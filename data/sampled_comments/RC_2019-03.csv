Right now I'm working on establishing myself in neutral.  Figuring out when it's the right time to walk forward, how to make my opponent hesitate, be aggressive, or ""fall asleep"" in neutral.  Necalli is super stubby, so I need to think really hard about what I can influence my opponent to do.  It makes playing the game stressful though, and it can be difficult to divvy up all of my mental resources efficiently when I'm focusing on this particular tactic.  Definitely a work in progress.

“If there is found among you, within any of your towns that the Lord your God is giving you, a man or woman who does what is evil in the sight of the Lord your God, in transgressing his covenant, and has gone and served other gods and worshiped them, or the sun or the moon or any of the host of heaven, which I have forbidden, and it is told you and you hear of it, then you shall inquire diligently, and if it is true and certain that such an abomination has been done in Israel, then you shall bring out to your gates that man or woman who has done this evil thing, and you shall stone that man or woman to death with stones



Leviticus 20:27 

“A man or a woman who is a medium or a necromancer shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones; their blood shall be upon them.

Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.

And a huge number of bosses are negatively affected by replacing ores with stone spirits.


Personally, the M&amp;S was fine for it's changes to how the skill was trained, but the value wasn't retained. The alch value per bar used in gear should be raised , even with elder rune you only get 10k value from high alch per bar used in the process. This is very low considering you need 2 ores and a normal rune bar, so the actual values of the ores individually are pretty low, and in turn the stone spirits need to be even lower to maintain a profitability for miners, so value on individual ores and stone spirits are very low.

Reaching out, she placed her hand on Edmyn’s shoulder as instructed. Rhea could feel the tension in his shoulders and tried her best to keep her touch light. When she went to clasps hands with the Plumm, she stopped short. 

“Is this the dance where we switch partners after the turn or is that the one after the King’s first dance?’

She was hoping to pass over the hand holding until they became more familiar with one another. It was one thing to do it with a group of others around them but alone was something entirely different.

There is a paradox that exists there, a fierce pride in their smallness and self-reliance, paired with a desire to engage more fully with the international community. One of the quickest ways to start a knock-down-drag-out fight over the dinner table is to toss out the question of whether or not they should join the EU. And the culture there has noticeably changed since I first visited in 2005, as more and more tourists pour in and more and more young folks study or move abroad. 

That's not the only thing that fueled the Fleet, and culturally, Exodans are definitely not Space Icelanders, but the conflict between preserving that which makes you unique and opening yourself to the possibilities of other influences is something that I, as an outsider, have been mulling over for a while.

My stoma has shrunk a bit in the past few days l, ive had it for a month now. I think i need smaller bag sizes because its going to irritate my skin. Hopefully i can get this sorted. 

A quick tip for the future. Make sure you dont change your bag after you eat as it is mostly active at that time. Also make sure you rub the adhesive A Lot so it sticks well. Plus getting all the free samples you can is great. Make sure your nurse listens to you and not the other way round. Gummy sweets like haribos and mashmellows are good to have. Drink a lot, a lot. 

Thats what ive done so far. Im the kind of person to worry a lot about the smallest of things. So even though im fine i still think something is off, its hard to get fully used to it. 

Im using the Salts ileostomy stoma bags with a barrier ring. It seems to work well, i just need a better size as it is a bit big now.

There is a huge difference between a person coming out as LGBT and another stating they are anti-LGBT, the latter invalidates and/or promotes hate towards a group of people. Also there shouldn't be a second side to this, if a person is LGBT, it is their right to follow that way of life without you and others judging their community. In the same way, it's not okay to for a person to hate the church or to hate Muslims. 

I have now checked and whilst the church he goes to is anti gay, Pratt has come out and stated he doesn't follow that particular aspect of his church. ",1551398401

"Fencesitter","t5_38fvu","Climate Change is absolutely catastrophic. 

1. Climate Change is different from other apocalyptic ideas in the sense that it is currently happening, already killing people in extreme weather conditions and is backed up by scientific consensus. Our current goal of 2 degrees Celsius (maybe 1.5 degrees but no way we're gonna make it) will have and already have massive impacts on insect populations declining, ocean acidification, coral bleaching, sea levels rising, icecaps melting, scarcity of drinking water. We are looking at displacements of millions of people due to famines, wildfires, flooding etc. This is 'best case' 2 degrees warming, without possible tipping points (which could be catastrophic, but are totally unpredictable so not really useful to get into it). Currently emissions are increasing worldwide. If everyone lived like people do in the US we would be at 4 degrees warming by 2100.
2. For everyone talking about the birthrate of developing nations and their influence on global warming: the richest  7% is responsible for 50% of emissions. The poorest 50% percent of the population are responsible for 7% of emissions. Increasing the world population by 2 billion poor people will only increase emissions by 3%. On average, someone living in the US emits the same amount per year as 32 people in Nigeria. What this also means is that a relatively small amount of people can screw it up for everybody else, so even one country dropping out of these international agreements can be really impactful. 
3. Yes, privileged people will probably be fine, but as opportunities/resources shrink the amount of people who actually are privileged will be a smaller percentage.   


I don't think humanity will go extinct. I think humanity will, more so than it is already, be under tremendous amounts of pressure and many people will suffer. Then again, many people have suffered for the last thousands of years. Humans are adaptable and can deal with a lot. Your child will most likely suffer at some point in their life, even without climate change. Is it okay for you to bring a child into this world knowing it will suffer? How much suffering is too much? If you teach it to accept its suffering, will that make it better? I think ultimately life is not fair, suffering is inevitable and wanting to having children is often not a logical decision. A logical (ethical) decision has to be derived from some type of ethics. If you think it's ethical to reduce suffering, and not existing causes less suffering than existing, then obviously having a child is not a reasonable choice. However, if you think the value of enjoying life is worth the potential suffering, then maybe it's okay to have a child. There are so many of these arguments you can make.   


I myself am a fencesitter, and I haven't decided if I will have a child or not. If yes, it will definitely only be at maximum one biological child. My main point of reference is how I feel about being alive, and currently I don't know. I have suffered quite deeply, yet I am also very privileged and my life has turned around a lot and become very enjoyable. It's all wonderful and awful at the same time.  I sometimes I try to imagine being my own child, and how I would feel being a young adult living 25 years from now. It seems like an impossible imagination. All I know is that if I choose to have a child, I have an enormous responsibility for their well being, and that means teaching them to be resilient, protecting my privilege and fighting for a world that is safe. I have to decide whether I am up for that kind of struggle. ",1551398402

&gt;*The Amazing Bulk II: Return of the Bulk* is the sequel to *The Amazing Bulk* (2012). To those of you who don't know: *The Amazing Bulk* is a story about a government research scientist named Henry ""Hank"" Howard who has been commissioned by General Darwin to make a serum that will increase the user's strength and longevity. He wishes to marry the daughter of General Darwin, Hannah Darwin. General Darwin says no and, in an effort to prove that his serum is successful, Howard injects himself with it, allowing him to turn into a colossal purple humanoid.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;That's basically the beginning of the story, at least. Now, here's how *The Amazing Bulk II: Return of the Bulk* should go (WARNING! THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE AMAZING BULK):  
&gt;  
&gt;It's been five years since the death of Henry ""Hank"" Howard. The world is full of chaos and no one is there to stop it. Hannah Darwin, the daughter of the late General Darwin, has been lonely now that her boyfriend is dead. On May 17, 2025, there is a newscast saying that the Bulk has returned. Next thing that happens is that the Bulk appears right at her door.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Also 75% of the money will be used to buy a bigger studio. The other 25% will be used to hire more 3d animators with at most a year of experience.

Totally makes sense. That's what my guy friend that has all female friends is sort like. 
Also, can you describe those ways they talk about women? Out of curiosity. Ive heard some stuff in groups of guys when I had all male friends but I'm sure it's even worse normally, since they didn't want to get too bad with a girl there.. Honestly, the fact that men demean women so much makes me prefer the company of women, to be honest. And it makes me kinda prefer a relationship with a girl as well (I'm bi, more interested in girls to begin with.. despite the fact I've only been with guys haha). 

&gt;Yeah, had a guy get angry at one of my friends for turning him down and he kept asking why, so she turned to me and said I was her boyfriend. He kept asking to see us making out to prove it, but everyone around us called him a pervert and got him to piss off.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","You are forgetting one important thing. Trust. Nuclear power is dangerous because the consequences of an accident are huge. The public has to trust the industry to do the right thing and doesn't cut corners to save time or mony.

In Fukushima the tsunami walls weren't high enough. After Fukushima we learned that there was already a tsunami that hight 150 years ago. We saw the hydrogen explosions and learned that there are measures to prevent these. Which are even mandatory in germany. And than we learnded about all the little things TEPCO did and whre the japanese authorities closed both eyes.

Now think about it. When these fuckups happen even in Japan what does that say about other countries? After Tschernobyl you could just blame the russians with low standards but Japan is a western country with high standards. In Germany we have learned that the industry tried to cover litte accidents. Or didn't adhered to the regulations. 

Then you see the problems with the new [EPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_(nuclear_reactor\) ). Failed schedules and raising costs. Costs so high that renewables are easily cheaper.

I also heard from some UCSF students who said UCSD‘s courses with the med students doesn’t provide much benefits.  Based on your experiences with UCSD grad, do you think UCSD prepares its students for residency? 

Yeah you’re right about the break. UCSF’s 3 year program has a 4 week break in-between P1 and P2 year. However, when I brought up this potential issue to the dean, he responded with saying internships should be done concurrently with course work. I’m not sure how heavy the coursework will be, so I’m a bit worried about that. 

As for residency, I’m sure I want to pursue residency, but uncertain of which specialty to pursue. Right now, I am interested in ambulatory care and oncology. I’m hoping my rotations will help me make a decision! 

I was not sure how much of an impact the name of the school has on residency. So I wanted to see how others thought about that.

I think it was shot down by the government.  But of course if you logged every transaction you would have a registry, but not really of gun sales but of interested buyers.

But still, why a registry to enforce universal background checks?  For enforcement?  Do meth dealers have a registry that we use to catch them? Or speeders? Seems all you need to enforce UBC is to run occasional sting operations on sellers, which is pretty basic law enforcement.",1551398405

Also I suspect we’ll begin to see more supple tart material for *Apex Legends* down the line in the way of comics, short stories, animated shorts etc. and corresponding updates to in-game items like cosmetics and voice lines that tie into it, and considering the game just came out I’m willing to wait and be patient to see if Respawn integrates Gibraltar’s sexual orientation more into his character over time.",1551398411

"transgenderUK","t5_2ue3h","I think your being a bit harsh, it's a well balanced response, from his reply, he has showed that the coverage of the story was without opinions. x said this which turned out not to be true and y said this. News is not suppose to have an agender only to present what people have said, to fact check and show both sides then it is up to the reader to take their own position. Which is TECHNICALLY what the article does, it would have been nice if he had at least acknowledged that they only showed the positive opinions in the last a few paragraphs and are way fewer in number which is bullshit, as if he doesn't know that most people do not read the whole thing. But the person who responded to you did a good job, and was respectful.  HOWEVER I do see your problem with the original article, if you read the whole thing it's just about ok. But I would not call it balanced since the majority of the article is in the negative and then changes to the positive in the last few paragraphs. In order for the article to be balanced they would need to give at least 5 more quotes on the positive side or show both sides as you read and not have polar opposites at the top and bottom. This is an issue with soooo many news articles where the title is completely discounted by the end of the article. So I don't think the issue is with the BBC, it's about the click bait nature of news. We should be attacking all news that publish articles like this. All of news loves to shit us up by claiming the world will end tomorrow and in the last paragraph they spoke to an expert who said the world will definitely be fine. There is so much bullshit in news and it sucks that this is the accepted format of articles. I think it's also worth pointing out that in general the BBC is one of the better news sources out there, There are so many that will just straight lie to your face and not even give you the opposing opinions, These news agencies are the true enemy of humanity that seek to divide us! While I support your post I would also like to point out that by us discussing the article and then sending everyone to read it we are just making the problem worse cause the metrics will tell the BBC this article performed well and improved SEO. I don't know what the solution is but I know it's a larger issue that has nothing to do with the BBCs opinion of trans people. I spoke to a lot of BBC employees at London pride and a huge proportion of their employees identify as being on the gender spectrum so be careful about going after them.

"Gundam","t5_2sjr4","Yeah that's right, I remember now hearing somewhere that the Gelgoog was performance wise on par with or better than Amuro's RX-78. Part of the reason Zeon lost A Baoa Qu and why the Gelgoog wasn't as mass produced as it could've been (other than the short time period between the first Gelgoog and the end of the war) was mainly 2 reasons:

A) that by the time they had any real number of Gelgoogs, Zeon had at the time killed off many of their ace and experienced pilots, leaving largely inexperienced ones in the 'googs while the surviving GM pilots attacking A Baoa were battle-hardened

B) IIRC, Zeon spent so much money/time/R&amp;D power on new and diverse MS that they were innovative, but few in numbers or cross-compatible parts. Compared to GMs, which despite varieties are essencially mostly parts-compatible, many of the OYW Zeke suits weren't parts-compatible etc. due to many variations of design difference (i.e. between a Gogg and a Gelgoog vs. an Aqua GM and a RGM-79GH).

This somewhat led to the GM being a mass produced jack-of-all-trades, master of none situation, where the specialized GM versions/variants were at times met and exceeded by their specifically designed Zeon counterparts (especially regarding aquatic variants). ",1551398415

If you download YUMI and a decent linux distribution ( distrowatch.com to see a list of all the popular distributions available, I recommend Ubuntu or linux mint if you have never used linux before) you can use YUMI to create a flash drive with the OS on it and you might have some luck with mounting your HDD while installed in the original machine.

If we implement it state by state, then how do you work out the differences in care if a patient needs to see a different physician in a different state. How does billing work or reciprocity? How does recovery work? How does triage work? We were literally discussing in this very thread how nonhomogenous country have a harder time dealing with policy and your solution is to find ways to divide the country even more?

"podemos","t5_31h78","oye, othar, me resulta difícil conversar contigo porque percibo que no aceptas argumentos más bien básicos ... volvamos al origen, el gran agujero de las jubilaciones anticipadas.

.
.

¿Cuál es la máxima anticipación, y la anticipación media?
Dos años respecto de la edad legal de la jubilación. Desconozco el dato de anticipación media, pero intuyo que puede estar en torno a 18 meses.

.
.

Así pues, ¿cual es el coste inmediato para la SS de una jubilación anticipada?
Sería la suma de las pensiones a pagar durante la anticipación, más la ausencia de cotizaciones en caso de que se estuviera trabajando, menos las cotizaciones del (supuesto) nuevo empleo de relevo.

.
.

¿Y se cobra la misma pensión si te jubilas anticipadamente? Claramente, no. Existe varias factores que reducen la pensión entre un 5% y un 10%.

.
.

¿Por tanto el coste inmediato de una jubilación anticipada termina siendo compensado pasados unos años?
Claro, hombre, alrededor de unos 10 a 12 años después el coste queda compensado, mientras que se sigue cobrando una pensión reducida de por vida

.
.

¿Y es que acaso tenemos ahora mismo un boom desproporcionado de jubilaciones anticipadas?
Pues no, la tasa de jubilaciones anticipadas es más o menos constante

.
.

¿Pero entonces, dónde esta el gran agujero?
Pues no hay tal agujero debido a las jubilaciones anticipadas. Los verdaderos agujeros son otros que no merece la pena volver a repetir",1551398415

You get bonus points when you have more than 5, with the bonus capping out when you reach 20 points, so getting 20 before you cash in is recommend. Other than that just avoid dying, and make sure to kill enemies before they can cash in their own points.

"KHUx","t5_39szw","Here, I'm gonna put down my assessment as well as a new player.  I've been playing for a solid 2 months and some change now. Started at the end of December. I'm a VERY picky VIP buyer.  Think I've only bought twice.  


While I under the need to make money, because SENA after all is a company, It important for the business to keep the game balanced  in such a way that they keep players happy. In case they didn't realize, unhappy players will Drag your name thru mud and, if possible, boycott your game. But if you adjusted a few things within your game that would make you game more player friendly and less money grubby, you can actually get MORE players to spend money.   


As the game is now and 

\-the lack of  available Jewels in proportion to the cost of Banners 

\-the abyssal RNG of the Banners (I'm not saying everyone should have 80% odds on pulls but less than 1%? Das Bull.

\-the weekly rewards for VIP not being work $15

that's just to name a few. This system doesn't stand up on its from what I can see. It stands up on whatever amount wealthy players can spend. Assuming they are wealthy and are not actually suffering from a GAMBLING ADDICTION. yeah I said.

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho. I'm not opposed to spending money on a game. In fact I do it every month for Final Fantasy XIV. That is a bigger game, yes. But it is a game where the Devs listen and try to coincide with what players are asking for while keeping with the structure of the game. Because of this, I don't mind not only paying for my Sub (12$ per month) but also retainers (2$ per Retainer, per month. I have 6) so my sub is now up to 24.99$ a month. I've been playing the game for 5yrs. yeah.  


  
So, this whole situation with the game just looks like one big...BAD DEAL.  The return is not worth the money and to be honest. The Jewel packs are all overpriced IMO. If they SENA needs a model to look at, they can even look at FARMVILLE. Yes, from early Facebook. Because they did it right, and I never had a problem spending money on a Colorful cow or a checkered Chicken when my crops didn't pull me in enough money.  


In game Currency is IMPORTANT and it is important to make it readily available to the player base and then they can have to option of paying extra for Jewels. If not for the fact that I still have 200 regular quests and all of proud mode still for income, I'd have stopped playing by now. So guess what happens once I finish? Because right now, I'm using the quests to make the money I need to do Banner pulls. That's not acceptable. The Veteran players exhausted that avenue ages ago.  


So that's all I got. Hopefully something can change or they just loose more players. When I'm done with quests, I'm done with the game and I WILL NOT promote this game to anyone, even if I know they will like it. Not gonna feed this particular money monster.

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","&gt; How many hours of your life have you studied math?

You continually reveal yourself as a cognitive hoarder. You ask me about the size of some volume of facts I may or not have accrued - what is the value in this question? What verdict could it possibly reveal vis-a-vis what we were talking about? I'm talking about the big picture, and the limits of systems. What could it possibly matter how many intrinsic details of said systems I've absorbed? I don't even care about math or even logic per se, I care about truth and accuracy and perspective. I care about things external to systems, if you actually applied what you said you understood about the limitations of logic you'd realise the inner workings of no system is meaningful in itself, and someone lacking knowledge (if you'd even call something at that level of specificity knowledge) of those does not invalidate their perspective on the bigger picture of things.

&gt;It's not about a piece of paper.

Yes it is, that's precisely what you have an ego-identification with and why you are getting defensive when it is targeted. You're flustered that it's not earning you deference because you've been trained to expect that it will and don't know what to do when it doesn't. Hence you don't engage anything I said which was actually *interesting* and fixate on this *boring* point of contention. You just irk at my sheer gall not to kowtow to your imaginary authority. 

&gt; It's about the fact that I have devoted my life to learning about a topic and you haven't.

You seem unable to account for the possibility that a life can be wasted or misspent. Most are.

And sheer volume of hours on the clock is *not* what devotion is. Not by a long shot.

&gt; I wrote a fucking thesis on it

Was it valuable? Or just a checkmark?


&gt; I teach this stuff every day.

Any idiot can teach to a curriculum. Can you inspire a single human being? Have you produced an original thought in your life? Do you think yours or *anyone's* ability to do so is a univariate function of t, is purely a matter of how many *hours* you put into it? Surely you can see that's absurd.

&gt; you don't unless you also have spent as much time as I have learning.

And this is precisely  how knowledge and authority do *not* work and is revealing only of your own psychological need to *believe* they do.

 The volume of time you've crammed into your studies is not important in reality, whereas for you it seems to be of *sole* importance. It's perfectly possible for me to have insights you don't, or that you never will on your own. Can you tell me a logical reason to the contrary, since you claim to be an authority on logic? To use the most basic illustration possible because apparently I have to, what if I'm capable of learning at a greater rate than you are? I'm a genius. Not to indulge you and your perverted suppositions of how knowledge and authority work, but I have known 'professional mathematicians' who considered my *innate ability* to be greater than theirs and saw this as imparting value to my perspectives (and that was their expressed view, not mine - and they never defaulted to their status as an argument in itself either). What I was talking about in my previous comment connected very deeply to the essence of creative genius - but you're not talking about that because it's incomprehensible to you, instead you're fixating on my authority or perceived lack thereof. You think I'm naturally inclined to talk about myself this much? This is where you've brought the conversation.

Whereas the very concept of genius, as something that moves in leaps and bounds, is anathema to this view you are aggressively *axiomatising*(!) that learning is *nothing* but this kind of dreary fungible marketplace wherein facts simply change hands and you just trade your time for tidbits so that your expertise is literally equivalent to time spent studying because time was your medium of payment. You actually think knowledge has a standardised price measured in a common time? Don't you know relativity? Don't you know time isn't the same for everyone? You claim superiority to me on account of the fact you have *hoarded* more, even I myself had no idea how insightful I was being when I initially characterised you as a cognitive hoarder. That's another characteristic of genius - it self-moves, it outdoes itself. The world of academe from which you borrow your own authority is anti-genius in design btw, it's designed for the slap-bang midpoint of the distribution between average and genius just like the wider world is designed around the average.

Would you say an angel with the power of flights has no *right* to be where it is unless it spends precisely as much time getting there as the man walking on foot does? Oh right bad metaphor for you since you're dogmatically atheist, materialist, and earthbound. 

This might be more suited: Is the only wealth that counts in assets?

"HalfBloodHaven","t5_m7rqz","Megan notices the color of the paint on the twin girl's vest, though she doesn't think anything of it.  She just assumes that they weren't given team colors since it doesn't really matter if you die by enemy or friendly fire.  Plus, there's always the chance that she was accidentally shot by her brother, which would explain why he's apparently left in a huff.  He might not want to admit that he's responsible for taking out his own sister.

""It's a shame that we didn't have more people come out.  It probably would have gone a lot faster if there were too many people to really hide from each other.""

They obviously don't need three people to carry one person's gear, so Megan stands to the side and waits.  The female twin doesn't seem too bad, and even Cassie is helping her.  Maybe the brother is the one that's a bad seed, and just influences his sister when he's around her.

"EatCheapAndHealthy","t5_2vvpi","This soup lets you vary the amount of each ingredient depending on your preference - you can also add clams and have a nice clam chowder! I made this because I needed to use up chicken stock and ham, and happened to have everything else on hand - it's super cheap!

 - 1 onion, chopped

 - 2 ribs celery, chopped

 - 2 med carrots, chopped

 - 3 cloves garlic, minced

 - 5-6 cups homemade chicken stock (boiled a Costco chicken carcass overnight in a crock pot with veggie scraps to make this, you can of course use bouillon or w/e you have on hand)

 - 1 cup diced lean ham

 - a bay leaf

 - black pepper

 - a few russet potatoes, diced (this varies entirely by preference and the size of your spuds. I peeled mine halfway, you can peel or not)

I sautéed the non-spud veggies until the onions were translucent, then boiled all of the above in the stock, adding the potatoes in 2 stages so the first round would fall apart a bit but the second round would hold together.

Then, I made a roux on the side using

 - 2T butter (you can use oil)

 - 2T flour

 until the flour was cooked but not darkened. I added 2-3 cups of milk to the roux and brought to a boil until fully thickened. I combined the milk/roux with the rest of the soup, and I had a pot of very cheap, very tasty dinner for the week. 

You can make the above into a ""baked potato"" soup by topping with sour cream, bacon, cheese, chives, etc. but without any of those additions (and even with moderate additions), it's a very healthy, relatively low-cal meal.",1551398418

At 200 health across the board, bigger characters are at a huge disadvantage.

I think a lot of cat owner simply let their cats get away with bad behavior without proper training and then that's how you get cats that misbehave.

In medicine, the circumstance of salt poisoning is most frequently encountered in children or infants who may be made to consume excessive amounts of table salt. At least one instance of murder of a hospitalized child by salt poisoning has been reported.

Too much salt intake in adults can also occur from the drinking of seawater in survival situations or the drinking of soy sauce.  Salt poisoning has also been seen in a number of adults with mental health problems.

Salt poisoning typically results in a feeling of confusion and jitteriness; more severe degrees of intoxication can cause seizures and coma. Death can result if medical intervention is not forthcoming. These symptoms are generally a consequence of hypernatremia—an abnormally high sodium level in the blood. (There are myriad causes of hypernatremia, which is frequently encountered in medical practice; salt poisoning is not a common cause.)

"drugscirclejerk","t5_2twtv","I don't agree with the idea that ""white folks"" have no place taking drugs because of the culture that they were first used in, I feel that these sorts of drugs were put here for humanity at large.  Not just people in certain cultures.

Also, psilocybin mushrooms weren't exclusively used by the Aztecs during ancient times.  It's just that more is known about the ceremonies and rituals that they used psilocybin mushrooms in, since their culture kept detailed written records.

However, they also were used in Europe during paleolithic/neolithic times, as there are cave paintings that depict it.  This is simply less well known, as these cultures kept minimal records of their ceremonies and practices.  Now, I don't mean to go off on a tangent, but given the title of the sub I might as well.

Anyways, I think mushrooms were actually responsible for human evolution.  I think that use of mushrooms by Neanderthals is what caused these pre-human species to evolve into the higher consciousness that humans currently possess.  Obviously, this theory has not been solidly proven, though there is [a lot of evidence for it](https://truththeory.com/2015/07/15/stoned-ape-theory-a-unique-theory-of-human-evolution/).

Especially when the most appropriate route is through legislation and yet when that route is not possible due to electoral opposition the court is then used to change the interpretation.  Some ""wedge"" issues are created to on purpose to push the that agenda. This is why the right wing is trying to stack SCOTUS.

I have two wands, creampie dildo, average sized dildo, BBC, furry tail plug, jewel plug, and more. Feel free to ask, as I update my stash frequently.

I am not extremely comfortable talking on camera other than names (Ask me about pricing for names!), moaning, light dirty talk (like ""fuck me harder!"" ) etc. Message me with your request!

You don't get a PhD because you ""love school and learning"", it's a ~5-year training position for a career in research.

&gt; ... but at the same time I have a little bit of self-doubt mainly because I will be dedicating 6-8 years on this and $20K plus with no real plan or goal (which I'm kind of OK with).

You shouldn't enter a PhD program with ""no real plan or goal"" in mind.

An unfunded PhD is a terrible idea. If you're paying to get a PhD, you're doing it wrong.

Why does every professional I know in half a dozen industries (tech, education, manufacturing, sales, and even medicine &amp; pharma of all industries, which are booming hugely) weave a tale of woe about the last cost of living increase being many years in their rear view mirror, and it being less than a single year's real adjusted inflation, let alone all the years between that raise and the present day?

If things are so damned rosy, how come every single middle-class person I know is worse off than they were at the turn of the century, in very measurable ways (smaller houses, older cars in poorer repair, kids going to crappier schools and having skimpier Christmases, no vacations in sight, Kraft Dinner on the table instead of real food more often than not, etc.)?",1551398424

You're saying it's Rockstar's fault for listening to the community and implementing actions based on feedback. I honesty can't blame them.

Don't go out dating somebody because you want to find a partner for life right now. If you feel ready to date, just meet somebody, and if you click, great!

From there, if you're both feeling comfortable and you want to progress you can take it that step further.

Studying helps. Practicing champs that you play against in the practice tool or in games so you understand their weaknesses and what strengths to avoid helps. Reading the details of each champ ability and thinking about what is strong about their kit helps. Watching closely to animations and listening to sound effects that trigger your stopwatch finger or dash/flash response helps. Studying the game helps regardless of what champ you pick. 

Maybe the counterpoint is, if you decide not to work that hard at that part, mages can carry most. Some people might be like, I just want to play. ",1551398425

Your post has been automatically removed because it appears to be asking if some aspect of someone else's or your own sexuality or body is normal or not. We get a lot of questions here that are about really basic stuff that *ought* to be taught in but that unfortunately isn't. Variance is the norm in human sexuality. It's more meaningful to ask questions like: is this safe? Is this consensual? Is this mutually pleasurable? There are a lot of great resources for this, including [scarleteen](http://www.scarleteen.com/) and [go ask alice] (http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/).

Disingenuous.  Ignores that the what the devs think is good and the players do can be different and both have to communicate about their concerns to reach a conclusion.

None of this Gish Gallup makes sense at all.  This just seems like cherry picking to assert my position while ignoring everything stated.

&gt;Again this attempt to hide behind the community. 

This is dishonest.  All this is would be a veiled scapegoating and fingerpointing to hide the fact that DE failed in fixing a broken system which allows for mods to abuse the trust of the community in a very poor manner and the community itself is tired of this.

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","The lucky nations are social democracies, which is capitalism restrained by high taxes and a strong welfare system. This is not a natural state for capitalism and is inherently unstable. Either a nation continues pushing left, ultimately resulting in the end of capitalism altogether, or else capital will eventually reassert its power and deconstruct the welfare system. This happened in the US during the 80's, and it's currently happening in many European nations under the label of ""austerity.""

The less lucky nations have ""crony"" capitalism, which is actually just capitalism in its natural final state. In this system, the power of capital is completely dominant and the state has been entirely captured as a tool for the capitalist class. Policies and regulations are designed to preserve the wealth of the capitalists and suppress potential competitors, while also destroying the power of labor suppressing the working class. Safeguards are also put in place to ensure that the system can never be changed through reform. The legal system is turned into another weapon against the working class, while protecting the rich from any punishment for their crimes.

&gt;So if you wont answer how to pay for your grandiose ideas. Can you tell us all how much your ideas cost? If its not 93 trillion is it 1.15 gigawatts? 

What you're missing is how most of these programs are cheaper.

Having many more times the empty homes than we do homeless is not efficiency; it's a drain on the economy. So is paying twice as much as we should to cover only part of the population's healthcare. In both cases keeping millions of people out of the workforce.

Regarding the ecological portion, I'm curious if you really think the green new deal is more expensive than destroying the environment.",1551398431

Also, the misspelling of my last name would've had to have been the clerk, since that isn't something the recipient fills out (at least in my experience signing for packages). It's usually typed into the handheld by the clerk, IIRC.

Some of the items are electronics that would have a serial number. I'm currently on hold with my bank. If that doesn't work, I'll try the postmaster general. Thank you for the thoughtful response.

Diet - your body requires certain nutrients to not just live, but function in an effective and efficient manner. If you don't get enough protein your muscles won't build the way they need to, if you are on a non-keto diet a lack of carbs will deprive your brain of the sugars (read as healthy carbs broken down into sugars) to process information and function. This is the same for keto diet in terms of fats. 

Sleep - your brain uses this time to repair itself, process data it couldn't while awake, and cleanse toxins that build up in the brain over the day. 

Working out - increases muscle to mind communications and can increase reaction and decision making times if done right. ",1551398433

You get the ride the wave the whales make, not the other way around. Why do you think gtao is what it is? Because the whales buy it up, we the long term consumers don’t show rockstar what we want with actions, because we don’t spend the money. Our words aren’t as strong as the whales money when it comes to decision making. 

I never said the online gamers were a small majority. What I’m saying is that the majority of players did not buy it for online. If they had, they wouldn’t have bought it before online was out, before they even had an idea what it would include. Rockstar is known for their single player experience, everything is catered around that actually. That’s why you got games with hours and hours of game play time, even rushing it, and bare bones online. No one could say rockstar has ever had its shit together when it comes to online. It’s gone on 6 years because the whales. The market changed then with games. They seen they could make money just releasing a few tweaks to a game that’s already made it’s fair share. I would love for some sp dlc, but business wise, why make dlcs for sp that may not draw in whales, and also be a dlc for their weakest story, when they can add the same dlcs to online, and make money hand over fist trickling it out over 6 years. 

So again, when their revenue comes from 1% of all the players, they follow the money. 1 percent of players isn’t a whole lot, but those 1 percent are spending more than if half the base bought sp dlcs. One model they can continue to make money for years, another they make money one time. 

You got the online portion of the game. To me and anyone with half a brain who knows how to get their monies worth and won’t buy something if they won’t, it was free. Right now it’s cost me about 50 cents per hour on just one play through, well worth it. Yet you have online(remember again, nothing was stated what or when it would have content) so you literally have what you paid for. Right now. 

They’re doing you a favor calling it a beta, because their telling YOU that you have more coming. That it isn’t finished.

"Spiderman","t5_2rw42","The train scene in Spider-Man 2 for me, not only my favorite movie Spider-Man scene but one of my favorite Spider-Man scenes in-general (with ASM #33's iconic lifting scene being the first). Otherwise...

The ending of Spider-Man 1, the entire final fight to Osborn's death to Peter having to deny MJ's advances, it's all a great last couple of minutes for me.

In Spider-Man 3, Sandman's creation. Very emotional scene, great visuals.

TASM1, probably Peter getting the eggs for Aunt May, it's a nice scene and shows Peter's developed as a character. Otherwise, Peter saving the kid because it's also another moment where he develops, selflessly doing something for the first time and really grows into the role. Marc Webb did a nice commentary on the scene, pointing out Peter's daddy issues and the kid's dad and how they parallel.

TASM2, really any scene where Spidey's out there just helping NYC. Would've loved the opening with him stopping Rhino if he didn't let dozens of people die to tell some quips. Seriously wonder how they spent that much time animating all of that and never questioned that Spidey's not even bothering to help out.

Homecoming, not sure to be honest, Peter lifting the debris is a good scene but it just doesn't do anything for me. Can't really think of a moment that stood out.",1551398434

"MTB","t5_2qo3d","&gt;Case in point: 1500 drivers **trained to handle an actual blowout** at highway speeds. Not one lost control—not only that, they were not permitted to wear helmets, and they did not install roll cages in the cars. That's how confident the instructors were.

They were trained specifically for this. How many people on the road do you think have training for this? How many people are driving down the road *expecting* their tire to blow out? The question is not whether its avoidable, but whether its deadly.

All you have to do is Google it to see that I'm right:

&gt;Sadly, tire blowouts can result in vehicle accidents that injure and kill many people. In the latest statistics reported from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, tire blowouts are estimated to cause more than **400 deaths** and more than **78,000 crashes** each year.

https://www.standavislaw.com/how-many-people-die-each-year-because-of-tire-blowouts/

"MagicArena","t5_3nbzd","&gt; This is not true in paper magic. My understanding is that there is a sort of print run in that cards are printed in sheets and then randomized. 

The commons are currently printed on two sheets and then a ""run"" (several cards in a row) from each sheet is inserted into the pack. Sets have always had some variation on this, commons have never been truly randomized. if you go far enough back you literally just get packs with 11 commons in a row and then the next pack starts with the next 11 commons. Uncommons are in a similar ""run"". Rares are semi-randomized but you'll still often find part of a ""run"" in consecutive packs. Sets int he late 90s  and early 00s straggled with ""rare mapping"" because they were insufficiently randomized and you could determine which rare would be where just by opening a few packs from the box. 

The utility of knowing this information in draft, however, is fairly dubious. Its way too hard to calculate, even for the pros, in a timed draft, and just reading signals provides the same result. The odds you could determine the card your opponent drafted, then counter draft against it, then actually get paired against them to use that counter is pretty much impossible.",1551398435

All of which seem a vastly more accurate predictor of necessary caloric intake than my gender.

So to whoever is attempting to DoS attack Lenny...

...it doesn't seem to be working...

One of our volunteers decided to deal with the DoS attack in their own way and send a call to Lenny that would break [Jerri, J-E-R-R-I's record](https://www.reddit.com/r/itslenny/comments/4gjk1m/lenny_marissa_and_rachel_are_the_same_person/) by over ***17 minutes***.  Lynn finally decided to end the call around the 49:19 mark but took all the way to 52:36 to actually release the call.  Will Lynn's record ever be broken?  I say no way.  But...I've said that before...

I like how the more frustrated Lynn gets, the faster she talks.  Which is totally helpful when dealing with someone who's hard of hearing.  Also amusing: she called Lenny by several different names.  (I censored them all as I'm not sure which one was our volunteer's name.)",1551398435

Now, if you were coming in with other people and he was serving a whole group, that would be different. But since you’re coming in solo AND doing your own bussing? Yeah, no need to tip.

But you could always be flirty and tease him with something like “Later...” on the tip line. As a guy, I know something little like that from my SO would make my day.",1551398435

Just because their stupid religion (and I am not singling them out in the regard that their religion is stupid, most every other religious belief is stupid) mandates the creation of a state does not mean that Israel gets to have special treatment.

I can deescalate any situation and peace keep and mediate between people who clash. 
I'm not a 10 because in my quest to be relatable and bond I will sometimes gossip and shit on other people behind their backs.  This is a sacrifice I consciously make to really strengthen a bond with someone. There's simply no substitute for hating on the same people,  and so I will throw people under the bus on occasion in order to warm their enemy up to me. 
I don't know if anyone could be a ten, because say you're a man of ethics and principles who refuses to shit on people who aren't in the room,  cool now you're lame and no fun and essentially alienating the people who are in the room. So you're gonna lose points either way.

Like, you will waste so much time trying to do that which could better be spent on other activities. My response is usually ""well, it seems like we don't see eye to eye on this"" and then move on.

Think of politics as like a spectrum that goes like this:

Active Supporters &lt;--&gt; Inactive Sympathizers &lt;--&gt; Moderates &lt;--&gt; Inactive Opponents &lt;--&gt; Active Enemies

Your goal should be to move everyone over to the left one slot. Turn the inactive sympathizers into active supporters. Move the disengaged moderates into sympathizers. Turn your inactive opponents into moderates and turn your hostile enemies organized to destroy you into inactive opponents. How does getting bogged down into a loaded debate about 20th century body counts help you to advance this goal? The short answer is that it doesn't.

A good example of this, I think, has been anti-fascist strategy in the United States. Notice that a lot of conservatives went ""both sides are equally bad"" after Charlottesville. That was actually good and a sign of a winning strategy because they had been inactive sympathizers for some pretty nasty characters on the far right before that. They had moved over one slot.

They offer them in like 7 or 8 calibers, so you have the option to go with 308, 6.5CM, 243, etc. I think any of those rounds would suffice, they're all low recoil with good ballistics. I personally would go with 308 or 6.5CM but everyone likes what they like. 308 isn't expensive and there are lots of offerings. 6.5CM has superb ballistics and is more than enough to take white tail, and I can shoot a couple hundred rounds through mine in a sitting without getting beat up by recoil, but the ammo costs more than 308. Compasses are regularly on sale in the $200-300 range and usually have some sort of veteran discount. Pair it with any decent scope and she'll be good to go.

To be honest, thought, you can't go wrong with most $300-400 offerings right now, everyone is making excellent guns in that range, between the Savage Axis line and a bunch of others I can't remember off the top of my head. I really really like my Compass though. It was $20 for the trigger kit to make my trigger any pull I could want, it's MOA guaranteed, and it came with the barrel threaded.

I felt out of place in the trans community, even though I really just wanted to be a man. So I went on T and scheduled top surgery.

When I got top surgery, I suddenly realized all those things I was felling WAS dysphoria, I was simply really good at telling myself I didn't have it, that others were worse, that maybe I wasn't really trans because I didn't really mind all that much that I had breasts. 

There's no one way to experience dysphoria and some people are a lot better at putting the feelings into words (or even recognizing the feelings). Dysphoria doesn't define trans-ness, it's a symptom. Just as with anything else, not everyone experiences the same symptoms in the same way, or even at all. Your low level (or non-level, however you see it) of dysphoria doesn't make you not-trans or less-trans.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","Nor did I say I was being forced.  I'm expressing my disappointment in this content (which I've paid for) based on:

- It's primarily gambit focused, and I don't enjoy gambit.
- I dislike the armor design.  The belts, buckles, satchels, as well as the bright neon glow.
- Having the perks on the armor means we'll all look alike.
- More time-gating. 
- From what we've seen, it's gambit, a horde mode, and if TLW quest is any indicator, a Thorn quest which is just a long checklist of old activities (go play crucible, go do public events, etc)
- If everyone's going to be chasing the new armor and perks, why did they bother increasing the power level - just to boost everyone up anyway?

The sad thing is, it's all fixable.   Armor styles similar to early D1 (as people have been asking for forever).  Titans that are more ""Spartan"" and less ""Hobo"".  Armor that accepts shaders correctly and completely.  How about a transmog or vanity system?  Any of these things would solve the armor issues.  As for the gameplay - why more gambit?  Why not more dungeons like Shattered Throne?  Why another horde mode?  I'd rather they brought SRL back before they gave me another horde mode.  Even if all they can come up with is horde mode - how about making it rewarding in its own right, instead of tying it back to gambit again?  For better or worse, Destiny is a looter.  If we don't give a crap about the loot, what's the motivation?  Why not give Reckoning it's own armor set?  Why don't the vendors or vanguard rotate stock anymore?

Speaking of giving a crap, they keep telling us about all this rich lore the drifter has.  So what?  The drifter to me is this annoying dude that insulted me at the end of TLW quest.  I don't have any emotional investment in him as a character - why do I care about his lore?  As far as I'm concerned the Drifter could have been wholly replaced with a gambit bounty board.  Why isn't this season about Uldrin?  That was a pretty big reveal not too long ago... and then nothing?

There are a few things that grab my interest.  The Pinnacle PvE weapon is a scout rifle.  That's good.  The bad of course is that scouts are still pretty much the weakest option out there due to the nerfs.  The Allegiance quest - whatever that is.  The Invitations from the Nine / Xur Bounties maybe.  There are lots of details we don't have yet, so there's hope there.

Yesterday's pick: Acapulco ATP. Nadal -3.5 games @1.83. Lost. What a shame honestly. Nadal had 40-0 on two of Kyrgios games and couldn't capitalise. I was just as salty as Nadal was yesterday. 

Today's pick: Acapulco ATP, noon local time. Alex De Minaur +3.5 games @$2. 1unit bet. 

Reason: I'll say up front I don't have much doubt Zverev will win this one, and eventually his offense will be too much for De Minaur's defense. But I am gambling on Zverev taking longer to find his game, in which De Minaur can close the game gap, and secondly of the two players I Zverev is more likely to have blips in his game, in which De Minaur can close the game gap.

I think De Minaur will come out swinging and playing his heart out and keep it close enough until Zverev finds his A game. ",1551398442

"guns","t5_2qhc8","As already said this is an Italian Vetterli 1870/87/15. To add some info: Originally Italy adopted the Vetterli in single shot guise in lieu of the tube magazine the Swiss went with, but they did go with a modern centerfire round in place of the rimfire of the Swiss. They then realized that was a stupid idea and began the process to retrofit them with the Vitali magazine system and retained the 10.35mm black powder cartridge. These are easy to distinguish as the Vitali magazine has some attractive curves to it unlike the slab sides of the Carcano's. These Vetterlis would see action in Ethiopia, but spoiler alert it did not go well for the Italians (guns weren't the major issue).

WWI came about and like every nation Italy needed to free up arms for front line use, except Italy was broke af like usual. As they had over 1 million Vetterlis in some form or another in inventory still, they made modifications to use the same Mannlicher style en bloc system from the Modello 1891 (Carcano) and use the 6.5x52mm. You can tell if yours was previously a 1870/87 by if there is a round wood plug in the bottom of the stock covered by the magazine (provided the stock is original). To take the smaller 6.5x52mm ammunition the barrel was bored out and a steel rod inserted which was soldered in place and was then bored and rifled. This is usually referred to as the Salerno method, it was also used in the Carcanos to rebore shot out barrels. In this case it seemed to have worked fine, but not the Vetterli (old design for black powder, not a good idea to make it smokeless). Even the Italians knew this was not a good idea but it was done so that rear echelon (note: rear-rear echelon and the colonial troops that likely would never fire the things) would have something. Suffice to say don't go shooting it unless you have properly downloaded ammo as it's a good way to either damage the action or split the barrel. They were dug out again briefly to arm colonial troops in WWII when Mussolini though invading Africa and getting in bed with the Nazis was a solid plan (it wasn't).",1551398442

&gt;Thanks for the suggestion! It’s actually one we’ve debated on the team. One concern we have is anytime we – the OW team – make assumptions about what you want to do without giving you some agency in the situation. Our concern is, we believe there are a number of players who want to or like to play different roles but because they are thinking of “the good of the team”, they flex to needed roles. A player like this, under your design suggestion, is going to end up always having to play tank or support. We really want to avoid design solutions that further reinforce players being forced to play roles they don’t intend to.

&gt;I hope this explanation makes sense. To use myself as an example, by your suggestion, I am a “tank main” because most of my play time is on tanks. But I really love playing healers and damage heroes as well. I would be worried if the game just assumed I should be playing tank all the time, because I did it so much previously (mostly to be a good teammate, not because that’s what I wanted to do).

&gt;Hope that makes sense.

&gt;regarding symmetra main question… our live ops producer has 700 hours on her.

- [**Kaplan | Game Director**](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/role-queue-compromise/311123/6)

**Regarding the role queue, have you and your team considered separate role SRs (similar to say, Splatoon 2’s separate ranks for modes) or do you intend to keep us to 1 SR per account?**

&gt;if we did role queue, we would do separate SR’s. this is one of the things i think would be really fun (plus make the game way more balanced and improve matchmaking)

Found I had to keep creating lots individual stores with small states to get round this. Where with NGRX you have one large state with selectors where you can define granular subjects. Was probably not the best approach but had just came from Angular + Ngrx project and wanted to do something similar in an AngularJs project with RxJS. Still allowed me to use the container/presentation approach which keeps your components reactive and solves a lot of problems when you need to make lots of small components work together.

"lesbianfashionadvice","t5_2t3nu","I personally think one of the best ways, especially if you aren’t wanting to go super butch, is to make yourself what I call het-hostile (doing to straight men what chunky geometric makeup does to AI face recognition).  Play with the gendering of products - take a men’s marketed item and wear it femininely or paired with traditionally feminine items (men’s blazer with a crop top under, sequin skirt and work boots, etc)
Also, layer up: layer your accessories (several rings, layered necklaces, etc), layer your core pieces (tee with a cardigan with a jacket with a flannel around your waist), layer your patterns (plaid with floral is my fave combo), layer your fabrics (flannel and satin and leather, anyone?), layer your colours (grey-blue, deep brown, tan, and coral orange.  Deep purple, light green, tan, and saddle brown.  Burgundy, olive, and pink.  Go nuts.)
Finally, a thing that always pings my gaydar is a full face of makeup and totally bare lips.

Or you can go full butch/stud/moc and just start wearing men’s clothes.  That’s also an option and will very much illustrate your point.

Lesbian fashion is frequently about playing with polarities and perceptions, and about being feckless in your regard for general fashion sense.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; This is all worked out from systematic metaphysics and philosophical anthropology regarding formal causes, teleology, action for an end etc.

I would love to see you defend this baseless claim without invoking your religion.

&gt; Homosexuality is wrong, and a sin, because homosexual sex acts are contrary to the natural, teleological end of the sex act itself; procreation. 

Therefore, all sterile couples should immediately break up, right? As soon as a woman hits menopause, she loses her right to have sex, correct?

&gt; The same for homosexual marriage, marriage is a sacramental union between man and god for the end of procreation.

I married my husband two years ago. Tell me how it hurts you.

&gt; This all derives from Christian philosophy, not bigotry or hatred or some baseless hating of gays.

As an ex-christian, I can attest that Christian hating gays is a real thing, and Christian lying about hating gays is a real thing, too.",1551398447

I'd argue that if we count the Stug, Wirbelwind and Panzer IV as unique vehicles, then for example, we should count the Flanker, Howitzer, and Close Support FT-17 as separate tanks too, because in both games it's the same hull with a different turret (or casemate), and all the other BF1 tanks should count as three tanks instead of one for your list.",1551398448

I.E. The Dwarf having the ability to become either a Slayer, an Ironbreaker, or a Ranger Veteran is awesome. But this could be taken so much further.

I'm just hoping Chaosbane *gives us a way to deeply customize our character and turn them into different forms.* Like in Diablo 2, I could make viable unusual characters. Like how I made my Paladin use a longbow, with holy auras that made my shots hit hard, but also damage and disable enemies that got close to me. So you could turn a tanky melee class, into something different if you got geared properly and creative with skills.

A practical example I'm hoping for, is being able to turn the High Elf Mage into a Loremaster of Hoeth - aka a Blademaster mage. ",1551398448

Right! Haha, of course! There is always a risk.

&gt; But responsibly breeding dogs is much more expensive than irresponsibly breeding dogs. If you were to start breeding Yorkie x Maltese mixes, why would someone pay $1200 for your dog when they can find one on Craigslist for $300?

Yeah, that’s really true. There are so many badly bred mixes that are super cheap and over-saturating the market. But there are also really, really expensive mixes that cost more than a reputably bred dog and people are still buying them for an insane amount of cost because they somehow think their reputable. It is tough. I guess a lot of purebred reputable breeders breed show dogs, and you can’t do something like that with a mix so there’s less insensitive to it? Plus purebreds have been around for a lot longer, but still. The fact that there isn’t more reputable breeders for mixed breeds is ridiculous. ",1551398450

Basically, a huge wave like this one at Nazare in Portugal always breaks in the same spot, and because there's such a huge volume of water involved, there's more time between ""sets"" of a wave. Which means the jetskis can chill just outside of the ""break"" zone, and then zoom in if necessary. In that video, you can see several ""watermen"" on Jetskis hanging out outside of the wave-zone, ready to toe-in riders or pull them to safety (usually a bit of both).

It does NOT always work out. Sometimes a surfer could be stuck getting pummeled by waves for minutes prior to a jetski reaching them, or the jetski itself can get caught in a wave (like in that video).

We've pretty much stopped talking, and I don't have anyone else I really trust to the same level. My brother is close, but it's not really the same. I have a decent thing going on with a new girl, we're both into each other, but the only date we've been on was very stressful to me because we went to a club which I've pretty much never done before. We're still talking a bit, but she's not very consistent with texting and it just throws me all over the place.

I also have only been back in the dating game for about a month ago. Before that I had been working on self-improvement for about a year and a half (I'm down 60 pounds!) and to be honest I consider dating my main focus right now. I don't think my life is going to get that much more interesting until I can find someone. Some new friends would help too, but I'm kind of a loner so I'd rather find one person I really connect with. I know that's not an easy thing to do, and that it relies a lot on hard work plus luck, but I'm ready for it at this point in my life. 

The early stages of a relationship are always the worst for me, but I know I do great when I make it through that. I've done it before, and most of the dates I've been on recently have gone well. The last one was bad, but I don't fault her for that and I think I did the best I could with what I had.

"Winnipeg","t5_2qtno","They hire by the pound.

Much like any other 80+ development shop in Winnipeg, There are some teams made up of driven developers who appreciate better practices and the importance of continuous learning in their career.  Then there are teams made up of 9-5ers and people who are inexperienced or don't realize they have gaps in their knowledge and don't have the drive to get any better.  The latter tends to hold sway because it's very tough to hold onto good talent, especially with a generalized cult-like HR framework.

If you're on a team that's the former, I'm sure it's survivable.  If you're on a team that's the latter, you're on a slow career (*read: salary*) path.

&amp;#x200B;

In either case, you're dealing with a very top-down post-acquisition startup with all the monotonous HR and pseudo-culture hype that tends to accompany them:  Open offices, politics of ""team fit"", crabs in buckets, tall poppies, going along to get along...

"EnoughMuskSpam","t5_3blr7","Prior to the mid 19th century the music world was very much based on the patron model, with the wealthy commissioning works from composers and other artists.  Some composers and musicians certainly achieved fame for their works, sometimes gaining positions in the courts of nobles and kings.  Though court life was obviously luxurious, rarely did they become particularly wealthy as result of their work and were at the fickle whims of their patrons.   Aside from patronage, the main source of income for famous musicians was publishing sheet music, though again this wasn't wildly lucrative.  By the late 19th century widespread piano ownership in the middle classes led to a boom in so-called parlor music and demand for printed sheet music and the emergence of popular music as a genre.  Musicians definitely made steady money during this period, and many, particularly Jewish immigrants and African-Americans, were able to rise out of poverty, but few, if any, became rich in comparison to recording artists a century later.  The rich and famous musician archetype is very much a product of the recording industry.


On the other hand, I have no idea what the author of this article is saying when he claims that entrepreneurs are supplanting musicians in terms of influence.  Famous artists are just as wealthy and influential as they were forty years ago, maybe more so given the rise of social media.  ",1551398454

 **(2)** Every one who wilfully attempts in any manner other than a manner described in subsection (1) to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Mom and I clean houses together, so we're both used to getting relatively dirty. We're both hard workers, and the house was a small, two level house, and we were cleaning their house before they moved in, so nothing inside. Easy, right?

Nope.

We step out of the car, and both of us are hitting with an overwhelming stench, before we even get inside. Mom gives me a look and says she'll go in first to see what needs to be done. So I start taking the supplies out of the car, then she comes back out and tells me to come in and see how bad it is.

I go inside, and the first thing that hits me is the smell of rotting food, combines with that smell of old house they always have. Alright, kinda bad, but I'll manage. She shows me a back room and just points inside, and I kid you not, you couldn't see the floor under all the rat droppings everywhere. It was like someone took a big sack of rice and dumped everywhere.

Remember when I said we were hard workers? Yeah, we still did it. I don't know why we still did it, but we did. The droppings were everywhere. In the kitchen cabinets, in the refrigerator, in the ice box in the freezer (I don't even understand that myself).

I had to throw away food the previous tenants had left in the fridge, pick up dead flower stems all around over, and pick up trash they had left all around, all while mom vacuumed up the droppings everywhere.

The worst part, though, has yet to come.

We open the oven door, and I almost vomited on the spot from the smell. It was indescribable, but I can try.

Think old food, a gross, musky bug kind of smell, and dust, all rushing into your nostrils at once.

I look back inside, and there's a straight up box of pizza in there. Who puts a whole box of pizza in the oven? Who leaves food in the oven when they move out!?

There were some pots and pans in there too, and big, fat, baseball sized balls of...something in there. Had to throw that out, and it was not pleasant.

Got like $200 bucks for it, and it took us 6 hours to clean, so...worth it?

1. You're only going to have access to about 110GB, the other 10GB is restricted (SSDs need about 10% free to avoid failures).
2. Games and programs on other drives still cache files on your C:/ drive. This has particularly been an issue for me, sometimes dropping my remaining space to under 1GB while running UE4.

I'm using a 120GB SSD as my C: right now, and 120GB is a \*lot\* less than it sounds like. I've had enough space issues that I ended up buying a 1TB SSD recently so I could actually store files. I still only have about 10GB remaining on my SSD (and that's without any games).",1551398455
"business","t5_2qgzg","There's a snowball's chance in hell any major insurance company is going to pick Amazon as a PBM, especially after all the big players just spent a shitton of cash buying their own PBMs in the form of Express Scripts and CVS/Caremark.  THe little guys might -- the various small cooperatives that form as part of the ACA marketplace providers, but even those guys tend to lean towards the big PBMs.

Almost every insurance plan out there demands that maintenance meds go through their own, in-house PBM (i.e., Aetna is going to demand you use Caremark's mail-order for your 90-day supply).  This takes a _huge_ bite out of any consistent revenue. 

That just leaves the odd insurer and a bunch of retail pharmacy meds, a _huge_ swath of which are prescriptions called in after you see your doctor and picked up at Walgreens / Target / etc. on the way home.  

While that segment may be lucrative and you're right -- Amazon can probably nail down the logistics for keeping all the random formularies in stock and available throughout whatever areas they happen to serve, _every other retail pharmacy out there has already solved this problem_ and you don't have to worry about shipping.

All that leaves is Amazon sitting a space where they're handling the ""one off"" prescriptions, competing with ""Hi, my doctor called a prescription in for pregnasterol,"" and acting as a 3rd party biller for random insurance providers.  ",1551398455

&amp;#x200B;

I really enjoyed it because it was very funny, was a visual treat for the eyes, and most importantly, it satisfied a primal desire for perfect organization.

Perfectly peeling off a sticker. Watching machines perfectly manufacture objects. Having just enough water to fill a glass. Seeing a star-shaped block perfectly slide into a star-shaped hole. It is a very basic thing, but it feels great, it feels satisfying. It's the same reason why Tetris was so successful. Yes, Tetris requires a lot of mental skill, but for what reward? The reward of seeing things fit into place and seeing all the messy clutter just organize and clear out. That reward is very powerful to us on a biological level, and it's a reward seen in many mobile games. Many mobile games resemble Tetris or matching-color games for the same reason: You see clutter clear out via organization, and it just feels good.

&amp;#x200B;

As for farming games? Even if it's not challenging at all, sometimes it just feels good to be managing something, taking care of something, watching it grow, such as your farm or your big number in a cookie-clicker like. Life is hard enough as it is, and as fun as challenges can be in video games, sometimes people just want to know they're making progress or making something bigger and better, even if its in a small video game.

Btw the SAT is test notoriously easy to study for and not a good indicator of intelligence.  You can improve your score by more than 200 points just by practicing a few tests and timing yourself.  GRE is a better indicator and LSAT probably is too.  The discussion isn't focused on undergrad admissions just because you want it to be, it's focused on affirmative action.  Both undergrad, graduate and professional.  Right now you improved your score to a D.  

Normally when you sum on a non smooth graph you use rectangles or trapezoids.  You usually learn it in calc 101.  It's very easy to sum on a discrete set because it's just taking the expected value, it's even easier here because they give you the population size as a percentage on the y axis.  

Good luck on your career as a coal miner.  I wish you the best.

It's not as easy to break into a dwelling as your question implies. In our case, we live in the country down a 900 foot driveway, and the dog would wake us up before anyone got anywhere close to the house. There are six doors, each secured with a deadbolt, and all glass here is triple-pane. It's *hard* to break a triple-paned window much less crawl through the hole.

So I keep a set of ears next to each self-defense gun in the house. Even when I lived in the city, in a non-secure apartment, a burglar was unable to kick his way into my unit at 2 a.m.; I wasn't armed then, but if I had been, I'd have had time to put my ears on.

So: a set of ears next to each gun. It takes very little time to put 'em on. Not only that, but I might get lucky. The invader would see me naked, wearing nothing but a set of camo-pattern earphones, pointing a firearm in his direction and telling him that he'd better get down on the floor right away because I can't hear too well. In my case, it would be either a Dan Wesson 715 revolver in .357, with a 6-inch barrel, or a Henry lever rifle in .357, or a Remington 870 20ga pump shotgun, depending on which room.

I *really* don't want to shoot anyone -- just think of the rug-cleaning task -- so I'd hope for some laughter.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The most validating part to me was when he was talking about the campaign and how Trump said it was going to be the biggest infomercial you've ever seen.  

I've said for a long time that in the summer of 2016, when Trump was really starting to pull ahead of the pack, it was like his campaign was intentionally trying to throw the primaries.  The man did not want to be president, and he acted like it.  It says an incredible amount about the dysfunction of our democracy, that a man who is just trying to game the system, and finds the idea of actually winning repugnant, is hoisted into the presidency nonetheless.  

You could also tell the point in the campaign when they realized they could actually win, and started playing to the crowd.  I believe Trump's main reason for not wanting to be president is because he knew the scrutiny it would bring on his illegal dealings.  So I hope that his greed betrays him, and he gets his comeuppance yet.  

As for our democracy, I have little hope left.   ",1551398458

Essa história que socialismo causou fim do império Romano é bem velha entre alguns libertários/Ancap. 
Tem centenas de vídeos no youtube e textos em blogs libertários sobre isso, todos usando essa mesma fonte. 
Quem estudou um pouco sobre império romano sabe que é bobagem dizer que socialismo (uma ideologia que nem existia ainda) foi responsável pelo fim do império.

"AnthemTheGame","t5_3lspr","I partially agree with this. It definitely feels like a first-attempt at a game completely divorced from what a studio has historically developed and this is exactly the case. Anthem is different than Bioware's game catalog, but they tried to inject the classic ""Bioware charm"" into it through the Fort Tarsis interactions. It feels like two games squeezed together in one container.

The joke is that all of these live games start in a poor state. Destiny started poorly and took a year to sort out (this is true for both 1 and 2). The Division started poorly and it took Ubisoft Massive delaying DLC to produce meaningful updates the team and the community deemed important. Massive's route worked splendidly. Bungie's route worked okay - it took a long time, but it got there.

While I'm not surprised Anthem released in a poor state, I am surprised how poor of a state it is in. The content feels slight compared to similar games at their releases. The loot system is odd and lacks the ""oomph"" other loot games have (like when a Legendary or Prime drop happens in Diablo 3, the sound and the beam of light? Good god.). Anthem definitely has the capacity to be updated to a good state, but I'm apprehensive because it's a huge undertaking. Considering this game's 5 year-ish development (I'm going to assume 2 years actual development), it might be a long while before we see any meaningful changes.",1551398461

He is still teething (you can really see he's reading an autocue as opposed to a veteran like Jimmy or Sandi).

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","According to TTB (the labeling regulatory authority) you can 'fudge' the ABV by IIRC .5% for ABV under 10 and 1% if it's over. Basically, it's marketing.

EDIT: For wine it is +/- 1% over 14% and +/- 1.5% for wines below 14. 

For malt beverages like beer (is cider considered wine or malt?) its even weirder:

&gt;For malt beverages containing 0.5% or more alcohol by volume –
A tolerance of 0.3% above or below the alcohol content stated on the label is permissible EXCEPT THAT regardless of this tolerance:  

&gt;A malt beverage labeled as containing 0.5% or more alcohol by volume may not contain less than 0.5% alcohol by volume.  

&gt;A malt beverage labeled as “LOW ALCOHOL” may not contain 2.5% or more alcohol by volume.  

&gt;A malt beverage labeled as “REDUCED ALCOHOL” may not contain 2.5% or more alcohol by volume.  



So, the discrepancy is within the allowable tolerance. It may be that one is the 'correct' ABV and the other is marketing. Likely the cans are accurate (as they were made first) and the box was made after with the 'advertisement' ABV. More alcohol sells. 


EDIT 2:

&gt;Cider and perry products are regulated by TTB as wines under Chapter 51 of the IRC

"JUSTNOFAMILY","t5_3a182","This was originally written for the r/justnomil sub but it very much works here.

Don't rock the boat.



I've been thinking about this phrase a lot lately, about how unfair it is. Because *we* aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.


At some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own. 


The boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking. 


The boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?


Ballast!


And the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.


A born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, *because it did* .


When you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that *you* aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.


Now you and your DH get a boat of your own. With him not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder. 


While a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something! 


So the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and DH see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady? It would make their lives so much easier.

"MagicArena","t5_3nbzd","Hi, i'm new to mtga. Discovered this game like, 5 days ago. :)

I'm kind of overwhelmed by a lot of decks currently. Back when i played a lot (with paper cards) i rather liked my green wurm deck, which i tried to recreate in MTGA. Aside from not having priests of titania, i did get close: https://aetherhub.com/Deck/Public/80167

However, i kind of hit a brick wall. Almost every deck i encounter has quite a lot of removal/control in it, no matter if it's black, white, red or blue. Oftentimes i just can't get the heavy hitters out because my elves have been killed off, and by the time i do get the big ones out some kind of infinite combo has started (thousand-year storm, the guy's turn took 15 minutes before i just had to concede out of boredom).

I since splashed in status/statue and some green/black lands to help me with that, but i just can't seem to get my deck to work.

Should i just give up on that kind of green deck, or are there any tips on how to improve it? Maybe i'm going at it too simplistic?

Or is the meta just really, really unfriendly to monogreen/greenblack ""big stuff"" decks atm?

PS: In the ~20 games i played ranked i only went first in 2. Am i just being really unlucky here? Aside from having to mulligan a lot due to only having one land and no mana acceleration disturbingly often.",1551398464

"imaginedragons","t5_2urqu","To be fair, radio stations only play singles, never album songs, that’s how it is for every artist. So it wouldn’t make any sense for a radio station to play anything that isn’t a single. Sure it’s the radio’s fault that the singles might be played WAY too much to the point of overexposure, but it’s not their fault for playing only singles and not songs that cover ID’s entire discography. Nor do the radio stations choose what the singles are. ID shouldn’t get special treatment just because their big singles don’t accurately represent their entire discography, that wouldn’t make any sense. If they’d do that with ID then they’d have to do that with every artist and that wouldn’t exactly be feasible. 

Besides, the label and artist don’t want to promote album songs, they want to promote the single that might currently be big or gaining traction. So of course it’s the singles that are going to be pushed to the radio and ultimately be played a lot. ",1551398465

"AskUK","t5_2t4s3","My personal experience of the police (no, I was never arrested or in trouble with them) is a bad one and I've only ever grown up being told bad things about them, but that's me. I would never tell my younger brother who grew up and lives in a different part of the country to me about any of it or talk to him about police the sane way my family and friends spoke to me of them because he has to have faith in *someone*.

I will say this, the policing in this country is underfunded by our government - as are most (if not, all) of our security and public services. Maybe if we got rid of ""Police Community Support Officers"" and CCTV cameras without good enough quality to present in court unless the camera is actually right in the offenders face, then we might just about be able to afford more *actual* police officers that can chase criminals unlike those PCSO's or CCTV cameras. 

Yeah, have some CCTV cameras about, especially in public indoor areas but having CCTV that isn't always of good enough quality to even make out a car number plate is just money down the drain. 

Don't watch those people who video themselves on YouTube being approached by police though. Them people just think they know the law inside out when in reality, they just need to shut their mouths and do as the officer says. At the end of the day, that officer can *and probably would* make your life hell later on if you obnoxiously make his job difficult at that moment in time. ",1551398465

"Python","t5_2qh0y","Let's say your array has 10 items in it, and you remove 2 and now there's 8

My guess is somewhere in your code you've ""hard-coded"" a static number of loop iterations. By that I mean you have a loop that iterates through that array with something like:

    for i in range(10):
        do_something_with_array(i)

OR:

    i = 0

    while i &lt; 10:
        do_something_with_array(i)
        i += 1

In this case, when you removed two values from the array, it is no longer of length[10] it is length[8], so when the loop gets to ""i = 9"" it throws an index error.

If this is in fact the case, what you'll want to do is instead of hard-coding a loop of 10, you use ""len()"", something like this:

    for i in range(len(array_name)):
        do_stuff_with_array(i)

OR:

    i = 0

    while i &lt; len(array_name):
        do_stuff_with_array(i)
        i += 1

In this way, your iterator will adjust to whatever the length of your array is no matter how many items you remove (or add for that matter).",1551398465

"NJTech","t5_2s9ey","NJIT is arguably the best 'bang for your buck'. The CS program is great here. Professor get bad rep but certain courses from the program are really challenging and worthwhile. The program is rigorous for good reason.

&amp;#x200B;

Easy commute. Can't say for all but I was only a 15 minute drive down the interstate. Definitely beats the living &amp; food expenses down at RU New Brunswick before I transferred here. On my last semester here, I took NJTransit since I didn't need to come to campus a lot. Was a breeze.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, money. NJIT is on a steady rise. Tuition is cheap for what you can get out of it. I see a bunch of alumni's on LinkedIn working for some of the top companies in the metropolitan area. I personally know people I graduated with landing jobs &amp; interviews at great companies. And tuition a semester is like what, around $10k as a full-timer? I don't see the appeal to attend private universities unless you're in it for the 1) name 2) scholarship 3) lifelong dream. Other than that, you're just asking for a lot of unneeded debt.

&amp;#x200B;

The only problem I have seen with this school was how easy it is to cheat your way through the classes. Maybe due to the professors being older. Exams and homework get recycled and I have witnessed people copy pasta homework for free points. CS program had a myriad of cheaters and there was a very big gap of excellent programmers and weak programmers. Don't be the latter. Stay on top of your education and give your professors your undivided attention until you can code an AVL tree in any given lang with your eyes closed. Get Dean's list, get an internship, and trust me you will go far and pay off your NJIT debt in no time.",1551398465

She was also being molested by his new wife's daughter. We called CPS on them so many times and they'd take at least a month to go out and visit and give them a few weeks' notice each time so there was time to make everything look presentable. How he had it looking after that time was still not really passable as there were bugs everywhere and holes in the floor and things like that and they never took her. My mom, who isn't her mom, even offered to take her and CPS and no one else would do anything. My sister's actual mom didn't even get her for some reason and she wasn't amazing but she's so much better than my dad. Long story short, CPS told us they weren't going to do anything so we might as well leave them alone and we stopped seeing them because it wasn't safe for me either. There wasn't any good options at that point but I'll never understand how CPS can do so much when there's no reason to suspect it's necessary like in your case and then totally ignore it when it's obvious like in my sister's case.

Your response is a question that I cannot answer, seeing as I did not make that decision. If I were to give an answer though, it is fairer for everyone to grind for hours over a week than it is for some people to get a reward in five minutes whilst others may have to wait for weeks on end. Instead of having g an imbalance between players depending on their free time, have everyone working on the same large and accommodating timescale, whilst giving other exclusive rewards along the way.

The Bad Interactions:

1. Self-Insert player that was M&gt;F to the max, and consistently used their sexuality/gender dystopia as an excuse to be a violent asshole in and out of game. Additionally kind of wreaked my best friend's sex life (and yes, said best friend was AWARE of trans person)
2. M&gt;F trans person that was blatantly doing so to try and hit on the lesbian couple at the table. They were a nice person, but the level of cringe they brought was real. Thankfully they had cool characters and was overall pretty chill.
3. Not trans, but my ex-husband was heavily into crossdresssing. I literally had to throw him out after he threatened bodily harm to me, my friends, and himself.

On the other hand, one of my best childhood friends (AND Player at my table) is trans and we've been cool forever. I've known other trans as well, so I know that most of the bad apples were not bad because of their sexuality/identity... they were just assholes. 

Still, it always makes me extremely nervous to be around anyone who is trans until I know they aren't jerks.",1551398466

Even if the person asking for help deliberately went to you because she is sexist and just wanted a man to do it, refusing to help someone who asks is a pretty all-around douchey move regardless of how many other capable people are around that could also perform the task. If you're in a work environment with people you see every day, just imagine the outcomes of each possible course of action:
If you smile and say, ""sure I'd be happy to help"" what could possibly be wrong with that? How could that ever work against you in the future? It never hurts to have a better relationship with your coworkers. Or help them when they ask. 
You chose to say, ""no I'm not going to help, get that other person to help you"" which just makes you look like an asshole.

""Ignoring the content""? What the *actual fuck* kind of joke is that supposed to be? It's a bad one, that's for sure. Black Armory content was not made for people who aren't at the light level yet. Black Armory content was made for people who had, at that point, already completed Core, the DLCs, Forsaken, Dreaming City, and were at LL600 ready for the increase to 650. For the people who aren't at 600 - 610 - 620, there's Dreaming City and going around the system collecting Prime and Powerful Engrams. I've been here for a month and I'm 650. Do your engrams instead of crying about ""ignoring the content"" and you'll get to 650 too.

And that kind of attitude is totally out of step with where the party base is today. This kind of stuff will become a bigger drag on him as the campaign rolls on, if he does jump in. ",1551398470

I luckily work in the public sector and qualify for forgiveness since I’m only making $44,000 a year in my job. However, I haven’t let student loans destroy my quality of life. My husband and I bought a home in 2017 and we file our taxes separate to keep my payments extremely low ($161 a month). I’m also about to refinance before my payments begin in April.

I have substantial debt but I’m not willing to disengage from my life in order to pay it off. I’ve got great credit, a healthy checking/savings, I’m contributing to my 401k. I’ve come to accept I’ll probably have my debt forever but at least it’s all federal loans so it’ll die with me whenever that time comes.",1551398470

A one time thing because you ran out of toilet paper and are desperate, sure okay understandable, but this seems to be what she does every time. There is definitely a couple things to take away from this whole situation.  One is that she clearly needs therapy. No one who doesn’t have some sort of unresolved issue is doing this. My best guess is she has OCD/anxiety, probably revolving around bodily fluids and being “unclean”. Another thing is obviously she can’t keep doing this. As a short term solution before she starts therapy, I suggest getting a box of those throw away latex gloves. They’re inexpensive and she can put them on before using the toilet, wipe with normal toilet paper, flush, and then dispose of the gloves in the garbage can. Best of luck to the both of you.

The edition isn't actually relevant I think?, but I need some advice on an item in my campaign. To give some context, I'm DMing a homebrew 'sci-fi' campaign, in quotes because its actually very fantasy based, but magic has been lost in the majority of the galaxy. The PCs are some Guardians of the Galaxy-esc renegades, and they're fighting against The Galactic Federation, basically the Federation from Star Trek but more evil. One of the PCs is from Earth and ended up in a cryotube for 10,000 years, and her little brother had this Zebra toy and lots of stuff happens with that but the important part is that this Zebra ends up in the hands of one of the other PCs 10,000 years into the future. It caused some interesting character strife between the two, and that was its original purpose, just a point of connection and a cause for tension. I do, however, want a reason *why* it lasted that long, and I have a lot of ways to deal with its age, many of which are just my player's theories because they are some clever fools, some of which tie into the main plot &amp; BBEG, but I want some advice on which option to choose. Some of my PCs are on Reddit though, so if anyone is willing to pm me to help me talk through this that'd be great. I'd be happy to help you make some homebrew stuff in return if you'd like :)",1551398471

"RationalPsychonaut","t5_2yce6","He has worked closely with Sir Roger Penrose for something like 20 years on developing the [theory](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.1998.0254) that microtubules in brain cells  sort of act as quantum computers which are most likely responsible for [consciousness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WXTX0IUaOg&amp;t=3s). It's pretty [controversial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571064513001619), to say the least. But since the weirdness of quantum mechanics is a tempting tool for explaining other mysterious phenomena in the world, it gets tossed around quite a bit as a ""god-of-the-gaps"" solution

But Roger Penrose is no dummy (he was Stephen Hawking's PhD tutor) and he has staked quite a bit of his reputation on this theory which seems to have been somewhat supported by recent [discoveries](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.htm). But lots of physicists hate any theory that ties any direct line from consciousness to quantum mechanics, and will convincingly argue that there's no where near enough evidence to support it (See Lawrence Krauss).

It can.

The two smaller triangles in the figure are similar to the large enclosing triangle, because they have a right angle and they share an interior angle with the outer triangle. Because those two smaller triangles are similar to the outer triangle, they are also therefore similar to each other (there are other ways to determine this as well).

Because the left small triangle is a 3-4-5 triangle, the right small triangle is also a 3-4-5 triangle. That means the ratio of the short side DC to the long side BD is 3/4. We know that the long side BD is 6; therefore, DC is 3/4 * 6 = 18/4 = 9/2.",1551398472

So they either need to find several suspects with anchors on their necks, or they need to remove that variable by taking photos with necks covered.

There are a lot of music pools out there but more or less you can always take either a short edit or an acapella-out edit from the pools and mix in the edm song’s drop.

If not what I did before was take a top 40 song and google or search soundcloud and add “remix” or “house remix/edit” or “mashup” at the end and super easy and simple. Soundcloud is always a decent source of edits with many people giving free music edit packs. Youtube can give you a bunch of DJ mixes with titles like “Best of Trap Febuary 2019 mix” for a quick good idea of whats out there. Just have to sift and really dig for songs that you groove with.

You could always make your own if you have the time but I find it easier to just take parts of edits I like and splice it into another one instead of starting from scratch.

Without PoB a LOT of people will stop playing PoE - I'm not sure GGG realise this and I can only hope they intend to offer at least some of what it does ""in game"" because - otherwise - they may be a little fucked.

The mob will eventually calm down. Maybe in private conversation you can talk about your experiences (word will eventually get out that the teacher maybe wasn’t perfect). You can also just not engage and tell others that you aren’t down to gossip because 1 you have your own experiences and 2 nobody has all the facts of what’s going on. None of it will make you a better aerialist. Later on you’ll be glad you never joined the mob.

At the end of the day, we’re always responsible for our own choices, but criticism and body shaming are unreasonable methods of “encouragement”. If I experienced that, I would complain and probably look for a new gym altogether. Part of a teachers job is to push limits and keep a class engaged and coming back. They aren’t in your skin so if they push you to try something and you really aren’t going there, then calmly tell them you appreciate the push but you are listening to your body and insist. Your teacher can’t make you do anything you don’t want to. You can always leave and take with another teacher. Best of luck to you!

God is not bound by our free will at all, if we accept free will. He let some people, with their free will, go their way to Hell, when he had the power to not have that happen. 

He set the rules. He set the table for the test here. And He alone. 

As for your posit on salfivic exclusivity, this is a hotly contested topic. Classic Islamic scholarship agrees that Jannah is for believers. Now you might say there are exceptions and such, but here’s my counter argument. 

Take someone like Abu Talib. He helped the Prophet, assisted him, and even by the Prophet’s own account, assisted Muslims. He protected the Prophet from harm. But simply on the basis of his disbelief he will suffer a punishment of his brain boiling for eternity. That’s harsh, even for a second.

"detroitlions","t5_2rynx","That something looked flat, maybe even wrong with the offense and Stafford specifically in preseason, and that this wasn’t just because teams don’t try that hard in practice games. 

Lots of people rushed to defend the team, lecturing that there’s no way you can judge a preseason performance as indicative of how they’ll play during the regular. Yes, I agree that the *outcome* of a preseason game means little, but when Detroit’s starters were on the field in those games, they looked like they were having several issues that were not going to be resolved by the time the season started, and I thought a lot of the people here and on the podcast were in denial, not recognizing what was obvious to see. “Too smart” to see a simple explanation and instead coming up with all sorts of complicated “Patricia chess match” theories about putting players in positions where they’ll fail to make them stronger in real games. 

But Stafford continued to look off his usual high level of play for much of the real season, and although the team got up to 6 wins - something I doubted was possible after Week 1, there were very few memorable big offensive highlights in the 40-yard plus category. And the defense struggled and looked flat out of the gate as well until the additions of Harrison, despite a few strong individual performances from the start. ",1551398477

Y'know, things they actually wanted to do but didn't have a lot of help from parents. I was met with confused stares.

https://www.etsy.com/shop/ProArtSuppliesUSA/items 

But if you buy the $62 set in etsy then no worry on lightfast all is  fully excellent to moderately excellent lightfast. So its good to go and highly recommend, I use this one but slightly modified.

The Ultimate 36 is the newest version (I dont recommend as they slap in too many very low lightfast pigments just to add cadium colors which is lame drawback its only sold on Blicks and Amazon)

▪SONNET is the students grade of St. Petersburg but lightfast so so.▪

Ladoga is same as St. Petersburg but as example a few low lightfast included.

■Kuretake Gansai Tambi set, I have the 36 its great for practice but be warned these are different traditional watercolor method than any other country, so they control bit differently and few colors fade but do well indoor. They're great for sketchbook or display in home as practice works. I consider them a high Student Grade like W&amp;N Cotman. Minus mixability, these muddy and lose vibrancy if mixed.

◇If you like to build a pan set.

Look up on amazon Meedeen empty full pan case $7.99-10.99 12-14 pan (if you plan buying tubes to fill pans for certain colors)

●Buy M. Graham 15ml basic color set 29.99 on ebay. 
●Buy watercolor color wheel. 
●Then buy M. Graham Neutral Tint, and Paynes Gray. 

You're all set for roughly $50-55 if you like mixing colors (last a long time with these with 3-4 full pan refills in 15ml tube) M. Graham are perfect for filling in pan and cheap cost. Allow 2-3 day semi solid dry time in pan when freshly filled.

Its really close to St. Petersburg 36 set in cost. So save up a bit for Petersburg set and grab it. Save the pan packaging for future pan refills.

Blick sells refill pans but 2x price. Etsy is cheaper. 

•For professional paints use only 100% Cotton (Rag) papers. Bee company makes very affordable paper, aside Strathmore cotton papers. $12-$14-$24

Then Fluid 100% cotton, Arches the most expensive.

Cold press 100% cotton paper is rough: Allows glazing, some lifting, good blending

Hot press 100% cotton paper: Great lifting, Great Blending, low glazing due to smoother surface.

Papers go from 130lb to 300lb depends what you like and want. Higher Weight is higher cost.

Make sure Watercolor paper says 100% cotton or 100% Rag, if it doesn't skip it as it will be student grade watercolor paper.

I hope this info helps. ",1551398478

"firefox","t5_2qh4p","https://tomtsui.wordpress.com/2011/04/29/modify-firefox-sync-interval/ is an article from 2011, which is ancient in how Sync works today! And the manual Sync button works entirely different now, since Tabs Sync came into play and the button became ""Synced Tabs"", than how it worked back in 2011 when it was labeled as ""Sync Now"" and was a true manual Sync button.

As tabs are opened and need to be sync'd, the contact with the Sync server isn't once an hour as with the pref **services.sync.syncInterval** at 3600000 milliseconds might lead a person to believe, but the tabs sync event does lag from ""real time"" a bit and I can't find a pref which night change the time. But my observations with Sync is that saving a new bookmark is almost instantaneous, as I have seen with two different Profiles on the same PC running in tiled windows connected to the same Sync account. The Sync action thru the Sync server is so fast that I have to focus my eyes on the other browser window before I click to save a new bookmark in the first browser window Profile and have it appear a fraction of a second on the other browser. When I made that observation I was running Sync to keep a Nightly and a Release version synchronized and switching between them frequently to test the new features that were being added to the Firefox Nightly versions.",1551398478

The major points here are that the parents made the decision, the kids weren't even conceived yet when the decision was made, and that the technology is far too early to be practical. 

Suicide or genetic disease, yes, when the person is already born and suffering, it is within reason to cure them. Sometimes we try experimental drugs when there is no good alternative. However, here the decision was made previous to the existence of the problem. You have to be able to discern this.

&gt;“So it’s not what the press talks about where this guy is going to  go in the third round, or fourth round or whatnot. We  have to go through that process, us as an organization, and say, “OK, is that guy going to fit what we do?’ And get him in a situation where we can train him for a year or two or three years -- depending on how long it takes -- and hopefully he can be that guy. Whether he’s a top 5 quarterback or top 10, we want a quarterback who can win for us.’’

&gt;Among the quarterbacks who will be around after the first round and who might fit the Broncos’ profile: North Carolina State’s Ryan Findley, Northwestern’s Clayton Thorson, Auburn’s Jarrett Stidham, Boise State’s Brett Rypien and Buffalo’s Tyree Jackson.

You can do this too. Build some sites and create a development-centric resume and you will get a gig. Probably not remote but it's not impossible.

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","&gt;.. a brick wall the is too uneven for trim

You can easily cut a piece of trim to match the contours of the brick with a coping saw.

The trick is in using a simple child's compass (for drawing circles) as a way to follow the edge of the brick with the sharp point while drawing the line to cut with the pencil. This gives you a consistent offset between brick surface and pencil point, helping to ensure an accurate cut.

Or you could transcribe the shape of the bricks to the trim by using a tiler's contour gauge in four inch/10cm segments. 

But the compass trick is easier.

"TheOA","t5_37af3","&gt; *I'm seeing multiple dimensions.*

Get. Fucking. Hyped.

&gt; *Does anyone else find it interesting the first line in both seasons is 'blink for me'?*

Mirrors and symmetry are themes that permeate the show to the core. It's not surprising to me that Zal and Brit are drawing parallels here.


&gt; *The scars on Nina's arms? They look like cigarette burns, possibly self inflicted.*

I definitely think it's meant to mirror Prairie's scars. But they are very neatly arranged, making me think it's not a self-harm thing, even if it is self-inflicted.

&gt; *In the first season when the OA has her first meeting with BBA *

I pulled the quote - ""It's about you and Steve, and the play, cast of two, setting - classroom, over many dimensions through time"". I'll be really interested to see what BBA and Steve's relationship is in the new dimension.

&gt; *And the versions of Hap we see! He looks like his old self, he's talking to ""Prairie"" he says her name in the audio we hear. But then there's the bearded Hap who seems so ecstatic to find Homer in the therapy looking circle.*

I'm fairly certain that new dimension Hap will start with a beard but later shave it to match his old dimension self. It's worth noting that Hap is wearing his Part I glasses in the field performing the movements, but has completely different glasses in the new dimension.

&gt; *And what is the dream/sleep room with all the people in bed and people with computers?*

On one hand, I want to know! On the other hand, I am afraid to speculate and just want the show to tell me. Presumably a ""the missing people are in the weird house and a nefarious experiment is being performed"" to mirror Hap's and Leon's experiments in Part I.

&gt; *As far as the Crestwood 5 and some extras*

They show the Crestwood 5, Angie, and at least one other person I can't identify.

What things does she avoid touching and how does she goes out of her way to avoid them? Does it cause her anxiety? Is she afraid something will happen if she gets germs on her? What does she have to do if she accidentally contaminates herself? Are there any other things that she avoids or is afraid of?
These questions and this line of reasoning spring to mind because I have a loved one who has OCD and went through an obsession with germs and contamination. I'm not saying that's what your girlfriend has I would seriously ovoid any type of self diagnosis, but it might be something to talk about.
If she's afraid of contamination to the point that it is affecting her life and making her feel ashamed or depressed it may be worth talking to a doctor about. That may sound humiliating but it would be worth it. 
As for you, as her boyfriend, be supportive but don't let things that are hurting her slide. If she's too embarrassed about the sock thing, or you can't deal with it maybe you could invest in a different type of toilet paper, or even something like automotive paper towels. They're thicker and larger wouldn't look too out of place in the bathroom.

&gt;Solnit also firmly believes that gender discrimination was a deciding factor in the election of Donald Trump. I play devil’s advocate and press her on why the American left remains so focused on identity politics, when class — rather than gender or race — is arguably where the real economic and political action is. Solnit immediately chastises me for using that “horrible, dismissive term ‘identity politics’ that Bernie Sanders and others used, which pretends that we’re in a colourblind, gender-blind society and it’s all just economics”.    
  
&gt;  
&gt;Wait, I say, pushing back, does she think Sanders did that?   
&gt;  
&gt;  
“I think that identity politics is old, and identity politics are about feminists like Mary Wollstonecraft and the French Revolution.” (I am pretty sure the latter was about class, but before I can interject, Solnit is on to her next point.)

"GCdebatesQT","t5_3bm34","&gt; The author goes on about how gender doesn't account for political classes and structes. But gender doesn't try to do that. It tries to explain the way genderidentity affects the individuals live and how such an identity might be recognized.

Erm, no.

Gender refers to the social/cultural differences between the male and female sexes (because the male and female sexes are socialized and treated differently by society). A society that made no social distinction between people of the male and female sexes (so no clothing rules, no social roles, no pronouns or non-medical references to sex) would be considered a society without gender.  

This is how it's been defined in dictionaries, but also in sociology, psychology, and feminist theory textbooks since the 1950's-1960's. ""Gender roles"" replaced ""sex roles"" in order to emphasize that differences in the activities, behaviors, and dispositions of the male and female sexes were a product of culture rather than their biology.

From the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender) article on gender:

&gt; The modern academic sense of the word, in the context of social roles of men and women, dates at least back to 1945,[15] and was popularized and developed by the feminist movement from the 1970s onwards (see § Feminism theory and gender studies below), which theorizes that human nature is essentially epicene and social distinctions based on sex are arbitrarily constructed. In this context, matters pertaining to this theoretical process of social construction were labelled matters of gender.

&gt; The popular use of gender simply as an alternative to sex (as a biological category) is also widespread, although attempts are still made to preserve the distinction. The American Heritage Dictionary (2000) uses the following two sentences to illustrate the difference, noting that the distinction ""is useful in principle, but it is by no means widely observed, and considerable variation in usage occurs at all levels.""[16]

&gt; In the last two decades of the 20th century, the use of gender in academia has increased greatly, outnumbering uses of sex in the social sciences. While the spread of the word in science publications can be attributed to the influence of feminism, its use as a synonym for sex is attributed to the failure to grasp the distinction made in feminist theory, and the distinction has sometimes become blurred with the theory itself; David Haig stated, ""Among the reasons that working scientists have given me for choosing gender rather than sex in biological contexts are desires to signal sympathy with feminist goals, to use a more academic term, or to avoid the connotation of copulation.""[2]

There's only so far you can develop a character and if they're planning on continuing with Sora they probably want to leave room for growth down the line. That being said, I could even see KH3 working better as a side game: make it shorter and less ""epic"" but still finish out the plot. Then the next major installment gives a quick recap and moves onto the next plot line.

Clues to the Gang: aka dossiers. you can do YT walkthroughs but it does open up more clues to who everyone is/why they were chosen and hints at the idols. Collecting all of them will reveal a bonus scene.

Idols/The Endless: again, collecting will give you more insight but you kiiiinda figure it out on your own. Collecting all of them will give you a bonus scene.

Embers: similar to the Idols, they'll reveal extra scenes and instill hope/add friendship points (I think? it's been a while since I played these books) for each member of the group. You'll see a bit of their past and possible future.

Also, Outfits: buy the ones that will help the mission (scuba suit, camo gear, one of the futuristic suits that lets you see how your choices affect friendship/relationship points) for extra scenes/extra insight.

We simply laid a layer of 2-3 thick comforters/blankets, lied on top of the layer of thick comforters, and use another comforter/blanket to cover. Not only is this set up cost effective compared to looking into futons or mats, but also is it the “right way to do it.” Not to mention it aligns with the idea of minimalism because you don’t need to buy too many things for this set up 🙂",1551398491

If they find it inefficient in earning in Canada then they won’t earn money in Canada or directly under their name. They will not pay income tax in Canada because there is no income. The asset market isn’t “local” anymore. 

Not for all the major cities in the world. Attempting to make it local is stupid as it will not work. Plenty of retirement funds have assets in other countries asset markets. You fuck with people’s investments they fuck with yours. 

The best case is you move somewhere you can afford. By the looks of it, it isn’t in GVA or GTA. 

You expect smart and wealthy investors to come here and work as a peasant you are in for a surprise. They are here to expand their wealth network not to work as a peasant. Making money in direct income is too inefficient in Canada. ",1551398493

If you're in your mid 20's your income is probably laughable compared to what you are going to be earning in 30 years. My daughter is 25 and just finished University. I want her to work on maxing out her TFSA first. Later when she has her TFSA maxed out and she still needs to save more for retirement than she can start her RRSP contributions (she will be in a higher tax bracket later in her career). If you start contributing to your RRSP early on at basically your lowest income level (the lowest tax bracket of your life likely) it increases the risk that you might be in a higher tax bracket when you retire. The benefit from the RRSP is greatest if you can contribute to the RRSP in a higher tax bracket than you will be when you retire and start to withdraw the funds.  ",1551398494

To double check: 3130.8 points needed + 2064 scored so far = 5194.8 total points. 5194.8 total points ÷ 78 games played = 66.6 ppg

"FORTnITE","t5_2t7hh","Oof she's my baby. I'm kind of upset that they gave her counterpart the crit rating perk instead of her, but I guess I'll get over it sooner or later. Scythes are still good either way, depending on how you run them.

I should let you know I ended up switching out Alchemist for Cloaked Shadow. I realized I can't stand in a mosh pit and take it for granted that I won't get knocked. So that combo of Hearty Strikes, Medicinal Fumes, and Dim Mak is gone. What I'm getting at is over the past few hours, I've started to play smarter and found I don't need Alchemist for the Medicinal Fumes. Cloaked Star's support bonus, Corrupted Aura, is perfect for singling out larger enemies or Mist Monsters and letting the small stuff kill itself in the Aura. Survivalist is enough to keep the health up, and Dim Mak is perfect for the shield. 

So her support team is going to look very similar to Assassin's, although Assassin is now in as a support bonus.

* **Team Perk:** Dim Mak
* **S1:** Whiteout Fiona (Anatomy Lessons)
* **S2:** ~~Swordmaster Ken (Legendary Blade)~~ Brain fart, we're not using swords like the old days. Cloaked Shadow (Corrupted Aura, Alchemist (Medicinal Fumes), or Anti-Cuddle Sarah (Rapid Charge) would be good replacements for this slot.
* **S3:** Assassin (Assassination)
* **S4:** Deadly Blade Crash (Corrosive Strikes)
* **S5:** Survivalist Jonesy (Survivalist)
* **G1:** Slow Field (good luck mini bosses and mist monsters)
* **G2:** Turrets (distance support if needed) or Adrenaline Rush for extra health while you get used to not having Medicinal Fumes anymore.

The thing is, you can go and mess around and see if you like other loadouts. That's the beauty of this update. There are a lot of different ways to play.

Btw, if you ever want to swap out Dim Mak and try for something different Endless Shadow is really cool, since with this setup Shadow Stance lasts for 20 seconds, allowing you to keep the ~~Legendary Blade bonus~~ (again, brain fart. doesn't work with scythes), +60 Armor, and +15% movement speed super long. That team perk increases Shadow Stance 4 seconds for every Ninja above 3 stars in your squad. The triple jump team perk also looks cool but double jump is all messed up right now.

I run my scythes a different way than others do too. I normally run with 2x attack speed, 1 armor, and then matching 5th and 6th perks. Both my Fishing Hooks have affliction damage so it's kind of cool having that *and* snare from Harvester's innate ability. I might try to change one of the attack speeds to Crit DMG, like I've been trying with my swords.",1551398498

As Kal finishes his sentence, he sets his mind as though he were in the final moments of a hunt, and feels the flow of his aura cease. To the other examinees, it appears as though his aura has been extinguished like a flame. He maintains this state for a few moments, then a trickle of aura returns as he stops focusing.

""What is that state called? And what are the other two principles?""

Kal sits down. Though he is listening to the response, a part of his focus is now taken by the principle of Ten.

Not a novel, but another good piece that is similar to Vonnegut’s theories on treating one another well (“god damn it, you’ve got to be kind!”) is **This Is Water** by David Foster Wallace. It’s actually a short speech you can get in book form, or you can listen to it here:

Porzingis has serious injury concerns with his stature, and will be due a lot of money soon. No front office wants to have that problem.

The unions will push for that because it means more mileage for their drivers and the logistics companies will push for it because it means reduced delivery times and the software companies will push for it because it means more data and the OEMs will push for it because it means accelerated vehicle depreciation.

Mind-made-up meter: 9

Candidates still under consideration:Luka Doncic (Dallas), Trae Young (Atlanta)

Analysis: Yes, this race is unofficially over. Doncic (20.9, 7.2 rebounds, 5.7 assists) has been everything the Mavs hoped for, and now he’s on track to join Robertson as the only other rookie to reach the 20-7-5 marks.But again, there is still roughly a quarter of the schedule left to play and Young – who had 36 points, 10 assists, and eight rebounds in a win against Minnesota on Wednesday – has been on a major upswing for quite some time now after his rough early start. At this rate, he’s set to join Robertson, Magic Johnson, Damon Stoudamire, Allen Iverson and Isiaah Thomas as the only rookies to average 17 points and seven assists.

Consider these lines from Dec. 1 on…

Young: 20.8 points (42.7% overall, 38.7 from three-point range), 8.2 assists, four rebounds, 3.7 turnovers

Doncic: 23.1 points (43.1%, 32.8%), 6.7 assists, 8.6 rebounds, 3.3 turnovers

The gap between them has been shrinking, in other words, even if it’s far too big for Young to bridge all the way. If nothing else, the Hawks rookie looking more and more like a legitimate franchise cornerstone means the optics on that controversial Doncic-Young draft day trade look far better these days. To review, the Hawks sent the third pick to Dallas (Doncic) in exchange for the No. 5 (Young) and a 2019 first-rounder (top-five protected).

Yet for Atlanta’s purposes, Young’s progression has been positive enough to inspire a rethinking about this coming summer in which they’ll have approximately $41 million in salary cap space. According to a source with knowledge of their thinking, the Hawks are so bullish on the development of Young, fellow rookie Kevin Huerter and second-year big man John Collins that they want to explore even the biggest and boldest of offseason plans.

Translation: They’re planning to pursue meetings with the best-of-the-best in free agency when July 1 rolls around. It’s a half-court shot of sorts, to be sure, but they’d love nothing more than to fire that pitch to everyone from Kevin Durant on down. Talk about the young core and where they believe they’re heading under coach Lloyd Pierce, the arena that received $192.5 million in renovations that have drawn rave reviews, and the fancy new practice facility too. Even if (insert free agent’s name here) doesn’t come, it’s the kind of courting that sends a league-wide message that your program should be taken seriously",1551398504

If not, he must be taking them out of patient's bottles once the rx has been checked and is waiting for pickup - tho if someone notices that they have 1 (or more) missing it will come down on the pharmacist who did the final check.

Besides these, I cant think of any other way where someone could take CII's and get away with it.

In that theoretical universe, you still have the Klingons (war), the Romulans (subterfuge), the Borg (globalists), and the Ferengi (greed), with factions of each all living under the Federation utopia. You also have cases where the Enterprise has to go searching for dilithium crystals (scarcity).

Let's take a real world example. America. Compare America to *any* medieval society in the dark ages a mere few hundred years ago, and they would look at our society as already post-scarcity.

 Staple foods like Rice and Potatoes cost a few cents for a meal. Water is clean and free to anyone who needs a drink. Winter shelter with heat is easy to come by and doesn't require months of preparation. Traveling to the main city for metal works and supplies can be done within a day instead of weeks at a time. If you're injured, you're taken to a hospital and fixed up before they even ask to square up your doctor's bill. You no longer have to fear being accosted by robbers randomly along the road.

I have no idea what we'll be in need of and of how much financial flexibility we'll in 2 years.

&gt;You saying that signing Harper will hamstring them is just conjecture, and in my opinion unfounded. There is nothing to support it.

Every team has a maximum budget that the owner is willing to spend every season. The Bryce Harper signing means that 25 million is automatically going to count against that budget every season. So that's 25 million that the Phillies won't be able to spend elsewhere every season. So it clearly will affect how much the Phillies can spend every season. Whether it's worth it or not is a different story. 

&gt;Your whole argument about the cost of Cano is based on the Mets having previously made bad decisions.

"langrisser","t5_2vo7m","So I would appreciate some advice for my team and summons.

Currently planning on going princess with Liana, Lana, Cherie, Shelfaniel/Luna, and off-faction Ledin. I have all but the faction buffer, both of which are on current banners. I was thinking that since I already pulled Lana from the focus banner, going for Shelf will be more likely than Luna (I also happen to prefer Shelf more) since it's two  focus.

But then there is also the Elwin/Ledin/Leon banner coming up next week, and either of the two I don't have would be great additions to my barracks (also Elwin is required for Liana bond power, Leon for Lana). Unfortunately I can't wait until that banner to decide how to split my summons because the twin princesses banner would be gone.

According to the CN schedule it'll be while (~1.5 to 2 months) until any banner with Elwin or Leon or Shelf (she happens to be on a focus banner with Bozel and Lana in the future, which would be perfect for me). But seeing as it'll take a while, should I pull for Shelf now since she provides the faction buff and the team's potential will be worse without her for two months, or pull for Elwin/Leon?

Tbf for Elwin and Leon I'll have two weeks to gather more tickets/crystals, but atm I have 11 vouchers and 5k crystals (with a lot left behind in story/time rift).

On a side note, does anyone have the link to the Liana Macho lottery skin? I heard there's one in CN and would like to keep 4k crystals on hand for that, as well an approximate estimate when we'll get it.

Edit: nvm [found it](https://i.imgtc.com/CBUPDoN.jpg) I'm glad it's this one since I've seen a few of her other skins, was hoping this was the ""f2p obtainable"" one",1551398505

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Start by throwing out any testimony from the Bible on the basis that all of those sources talk about Jesus performing magic tricks, and as such cannot be regarded as reliable. It's like if a witness said he saw the accused fire a gun at the crime scene and also the accused was flying and had fire shooting from his eyes. That's a compromised mental state. That would never stand up in court. 

There are several extra-biblical accounts of Jesus, but it's worth noting that none of them are firsthand accounts. All of them occur well after Jesus' supposed death, and they reference the cult of Christianity without saying that Jesus was actually a person who existed. We accept that level of evidence for the existence of other historical figures, but in terms of a modern, fair trial it would never be sufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It's like a handfull of people saying, ""Oh, yeah, I totally heard that he did it. Yeah, that's what the plaintiff told me.""

Also, be aware that the Bible contains between two and four actual firsthand testimonies. The gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke appear to all have the same author (essentially the same narrative with similar phrasing throughout). The gospel of John appears to have a different author and conflicts in several fairly significant ways with the other gospels. You might be able to use that conflict to discredit both testimonies if the compromised mental state tack doesn't pan out.

Paul (Or Saul of Tarsus. Same guy.) talks about hundreds of witnesses seeing Jesus, but the trick is that was something he saw 'in a vision'. Paul never met Jesus when He was alive. If the other side says anything about hundreds of witnesses, you should absolutely use that to cru- to hang them. If you walked into a courtroom and said that your evidence was that you had a dream that hundreds of people saw the accused committing a crime, you'd be disbarred.

Hope this helps. Good luck.",1551398506

Anyway, by a TON of time, I mean a TON of paid time in general. With 48 personal hours, and up to 160 hours of vacation (accrual and limit are level dependent), you're looking at more than 200 hours paid time. Plus, the unpaid 80 hours. All of which can be taken with virtually no notice. Not to mention the options of paid medical leave as well as every employee is entitled to a 2 week minimum personal leave (can be either paid or unpaid depending on if you want to apply the time in your bank). 

My point is that there are a lot of options for time off which can essentially be taken at the drop of a hat.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"politics","t5_2cneq","That's a good question. I'm not an expert, but I do have a computer science degree so I'll attempt to answer.

Online banking is made possible (that is, secure) by encryption, which means that the data being exchanged online between you and your bank is scrambled before being sent. You're able to unscramble your bank's data, and they're able to unscramble yours, but anyone watching the network traffic in between can't read it because they don't have the decryption key necessary to unscramble the data. When this encryption is done properly, your bank can be confident that any data coming to them through their online service was actually initiated by your account.

With this out of the way, the other thing your bank needs is simply a way to lock access to your account away from other people, and this is done through a simple username and password. If you compromise your password, that's your fault in the eye of the bank. Nothing bad happens to them really, only you, so they don't need to secure your account any more rigorously. They can attempt to clear up unauthorized transactions of course, but someone guessing your password isn't disastrous to them. To put it simply, online banking is secure but it has many less restrictions compared to an election.

Now let's look at some additional restrictions which are placed on elections. The government needs to make sure that the US citizen who registered is placing the vote, not someone else. This alone is a headache. Sure, you can register online and confirm your identity but how can the government know that it's actually YOU casting the vote when the election comes around? In-person voting usually uses an ID check before handing you your ballot to combat this, but the closest thing we can do digitally is require some sort of biometric verification at the time of voting.

The government also needs to make sure that your vote remains anonymous and untraceable, to avoid anyone being able to bribe or threaten you to vote a certain way. In-person voting does this by forcing you to vote alone, and throwing out any ballots that have identifying marks on them. With online voting, there's no way to ensure that someone else isn't watching the vote take place to make sure it goes a certain way. It's inherently much more open to bribery or blackmail.

There's also the matter of everyone using personal, unaudited devices to vote, many of which could feasibly be infected by malware to mess with the voting process (which could silently propagate over the internet after being unleashed by a foreign government). There's trillions of dollars at stake in US elections, you can bet someone would try it.

Beyond these headaches for the government, there's additional headaches for the voters. Do you trust the software you're using to vote? How can you trust it, and how can you know without a doubt that it hasn't been tampered with? What if the webpage has been replaced by a convincing fake like in phishing attacks? What if someone intercepts your digital submission and reports back to you a fake confirmation page, while throwing your vote out? There is absolutely no way for you to verify that your vote was submitted correctly, compared to simply dropping a paper in a box yourself with in-person voting.

Also consider the matter of counting the votes. This essentially happens in a black box. How can the candidates trust that the votes were counted fairly? With paper voting, a representative from every party with a stake in the election gets to watch the box be opened and the votes counted. With electronic voting, it happens invisibly in a computer and there's no way to watch it happen.

There are ways to mitigate these problems, but I don't think there's ever going to be a way to solve all of them. There are also more concerns than I have listed, but like I said I'm not an expert in these things and I've spent enough time writing this. None of these issues exist in a proper paper ballot voting system.",1551398508

"india","t5_2qh1q","Here is an interview of a Greek pilote. Be aware that it was more than ten years ago.  


Would you agree with these statements of a former HAF fighter pilot?

&lt;&lt;To conclude, the Mirage 2000 is slicker than the Viper but less powerful. &gt;&gt;

This true.

&gt;&gt;With good pilots on both sides, they are probably equal in dogfight&gt;&gt;

This is wrong. A good pilot in an M2K will kill a good pilot in an F-16 9 out of 10 times (1 provided for launch failure).

I served in an M2K fighter squadron in HAF. We analyzed tactics and combat scores against HAF F-16 squadrons all the time.

The M2Ks higher INSTANTANEOUS turn rate gives it an advantage during the first pass. The F-16 cannot outturn the Mirage. It has to climb in hopes of avoiding the lock. A good M2K pilot will end it right there (the Magic 2 is a better IR weapon than the AIM-9L/M).

A rookie in the M2K, however, will probably lose the F-16's climb. The more powerful viper will escape and will then gain the advantage because of 1) Altitude 2) Higher SUSTAINABLE turn rate.

As for turn rates, altitude differences are purely theoretical and in practice make no difference EXCEPT for sea level manuevers where the more powerful Viper starts gaining the advantage.

&gt;&gt;Would you agree with the statement that F-16 is a better choice for multi role missions than Mirage 2000 ?

Absolutely. The M2K is a multi-role fighter also, but its performance varies greatly among roles - whereas the Viper performs almost all missions at a very satisfactory level.

HAF M2Ks are specialized. 331's (where I served) primary role is now TASMO (naval strike with AM-39 Exocet) and 332's primary role will become Deep Strike (with SCALP EG). CAP &amp; Air Supremacy are their secondary roles.

The F-16 sqdns OTOH undertake a number of roles such as SEAD, CAP, CAS, and numerous specialized strike missions (enemy AFBs, enemy C&amp;C centers etc). The Viper is a much more volatile weapons system",1551398508

Ah yes, continuing the Grand Tradition of criticising Effective Altruism for being ineffective without presenting any numbers whatsoever.  Why actually engage with GiveWell's methodology and estimates directly when you can just dismiss their efforts as arrogant?

The author doesn't acknowledge that orders of magnitude involved here.  If you think deworming a kid for less than a dollar or saving a life for a couple thousand dollars is ineffective and you can do better, fine.  But maybe give an example?  Certainly don't say Effective Altruists rely on mindless extrapolation (GiveWell explicitly takes into account charity's ability to expand with funding; GiveWell doesn't recommend 300M Americans all donate 10% of their income to AMF, they are well aware of the effect they have on charitable giving).  And don't use a single example of (honestly quite effective!) work to insinuate it is applicable to anything more than a tiny minority of people.

""OMG this game doesn't look as good at BotW or Mario Odyssey!? Game Freak sucks"" 

&amp;#x200B;

NEWS FLASH! Its not supposed to. Don't compare Pokemon to other games from other series. Instead, compare This Pokemon game to other Pokemon games. If you pulled your head out of your \*\*\* for 3 and a half seconds you would see that this is BY FAR the best looking Pokemon game to date. Pokemon is not, and never will be, a graphical power house. Expecting it to be a graphical power house is missing the point, and setting yourself up for disappointment. There is no movable camera or fully 3d environments, because there isn't supposed to be. Adding a fully explorable 3d environment with a camera that you can spin around and around would not add anything meaningful to the game. If Game Freak thought any of the above would add something meaningful to the game/franchise, they would have added it. Pokemon is one of the most profitable franchises on the planet, they do not lack for money. If they really wanted to, they could make *Call of Skyrim: Modern Pokemon*, with photo realistic textures, 40,000 NPCs with fully fleshed out routines and complex dialog options. They could make that *Pokemon MMO* people have been foaming at the mouth for since time immemorial. They could make *Breath of the Wild Pokemon Appears.* Just not in the time frame you all are expecting. But they don't do any of this, because that isn't what is best for the series, and as the numbers are telling them, its not what the fans want.

3. He said he did not commission the @womenforcohen twitter account. The people who created the account stated that they did it at cohens direction in a wall street journal interview. 

4. In his Truth in Testimony form he stated he did not have any contracts with foreign government entities. He then testified that he had contracts with the Bank of Kazakhstan and Korean Aerospace Industries during the hearing.

5. Testified that he was a good lawyer and understood the need to present his clients with sound legal advice , then also testified that he made the Stormy payment with out considering if it was improper or even the right thing to do. Also contradicted his written statement with his verbal statement on the source of the $130,000

6. He testified that he is only in this predicament out of blind loyalty to Trump. The prosecutors and Judge that over saw his case stated that his conduct was not out of blind loyalty but rather of Cohens personal greed and ambition.

Yes, he’s a big body and he’s fast and he can put up some numbers but they’re rarely crunch time #’s.

TB12 obviously lost confidence in him before the suspension as evidenced by him only getting 2 targets in the Steelers loss. And none after a big drop on third down.

Even assuming he gets sober, I don’t think he has the mentality of a prime time clutch player. Cleveland cut him for a reason.

The only little bit of optimizing for Google that I do, is try to get my tags into my description. Not all the tags, I don't want it to sound like a laundry list, but the important ones. 

When I was writing a blog I read that keywords or tags should be worked into the content naturally. Google didn't like (meaning would overlook or consider it spammy) if you just listed out your tags in the blog post. I am guessing the same would work for listings.

You didn't mention this, but don't bother changing your photo's file name to a keyword. That works for google and blogs, but Etsy automatically changes your pictures file name.

I am a strong believer that it is actually biological. She feels that way because she is in fact a woman. 

Not all women think like that ofc. And some men think like that to. 

But I think biology dictate that more women than men will feel an urge to caretake the children. 

My country is probably one of the most equal rights country in the world and still substantially more women choose caretaking, even if they are encouraged to do otherwise.

At least not to the extent that people like John Wayne did back in the day as a mouthpiece for McCarthyism. Calling him out for having attended an anti-gay church in the past is, well, fine, I guess, but not generally helpful for anyone. A big part of me feels like this issue isn't really worth the amount of drama surrounding it. Like, why single out Pratt, not even for the things he's said, but for attending, and then intentionally leaving, a church in the past that did bad things to gay people. Are we calling out Catholic actors and actresses, too, for being a part of a church that actively covers up child sex abuse? It just really feels like less a symptom of genuine leftist cultural criticism and more of call-out culture clickbait. ",1551398514

Part of me thinks that he'll look better on a good team where he can play within himself more, but then another part of me worries that he'll never really fit in on a good team since the main skill he brings to the table is something that KD does much better (kinda like how Wiggins looked better when the Wolves were bad, but now it's clear how limited his game truly is).

If we get all 3, I'd expect 47+ wins. KD and Kyrie are elite, Zion should at, the very least, be a positive contributor as a rookie. Mitch is the love of my life, DSJ is a much better passer than I expected, and we could fill in the gaps with cheap vets.

Being somewhat of a car guy, he used this opportunity to buy a then new C63 AMG (an '08 J think) and absolutely hated the cost of ownership, so after a couple years he started his own office, got rid of the C63 and bought a cheaper car (can't remember exactly which one but I'm pretty sure it's Japanese).

"WaterTreatment","t5_36wnj","On unchlorinated well water, we typically estimate resin will last 12-15 years (loose boundaries) as long as the softener is not subject to extreme use or left without salt for an extended period of time. In my experience that means it is essentially a toss up as to whether or not your resin is in good shape. The only easy to know if the resin is any good is to test the hardness of water after the softener, but that won't require a lab test. Any water treatment technician will be able to test that in 30 seconds with a field test.

Point-of-use RO units are not rated (in my experience) for feed water hardness as high as your well water (748 ppm/ \~44 gpg), so I would recommend having the softener in working order before voiding the warranty on a new RO by subjecting it to water it is not rated for.

Good news is that you shouldn't need a whole new softener regardless of resin condition. Looks like a 1 cuft softener, material and labor for a resin replacement shouldn't run you more than a few hundred dollars all told if the valve is in good shape mechanically. That valve is based on the Fleck 5600 platform, the most common softener valve out there. I don't have any experience with Myers, but unless it is modified in a proprietary way to enable price gouging, even a complete rebuild shouldn't cost much more than $500. Most people find that course of action preferable to the $1500 or so you would likely be spending on a decent softener.

At 1.8 ppm iron, a properly functioning softener should be able to take care of that no problem.

The hydrogen sulfide smell you are getting is a different story. If it is predominantly in the hot water, first step is to have a plumber replace your current sacrificial anodes in the water heater with aluminum zinc (not plain aluminum). To take care of a cold water problem, options include having an atmospheric storage tank put in (some other advantages to that as well, as well as downsides), injecting chlorine, or having an air induction filter put in. The consideration between those involves too many individual circumstances to be wise to do over the internet, but a water treatment professional would likely be happy to have that discussion with you once they understand your individual circumstance better. Price for those choices does vary considerably and would depend a lot on installation setup.

Hope that gives you an idea of where you are starting out!",1551398516

"ITCareerQuestions","t5_30560","1. Titles are just made up words that HR in most companies loosely tie to duties. I'm a senior technical analyst, but i also architect solutions for the company. For the most part, a technician would work on hardware, an architect would architect solutions involving vms, storage, etc. Generally all would be responsible for analysis and administration within their areas, aka how can we improve, and administration to me is just more words for day to day maintenance and requests.

2. This week, to keep it vague as to not break policy, i've done work with:

* Clustered servers, and iscsi volumes
* home drives and the relocation of their data
* meetings
* dfsR and dfsN for remote sites
* exchange / windows server patching
* made changes to veeam backup scheduling and throttling
* meetings
* work to replace on-prem email security with cloud service
* went to the local datacenter, both to add in a temporary a/c unit and to look at the 'cuda and wish violence upon it
* a couple tickets, mostly referring the helpdesk to the documentation that i've sent them several times
* created some certs so non domain joined machines can attach to our wifi
* meetings

3. Go build a lab. It doesn't take more than a 1tb drive to get esx running (free) with a fully functional domain including AD, DNS, DHCP, File Shares, users, etc. And you can use windows server for free for 120 days as well. Mess with things, see what happens when you do something stupid, then learn how to fix it.

4. Mostly it's preparation for projects or improvements. 90% preparation for 10% actual making changes. We don't just sit and wait for shit to break, that's what alerting is for. It's customer facing, but instead of the clients being users, it's the helpdesk. And yes, we think of the helpdesk like you think of your users.


Edit: it replaced my 3. and 4. with another 1 and 2. Leaving work now, not gonna fix it.

So I've always been a nagging harpy about being mindful of their size and strength. Always encouraged them to understand how fragile most people their age are. And always encouraged them to help others when they can find opportunities to do so. 

Now, what I meant was that they should share pencils with classmates and use kind words even when they're angry. However, that is not all they took away from the lesson. 

So when a younger smaller girl was being chased and called names by an older bigger boy, my beautiful little protectors of the small decided to do something about it. They invited her to play with them and, when bully kid showed up, they ""accidentally"" tripped him or knocked him down every time he tried to touch the little girl. 

Watching my seven year old laugh as he described the kid getting frustrated and going away, how carefully they pointed out that it was always an ""accident"" and how incredibly happy they were that the little girl was able to laugh and run and play safely... 

Of course, I had to give them the bit about making sure to ask a grownup for help. I watched it go in one ear and it the other, but honestly if playing kinda rough to show him he wasnt the biggest and baddest was their solution, I don't have a problem with it honestly. ",1551398517

&gt; Israeli soldiers may have committed war crimes while responding to Palestinian protests on the Gaza border last year, UN human rights experts have said.

&gt; &amp;quot;The onus is now on Israel to investigate every protest-related killing and injury, promptly, impartially and independently in accordance with international standards, to determine whether war crimes or crimes against humanity were committed, with a view to holding accountable those found responsible&amp;quot;, said Santiago Canton, the Argentine chairman of the commission.

&gt; Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the findings proved &amp;quot;What we have always said - that Israel is committing war crimes against our people&amp;quot;.

How can we trust any evidence or stories from HPD from no-knock raids?

"schizophrenia","t5_2r828","I smoked weed off and on for years. Interestingly, I had been smoking and drinking regularly for a few months prior to my break. As the break drew near, I smoked less frequently because I was already just kind of high on life. Though it was regular use for a few months, it was moderated. I would take a small hit a few times a day, mostly because I didn’t really like feeling very high, just getting a small, uplifting, and energizing buzz. I have no familial ties to schizophrenia, I’m the only one. 

At this point, I’m kind of seeing the disease as a blessing, though often times it is very painful and stressful. I see it as an opportunity to reorganize my mind and consciousness, to get a handle on my biological health, and to distill truth and become more inherently stable and less afraid, though a significant part of that reorganization implies and means destruction of maladaptive aspects of who I was and who I am, both in terms of personal psychology and with behaviors, like drug use. 

As far as I know, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders are not necessarily strongly related to genetics. They are more related to trauma and environmental factors, though genetics do play a role. As much as anything, at least from my current perspective, genetics may be more aptly associated with greater overall sensitivity to mental, emotional, and physical stimuli, but at the same time a person’s fundamental perspectives of life and self have a great deal to do with the onset of extreme states. The seeds of perspective and belief, whether emotional or mental, can grow wildly out of control when not addressed or necessarily seen, and those matured plants come into one’s conscious experience in powerful and seemingly uncontrolled ways to let a person know what they’ve been farming, if that makes any sense. Strangely, I’ve come to enjoy and appreciate the opportunity to work on myself and to free myself from belief systems, thoughts, and emotions that were keeping me in states of pain, stress, and limitation. That’s largely been due to work on my own perspectives on life and this illness, and my relationship to experiences like pain/discomfort and mental, emotional, and physical chaos.

I’ve been having quite a bit of success with approaches like dietary changes/ supplementation and psychoanalysis. If you look at literature about schizophrenia and extreme states and the overall perceptions about it from non-western cultures through the ages, there is a much more productive and healing view of it, and people that might today be diagnosed with the illness and effectively outcasted and looked upon as broken were/are helped to move through the experiences, to view them in a productive and constructive light, and the end result is greater recovery, healing, and reintegration with society. Those who have had extreme mental and emotional states were/are often regarded as having something unique and useful to share with the greater society. Not to generalize too much here, but after the reorganization of the mind and emotions has taken place, and new light is shed upon what was effective and harmonious about a person versus what was maladaptive and potentially destructive, the symptoms of schizophrenia become less intense and chaotic if not disappear all together. It is necessary to grow with the experience though, and to not fight it when the ego/ conscious and subconscious mind have reached such a point of instability and imbalance where they need to utilize destruction/ deconstruction to come back into harmony and stability. It is more effective, from my own experience, to try to work with the chaos and try to direct it toward outcomes that are artful and beautiful, constructive and useful. An example of that would be Carl Jung’s own personal experience with psychosis, which he was able to navigate and turn into something he considered very helpful. Other examples can be found with the shamans and holy men and women of both antiquity and modern times. 

The mind, body, and consciousness seem to be constantly striving toward balance and harmony, greater expression, and growth. When a mind can’t grown anymore in the direction it is going, it adapts. When it can’t adapt well because it has become so off balance, it reorganizes it’s foundations, which often times may appear self destructive. All in all, both from the research I’ve done and from my experience, it appears that this disease may be much less rooted in an individuals biology than it is in their conscious and unconscious makeup. Biology does play a part, but it is becoming more understood that a person’s mental and emotional states directly influence their biological states. Things like fear and emotional stress actually cause biological disease. It goes both ways, but getting a handle on one’s emotions and common thought patterns can very much influence their biology. Sometimes a certain amount of disassociation from the mind and one’s thoughts is necessary. It allows a person to analyze what is being thought with less emotional reactivity, and gives a person greater conscious control and choice over what they may think in the future. We are all evolving, changing, creating, and responding to life continuously. I find it fascinating that schizophrenia and psychosis are part of the human repertoire of experience.",1551398522

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Pedphiles are just frowned upon in general. I saw a documentary about a pedophile who is ""inactive."" He's celibate, has no sort of sexual relationship with anyone, etc. He's never had sex with anyone. It's an interesting documentary. He talks about his fantasies. (a super intelligent 7 year old who has legally been granted the right to function as an adult and can legally consent to sex with him, if you're curious.) He doesn't have any sort of porn at all. No pictures, no drawings, no nothing. The only place that content exists is his imagination.

It's a really interesting look at someone who is just trying to exist. But the comments on this video. My god. Shit like ""Fucking pedophile. He should be put in jail for the rest of his life/executed. He's disgusting.""  That's very concerning to me. He's done absolutely nothing wrong whatsoever.

"letsgofish","t5_2sclf","&gt; We'll start again with the lack of free agent signings, the Marlins ranked in the bottom fifth of payroll for 6 of the 8 seasons Stanton played in Miami.

Judging a team based on payroll is ignorant. The core of the team was in pre-arb or in arbitration so thats why payroll was low. Plus if you are hoping for $150 mil payroll you are rooting for the wrong team. Payroll doesnt equal wins, just ask the Rays.

&gt;Firesales and signing free agents

You cant say the werent trying when they signed the top hitting FA, top pitching FA, and a strong reliever FA that just didnt pan out. You cannot predict that. Coming into the Marlins first season in the new stadium everyone thought they would be a winner. Hindsight is 20/20 and those FA's didnt work out.

Hanley, Josh Johnson, Edward Mujica were all trash after they left the Marlins anyway so lets not act like we gave up future MVPs and all stars. How many wins did Ricky Nolasco have after he left the Marlins?

Dee Gordon won a batting title after they traded for him, Dan Haren had a sub 3.50 era in 20+ starts with the Marlins. The team underperformed, how is that Loria's fault? Every year in baseball underperforming teams trade veterans at the deadline for basically nothing, just to save money.

&gt;So what about 2016-18?

The Marlins were fully in it until Staton got hurt, again, and then JF died. They tried to pick up the pieces in 17 but there was no way it was gonna happen. Loria didnt own the team in 18. 

I get it, its easy to feed into the narrative that they werent trying or heading in the right direction to win, but at some point the players need to look in the mirror and say, we had a playoff caliber lineup and just didnt get it done? Everyone is bitter that he fucked over the city of miami with the stadium deal but fail to blame the city commissioners who couldnt read the fucking deal that literally spelled out what was going to happen.",1551398523

I think losing your virginity to ‘the one’ or ‘someone special’ is overrated. I waited (a bit longer than I could have) and had sex for the first time with someone ‘special’. And at the time she definitely was special. But it’s all irrelevant now, as I’m now with ‘the one’, and it wouldn’t have made any difference if there’d been a few more insignificant notches before her. TL/DR: don’t overthink your first time. It’s never as special or important as you think it will be. The real special times are the repeated occasions with ‘the one’, when you’ve actually worked out what you’re doing. ",1551398523

If there is some afterlife experience, I think it's unknowable.

I'm pushing retirement age. I think I've lived a mostly decent and charitable life, although I've made plenty of mistakes. I have a wonderful wife and two beautiful, intelligent and well-adjusted adult daughters whom we didn't indoctrinate with religion. When they were teens, we explained that we thought it wrong to do so, because we simply couldn't tell them that any religion is true. That was a conundrum they had to tackle on their own.

You have something that most people lack which is drive/motivation and if you have the will power to go through the frustration of math, physics and engineering to acquire more crystallized IQ you can surpass some lazy engineers (fable of the tortoise and the hare). now considering the time it will take you more than the average engineering student in learning and eventually you will hit a wall, when that happens choose something you specialize in and get more efficient in it.",1551398524

I followed Dave up the staircase (a bit too rickety for me.) As much as I wished to move out of my cramped apartment in the city, I hated looking for new houses. Such inane work, checking all the rooms, making mental notes about everything good or bad about the condition it was in, dealing with Dave and his stupid fucking smile the whole time... but now that I had just gotten a new promotion, making rent was less of an issue. And when my shitty landlord stopped answering my questions about why the hell there were rats in my apartment, I decided that maybe it was time to move out.

""Bathroom is right in here,"" Dave announced, flashing me his plastic smile and motioning me inside. I stepped into the doorway and looked around. The shower seemed fine, and the toilet appeared to be fairly new, and the countertop appeared to be made of imitation marble. Nothing out of the ordinary, except the mirror. It had an ornate gilded edge around it, and something about it was off-putting...

&amp;#x200B;

I looked into it deeply, seeing my face reflected there. Nothing else... right?

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh yes, the mirror. It's a bit odd, not decorated at all like the rest of the bathroom."" Dave had followed my gaze. ""To be honest, I'm not sure what style the previous owner was going for, the rest of the bathroom being in such a modern style."" I wasn't listening. As I watched, my face seemed to slowly fade away, along with all the other reflections of things behind me. And like a window, I could see that behind this mirror was a snow-covered forest of spruces and pines. And staring back at me was a young woman, simply clad in a gray cloak.

&amp;#x200B;

I slapped myself in the face. Hard. Nope, not a dream.

&amp;#x200B;

""Is everything alright?"" Dave looked quizzically at me. I simply pointed in the mirror, at the forest, at the woman inside.

&amp;#x200B;

""Can you see that?""

&amp;#x200B;

""You mean the wall behind you?"" Dave clearly didn't see it. He looked at me, confusion in his eyes. Dammit, who was this woman? I made up my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

""Sorry, Dave. I think I fell asleep. It's been a busy few days, you know?"" That part wasn't a lie. I had been working late into the night to meet my new deadlines. Dave made some sounds of agreement, but I wasn't paying attention.

&amp;#x200B;

""Dave, is it okay if I used the bathroom real quick? And then let's go see the basement, yeah?"" *Go away, Dave, I need to find out what is going on here.*

&amp;#x200B;

""Sure, no problem. I'll wait for you downstairs."" I practically slammed the door in his face. I knew I wasn't being polite to him, but right now that was the least of my worries. I heard his footsteps going down the stairwell, and I locked the door. Then I turned around and approached the mirror.

&amp;#x200B;

""Who are you? Are you real?"" The woman in the mirror just looked back. I felt her eyes staring deeply into mine, and felt deep... longing? Nostalgia? What was going on? Who was this person? ""Why are you here?""

&amp;#x200B;

The woman seemed to flinch at that question.

&amp;#x200B;

""Are you trapped there?"" What was I doing, talking to what was clearly a hallucination? Maybe the long hours were beginning to take their toll. The woman shook her head. ""So why are you in there then?""

&amp;#x200B;

She hesitated, and then pointed at me. My heart skipped a beat. *Me?* ""I don't even know you. Why would I be the reason you're in there? Are you trying to tell me you're not real?""

&amp;#x200B;

She looked at me, and I could see there were tears in her eyes. She shook her head and pressed her palm against the glass, like a window. Inviting me. I did not put my hand on the glass.

&amp;#x200B;

""Please, tell me what's going on."" The feeling of loss, of pain, in my chest was getting stronger. ""What's going on? Who are you?""

&amp;#x200B;

Her eyes begged me to put my hand to the glass. Behind her, the wind picked up and loose snow fell from the tree branches above. And was it just me, or did I feel a sudden gust of cold air blowing across my skin?

&amp;#x200B;

I placed my hand to the glass and felt myself being sucked in.

The entitlement, I'm telling you what, it's unreal, kinda sounds like my ex actually. Mine actually tried to tell me that the $600.00 a month(I have 3 kids) and providing health insurance (that doesn't cost him any extra premiums because of him being in a union). That he is doing more than his share. Now don't get me wrong, I'm thankful for what I have but he doesn't even get how little that actually is. Also I read in another one of your posts about him demanding to see the kids because you have not visitation order, do you still not have a visitation order? Because, again not sure about child custody in Australia, in the USA not having the visitation order and the boys living with you actually does give you the right to deny him access to them as you are their assumed guardian.

The two biggest things here are your food and your rent.

1.4k is a lot for a single person. Would you consider living with others? It could cut your rent in half easily.

The other option is of course moving further out but it’s up to you.

The 500 for food is again crazy. You split it up in another comment but tbh that isn’t much less crazy. 

Try making some new meals and getting protein from things like lentils that can make some amazing currys and is far cheaper than meat. Subbing a couple of meat meals a week with lentil based ones may save a surprising amount. Also cut down on pizza i guess.

Honestly depending on your job have you thought about leaving london? From what you have described i guess you are earning around 2500 a month take home that is a good salary but if you could earn 2000 a month outside london the difference in rent might be worth it.",1551398528

I refuse to do all the work and take all the blame if her rear gets wet. I lived for 25 years without my bottom falling in when I needed to sit, she could learn to look first.

Assuming you split the work this way, it logically behooves her to be there one to put it down. Her bladder is smaller than mine and she uses it more frequently. Therefore it will more likely be down already and she will only have to put it down after I use it. If she chose for me to put it down, I will more likely gain the benefit and she's will likely have to put it down and then lift it again every time she uses it.",1551398528

I notice you're doing most of your camera work in post- as you advance you'll find this will limit you. Your shots don't have the parallax between foreground and distant elements that it would have if you'd shot it with a real camera, and this will inhibit how real you can make something look.

The next think you should work on is using 3D tracking to create a virtual camera in whatever compositing program you're using. The principles are similar to what you're already doing, but you'll be able to get much greater realism.

Both you and Bob are factory owners with $12 each and employ 5 workers each. You sell apples and Bob sells oranges.  

You produce 12 apples a month and Bob produces 12 oranges a month.

You and Bob pay your workers $2 each and charge a $1 for your products. 

Everyone spends their money on 1 apple and 1 orange - workers use up their pay while you and Bob pay each other $1 for an orange and an apple respectively; effectively swapping an apple for an orange and vice versus.

End of the day, both you and Bob have $12 again and everyone is happy and fed. 

But you and Bob discover automation, fire all your workers and cut production to just 2 apples and 2 oranges. 

You charge Bob whatever you want for an apple, he charge you the same amount back for an orange. Both of you still have $12 each and are well fed with an apple and an orange.

In the case of vaccines, in order to protect those with immune suppression, or are too young to be vaccinated, a certain percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated to prevent an outbreak. When the population falls below that percentage, the entire population is at risk and outbreaks occur, which effects more than the individual that chose not to vaccinate, it then includes those who got the vaccine. 
We are seeing that today in states that have really high exemption rates, and now have measles outbreaks.

Vaccines only truly work if the threshold of the population is vaccinated. 

When people are allowed to opt out it creates a greater chance of an outbreak for the entire population.

"StarWarsLeaks","t5_2vflj","I don’t see how he can lose faith in himself to fix something that he hasn’t even tried to mend. He basically walked in on his sleeping nephew, creeped into the dudes mind, and got caught holding a lightsaber over him. That mistake has nothing to do with his use or abilities of the force, or his role as a Jedi. The failings of the earlier Jedi were leagues different from this experience Luke had. 

Burying his head in the sand is not at all consistent with how he reacted to his failure in the OT that was just as big, if not more so. His reaction then was to immediately get back to work and fix the problem. This character arc doesn’t make sense when applied to this particular character. It also backtracks everything he accomplished in prior stories. 

The payoff wasn’t that cool because he just dies anyway afterwards. If he’s going to do that to buy them time, then they return to him on the island to camp out and there’s the promise for more Luke to actually help them, then that’s one thing. But going through the exercise of worrying about his safety to being relieved his not in danger and not actually there, to just dying anyway isn’t cool. It’s a cheap way to play with the audiences emotions. So basically: the power display isn’t that cool when it’s used for five minutes and that’s all we get of the old Luke before he shits the bed. The point of finding him was to get him back in the game, not buy them a couple minutes to keep running. He was supposed to be secret card in the deck. 

I’m definitely a much bigger Luke guy than I am Rey. In the OT Luke’s struggles were both physical AND emotional. Everything comes so easy for Rey. She’s alright, but the way she pestered him actually annoyed me. Her actions and experiences should’ve pushed him to decide to help her, not her annoying him enough to the point where he wants her to just shut up. She basically found her belonging at the end of TFA. So what’s the point of her arc now? Where can you take her emotional struggle? Luke’s arc spanned the entire trilogy and it was clearly defined as to how he was growing and learning. Kylo is the focal point of this trilogy - and it’s clear that he has the most internal struggle, and his problems are interesting and believable. 

Having the conflict between her and Luke would’ve made better sense for the later actions of the characters. That rift would be a good reason for her dip out and go to Kylo, and for Luke to get back involved. 

Rey didn’t even see Luke when he projected. He never came to speak to her. He didn’t come back to stay and be there for everyone. He came back to basically screw around for ten minutes, say sorry, and give them a chance to keep running. It didn’t help them advance in their struggle in the actual war whatsoever. It basically helped them stay on the road. 

If his death were to change the ride of the war, then he’d have taken some chunk of the First Order with him, or at least changed morale. But nothing changed. The Resistance is still severely out numbered, the First Order has control, and the galaxy is condemned to oppression. Luke’s death didn’t actively change anything, which is why it was premature. 

If all he’s going to do is talk, then that’s something we’ve seen before and doesn’t add anything special to his character. Rian argues that possibilities of Luke as a dead guy are far more vast than as a living person, but that makes no sense. He’d just be doing what all the other ghosts do, which does nothing unique to Luke as a character. 

Yeah, it would be awful if they made him an OP force ghost. But given Iran’s comments, that seems like a possible direction they would go in, which would be asinine. You can’t undermine the accomplishments of everyone else. Otherwise the whole struggle is pointless. 

It’s not that I hate the movie. I really do try hard to like it. There are some good parts. But I just can’t get past my disappointment in it. And it’s not about the film not matching theories or meeting my expectations. My only expectation was that it would be an awesome Star Wars movie, it just wasn’t. This is a fundamentally flawed film, from the plot, to the (atrocious) misplaced humor, and the character developments and timeframe. It’s the exact opposite of the prequels; those are good Star Wars movies, but not good movies. I was a bit of a defender of the film at first, but realized that I shouldn’t have to work so hard to try and justify why some of the decisions made were acceptable. It was not a good feeling walking out of the theater the first time. On repeat viewings, I get more and more frustrated that of all the story opportunities, this is the best that they could come up with. Just very disappointing. Maybe IX can help the perception of this film, but that would be thanks to JJ’s work of delivering on something that Rian couldn’t and wouldn’t necessarily make this a better movie because of what happens next.

What is it about this set that justifies charging double (or more) the price versus those sets? They were deemed to be fine at $4 a pack when the demand was limited to only casual limited, kitchen table, and Commander players. The target audience for this is much bigger with modern legality added. 

  


That's not even taking into consideration the risk of driving up the entry price of modern. A handful of newly modern-legal staples (reprints or new) with low supply and high pack cost could be prohibitive for players.

  


I'm all for WotC making money and being successful. I just can't see how pricing this like they did could possibly be good for the health of modern as an option for players. And if it's bad for the players and/or the format that just makes it seem like a big cash grab.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Again, just because the evidence doesn't exist doesn't mean that critical thinking cannot be taught. You completely ignored everything I said about it being ill-studied and not being selected for as an important focus in our society's education system. And the idea that there is some limited mental potential locked away in our genes is pseudoscience. I used the word potential colloquially in my last response to point to someone who was being accosted by a poor environment and therefore was expressing a phenotype that was not conducive to mental flourishing. We are all universal computing machines and we can run nigh any software that anyone else can on our hardware with the proper installation. That is the advantage we all share collectively as humans. I truly think that if this concept doesn't resonate with you (or anyone) then they've limited themselves in life already and will stay in their little box. 

And you'd be wrong to think I wouldn't push back on your quip about IQ and temperament. IQ as measured by standardized testing can certainly be raised and has been demonstrated time and time again. It is highly linked with short-term memory and this can be *drastically* improved with training. And a person can absolutely learn to change their temperament. Meditation can make a large difference in people's lives here, making them less reactionary and more thoughtful and compassionate. Hell, a *bad* temperament can just be a symptom of something else and can drastically change when the underlying stressors have been removed. The concept that someone is defined as a specific, invariant temperament is bunk. ",1551398533

I'm pretty sure you're the asshole. I used to work with a guy like you, he always had new ideas for ""improvements"" on how to do things. And to his credit, they often *were* improvements! But he would always do them himself, without asking or even notifying anyone ahead of time.

It got to the point where you couldn't rely on him to do simple tasks, because he would always do things his own way and claim it was ""better"".

I get that this guy is not you, but I think there's definitely a lesson to be learned here: if you're not the boss, you don't call the shots. You can make suggestions, you can advocate for your position, but at the end of the day, it's not your decision to make. You're being paid to do what you're told. That sounds harsh, but the alternative is *not* doing what your told, constantly getting into fights with management, and always being convinced that you're in the right.

Bottom line: good on you for having a good idea. But you need to ask management before you make big changes. If that bothers you, better brush up your resume so you can be the boss somewhere.",1551398533

Then consider that he plays the most important position in the league, where there's a great degree of scarcity of two way impact wings. He checks a number of important boxes in a weak draft class, and I'm in favor of gambling on him improving his shooting. You have to take into account the available options in this player pool and the risk/reward; for me, the reward of hitting on a player like that, who has a high ceiling, at a position of high value, outweighs the risks in his profile. 

As far as Garland, my case for him is that you begin from an auspicious starting point of high end ball-handling and shooting. When you have that as your baseline, everything else is workable. ",1551398535

Your English is fantastic. 

It needs thinking out from start to finish. 

Kids are taken into care, and I remember that I read some stats a few years ago about the abuse children receive in care homes. 

The stats suggested that there would be less chance of abuse if they stood on the street and handed out children to random couples, rather than let the children go through the care system. 

While the foster system is good, they need to have a *lot* more trust in people willing to adopt. You've applied for adoption. You've jumped through a thousand hoops. A dozen friends have given references. You own a £500k a year company. You have no criminal record. You are a Governor of a school. You have an empty room in your house. Can you adopt a 3 year old? No.

Let's move that 3 year old through a dozen foster homes until he's 18 when there's no one left to look after him. 

And that's our fucked up adoption system. ",1551398535
"roguelikedev","t5_2si41","I don't strongly advertise it as such, and of course there's always the shooty route which people tend to assume, but in a lot of ways Cogmind is actually a stealth game :P

**Stealthing**

Even if it's not the player's go-to strategy, there are always situations where stealthing it is advantageous--only the most confident of players with the strongest builds would consider outright shooting through every challenge! At one extreme even an entire run can be spent outside combat (one of the advantages of not requiring XP, or even interacting with enemies at all, in order to advance), and there are a lot of features to support this style of play.

Of course the most basic inherent tool is raw speed. Players can create builds that move up to 20 spaces per turn, which is anywhere from 7 to 40 times as fast as most enemies. Zipping through a hostile FOV at lightning speed before the enemy even gets a turn is nearly equivalent to having never been seen. Some enemies might decide to investigate the area in such a case, but as long as the player is long gone by the time they arrive in that area then there's no chase. And of course being sufficiently faster than an enemy means that even if spotted it's not a problem to just run away. So building for speed has a significant advantage here (though of course such a build will be more fragile...).

Speed is more of a stealth-augmentor rather than a true stealth-enabler, though. Stealth is avoidance, and avoidance requires knowledge. Some kinds of player *metaknowledge* can indeed help with stealth--knowing the potential outcomes of moving through certain types of environments or even specific familiar surroundings, but even more important is any knowledge-related capabilities that reflect dynamic or otherwise unpredictable dangers. Dynamic knowledge is especially valuable in procedural maps with a bunch of autonomous actors milling about. Core knowledge of this type includes:

* Sensors: For detecting actors outside FOV, these come in multiple types with varying ranges, and can be paired with processors for getting more specific details about those actors.
* FarCom: A permanent sensor ability that comes with its own advantages and drawbacks, quite different from regular sensors (I did a [comparison chart](https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/gsg-content/uploads/2019/02/cogmind_sensors_vs_farcom.png) as part of my latest [level design](https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/2019/02/level-design-shaping-cogmind-experience/) article).
* Visual processors: Increasing sight range means spotting enemies before they can spot the player, which is great for avoiding trouble, but only works well in open spaces (in tight quarters this won't help :P)
* Machine hacks: Various machines can be hacked to locate all kinds of different bots and squads, either temporarily pointing out their current location or updating every turn. Among these hacks is a more general purpose one that acts like a [sensor centered on the terminal](https://i.imgur.com/DE3hEeC.gif) to reveal any actors moving around nearby. Better terminals have a great range (but are also more difficult to hack). This is a pretty popular hack since it continues operating after the player has left the area, giving a persistent local picture of what's happening in that area.
* Robot hacks: There are a fair number of robot hacks aimed at supplementary intel, among the sensor-like abilities there's the FOV-sharing hack for transmitting back what a robot can see, effectively [turning non-combat actors into mobile cameras](https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/gsg-content/uploads/2018/08/cogmind_robot_hacking_link_fov_multiple_ascii.gif).

Although knowing where enemies are is important for avoiding them, terrain data is especially important since better resources for navigation mean being able to capitalize on fast speed (or even get by with slow speeds!) in selecting alternative routes that are either less likely to be troublesome, or confirmed to circumvent trouble altogether. For example slicing through walls to reach new areas or access nearby rooms indirectly is a very common tactic in Cogmind used to avoid enemies. In this category of tools we have:

* Terrain Scanners: For [slowly revealing nearby terrain](https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/gsg-content/uploads/2014/10/cogmind_terrain_scanner2.gif), like sensors coming in multiple types and also pairable with processors to increase their information density and speed.
* Machine hacks: One of the easiest hacks reveals the map layout of the surrounding area.
* Robot hacks: One of the most effective information-based robot hacks gives terrain and other data--[hacking a patrolling Watcher](https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/gsg-content/uploads/2018/08/cogmind_robot_hacking_map_route_storage_loop.gif) reveals its entire route and everything along that route. There's also the [engineer hack](https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/gsg-content/uploads/2018/08/cogmind_robot_hacking_map_walls.gif) revealing wall structures and hidden doors.

Overall there are many strategic options, too many to detail here, but maybe I'll do a full run-down on the blog at some point. There are ties into pretty much every system at play so that it's possible to do things like recall pursuers, or distract enemies by forcing another nearby actor to produce a false distress signal (for example to get a sentry to leave its post).

Some quick notes on other relevant features:

* Data logs found in certain outlying parts of the world can provide a wide variety of intel useful for stealthing through other areas.
* Visual SFX feedback can indicate where doors are being operated, or where firefights are taking place before they come into view, helping observant players navigate smartly even without access to other forms of sensor data.

**Escaping**

Without specifically a high-speed build, escaping battles already in progress tends to be more difficult in Cogmind compared to other roguelikes. Many roguelikes have consumables that provide a variety of ""escape options,"" but there aren't so many of these sorts of things in Cogmind.

While it's technically possible to teleport out of a tough situations (which uncontrollably sends the player away and causes enemies to lose knowledge of the player's position) this is a rare ability and access/uses are limited, so it's not a reliably method.

The alternative in Cogmind generally requires forethought, being powerful enough to make it through a fight without too much attrition, or carry enough spare parts to rebuild as necessary, or avoid fights in the first place (or at least fights/situations you're not sure you can come out on top of).

As a last resort, a very weak Cogmind that has lost most of its parts actually moves *faster*, and is capable of outrunning most types of enemies. So this is almost always an option, and eventually picking up more parts to rebuild along the way.

One of the advantages to running even while under fire is that firing weapons is *slower than moving*, so it's possible to reposition and find better circumstances (or even escape slower pursuers!) without taking too much damage.

In the end, Cogmind maps generally contain a *lot* of enemies, but players also have a *lot* of tools at their disposal in order to not turn every encounter into a showdown, or avoid those encounters in the first place.",1551398535

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","FR has significant fantasy-historical elements. If you want to run Dark Ages Britain, the Mongol Invasion, or conquistador adventures, there's a place in the Realms to do it. It's also a world of grand polities and powerful magic, mapped out to the tiniest detail. If you want to engage with a living world, the Realms is teeming with characters and hooks left out for you to grab onto.

Greyhawk is pulp fantasy, in the Burroughs/Howard/Lieber tradition. Civilisation is more scattered, less entrenched, and constantly under threat. Magic is rarer and often to be distrusted, as are the cultists of dark gods. It's a very good kind of setting for pure dungeon crawls, I think, because there's a lot of wildness and not much oversight.

Dragonlance is (theoretically) lower fantasy, with the exception of dragons and all their consequences, the better to put the spotlight on them. In practice, it's also a world much influenced by absolutes, and the low fantasy gives way to that a little. There are many orders with strict moral delineations and hierarchies, all the way up to the dragons and the gods. This is if you're really into dragons, raw good vs. evil, or if you're a Mormon with a desperate need to roleplay bringing back the worship of the true divinity through heavenly revelations inscribed on discs of precious metal.

Eberron is magic-punk. While perhaps fewer seriously powerful artifacts, high priests, and archwizards are just hanging around like in the Realms, magic and artifice are more prominent in everyday life. Well-known are the skyships and the trains. Also presented more strongly are political involvement, via House allegiances, and the idea of few races taking any kind of inborn or typical morality. This is for tables looking to stretch to boundaries of what has become standard fantasy,  or that was certainly the intention when it was released some time ago. YMMV on how well that's held up as the years have passed.",1551398535

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Corruption can have worse *effects* from a utilitarian standpoint, but when people are saying or implying that “rape is worse”, they are making a non-utilitarian claim.

For example, someone can do a lot of bad, but in small steps that hurts any individual very little, and without really ever intentionally or consciously harming anyone. Or they can do a smaller amount of bad, but all at once, with conscious intention, and focused on a single individual. The second case could well be considered “worse”, because it takes a “worse person” to deliberately and consciously do all that harm to a single individual in a single incident that causes a lot of focused harm in a very clear way.

We might even consider corruption to be *more dangerous* because of how easily a “not-terrible-person” could slip into it and do lots of collective harm, but it still wouldn’t be unreasonable to say that you think that forcible rape is “worse” because of just how broken your moral compass has to be to actually do something so horrific with such utterly clear boundaries.",1551398536

&gt; SRINAGAR, India - India banned a Kashmir-based Islamist political party called Jamaat-e-Islami for five years on Thursday, accusing it of supporting militancy in the disputed region that is at the heart of an escalating conflict with rival Pakistan.

&gt; India&amp;#039;s Ministry of Home Affairs said JeI supports claims for secession of a part of India, and that if its activities were not curbed, it could cause trouble for the country.

&gt; &amp;quot;If the unlawful activities of JeI are not curbed and controlled immediately, it is likely to escalate its subversive activities including attempt to carve out an Islamic State out of the territory of Union of India by destabilizing the government established by law,&amp;quot; a ministry statement said.

With Hawaii being so isolated, the MIRVs on each missile inbound don't really have anywhere else of interest to go, so they will all be going to the populated Hawaiian Islands. With Hawaii being a major hub of the Pacific Fleet, there will be quite a few missiles designated.

But I think it's worth noting that this racism goes both ways. You'll have a lot of people calling you ""Badawi"" if you are of a tribal ancestry. What's really sad is there's nothing wrong with being a Badawi, but they use it as an insult. Also a lot of the tribes in Arabia are Hadr (not Badawis). In fact, I'll go as far as saying that most tribes in Saudi are Hadari tribes.

In all honesty though, I see that kind of racism decreasing with time especially in the recent years. But it still exists and I think we must acknowledge that all sides are contributing in it ",1551398537

Also, if you were screening an analog signal tape, it was important to see it without filters so you could discern the additional tape noise from standard NTSC-generated noise.

I know some old Sonys would have a comb filter option on/off. Modern Sony PVMs have a filter off by default, but many have the *TRAP 358* menu option, rather than a physical button, where 358 stands for the 3.58 mHz of the NTSC subcarrier signal and TRAP is the trapezoidal gate filtering.

"Rifts","t5_2tlyt","Vampires take extra damage from silver, so that's probably why the PS bonuses aren't supposed to apply there; It's probably meant to maintain ""balance"". PS bonuses shouldn't apply to any damage type except contact (bludgeon\impact &amp; piercing) weapons. PS won't make an electric shock stun any better, nor a Plasma fire burn more fiercely, &amp; poison might not be much more effective just because you stabbed harder with it. Silver acts like a poison to Vampires &amp; some other supernatural creatures, so any strength bonus should only apply to the otherwise unmodified _contact_ derived portion of the damage, not applicable to any bonus damage due to _effects_, such as poison.   
  
In practice, I just take the damage of _any_ contact weapon, add any bonuses for damage type (such as Lighting, Fire, Radiance or Silver), add any bonuses for strength, &amp; _then_ any multipliers. Yes it makes specialized damage types &amp; Physical Strength bonuses overpowered as compared to Rules As Written, but ranged weapons are so (realistically) dominant in Palladium that buffing PS bonuses barely even _begins_ to level the playing field. I certainly haven't had any complaints (even when such damage bonuses were against the players). Stacking bonus damage seems like a good part of the fun, in my opinion.",1551398540

"Hamilton","t5_2reuj","Waste gasification is a well-understood technology. Air pollutant capture and storage (scrubbing) technology is well understood.

Basically these guys want to build a power plant close to the city (probably on the bayfront somewhere for easy access to baywater for cooling and rail lines to import more recyclables when Hamilton runs out). The gasification part is unnecessary (technically) but probably to make the idea of an incinerator plant more palatable. I mean, it probably has some benefits to the process... I would assume it's a form a precombustion pollution control, but I'm not really sure.

From an economic, efficiency and environmental standpoint, these kinds of technologies are absolutely essential if we are to truly get away from fossil fuel usage for power generation. Air emissions from new build industrial furnaces are so low as to be negligible, especially when compared to the kinds of combustion we typically use on a day-to-day basis. This kind of power plant would provide a reliable, clean method for dealing with recyclables and baseload electricity with very low transmission costs as a byproduct.

Don't let the Greenies hear you call it a power plant though. If they do, it will never get built.",1551398540

**Last Pick: 2/26/2018 - ENG CH - 8u on Leeds Utd ML vs Queens Park Rangers - L** Sorry for anyone who tailed this.  Leeds had plenty of opportunities, #3 facing #18 in the league and needing the points and they couldnt even score.  Sticking to the league i watch the most, bundesliga/french ligue 1 games from now.

**Todays' Pick: 3/1 - Bundesliga - 2u on Borussia Dortmund -1.5 (+160) vs FC Augsburg - Starts 2:30 p.m EST** 

**edit: well fuck me sorry guys there goes my POTD bankroll.  Who would've thought Augsburg beats Dortmund for the first time EVER at home lmao...Going to deposit another 10 units in a few days after this weekend.  Dortmund arent champions and god damn they are a mentally weak team.  Thanks for any support - fuck all the haters.  I post to keep track mostly, and think most of my picks provide analysis that at least support a W, just a bad losing streak (Leeds really screwed me haha) - but i'll be sticking with the bundesliga teams that have gotten me solid wins and profit - I'm not making a POTD but Leipzig, Bremen &amp; Frankfurt are showing to be very consistent and solid returns, as is AC Milan and AS Roma, along with Lille in France Ligue 1.  Some teams to keep an eye on.  Sorry for anyone who lost a shit ton of money, it wiped my POTD bankroll out but hey its sports and what are you going to do.  Rest assured I'll be going to a sportsbook tomorrow to likely get drunk and throw irrational money on Tyron Woodley :)  Keep an eye out after the next champions league fixtures.**

- Big loss on my last pick.  Sorry for anyone who went in big.

- Dortmund hasn't been looking like the strong current leader in bundesliga, however I believe with the return of Marco Reus, they mentally will improve back to the form in which brought them to the current top.

- I'm not going to go into my multi paragraph analysis on why i'm taking -1.5 (besides the plus odds), but Augsburg is a bad team and gives up a lot of goals, even at home.  I think the return of Reus is the x factor and they are due for a big statement win.  

- Putting my remaining units on this.  I wouldn't advise tailing if you have doubts, and wait until my bankroll builds back up.

Is it perfect? No, not at all. The Story is pretty basic, the gameplay could be made 200x better by providing a sort of quick dodge, be it a roll or dash, and I'd love if some of the transformations weren't so weird to control. 

But I still believe it is a fun, great game with lots of time you can pour into it if you want to.

And if she doesn't let you guys find out where the money is going, then you both will have to completely cut her off financially. If she's not letting you help her, then you can't do anything for her anymore.

"emotionalabuse","t5_2w5ga","So, speaking as someone who has gone through a 10 year relationship with an emotionally abusive boyfriend/spouse . . . Your reactions here bother me a bit. 

You talk about being supportive but you also talk about how you are trying to push things into positive quickly. To me, it reads a little like a wrecking ram, when he likely needs to process things at his own rate. Trying to force positivity may feel false to him. I would reccommend talking more of a listening approach than an active approach. He has to bring himself out of his shell, and he needs to feel safe and accepted to do it. You shouldn't try to force him out faster - it will likely make it much harder for him. Now, if he asks you to help him in certain ways, that's very different. But still - let him lead the way on the rate and the way he recovers, and try not to lead it yourself. Doing otherwise is effectively trying to control him (even if you have good intentions), which will ultimately hurt more than help. I think you get that already, but I did want to make sure the point was very clear. 

Different people tend to process abuse differently, but I have noticed certain patterns. Have you reas up on echoism or the effects of emotional abuse? If so, I would highly reccommend doing so. 

Here are some quick bullet points of the types of experiences he may be having:

- high sensitivity to any sign of discontent from those he cares about, and likely blaming himself for it (prone to over apologizing)
- difficulty believing positive comments about himself. They may even make him feel worse.
- difficulty reaching out or expressing when he's not ok - he may even feel selfish when doing so.
- periodic recurring memories of instances of negative abuse, which may make him more prone to be closed up or anxious 
- fear of getting closer to you (he might hurt you or you might hurt him) and fear of maintaining too much distance (he might hurt you)
- tendency to sacrifice things/beliefs/opinions in order to try to keep you happy
- strong needs for space
- difficulty recognizing when or how to express certain emotions
- a desire to not be in the spotlight or otherwise made a big deal of
- a recurring negative perception of himself

He may not be struggling with all of those, but I would be surprised if he didn't have some of them. 

What helps with those? In my experience: Feeling like someone will listen without judgement and without pushing change or insisting feelings are wrong. Having someone who can help break down the negative logic that doesn't make sense. Having someone who is very clear and upfront of how they feel, where there is little fear that things are hidden. Having a safe place to go to work things through alone as needed. Journaling is good. Getting positive responses to input, thoughts and opinions is also a plus, but don't go overboard on how positively you respond. ",1551398543

"The_Donald","t5_38unr","Sharia is the legal system in Islam. It is a body of rules derived from Koran verses and historical narrations of Mohammed's life. Sharia trumps all man-made laws, including our Constitution and Bill of Rights. **Muslims believe Sharia applies to everyone, including non-Muslims.**

Sharia is violent, openly bigoted toward non-Muslims, and brutally sexist. It is is explicitly opposed to religious freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, and the free exchange of ideas.  

* Sharia is mandatory for Muslims (Koran 5:48). They are not permitted to pick and choose which parts to follow. (Koran 33:36) 

* Any government that limits Sharia in any way is the enemy of Allah and must be fought. (Sahih Muslim 1:33, and many more) 

* The establishment of Sharia is a fundamental objective of every Muslim. (Koran 9:29)

* Sharia directly violates *at least* our First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Thirteenth Amendments. 

* Large sections of Sharia govern the practice of slavery. Slavery has been a part of Islam since its beginning and is still practiced to this day. The Koran actually devotes more verses to making sure that Muslim men know they can keep women as rape slaves (four) than it does to telling them to pray five times a day (zero). (Koran 33:50, 4:24, 23:5-6, 8:69)

Now how many of you want Muslims in our armed forces, our police force, or our government?

*****
&gt; The United States and the Taliban have paused negotiations in Doha, with the diplomatic push aimed at ending the war in Afghanistan set to restart over the weekend following &amp;quot;Solid&amp;quot; talks between the adversaries.

&gt; The latest meetings follow marathon talks last month that saw the US and the Taliban walk away with a &amp;quot;Draft framework&amp;quot; focused on a potential US troop withdrawal and a pact to prevent Afghanistan from harbouring terrorists.

&gt; &amp;quot;Emerging from three solid days of talks with the Taliban in #Doha. Meetings were productive,&amp;quot; tweeted US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who is leading the American side during the negotiations.

When this happens, the numbers will shift and we'll see teams taking advantage of the cleaner looks from the midrange.  

I don't think we'll ever get to a point where it's solved, because offenses and defenses will continuously adapt to exploit/counter-exploit each other.  If it ever gets to a point where one has a unsurmountable advantage, they'll make a change to the rules in the interest of the game. ",1551398547

“Draft capital” is an attempt to talk about the relative value of the picks.  For instance, as the bears won this year, the number of picks we traded for Khalil Mack stayed constant but the draft capital that the raiders got in return for Mack kept decreasing in value.  Next season, when the bears win the Super Bowl and the raiders are the worst team in the NFL, the Bears will still “lose a first round pick”, but since they get the raider’s 2nd in return, the loss of “draft capital” will only be one draft slot....",1551398547

As for grammar and reading and all that kind of stuff, I think finding a topic (or topics)  you're interested in and reading about them in Chinese would be a good start. 
I've also heard that reading the Chinese editions of books you've already read can be quite useful and not as likely to demoralise or demotivate you since you'll have a good understanding of the plot and characters. Harry Potter seems to be a popular option!

When you get back to SELRES status it will say RD2 ""Reported back to NRA"" NRA is Navy Reserve Activity which just means you're back at the NOSC. 

They can't activate you twice. And when you end your orders you won't be able to be sent off involuntarily for a little bit, called dwell time. You can waive dwell time and volunteer for orders later.

"PrimeiraLiga","t5_39lft","Estás como eu em alguns casos. Não acho que vá ser melhor que o Bernardo mas o Bernardo é provavelmente o estilo de jogador que mais valorizo em termos de características. 

E eu concordo que o transfermarkt pouco vale mas tem jogadores que ao ver que tem aquela idade me deixa sempre naquele ponto de estar a achar que o Félix é um craque mundial (e eu gosto bastante do Félix e acho que ele e o Florentino principalmente tem potencial para chegarem bastante longe) mas por exemplo se me perguntasses entre o Félix e o Sancho/Havertz/Reiss Nelson pá não consigo dizer que o Félix é atualmente tão bom como eles são. O que não o impede de acabar por ter melhor carreira. Da mesma maneira que não tenho a certeza que não haja um puto qualquer a jogar na Argentina/Brasil/país random da Europa de uma liga periférica que não vá ter mais potencial que o Félix.

Quanto a chapada de luva branca concordo e mesmo na B pode ser bastante enganador. Achava que o Galeno era muitíssimo pior que o Gleison por exemplo mas a verdade é que o Galeno tem praticamente assegurado um lugar no plantel do Porto para o ano. Achava que o Rui Pires ia conseguir aproximar-se do Neves e nem perto. Que o Rui Pedro ia ser um craque e parece que puf. Por outro lado nunca pensei que o Madi chegasse sequer perto da equipa B do Porto e está a jogar bem. Há alguns jogadores na formação em quem tenho crenças bastante elevadas e confiança de que pelo menos podem ser opções no Porto um dia mas já se perdeu tanto que não consigo dizer com 100% de certeza que não vai dar. Atualmente ficaria muito surpreendido se o Fábio Silva não der pelo menos um bom jogador de plantel no Porto mas o clube faz tanta porcaria na passagem para sénior que se ele se perder não ficaria surpreendido.

It doesn't bother me per se, but that still means they're setting a precedent for Artificer as a Buddy class.

My big complaint with the last version was that it gave us a companion we might not want, and which would intrude on most character concepts that aren't a House Cannith Artificer with Iron Defender.

I think if there were another subclass that establishes a buddy-free design, I'd be a lot happier, as I mostly want to play Artificers who aren't roboticists/geneticists.",1551398551

One of my female friends even had like 3 kids by the time she graduated. 

It really hurt them financially and emotionally because the fathers generally left them and they had major trouble finding partners afterwards.  I still see my female friend that had 3 kids (5 now) on FB and based on her posts I can see how much she's struggling keeping a partner.  Not to mention these kids did not have a stable father figure in the household.

It also impacted me and other guys in the school because we didn't want to be with a slut, we couldn't trust them and it just didn't feel special.  We had to deal with rumors, drama, etc. it made for a very toxic environment.",1551398552

I really miss MLB 2K, to be honest. I finally got a PS4 and MLB The Show in 2017, and I only played it for a few months. The Conquest mode was neat, but the Franchise mode (which I love) was horrendous. The card game was worse than the MLB 2K offered (without microtransactions, mind you) a decade prior. The motion-based control scheme for pitching was NOWHERE near the quality MLB 2K offered.

Sadly, MLB 2K made a much more engaging set of gameplay mechanics, but their networking, physics, and AI were utter garbage. On the flip side, The Show generally polished things really well, but doesn't offer that fun of an experience, IMO. It's OK, but it misses all of the things I enjoyed from the 2K games.",1551398554

&gt; Beijing has faced growing international opprobrium about camps it has set up in Xinjiang - strategically located on the borders of Central Asia - which China calls education and training centers and many Western countries and rights groups view as internment facilities for ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim peoples.

&gt; China has repeatedly rejected all accusations of mistreatment in the camps and accused Western countries in particular of political bias with their criticisms, pointing out that Xinjiang has won stability with its tough policies.

&gt; &amp;quot;People in Xinjiang are hospitable. A stable and developing Xinjiang in harmony welcomes your visit with openness and confidence,&amp;quot; he said.

Why? Because I don't think they articulate, explain, and argue for their position very well. 

Twitter, YouTube, fine.

But the Oxford Union has its reputation because of the quality of its speakers. 

I believe there's a difference between being selective and being silenced.

&gt;ESPN: You just talked about Cincinnati and Minnesota, and since Seattle joined the league in 2009 nine franchises have joined Major League Soccer. And on the docket right now you have Nashville, Miami, Austin, and yet there's that fourth expansion team. Where are we in that process?

&gt;Garber: You know we've got to make a decision sometime soon. There's no specific timetable, but we need to have that 28th team selected. St. Louis and Sacramento were bidding hard for that remaining spot, the 28th spot. Both have great new ownership groups, both have great stadium plans. We'll get our expansion committee together, get our ownership together and we'll try and make a decision sometime this year.

&gt;ESPN: Is there any way you could see a situation where you see both Sacramento and St. Louis come in immediately?

&gt;Garber: I don't see that happening, but we've broken the mould so many different times and different ways with expansion. But we do think we need to select that 28th team and then figure what, if any, plans we have to go beyond that.


Garber has always listed off cities when doing live interviews.  I wouldn't out much into that. 

But this  prepared interviewed  posted where only sacramento and st. Louis is spoken of for the 28th spot is much more revealing. Particularly the question of if both st. Louis and Sacramento could come together to which he doesn't put a solid no.

"ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM","t5_3o0h8","It might be unpopular to say this, but it's probably because the majority of these 'principled communists' on reddit are white.  As much as they try to distance themselves from it by adopting 'radical' politics that'll make their parents angry, white privilege is real and they benefit from it.

Deep down, they know that, the worse things get, they will be spared the brunt of it.  They have the luxury to scoff at reforms because it won't really impact them if things go south.

Say a candidate makes it a major part of his campaign to target 'illegal immigrants' and call for mass deportation.  Why should they care?  ICE isn't going to come into their neighborhoods and terrorize their families.

Say a candidate supports raising the minimum wage.  Does it matter to them?  Not really. They've got college degrees.  Minimum wage increases would vastly help women, particularly women of color and single mothers, but why would they care?  Just tell those women in poverty to cross their fingers for a spontaneous revolution instead.  These guys read leftist literature all day about gender equality and the liberation of the sexes, but I bet most of them don't even help their own mothers by taking up their fair share of household chores at home. 

I'm sure secretly a lot of these white communists would rather people like Trump stay in office in hopes that it'll drive more people towards socialism.  If they don't get to play the role of a white savior, then what's the point anyways, right? ",1551398555

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Hey man. I had a gf that sounds similar to this as we barely did it, and openly talked about it it being an issue, but never found a resolution.

It wasnt until i aged and realized that I cant compare her strive for sex to mine, as I can get it up anytime and anywhere.

In hindsight, the biggest issue is that my ex didnt feel loved, I failed to give her the attention she wanted, I did very little as to making her feel beautiful and supportive of her self reflection. I honestly was too blunt. For the most part I always tried to initiate with just sex, no kissing or anything and that is obviously not a very healthy way to make love. We actually broke up due to these very reasons. 

Advice: Treat her like shes the center of your world. Dont have to go overboard, but give her constant attention whenever she seems to want it, spoil her, be the best bf you could imagine yourself to be. Im not saying your the issue, but if this is in anyway sinilar to what ive experienced, this can definitely be remedied. She sounds like a woman who requires the right stimulation.  Give that 2 weeks or so then just plan a date night and run the bases, and dont skip any.  Hope this helps. ",1551398558

Stankey's statement contradicted the fact that HBO had been consistently profitable over the last three years, totaling nearly $6 billion, while allocating more than $2 billion per year for programming. Stankey also stated that HBO would have to find a way ""to move beyond 35 to 40 percent penetration to have this become a much more common product.""

You want to see what Bernie has actually done?  His record is public.  He had been in Congress for decades.  Try to find a single example of Bernie actually working on fixing any one of these problems after the camera turned off.

"ottawa","t5_2qpoo","She needs to be treated with a lot of patience and compassion right now. Even though she wasn't physically injured, she has been traumatized - and she is at a very tender age. 

Remember that oftentimes people's reactions to trauma don't make sense from the outside, but it is all part of processing her personal grief. Do not punish her for drinking, just acknowledge it and address it with compassion - it's not the problem, it's a symptom.

Forget the job interview and forget trying to get her to change her clothes. Just treat her kindly and gently - take care of her as if she were physically sick. Nurture her. Tell her you aren't angry and that you don't judge her. Work plus school might be too much for her right now... perhaps suggest that she just focuses on school and taking care of herself at the moment, because you know she's going through a lot.

If she will allow it, just be with her tonight, preferably one on one - maybe put on a show she likes, give her a cuddle and a cup of hot chocolate... tell her that you notice she's been drinking and ask her how she's feeling. 

Share some of your feelings about the traumatic incident, and ask her if she ever feels a similar way. It might help her if you open up first. Ask her if she has any questions about her mom. 

Afterward maybe offer to draw her a warm bubble bath and tuck her in at night. Offer to launder her clothes so that she has something clean and comfy for the next day. Baby her a little bit... she needs a parental (especially mother) figure right now. Kids often regress a bit when under extreme stress, so keep that in mind if you see her acting a bit immature for her age - it's normal. Don't punish her for it - it's a sign that she needs extra love and care to feel safe right now. She will come along in time.

Set aside a regular time for just you and her to do something together - go for coffee, something active like skating or skiing, a music event, dinner and a movie... something to help you bond.

Share with her the [Kids Help Phone](https://kidshelpphone.ca/) resource (she can instant message them too if a phone call isn't appealing) in case she has some things she'd like to say in private... You both also might be interested in reading [this book](https://www.amazon.ca/Cant-Get-Over-Handbook-Survivors/dp/157224058X) about processing different types of trauma. 

Good luck and take care. You will both get through this. &lt;3",1551398560

Don't forget Jared's trip to the Russian embassy. 

&gt; Jared spoke with Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak in early December of last year about setting up a ""secure communications channel ... using Russian diplomatic facilities"" in the U.S., according to the report&lt;

Just trying to set up a back channel with the one country whose relationship with us has been so perilous, we've had a direct hotline in the White House for nearly fifty years to avoid Armageddon. Of course we monitor all comms going to and from the Russian embassy even the ""secure"" stuff, but who knows what other arrangements they've made.

That singular piece of information would have doomed any other presidency.

Like I said, a corporation still needs a functioning government. And I trust neither.

&gt; They follow laws but only to the point that such profits are not in danger. 

That's only true for the corrupt ones. In most cases the business just fails and/or goes into bankruptcy, and the people running it have to figure out some new venture to start. Breaking the law is not always people's last resort.

&gt; If the local government does not have the funds to support a  firefighting force and cannot increase taxes enough to support them, why  would a private entity invest in a firefighting force that is clearly  not going to garner any profit? 

I don't fully understand what you're asking. Most local governments can't just increase taxes much without voter support. Taxes are the only money that pay for government services. The rent, utilities, paychecks, everything will come out of taxes. Whereas a commercial business doesn't rely on that at all, it can rely on investments, loans (personal and third party), sponsorship, and whatever business plan they put in action, either billing the local government for service at a nice low rate, or perhaps royalty income through whatever innovations they might be pushing.

&gt; interesting that you're using SpaceX as an example considering there is  ever increasing doubt that they will be able to turn a profit.

I'm still anti-EU, but my position has changed from it's an evil Union to it's run by ineffective/corrupt politicians. 

Personally, I understand why a European union is so appealing, but a confederacy that large is impossible to achieve as intended. Thus it's gotten bogged down into what it is now, so some nations want out, but it's making that as hard as it can for them. It'd be nice if everyone tried to work together in Europe, but although Europe is small, it's essentially the same as all other old world continents, and that kind of dream won't come true peacefully.

"OccupationalTherapy","t5_2s8kc","Parents insisting children have sensory issues when it is 90% behavioral is sadly a regular occurrence for pediatric OTs. 

Here’s how I address it. Take a look at the challenging behavior - maybe it’s that the child can’t sit still in class. Now try to determine if that stems from a sensory need for movement. In many cases, maybe it does. So now try some sensory supports and check the student’s response. You added theraband to the chair legs, gave the child a cushion, movement breaks. Does the child sit more still now? Then you can say that the issue is likely sensory driven. 

Now look at another behavior like biting. The student bites another student. Did that behavior stem from a sensory need or a social emotional one? My instincts say social emotional. Otherwise you would see the child biting inanimate objects like pencils or clothing. Biting a peer is an form of aggression. Not sensory. To prove your point you can give the child a chew toy and see if the peer biting behavior stops. If so, great, everyone wins even if your theory was wrong. If not, then the issue isn’t sensory and you need to look at other pathways to address the issue. 

I try to gently explain to people that while sensory may seem like the right answer, spending time following this road, if it is the wrong one, only hurts the child as the true cause of the behaviors go untreated and become entrenched. 

Anyway, check out Sensational Brain webinars on Is It Sensory or Is It Behavior for more in depth ways to tackle this issue. ",1551398563

Who Ronda was in a world of legitimate fighting is entirely what brought her to WWE and it's still *almost* entirely what her character inside WWE is as well. 

I would argue it would definitely be more *interesting* if Ronda's comebacks didn't invariably smack of a kid on the playground getting beat at a game and getting all 'this is stupid, I'm not playing any more!' But I'm also not sure what the alternative is, given the role she's playing. 

I think it's more akin to disconnecting the other player's controller. Where Ronda goes Becky can't really follow her (which I suppose pushes some people's buttons but also, peak-Russo was twenty years ago so whatever, most people get it,) unless she's going to double down on how shitty and embarrassing Ronda and Browne are as humans.

Secondly, doesn't that either describe a dumb or weak god?

I completely agree with the god of the bible being incostent with a loving god, that doesn;t exclude a non-loving god who wasn't above manipulation and lying to try get peopel to believe he is. We know from other verses in the bible he is perfectly willing to lie and manipulate.

&gt;But it’s also littered with myth, legend, mistakes, contradictions, and cultural interpolations. I think even Christians like myself should be able to admit that.

I agree, it does leave christians with another choice tho, that of being a literalist, and whatever god says or does is de facto good and moral.

And that sucks! It sucks that some people just give up their dogs like they weren't family (they are family! You and I both agree 1000%) and it sucks that there are some people who have to give up their pets due to life circumstances they just can't get out of and who can't live on the street in order to keep their dog (like being a woman in most cases, or having a job that you need someone to watch your dog while you're at work for if you don't have a home). It sucks.

And I wasn't talking at all about ""preferred residences"" like you indicate, but rather people who have no cars and need to rely on public transportation who don't have the luxury of being able to live wherever too-- and these places closer to public transportation are of course more competitive in a highly competitive market.

Absolutely, absolutely their pets and living situation should be considered before adopting. Absolutely no one should be dumping a pet at a shelter unless there's extreme circumstances (health, divorce, job loss, death, etc-- circumstances that should have exploring done before the final giving up happens).

But sorry I wasn't clear-- I was trying to give extra information about rentals, not homeowners at all, and maybe increase some understanding why someone who rents may not choose to adopt a ""restricted breed"" due to landlord/property management insurance, not to deter from homeowners adopting them. I don't think we're in disagreement, I think we were just picking up non-matching parts of what we both had to say.

Really the only reason I would want to own a house at this point is so I could adopt the heck out of a bunch of dogs who've been waiting at the shelter too long. :(",1551398564

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No offense taken. Worry not. 

I am 49. So not a boomer. But my parents were I guess being born in 1935/7.

I and them have never thought of millennial's as entitled. Maybe them both coming from extremely working class backgrounds has something to do with this. My Mother was an adopted child from the old London East End before it was gentrified and my father was a 'Northerner' from a poor Yorkshire mining town. 

If you read my post I clearly state I think the 'kids' (of whatever generation after me) are  being dealt a very poor hand.

I think I was the last of the older generation and the start of the newer more tech savvy generation.  

People born in the very late 60's up to say late/early 80's straddle the generational gap between the post ww2 mindset and the 'millennium' mind set imo.

My generation were perhaps the last to be in a position to be able to relatively easily own a home as long as both people in a relationship were earning an 'average' wage.

I am not bitching about the kids here, I think its a problem of parents of somewhere around my age (I am not a parent , I am gay) so I am purely an observer in this.

But I do see parents today aged perhaps between 25-35 as being part of the problem. The 'Helicopter' parent mind set. I see it in my own siblings with their kids to some degree. I have 5 brothers and sisters.

You bring up good points about trades. It is sad to see the denigration of them. The lack of apprenticeships is not a good thing. 

We are seeing the results of this within my own countries manufacturing base. The lack of people wanting to learn (perhaps not being made aware of is equally to blame) hands on engineering and mechanical skills is very obvious. 

There has been far to importance placed on the mighty Degree. And in the process it has become effectively de-valued as 'everyone and their dog' has one now.

I think again my age group was the first of their generation in which the idea of university education was pushed really hard. In the UK in the late 80's and early 90's there was a massive .gov sponsored push to get kids into Uni's , often studying more and more useless and pointless topics. 

Much less emphasis on Maths/Sciences/Language and more emphasis of 'social' and 'arts' Degrees which are all well and good but for the most part useless 'in the real world'.

I was also probably in the last of the people in my own country (UK) that benefited from paid for by the state university education. 

The amount of debt the young today have to suffer in order to pay for their education both in the UK and the USA is borderline criminal. The increasingly insane costs of living in any City , living and paying rent also has not helped their situation.

Having to start life with that size of burden can do nothing but put you on your back feet before you even get a chance to get started in life.

Honestly you have my sympathies , I do not have any answers sadly. Not sure anyone has. Except perhaps ensure your generation do not continue to make the same mistakes mine has and the ones before them.

Education really imho should be free for all. There is really no excuse not to have an educated populace. Surely it for the benefit of all?

My musings on the topic anyway. I certainly am not blaming the kids though. They are always powerless int this scenarios and purely the victim of circumstances beyond their control.

I myself have equally as much frustration with politicians in my own country who are all 50+ a lot of them in their 60's and they also display this 'olde worlde' mindset.

It is deeply frustrating so I completely understand your perspective.

Not all us old farts and duffers are arse backwards.

Just a lot , sadly.

7 oz. chicken thighs  
2/3 cup fiesta corn  
1 cup cooked brown rice  
1.5 oz. queso blanco  
2 large peppers, halved and scooped out

Super easy one - sauté the chicken thighs in a bit of oil until browned, add the corn and sauté for a few mins longer. Remove from heat and mix together with the brown rice and queso. I added a bit of lime juice during this step. Divide the mixture between the 4 peppers and bake for 20 minutes at 450 degrees. I saved and added a tad more cheese for the end and broiled it for another minute or two to get that nice brown crunch.  
  
Serve with avocado and salsa verde!

One hospital, upcharges patients 4x for the drug. high dose cost? $49,500 - so what's the insurance/patient getting charged? $200k. We projected most doses would be at this cost as, with stroke/hemorrhage often the patient cannot communicate with you to tell you when last dose was to verify which dosage you need. Patients' families are often useless. This stuff actually gets requested a lot, and we deny it, alot.

That said. It does move. They may have decent earnings. They also have their own anticoagulant molecule, betrixaban which was recently approved too. I've spoken with their reps a couple times. Biggest problem I, and other HCPs have with it are: 14% mortality rate (or something similarly high) within the 30-90 days after administration. We use QALY's in health economics to see if drugs are ""worth it."" It stands for Quality Adjusted Life year. QALY's are generally worth $50k. So about 15% of the time patients are getting 1/12th of a QALY for $200k? NAH. Also patients experience thrombotic events after use and there are questions on its pharmacokinetics and then re-anticoagulation afterward. You can argue, pro-thrombiotic patients are going to clot, and I'll say yes they will. But these guys with AFib would normally throw emboli up to their brain and reinfarct if they clot based on anatomy. These patients were throwing DVTs and PEs.

"ArtFundamentals","t5_332tq","I've got bad news for you, Michael. I know you had your heart set on harsh, brutal critique, but unfortunately I cannot provide that. Reason being, your work here is fantastic. There are just a couple things I'm going to nitpick on, but by and large you've really nailed everything I look for in a student's lesson 1 work.

* Your super imposed lines, especially the straight ones, demonstrate considerable confidence behind every stroke. You're not sacrificing flow to achieve a more accurate stroke (although you do slow down a little with the curves and waves, resulting in a wobblier line, but that's quite normal and not my focus here), and so you generally maintain a very consistent trajectory.
* You carry this over into the ghosting exercise where your lines maintain that confidence but demonstrate a considerable investment in the planning and preparation phases. You don't hesitate at all as you execute the mark, and your lines are clean and straight.
* As the exercises get a little more involved in the planes, you don't show any sign that you're devoting less time to each individual stroke. They're all just as well planned, and demonstrate considerable control. For most of them you either stop exactly where you're meant to, or quite close to it.
* Throughout this lesson you'll notice that confidence of execution and planning beforehand (rather than slowing down while you execute) is at the core of everything, and this holds true for the ellipses as well. As a result, your ellipses maintain their overall shape integrity, staying quite even and avoiding any deformation or stiffness. As you continue to practice, your accuracy here will continue to improve (I see a couple of places where the ellipses fall outside of their bounds, or don't quite touch those bounds to fit between them snugly, but they're infrequent), but you're already a long way ahead.
* For the most part, you avoid the common pitfall of deforming your ellipses to get them to fit snugly within the planes.  That is the primary focus of this exercise - to maintain their shape integrity and get them to touch all four edges. There's a couple places where you've missed the edge contact a little bit, but by and large you're doing well. Eventually - and this is several lessons away - when you're introduced to the later half of the cylinder challenge, this exercise will expand further, and will gain more requirements, but until then, keep up what you're doing.
* If I really wanted to nitpick, I would point out that your ellipses seem to get just a little bit stiff when you hit the funnels exercise. This tells me that you're not quite as confident here as you have been with other exercises, and as a result you're hesitating slightly as you make the mark. I see this a lot in the upper left corner of the page, along with a few other spots.
* Jumping ahead to the rough perspective boxes, you've done a great job of being mindful of the behaviour of each line before you draw it - that is, keeping your horizontals parallel to the horizon line and your verticals perpendicular to it (except towards the bottom of #4 where there's visible slanting to those lines). Of course, I'm also pleased to see that you're applying the double checking method, and as we can see here while there's a bit of a range to where your lines converge with the horizon line, it's actually quite limited and I don't see any that are really going way out. Nicely done.
* Fantastic work with the rotated boxes. This exercise, along with the organic perspective is more about exposing students to a different kind of spatial problem they may not have otherwise considered, and as such, it's meant to be very difficult and I don't expect most to succeed. That said, you've done a great job here, and have nailed the major points of the exercise. That is, you kept the gaps between your boxes narrow and consistent so as to eliminate any unnecessary guesswork, and covered a wide range of rotation on both axes. You didn't *quite* hit the full 180 degree arc, but you came quite close. Just be sure to tuck in the far edges of those boxes at the extremities a little further, so less of that face is exposed. The rotation here should be quite steep.
* Now your organic perspective boxes work is closer to where I'd expect it to be. You've done a great job of ghosting through each and every line, and are beginning to develop your understand of 3D space. I say that it's closer to what I'd expect in that there is still plenty of room for improvement - especially when it comes to getting your sets of parallel lines to converge more consistently towards their shared vanishing points - but this is totally normal, and something we will continue to work on next.

I'll go ahead and mark this lesson as complete. I'd like you to move onto the [250 box challenge](https://drawabox.com/lesson/250boxes) as your next step.

As for your questions:

1. It certainly does feel a little more awkward to draw smaller circles from your shoulder, because you end up moving something much larger to yield a very small result. That strangeness can certainly make it seem difficult, but you will get used to it - at least enough for it not to be a problem anymore.
2. It's understandable that having another mark closeby will add to the pressure you're experiencing, since accidentally crossing it will yield a more obvious mistake, rather than if you were just drawing on blank paper. Now, I don't think you need to do anything differently - your results speak for themselves, and you're doing fine. That said, it is the ghosting method that is meant to help with this, in how you split up the process of actually putting the line down. You think (and as a result, get nervous) when you plan and prepare, ghosting through the motion, but you always **must** commit to the stroke the second your pen touches the page. If you don't give yourself the room to hesitate at this point, then even if you're nervous beforehand, this will allow your muscles to take over and drive the mark home. Hesitation comes from overthinking - so make sure the moment the pen touches the page, the thinking stops. Ultimately what's the worst thing that'll happen? You'll make a mistake? So what - there are plenty more lines to draw, even if you mess up a few.
3. Yeah - in order to keep the homework submissions from overwhelming us, as well as to ensure that students give each lesson as much time as it requires to be beneficial (and keep people from just rushing through). It's also to keep people from working through everything on their own, and then submitting that work in quick succession, as this would make the critiques themselves a lot less useful. I'd recommend really taking [this warning from lesson 0](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/3) to heart. It talks about not focusing *all* of your time drawing strictly on learning and improving your skills. Students who do this frequently do so because it's a lot easier to follow a lesson plan or an exercise, and they find themselves relying more and more on that structure, and less capable of breaking out of it and just drawing something for themselves. Think about what you would draw if you were the most skilled, proficient artist in the world, and draw it. It may not turn out well, because you may not be ""ready"", but it doesn't matter. You've got to get used to drawing for the sake of drawing now, as this is a skill in and of itself. Far too many students come out the other end of courses with well developed skills but no idea of how to go about applying them, or what to apply them to.

I hope that helps clarify things.",1551398568

“Baby, sometimes people are mad and they’re mean to you. But it’s *NOT* your fault. Grandma is mad at mommy and daddy right now so she doesn’t want to talk to you. You need to stop calling out to her when you see her and wait until she talks to you. You know mommy and daddy love you so much and won’t ever treat you like that. How grandma is treating you right now is not ok, it is wrong that she is being mean to.”

I don’t remember exactly what I said but I told him it’s not his fault and basically asked him to not talk to her if he sees her and she will talk to him when she’s ready (about a few weeks later). 

I don’t really care about birthdays/holidays. My parents (and siblings too) were always abusive to me and neglected me my entire life. So they’ve never really celebrated my birthday and they’ve never celebrated holidays either. I’ve eventually learned to not expect anything at all from anyone on my birthday or holidays and that way I won’t ever be disappointed. 

I thought since MIL goes out of her way to celebrate this girl she would have at least tried to do the same for me, but nope. Never.

Ok not a crime case but when I was doing my Masters, my dissertation involved surveying for slow-worms, (c[ute little legless lizards](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bEP8AbrVbCY/maxresdefault.jpg) that live in the UK and some of mainland Europe that don't really do much, not rare but no one knows how many are around because they're quite elusive and hard to track since they don't really do much other than burrow, eat slugs and occasionally pop up) to survey for them the easiest thing to encourage them up is to place pieces of felt or corrugated iron down as they will bask under them,

We had two sites, one a small, private site where a relocation had taken part (They're a protected species so if they show up when you want to do building you have to mitigate) and the other was a few patches in a woodland which was our 'wild' site. So on a visit to the woodland I'm walking around with my project partner and the supervisor. My supervisor notices some of the sheets he placed is missing. We notice a group of people have set up camp (Which actually you weren't really meant to do there) and he asks 'Have you seen any sheets of metal lying around?' 

Them 'Nope, not seen any'

He found the missing sheets right there, piled up for their campfire and how can you tell they belong to us?

1. It's random pieces of metal in a woodland meadow which you know isn't a typical sight 
2. They are placed in a specific order 
3. They are spray painted with numbers ",1551398568

"ledgerwallet","t5_35ity","As another redditor commented, this should have been pushed way more heavily and should not be a pull. I'm pretty damn sure that there are _many_ ledger users out there who have not updated because they have no idea how serious this bug is.

My advice is that you push out another mailing and/or social media message where you make it more abundantly clear that 'this update is not like the others' and to implore people to update. I am sure you realize that the average internet user gets snowed under with all kinds of updates and very few people read update notes very diligently. Especially when 90% of the announcement is about other stuff and no details are given except 'critical vulnerability'. Much like how people don't really read terms of agreement. I don't think you can expect every one of your customers to read through it all. You could be more pro-active in this and actually stress it.

If It were up to me, I would have put 'CRITICAL UPDATE' in big bold bright red letters at the top of the announcement. That would've worked better than a single one liner somewhere in the middle.

But hey ,it's your choice. I'm updating so I'm all fine, and I really don't care. I'm just saying, maybe you should feel a little more responsibility in this matter to ensure that your customers don't come knocking and complaining a month or two from now because their funds got stolen 'cause they lost track of crypto in the bear market and they stopped checking everything daily (which does not seem like an unlikely scenario at all to me)

When I say conservative republican I mean conservative republican. Girls couldn’t sit next to guys unless they were married, girls had to wear skirts or dresses (think the Duggars), homosexuality was a HUGE NO. The whole 9 yards. 

Those same people who would condemn and bash on others for their actions are the same ones I see sharing these types of pictures. They find a way to justify actions they would otherwise condemn because he is the president. I feel the level of hypocrisy is insane.

So (imo here) they pair very well together. Also Miliam's large burst happens on break so using Berwick to chunk down the bar while waiting for break for Miliam might not be a bad idea as well.  

From my testing so far she can almost half bar or even 3/4 bar a Boss when buffed and under break with Berwick.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","There are a few good points, but overall I'm not a fan. In basically the order I remembered things while writing this;

1/2 spellcasting is great, cantrips are great, actually giving the people who are masters of magic the ability to know a decent amount of magic is always a plus.

What is the artificer meant to do in combat? From what I'm reading they don't have many options aside from cast a cantrip, then use their bonus action for their subclass feature. The alchemist doesn't get special potions any more (which were weak, but at least flavourful), and the 'artillerist' (is that seriously the best name they could come up with?) Gets slightly better cantrip wands. Arcane armament implies they're meant to be attacking with a weapon (either naturally magical or infused), but they dont have the hit dice to safetly mix it up in Melee, and the only real ranged weapons they can use are crossbows with loading, making the extra attack useless. They have very few active combat spells, and don't have the spellslots to use them regularly anyway. Playing a class designed to just cantrip each round feels pretty bad to me, especially since they don't even get a potent cantrip like ability.

Speaking of subclass features, did Wizards basically just hear all of the people complaining about disliking the mechanical companion and sugfesting jt be a seperate subclass, then just give each subclass a smaller mechanical companion it relies on to do basically anything in combat? Also they don't scale at all, the other problem a lot of people had with the previous mechanical servant.

The level 18 ability is literally just the level 2? Ability from the last artificer, but limited in the level of the spell, and repeatable. Is that worth putting it as the second last ability of the class? Imo, no. Honestly this imbuement ability seems like it'd fit decently well as an infusion.

The copying magic items infusion, replacing the crafting ability of tje previous version, seems like the best infusion to take most of the time. Imbue one or two characters weapons, the just make a bunch of items. Maybe know resistant armor for if you're about to fight a dragon.

There's several levels where they just don't get anything. No spell slot levels, no subclass feature, nothing. This is something specifically avoided in literally every other class afaik, but an artificer hitting 7, 11, and 15 gets 1 more infusion known and a spellslot for a level he already had access to. The closest comparison I can think of is Warlock invocations, and there is no level that one of those is considered sufficient for a level. This could have been used to put in a subclass feature, they have as few subclass features as full caster classes right now.

Preparing spells like clerics or druids is an interesting choice. It makes the class more versatile, as you can tailor your spell list to the day by tinkering in the morning, I like the problem solving feel of that.",1551398570

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I agree that ""non-quantitative methods are common in the humanities"" but I disagree about your reason, namely, I don't think ""strawmen"" are to blame here. 

The following is based on 4 years of TAing for Physics 101, Stats 101, and Psych 101 - there is a sorting effect - namely, people who believe themselves to be strong in quantitative fields study Physics/Chem/Bio because ""that's what quant-heavy people do"". Conversely, people who believe themselves to be weak in quantitative fields enter the humanities because ""that's what quant-weak people do."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Of all the classes in the Psychology department, the class that the most people struggle with, is Stats 101, because so many of the students entered the field specifically because they believed themselves to be weak in mathematics. 

&amp;#x200B;

Based on this, I would contend you have your causal chain backwards - it isn't that humanities drives people away from quantitative analysis - instead, it is a belief that one is weak in quantitative skill which drives one to study in the humanities department. ",1551398572

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Don’t move in with him! Move to him, but not in with him. It’s obvious you aren’t ready yet. You can find an apartment share with other roommates. You’ll probably have to sign a lease with them, but finding a sublease is not impossible if you really want to avoid signing leases. And you won’t have to worry about breaking up with your roommates anyway. 

If you do eventually move with him, make sure you choose a two-bedroom apartment. That way, if you break up, one of you can stay and the other one can find a subletter to fill the empty room. 

Another thing that can help is, when you eventually move in with him, make a roommate agreement. How is rent split? What happens in a breakup? What’s the easiest way to break a lease if necessary? Etc. Personally I think in the case of a breakup, if one person moves out and can’t find a subletter, both exes should split the cost of the empty room in half. Example: your total rent is $1000. You each usually pay $500 per room. But then you break up. He stays and you move out, but can’t find a subletter. He should pay his $500 still, plus $250. You pay $250 even though you aren’t living there anymore. This way one person isn’t stuck with paying double rent at the old room and for their new room. It’s more fair. 

Think about all these things and plan ahead. Don’t move in with him until you have a plan that you feel good about. ",1551398572

I'm extremely sensitive to smells, and certain smells that would often be unassuming or tolerable can make me nauseous. 

Loud noises tend to upset me, though I can typically listen to music that I enjoy at high volumes, sometimes even that makes me feel like I'm going crazy though. 

I can only sleep with certain bedding and I cannot sleep in clothes. I don't even like laying down in clothes and I'm weird about what clothes I wear. Gentle touches are also an absolute no for me. If something or someone touches me, it needs to involve a decent amount of pressure or it really bothers me.

Then there is food. I actually have some fruits and vegetables that I like the taste of, but the texture of them literally makes me throw up. I can't help it. People give me shit for being picky, but I'm not picky because I like having a limited diet, it is legitimately a pain in the ass on my part. I just react very strongly to tastes and textures.

He goes head long into fights and accurately headshots everyone. Every fight is close quarter and he literally goes from one target to another target in a tenths of a second.

Just because you play the game one way and cannot comprehend how to play offensively doesn't mean your way is the only way and its certainly not down to luck.

I'm not even a pro myself but I try to improve my reaction times and my ability to predict enemy movement (yes you can predict enemy movement). If I throw myself into the fire long enough those skills I mentioned will become refined. Just like any other skill in life. I didn't get my degree by staying home and doing nothing, I pushed myself and got better at my studies.

This is not meant to be a sit by the side with a sniper gun camping everyone out. Sure you can do that but so many of the games features are oriented around fast paced close quarter combat. It's a reason why there are more close range guns than there are sniper guns.",1551398576

"FuckYouKaren","t5_5r98w","Not that I'm suggesting you do anything shady or underhanded, buuuuut.... Depending on where you are you should be old enough to open a bank account if you go in person, maybe even at the same bank. You do this and you don't put your mom on the account and you don't tell her obviously. Then at work you get new direct deposit forms and you can usually elect to have your paycheck split and sent to different accounts. Obviously this relies on you having direct deposit anyway. Now, if she checks your paystubs or anything she'd see that, or would see that you're suddenly making less. If you don't think she'd notice then I'd start small, 20-50 bucks at first, see how it goes and never, I repeat, never spend any money from that account. That's your emergency money or your savings that you control, but if you start spending it then it may raise suspicion if she checks your balance and things don't add up. The nice thing is that once the money is in the account she can't technically force you to move it and she won't be able to access it. However this brings with it a whole set of other familial issues so tread very carefully. 

Like I said, I don't actually suggest you do this unless it's right for your situation and you know and can deal with the consequences, but there is a way to get your money out of her control.

Do you think he would be interested in historical weapons and warfare?

There are plenty of people that surf that don't choose to adopt the stereotypical surfer persona. 

Weed is the same way - it's not the weed itself that causes people to use certain lingo or live a certain lifestyle, it's the person who identifies with or wants to belong in that community/culture.

"MurderedByWords","t5_3hx3r","Blockade of Prefrontal Opioid Neurotransmission

As discussed in the previous section, a functional disconnection of the prefrontal lobes from the rest of the brain is associated with a loss of placebo responsiveness. Interestingly, in recent years this notion has been supported by the deactivation of the prefrontal cortex in the experimental setting. On the basis of previous experiments on the blockade of placebo analgesia by the opioid antagonist naloxone (see, eg, Amanzio and Benedetti, 1999), Eippert et al (2009a) conducted a study to investigate the location of naloxone action in the brain. By combining naloxone administration with fMRI, these researchers found that naloxone reduced behavioral placebo effects as well as placebo-induced responses in pain-modulatory cortical structures, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. In a brainstem-specific analysis, a similar naloxone modulation of placebo-induced responses in key structures of the descending pain control system, including the hypothalamus, the periaqueductal gray, and the rostral ventromedial medulla, was also found. Most importantly, naloxone abolished the increase in coupling between the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and the periaqueductal gray that was induced by the placebo. Therefore, as it occurs for prefrontal degeneration in AD, placebo analgesic responses are disrupted by the pharmacological blockade of prefrontal opioidergic functioning in the experimental setting.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

For context this person used to be one of my best friends. We were roommates for awhile and he was a great buddy. 

He had been dating this girl for over 4 years when this first started happening. I was away for school and hasn't seen him I awhile, and when I returned for a visit he told me.

He had cheated on his girlfriend with another woman multiple times. This woman happened to be married to someone his girlfriend knew. He ended up getting this married woman pregnant, and he and her split the cost for an abortion. He then basically cut contact with the woman and his girlfriend has absolutely no clue that any of this has happened.

This guy is friends with most of my friends. They all like him better than me. Him, his girlfriend, my other friends etc. are all part of one big friendship circle. When he told me this story I got angry with him, told him we weren't coop anymore, and basically don't speak to him anymore. 

I told one friend about this story and he agrees it's fucked up but he told me not to tell anyone. Neither of us have seen this guy around anymore but we've seen his girlfriend once and it's clear they are still together and that she has no idea.

I feel like telling the truth would be like dropping a nuke in this entire circle of friends, especially since it has been almost a year since he told me this story.

"adultery","t5_2sjkv","One thing that I have noticed is that with SO there is always ""routine factors"" that degrade the sex experience. With AP you don't know (and doesn't matter) if they like having their clothes folded in a particular way or that they didn't wash the dishes before leaving home in the morning. With SO these things tend to come up when you are having sex.  Sex with AP is more focused because there are little or no every-day factors interfering.   


If you ask SO to ""toss your salad"" and they say no, this might play in your mind when they ask you to do some chore that is completely unrelated. With AP, if they say ""no"" then that is about it.  Plus it is much easier to dump your ""non-compliying AP"" than to dump your SO for the same reason.

I'd wonder about the loss of nuance there, if I'm voting for 2 yeses and one no, would I be more likely to give that second yes a no, knowing that I wouldn't be helping my favorite the most? It'd be cool to see the numbers of how it plays out in practice, specifically regarding people voting honestly to their beliefs and preferences and being less likely to try and vote strategically. I can easily believe that approval voting is better than both what we have now and RCV, so I wouldn't stand in its way. Range Voting does seem more robust to me, though, and I don't mind a larger ballot in order to achieve that, if necessary. Seems like we could do it cleverly without a much larger ballot anyway, though.

Caveat: I'm not an expert in this subject. I'm a layman with a decent sense on systems and design who was recently introduced to it. I was supporting RCV about a month ago, and only recently heard of this stuff, and only quickly researched it. I certainly don't claim to know the definitive best solution. ",1551398581

Yeah 2cb reacts differently to people, more so than most drugs.
Imo 35-50mg, a nice happy buzz and good visuals. Probably best not to go over that if you haven't done it much before.
If you're after something less intense, and if you're gonna be in a club with lots of lights etc then people say anywhere from 10mg is enough. (Although personally I don't really seem to get the effects in a club, works different for all)
Something to bare in mind is whether you've eaten or not, skipping dinner and taking can make visuals so much better, so I'd recommend that, and you won't need a dose over like 35mg.
The 2cb subreddit has a lot of great info. Have fun! ",1551398584

The way our voting system works is that it uses voter preferences to eliminate the worst candidates until one candidate gets over 50% of the vote. Two party preferred just displays the result of the last step, but it does not mean that other parties can't be voted for, or that other parties will never be considered if they get enough votes.

Our current system is actually much better than many parts of the world, because you can actually vote for the third party you like the most, giving them support, a chance at winning and election funding, while still being able to choose between the more likely candidates to win.

I walked in and put the hoagie in my jacket, picked up a fruit juice, went over to the cashier and attempted to pay for the juice. There were no points on my card. A lady came from the back and asked me if I was going to pay for the sandwich and I asked her ‘what sandwich?’

“When the cashier swiped my card, she told me I had no points left and put my ID card down on the counter. I wanted it back, because our meal points are on it. When I attempted to get the card back, I grabbed the cashier’s wrist and took my card from her hand. That’s when she started hollering and making a scene. I got my ID card, I took the sandwich out of my jacket and the fruit juice and put it on the counter and went back to the dorms. I really didn’t think anything was going to come of it.”

I think the ending was meant to set up Alucard being able to sympathize with his father, to know the fate of being alone for centuries and robbed of any joy in his life. This will set him up to finally differentiate himself from Dracula down the line in how he chooses to react, which is what we'll see when they cover SotN.

One was of the way she was dressed by a random Twitter user while the vast majority of right wingers thought it was completely idiotic that that person did that.

The other was of her staffer eating a hamburger a day after AOC said people should really stop eating hamburgers, which was completely justified. It's also funny how Ted Cruz and other Republicans literally get chased out of restaurants by angry left-wing mobs while the entire left tries their hardest to ignore it, but somebody taking a picture in a restaurant of your new thought leader and her comrades being hypocrites is somehow the end of the world. 

Is that all you have? Pathetic.

&gt;Also, it's pretty telling that these people can support a guy like Trump but find AOC's few gaffes to be just a bridge too far. At least she has some actual policies.

Some actual policies like ban airplanes and renovate literally every building in the U.S. within ten years? That's only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to her absolute stupidity. The dolt doesn't even know how taxes work. She celebrated Amazon not coming to New York because she truly believes that the 3 billion in tax cuts could now he spend on public transportation.

Because you say you don't understand it, but you do. The reality of the situation is if someone didn't know what poly was and then got to know a poly man (in general, not sexually or romantically) they're less likely to make preconceived judgments about him upon finding out he is.

Everybody has a role to play on this earth. Why were we given free will? About that I don’t feel confident enough to answer, although I have my suspicions. God isn’t judging us solely on our belief in him too; good Muslims will burn to cleanse them from evil and nonMuslims will go to Heaven for the good they’ve done.

They produce waste which lasts for 10s of thousands of years which we do not know the best way to dispose of. 0% of the worlds nuclear waste sites are considered permanent storage and there have been many leaks. It will be expensive to build out this containment infrastructure and could be dangerous. Especially if we want to have this technology be a primary energy source then developing countries have a long way to go, and by the time they arrive it is likely that some other option will have passed nuclear for the best option, nuclear plants take a long time to build. Also, even though nuclear is carbon free, it is not renewable, granted i believe the earths supply of uranium is set to last for a couple hundred years, i dont know if that is taking into account a massive ramp up in production. Lastly there is potential for disaster which in most cases is so low it isnt worth talking about especially when coal already spits out a lot of radiation in addition to other toxins and pollutants.

"startrek","t5_2qixm","Samaritan Snare is incredibly bad.  


It was so bad that according to  *Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages,* it inspired the writers of the 3rd season episode *Tin Man* to write their episode.  


Writer *Dennis Russell Bailey* said:  
 

&gt;*The point at which we became serious about trying to write a script for the show was about five minutes after watching 'Samaritan Snare,' which in my personal opinion was the most abysmal piece of* *Star Trek* *ever filmed. My objections to it were that it always resorted to idiot plotting to make the story work, and that offended me a great deal worse than some of the awful shows which were done on* *the original series**. I thought the way in which it was plotted and the way it was dealt with was an insult to the intelligence of the people who watched the show and the actors and characters in the show. None of the plot could have happened if all of the characters hadn't suddenly became morons that week.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""Someone must have been aware of how hokey it was, because they wrote obvious questions into the script which they chose not to answer. For instance, before Geordi beams over, Worf says explicitly to Riker, 'Do we have to send them our chief engineer because they have a little problem?' and it's never answered. If you don't want to answer it, don't bring it up. Another thing that is stupid is Deanna Troi comes on the bridge and says to Riker, 'I don't sense fear or confusion. Geordi is in danger. Bring him back,' and no one even responds to that. They simply act as if it wasn't said. On the trip over to the starbase, where Picard and Wesley have this long heart to heart talk, Wesley says why would anyone use a defective heart transplant. That's a minor point. A major piece of stupidity is they send him to a medical facility where it turned out that no one was qualified to handle the operation if it went at all wrong. I can't believe they expect viewers to be so stupid as to not ask about that. The fact that the routine was repeatedly said, throughout the show, to be an absolutely routine procedure and when it went wrong, it went wrong for no reason that was mentioned, except that it had to go wrong to have the climax. Then it turns out they have to call the* *Enterprise* *to bring Pulaski over to do the operation because she's more qualified and the people there weren't*

While it doesn't seem to have offensive content, it offends the viewer's intelligence so much that watching it is painful.",1551398591

"IdleHeroes","t5_3fzsh","&gt; I'm definitely not attached to my aura, just thinking that 10% HP and 8% attack on my Valk and Sig is going to be a bigger deal than my 2 weakest team members

I definitely agree that HW and Belrain (regardless of level) are 2 very good support/fillers on a team with an E3 Sigmund and E3 Valk. So I can understand your sentiment of just going for a redemption aura with a random fortress+light hero.

&gt; I'm orbing heavily in Abyss lately because it seems like the best way for me to progress long term

Yeah I thought this some months ago as well, but not anymore. Abyss won't become better untill you have at least 2x E3 Skerei and will first be definitely better when you have 3x E3 Skereis. That's a total of 21 copies. There's a far way for that. Copies of KB will only be beneficial for PvP and Kroos is fine at 10* and not even the best possible support anyways.

Also, with the addition of heroes such as Horus and Aspen I feel like abyss has fallen a bit. Personally I think a team of: Sigmund, Valk, HW, Vesa/Bel, Horus, Xia/whatever seems a lot better than the abyss team you'd be able to make within the same timeframe of getting copies of those heroes. 

&gt; However if I'm building Vesa and HW (I think you're right, I should build towards Forest SL) it makes sense for me to take FS to 10* in the mean time

Personally i'd say you should only 10* FS for the sake of having a 10* fodder ready for when you need it for Vesa. I personally am of the opinion that you should only build god tier units (or units with a purpose, such as vesa) beyond 10* and FS is not a subset of those two scenarios.

&gt; but I have no regrets building Belrain up some. She helped a ton for a while and is still contributing to my current team in fights where Vesa dies before round 3. I've only got 1 copy of Aida and it's going to take me *ages* to ever build her.

Had you saved up HS for the event or were you luckier with RNG then you'd be crying right now :) Thus, I recommend never to ""waste"" resources on L/D unless you're certain you can build them. If you do decide to save resources till the next L/D release (which surely is the most optimal playstyle) then you will be crying if you cannot progress that given hero due to the lack of resources which were spent elsewhere. It's just a tip and a cost-benefit analysis of immediate vs long-term power boost.",1551398593

&gt; House Republicans spent the past few years - when they were the majority party - eschewing oversight of President Donald Trump and his administration, and instead holding hearings into such topics as social media and campus censorship of Trump supporters.

&gt; Until the beginning of January, the Republicans held a majority in the House and therefore controlled the agenda for committee hearings.

&gt; During the Obama administration, Rep. Jordan served on the Benghazi Select Committee, a Republican-lead effort that cost about $7 million dollars and held 33 hearings over more than two years into a topic that had already been investigated by seven other Congressional committees.

"reddeadredemption","t5_2rn7o","Here's my issue with your point about the daily challenges. Rockstar stated that this update heavily focused on griefing and preventing it. That's fine if it's for a random bug fix update, but they centred their first big update to the game on griefing. So what do they do? They are ""content"" that promotes griefing by telling people to kill At least 5 people a day. How are you working against griefers when you give rewards to people for using explosives on horseback? Sure, they can go to Showdowns for it (I doubt anyone will do this) to avoid griefing, but most ended up just riding around and using explosive rounds or arrows on anyone they happened across. Rather than going somewhere with an ongoing battle to easily pick up those kills, you force people to hunt in the wilderness for their kill. And then tell them to do it multiple times.

I bought the 13 gold emote solely because there's nothing else I want, And I earned all of my gold bars through easy methods like he Teddy Brown mission or saving the gold Rockstar threw at us. I'm not going to waste it to make my guns partially gold like everyone else already has. So while I don't like a single price tag on any item they've introduced (who knows what the ""Coming Soon content will cost) I didn't feel bad buying it. The funny part is that they want people to spend money, and think reducing hunt profits and slowly releasing minimal bits of content will do it",1551398594

"AskDocs","t5_2xtuc","Hey, I'm very sorry for the delay - I've been extremely busy the last couple of weeks. OK so first off, thanks for all of the extra info. Apologies for the delay, it took me a while to find some time to wrap my head around all of it.

1. Not necessarily - usually that finding is indicative of increased vascularity for what could be any number of reasons, but it certainly raises the possibility.
2. Yes, it is possible, but usually not with sarcoid. Will come back to this later, I may have something for you.
3. As above.
4. As above.
5. To me, yes. The histology of the lung findings is still not fully consistent with sarcoid, and as you correctly mentioned the fibrotic lung damage would usually be irreversible.

However, I do have something you may want to consider or put to her current care team. Firstly, I should preface this by saying while all technically possible, this would be an extremely rare presentation. It's more of a thought that occurred to me when you mentioned cyclophosphamide than anything, but I did do some digging for you.

Has anyone mentioned Wegner's granulomatosis in your wife's differential? I know her ANCA was negative, but while that is strongly correlated it's not totally exclusive.

**For:**

* Most significantly, Wegner's can often present initially exactly as in your wife, with non-specific pulmonary symptoms that eventually lead to fibrosis.
* More significantly again, in the vast majority of these cases, **cyclophosphamide + corticosteroids can induce remission in most patients, which is exactly how your wife was treated.**
* Wegner's has been known to cause peripheral neuropathy, which your wife suffered from at one point.
* It can cause secondary Reynaud's as you described due to its effects on peripheral vasculature.
* It could theoretically cause placental abruptions due to vascular degradation, which your wife suffered.
* It classically effects the upper respiratory tract, which could explain the sinusitis your wife consistently suffers from.
* Brain involvement is rare and I couldn't find any data on the histological appearance of neural Wegner's BUT lymphocitic infiltrates are seen on some Wegner's biopsies in other organs - roughly 50% of cases present with non-specific leukocytic infiltrates histologically as seen in your wife's brain biopsy.
* It classically also affects the eyes/ears, which could explain her vision symptoms. It's possible some of her other symptoms could also explained by its known sensory effects causing a weird presentation of vertigo (clutching at straws a bit maybe, admittedly).
* Rituximab, which alleviated her symptoms to some degree is actually indicated for treatment of Wegner's in some cases.
* The variable, diffuse &amp; transient nature of her symptoms could best be explained by a non-specific vasculitis like Wegner's.

&amp;#x200B;

**Against:**

* No renal involvement. This is the big one - the vast majority of Wegner's presents in the kidneys, or at the very least progresses to the kidneys pretty quickly.
* Negative ANCA. Highly indicative of some form of vasculitis, but not exclusive.
* Eye involvement in Wegner's is usually in the form of scleritis or conjunctivitis, rather than hemianopia, but hemianopia could be due to degradation of ocular blood vessels.
* It would be extremely rare for Wegner's to present as early as childhood.
* No evidence on chest x-rays. BUT if she went into remission when treated with cyclophosphamide and was on corticosteroids/immunosuppressants during these scans, it's possible they might mask it (bit of a stretch again).

&amp;#x200B;

There are some criteria for its diagnosis, but it's hard to tell if she fits them. I assume she had a chest x-ray(s) when her initial pulmonary symptoms started, do you have the exact results of those? Does the persistent sinusitis have accompanying discharge? Does she suffer from mouth ulcers? Has she had any other biopsies performed?

I have to go to great pains to point out that this would be an extremely unusual presentation with extremely rare complications of an extremely rare disease. That said, it's not impossible or totally inconsistent with her symptoms. I honestly had to think hard before even mentioning it, because as I said before I don't want to infringe on your current physicians but equally it's something it would be quite easy to forget about - it was only the mention of cyclophosphamide that put it in my head at all.

"Warframe","t5_2urg0","Your MR doesn't matter really. There usually will be 1-2 Chromas to carry you through a fight. However here is a List of things that have most to least priority for having interactive fun with Profit Taker:
  
- Have a Frame set up that doesn't get instablasted by the massive amounts of outgoing damage. Inaros is a classic as he doesn't need Forma or a specific setup. I personally took Oberon with a Phoenix Renewal setup. Cookie cutter is Chroma of course. I don't really like playing him but you can double your credit payout with his 4 skill.  

- Have a loadout where weapons spread out their damage types to cover a lot of the shield weaknesses. Personally I use Arca Plasmor (Cold, Rad, Corrosive) Catchmoon (Impact, Heat, Magnetic) and Redeemer Prime (Gas, Electricity, Blast).   
  
- Set up your Arch Gun for RADIATION. People seem to mostly go for Imperator Vandal, Corvas and Fluctus.

Your Operator setup doesn't really matter in this fight as your AMP is only used to switch damage types of the Profit Taker shield. Pimped out Void Dashes help however in speeding up your movement.",1551398596

It is logical to fear being replaced or being less important or whatever else is the root cause here (more help there from *The Jealousy Workbook*), especially given the constant cultural pressures towards monogamy.

Double majors can be great but finding a career/job that fills in two different niches can be difficult especially since a lot of the course work for these majors do not coincide. Another thing to consider - most people change their major, and there's majors you aren't even aware of that exist that might better suit your education needs and personal interest. I came to Pierce dead set on being a chem major since I loved it so much in high school, lo' and behold I somehow got into Political Science...something that I had very limited exposure to as a study in high school. Just be open minded, understand your interests may change, and understand the amount of work associated with double majoring.

Someone ran an article on it last season and it's not even close. 

Early 00s was a period where a few players had a very attractive game, and that's what it's often remembered for instead of the overall ugliness with which teams played on offense. People back then would complain much more about the state of basketball than they do now.

PT Distinction - Beast of a software but unattractive. They are coming out with a new app though. Does too much to list. If you want to automate free trials, create a course, have it integrated with your website...it does a shit ton.  Has nutrition options. 

Total Coaching - pretty, easy, and functions well. Easy to use. You can customize activities, demo videos, etc. The app doesn’t have push notifications yet but it will eventually. I use this one. Has nutrition options. 

My PT Hub - this is the cheapest. Great if you have a brick and mortar location, additional trainers, need a schedule, etc. Be aware of their cancellation policy though. Some angry trainers out there because of it. Has nutrition options. 

Train Heroic - your go to if you coach athletes and groups. Not a lot of bells and whistles but is amazing at that group.

"cmhoc","t5_356s4","Mister Deputy Speaker, 

I stand to wholly endorse this move by our Prime Minister to restore the credibility of our institution that is the Prime Minister's office by helping restore for him a properly functional and usable residence on an official basis. An action that was marred in partisan dispute to the profound loss of Canadians for too long. 

Many other nations use the head of governments residence as a symbol of the power and collective will of their nations and communities. Almost ubiquitously 24 Sussex and the White House are the symbols of our closest allies Government. It would be incorrect to say that 24 Sussex is such a residence for our Prime Minister, but what it ought to be is a symbol of the tradition of longevity for our institutions and that of the prime ministers themselves. 24 Sussex is a proud residence that I believe many Canadians can understand to be something of a fixture in our government mechanisms, it should be where informal cabinet retreats occur. It should be where the Prime Minister plans strategy and it is where if needed a Prime Minister can raise a family while also serving in his role as admirably as only they can. 

I am not arguing for this just because my boss would be the one who lives here, I am arguing for this as this is a duty we have neglected far too long. 24 Sussex falling into disrepair is an indictment of our lack of concern to preserving institutions in this nation for far too long, and I believe the fiscal investment in creating a livable symbol of power in Canada would go a ways to eventually attracting tourists and again a defining badge of office so to speak for our Prime Ministers. 

I will be voting in favor of this motion for the aforementioned reasons as well as simply believing in the long term we will save plenty of costs in assuring every 4 years that the arrangements for a prime ministers quarters need not be adjusted for moving in or out depending on the results of the election of residencies across Ottawa.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Was a Federal copper for a short time of my life. There was arson in a GP's surgery at Sydney KS Airport. It was a wooden duplex and beside it was a 2 bedroom dilapidated house with a dude living there. He was quiet, reticent, didn't know what happened. 

Mind if we go into your place to see if the fire has spread onto your property. He raised the Sgt's suspicions as he wasn't interested in talking to police, tried to stop us going inside his house, and was a weird, creepy sort of guy. He had the 2 large front windows covered up from the inside. Not really he said, which wasn't a no so we went inside. The front door could only open to the extent you had to slide in. Behind it was a mound of wrapped up newspaper. Everywhere. He spent his time wrapping up his shit in newspaper, the cat's shit in newspaper and I think his rubbish in newspaper. As for urine his cats pissed all over the place. It wasn't over powering just a bit rank. There was so much of it, it reached to almost the ceiling at the walls then came down to head height at the track through to the next room. 

I remember the Sgt coming to the conclusion after talking to the guy he thought he lit the fire so as to keep people away from his house. Called the Health Dept, Mental health professionals etc.

Bonus. From the burned out GP surgery, Sgt found a vagina spreader. It looked like two shoe horns with a connecting thread. Sgt took it home, polished it up and got a little plaque made up for it. He presented it to a Sgt he didn't like in an impromptu ceremony. About 20 of us had gathered round, beers in hand (Fri arvo) Sgt whatever, I award you this for your dedication to duty and ability on the job. It was the vagina spreader with the plaque saying ""Cunt of the Year 1986.""",1551398602

*****
&gt; A biographer of President Donald Trump said that the commander-in-chief&amp;#039;s tax returns would show that he &amp;quot;Has the lifestyle of a billionaire, but he doesn&amp;#039;t have any kind of wealth.""

&gt; The remarks from Johnston, who wrote The Making of Donald Trump and It&amp;#039;s Even Worse Than You Think: What the Trump Administration Is Doing to America, followed claims from Trump&amp;#039;s former lawyer that the president had inflated his wealth.

&gt; Critics and journalists have questioned Trump&amp;#039;s claims about his wealth, and the president&amp;#039;s resistance to releasing his tax returns has fueled speculation about what the financial documents will show.

Here is a copy of the original post:

I’m looking for $100 to be lent to me, if anyone could be so kind. I have never posted here before but I can assure you that I have intentions to repay the loan.

My girlfriend has been feeling depressed lately and I’d like to take her out for the night to try to cheer her up. She means a lot to me and I want to be able to take her out and go bowling, see a movie, get dinner, etc.

I will repay you with 25% interest for a grand total of $125 repaid by March 15th, 2019.

Thank you for reading.

 -Demand is through the roof for their stationary batteries but they can't make enough of them because the cars are taking all they can make.

-Margins are thin on the 3 so it doesn't make sense to build hundreds of thousands of cars with hundreds or thousand+ dollars in batteries on spec.

-Didn't they stop making software locked S's? (I'm not totally confident about this one).

It just doesn't make any business sense. So when trying to logic out why the weight is listed the same on the website, you can choose an option (software lock) that many people really really want to be true but makes virtually no business sense, or something else. 

Between those two options, I've got to go with something else. At which point I try to think of the most plausible reason. And it wouldn't be the first time they had the weight of the car was listed incorrectly.

As someone who originally planned to get a SR and really hoped it would be software locked, I hope I'm wrong. As a shareholder, I just hope they're making the best business decision.

There are a fair number of steam engine enthusiasts in your area operating engines that require soft coal for good performance. You might be able to do even better than Anthracite if you can hook up with them and find out where they are getting their soft coal from. 

Similarly, there might be local hardware stores and garden centers that sell bulk coal on the side. These are ideal for coal supplies because they usually offer multiple sizes of coal- Nut Anthracite will work better in a forge than TSC's Rice Anthracite because the bigger lumps are easier to fire with and not as prone to flinging hot sharp shards.

"trashy","t5_2uao3","I'd say that's a side effect of the system we have. You enter service with the knowledge that your customers hold sway over your income and our tipping culture is a social contract that most recognize, if not agree with.  

It has also fostered the level of service we get here because of the same reason.  Being really good at serving, in theory, should equal more money made so there's the motivation to go 'above and beyond'.  It might be better for customers to go to a set wage but with minimum wage what it is I would fully expect the quality of a lot of sit-down restaurant service to decline appreciably if that happened.  Both because that motivation is gone and those who are really good at it will look for other employment that isn't quite so draining.  Burnout is a real problem in the industry.

Personally, if I know I've given great service and get stiffed it's very demoralizing.  I start going over the whole experience and worrying about how I failed.  Because that's what a stiff symbolizes to me, a failure at my job that I strive to be very good at.  That just adds stress to what can already be a very stressful job.  There are plenty who will say it doesn't bother them, and maybe it doesn't.  Customers never seem to announce beforehand that they don't tip either so it seems that they want the quality of service but don't want to pay for it.   ",1551398606

It has nothing to do with comparing this year's rates to last year's.  What in the world led you to the conclusion that it did? 

""2.6 + 2.9 + 3.0 + 3.1 = 11.6 / 4 = 2.9% average seasonal growth when compared to period of previous year.

There we go we found where the 2.9% comes from!"" - you said this.

That's not where the 2.9% number comes from.  And it is clear you have no idea what you're talking about.   Do some independent research and try and be informed on a topic before you start lecturing.  

We haven't had a full calendar year of 3% average growth in over ten years.  People can skew the numbers however they want, and apparently even Trump supporters will tow the line here.  But find one Obama year averaging 3% growth - go ahead and look.  Trump already accomplished that.  Very impressive.   ",1551398607

And he was profiled because he was involved. They gave an image of Obama treating him almost like an equal, someone he trusted both as an advisor and as a lead, while he humbly and loyally knew his place as number 2 like Watson or Robyn. And this dymanic, where both parts appear to go farthee than necessary to produce productive teamwork enforced this idea of working together for change. And the Obama admin was good at that.  There's much to critisize about them being progressive socialist enough, but they managed to get a lot of shit done despite a GOP majory for most of the presidentship and they did so without pulling all that those hustles that Trump and McTurtle, and really everyone in the GOP at this point are doing.

I really think a more progressive candidate would be better for the country, and I dont think you could find more suited candidates than both Bernie and Warren. Picking between those two is a luxury problem. Yet I get why people rally behind Biden.

How long will you have?

What do you want to see most?

If you really want to see the northern lights, for example, there's no chance in summer because it doesn't really get dark.  For hiking you're going to want summer.  June to August, basically.

The state is huge... if you cut Alaska in half, Texas would be the third biggest state... so knowing how long you have will determine whether you have time for the longer road trips between Anchorage and Fairbanks, or up to Homer, that sort of thing.  If time is short I'd say Anchorage area with a day trip to Seward for the sea life and a quick hike to Exit Glacier, maybe pop up to Talkeetna area if it gets clear enough to see Denali.  If you have longer, you might consider renting an RV.

I kept it intentionally vague but in a way that didn't sound life-threatening, and ended up telling a few key team members that I was dealing with a health issue that was manageable but required a bunch of doctor's appointments. I referred to retrieval as a minor surgical procedure that I would need the day off for, but it was something that could only be scheduled 36 hours in advance.

I was lucky in that the office was a quick 30 minute commute from the office, and my clinic's monitoring hours started at 7:30am. So at least the brunt of the appointments didn't affect anything. ",1551398609

Well, this is a topic on which I have had several long debates so I feel compelled to add my two cents. 

Democracy is not a flawed concept, but it is a highly advanced form of governance. Before democracy is introduced to a country, the country must be mature enough to be able to handle it. Sort of like you don't let a minor decide for himself whether he can drink or drive or marry, his/her parents decide but once he reaches an age of maturity (although arbitrarily decided)  we let him make his own decisions. Similarly, we should have nurtured our country under a different sort of government when the British left and slowly made the transition to democracy.

I have many many more arguments &amp; reasonings behind my above statements but I don't want to post a wall of text here and distract from the main topic. If anyone would like to discuss this in detail, I would be happy to take it up in private messaging or make a separate thread.

Disclaimer: I am in no way advocating against the idea of India. I love my country and PKMB. The above is just a philosophical construct and obviously, it has no basis in reality.",1551398609

But know also this : people have educations, life experiences, habits, that shapes them in a way they won't see those things as the same way you do : you see it as a symptom of something ugly inside this guy, but that's not so simple. I have an old female friend, who i only discovered last month was often stealing little things in the supermarket. I was surprised, but i know her enough now to know it's not a symptom of her being a selfish asshole. She just grew up in an environment, a family, a surrounding, where supermarkets and stealing meant something else than it does for me. And which makes her see her act in another way than I see it, or not as bad as I see it.

So i would say : of course stick to your feelings on that, but also maybe just talk to him about it. Like, casually : ""i would never do that, honestly, it makes me weird to see someone do it"".

So how do we expect people to function without living in areas of the country where this is not viable?

I guess we will agree to disagree, if you have a weapon designed to kill, you should be obligated to take training for it. We do this for our military and our police force, the citizens should be no different. Work for universal gun training, but if you have a gun, take a class. It's not the ideal solution to have to pay but it is responsible, and will go to a lot of showing goodwill to the people that think you're fucking crazy for walking into a Chipotle open carrying. BTW, I could go into my back yard, drop trousers, and take a dump but it's unnecessary, weird, and if people see you they'll probably just label you an ass.

The chance of non normally distributed numbers appearing becomes exceedingly more rare the more they deviate from a normal distribution.  The chance that 36 sevens in a row appear is extremely rare and not mathematically proven.  As you get more exaggerated, it becomes even more questionable.

Said another way:

There exists a theoretical series whose digits are so repetitive that if PI contained it, PI would not be considered normally distributed.  This would certainly change our understanding of PI!

But a random series as described in your link?  That is also in line with our understanding of PI.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish there was a blanket-answer I could give for this question.  Against some characters, jumping is always going to be an issue because their jump-ins are so good (ibuki, necalli, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

One thing you should try and establish is how to deal with jump-ins, specifically how to maximize anti air damage with your characters.  One thing I do as Necalli is go for walk unders into trip guard BnB combos.  That generally puts the opponent into a terrible situation, the corner, so I'd encourage you to try that with you main.  Any walk under punish with a medium is normally sufficient.  Punk used this exact same strategy to make GF at evo two years ago.  Watch the set between him and Tokido and pay attention to how punk deals with jump ins.  Tokido makes a really smart adaptation to deal with it too.

&amp;#x200B;

"VRchat","t5_32s02","Windows Mixed Reality is pretty cheap and doesn't require a lot of space or use satellites for motion tracking. If you just want a HMD and hand tracking WMR is perfectly viable. People are saying Samsung Odyssey is the one to go for, but I got a Dell Visor as that was a cheaper option for me. As I've never bought into VR I valued WMR as an entry-level option. If I had the money I would buy StarVR for the massive FOV and buy the Steam Knuckles controllers, but WMR is currently an acceptable experience for me, and I don't feel the need to spend more for just one game.

I would encourage OP to do their own research and test the HMDs and Motion Controllers in brick and mortar superstores that specializes in consumer electronics (in the UK we have Currys PC World) or go to events where you can test people's setups on a couple of different games (EliteMeet in the UK is one but any big gaming expo or indie showcase is likely to have one).

One downside with WMR specifically is that you have to look at your hands for them to track, but it's not an issue which affects my experience significantly compared to both the Rift and Vive (and I have used all three). I don't have the tech specs to hand but IIRC WMR has a better resolution compared to Rift CV1 and Gen 1 Vive HMD, so WMR will look better in terms of screen-door effect and this makes a massive difference if UI elements are small in games like Elite Dangerous.",1551398611

"CatAdvice","t5_2sn56","I was 14 when my 17 year old cat passed. It was harder for me than when my other cat (got her when I was 8 and she passed at 18) died. I think that maybe the second time I knew how bad it would feel and I got a lot of that grieving out of the way while she was deteriorating, but it still took (and is taking, in the second one's case) years to stop feeling very sad at the thought of them. So it's okay to be sad and to still be sad for a while, let yourself grieve. 

It's especially hard to say goodbye to the friend you've had since the day you were born, and I'm sure she feels a special connection with you too. But remember that they don't know how short their lifespan is compared to ours. As far as she's concerned, she got to spend her entire life with a family who loves her and she's going to feel that love right up to the end. You have given her a great life and you'll (hopefully) give many other cats great lives too.

Hold on to those wonderful memories with her. You'll still be telling stories about her 15 years from now because something will remind you of something funny she used to do, maybe. She'll show up in your dreams and it might be incredibly sad at first, but eventually it'll be a happy surprise to see your old friend. 

If you've got a creative outlet, use that to cope. I wrote a few short stories about what weird stuff my cats used to get up to, and that helped me a lot. When my last cat passed I went through my photos and snapchat memories and made a folder with all her pictures in it. It's nice to have that to go back to when I really miss her. And it's something I was able to share with my mom who was also grieving.

Lastly, if anyone tells you ""it was just a cat"" don't listen to them. They don't know how special cats are to us, and it is 100% okay to be sad for as long as you need. ",1551398612

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Because I am confused. you’re telling me that the EC is designed in a way so that the majority can’t impose their will on the minority. 

The election of 1860 saw the majority (Lincoln voters) win the election. The minority was terrified of what Lincoln would do to them when he got in power. So they left the United States. 

It would seem that the EC failed in the election of 1860 to force presidential candidates from achieving nation wide consensus. And it this caused a civil war. 

Maybe I’m wrong. How did the EC force the candidates in the election of 1860 to listen to create a nation wide consensus? ",1551398614

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if right call but will jump back in but expecting S&amp;P 500 to possibly consolidate for 1-2 weeks from here. Canopy not breaking the high today really gave me a red flag - along with all other names. Today felt like a failed bullbreak which means we're sitting right at where we were last year this time, which is the start of this reversal.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't foresee any euphoric announcements anytime soon. Martha Stewart would've moved waves back then but not anymore - maybe if S&amp;P cooperated we would've see +15% on the back of this... but also keep in mind many more institutions are covering these now. Including the big names, and all of them have capped Canopy at around $65CAD. There's a select few that they rated outperform with a 10-40% implied return to target price left... but something tells me you probably don't want to play with those select names given the big bois are going to be going downwards ( i think) and we all know the correlation is too strong in cannabis - they had a moment of trade separation on monday I recall but as soon as the S&amp;P 500 started hinting resistance... that correlation became tight again.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, you have plays running still but very few select names left that are so undervalued that they had to catch up - hard to find these now.

In the early game, where everyone is scrabbling for shields and weapons, the guy who already has extra health is at a big advantage

For one, if *Azuma* is to be OG B-65, it makes sense to stick to historical AA.  *Yoshino*’s pimped-up take on the design is far more sensible to receive Bofors.  Those Army replicas of the British Bofors MKI were never navalized anyways.

For another, as the fall of *Kii*’s AA potency demonstrates, having no mid-range means long-range has more acting time.  For most IJN capital ships that’s not a good thing, but for those with 100s it works out great because it’s a good DP gun.",1551398617

They're secluded, depressed, and is hard to watch.

If someone doesn't want to talk about their day, you can't force them. I used to have an abusive parent who would get upset if I didn't tell her everything. I felt like I was walking on eggshells around them and it only made me withdraw from the relationship further. It's an easy cycle to fall into.

Oh a Muslim women doesn’t want to wax your dick and balls? Sue her because you identify as a woman and get to act like it’s a civil rights issue now. 

Multiple cases of women and girls being assaulted harassed or filmed in women’s toilets/change rooms by both trans women and men pretending to be trans? Oh those are just like 30 isolated incidents there’s no need to protect women.

Girls in schools that changed the policies speak up about not being comfortable will males in their restrooms? Well maybe those girls should just stay home from school because progress means women’s spaces are all inclusive.

Males keep winning in women’s sports?! Haha progress!

Women get kicked out of shelters because trans women with dicks, male bodies, male voices, and male socialization male them uncomfortable? They are just transphobic victims who deserve no shelter.

Rape survivor gets triggered by trans woman gynecologist and asks for advice? Banned from askwomenadvice. 

Say that the word woman means adult human female? You deserve to be punched!

Offended by period ads refers g to you as a bleeder/ menstruator? You transphobic piece of shit.

Lesbians who won’t sleep with trans women? Get over your transphobic sexuality bigot! Pull down the cotton ceiling of lesbian panties because they should suck it up and suck your lady dick.

Any women’s even that doesn’t include trans women? Make sure to bully them till they either shit down or include trans women. Females don’t get to gather anymore.

That's when one of the guys walked in front of me and reached into my front pockets saying 'come on man what have you got'. 
I stepped back and realised what was going down, I pulled my wallet out and the guy snatched it from me and took $40 from it. 
I ask if I can at least have my wallet back, dickheads friend says to give it back as well. 
He hands it back and pulls a knuckle duster up to my temple and says 'I swear to god if you call the police I'll kill you!' 
Me and my friends scared as shit obliged and walked into the KFC and order some food. We see that the idiots are sat at a bus stop across the road, too scared to walk back the way we came we call the police and tell them what happened and where the muggers are. 
5 minutes and some popcorn chicken later we see the cops pull over at the bus stop and we run across the road to safety. 
We identify the idiots and go back to the police station to give our statements, didn't get home until around 1am and I didn't get my $40 back.

I'm glad you're company didn't require that though, at least some companies are sticking to their word.

When I got out of university, I luckily had done an internship with a decorated CPA and it still took me 6 months to find an entry-level job. Plenty of companies want over-experienced individuals for jobs. Most of the jobs I saw had 1-2 year exp for 'entry level'. I consider myself lucky I had the internship. I have a friend in the same field, absolute genius, but no had actual experience and it took him over a year to find a job, every time he got close to the final stages, companies would take other candidates suggesting his lack of exp.

So people unfortunately can't work and do an internship at the same time if they don't live with parents, etc. the over-experience system is broken.",1551398619

Nixon has direct responsibility for 500,000 to 600,000 in the US-directed Cambodian genocide, partial responsibility for 1 million to 1.75 million deaths by the Khmer Rouge genocide.

Direct responsibility for at least 10,000 deaths by torture in the Phoenix Program.

Direct responsibility for over 2,000 deaths in the overthrow of the Chilean government.

Chemical warfare, perhaps 200,000 deaths by Agent Orange and hundreds of thousands of deaths by napalm in the US-Vietnam War.

Partial responsibility for 1.86 million to 4.72 million. 500,000 to 1.5million deaths by ideological blindness or incompetence.

Partial responsibility for 300,000 to 3 million deaths ignored in the Bengali genocide.

3,000 Kurds killed by betrayal, creating conditions for 100,000 deaths by Hussein's genocide.

Partial responsibility for 30,000 to 60,000 deaths in Operation Condor.

500,000-1.5 million deaths by incompetence and ideological blindness in the US-Vietnam War.

Pardoning mass murderer Lt. Calley.

"saltierthancrait","t5_9d1wl","Woke washing is a good word.  While I didn't immediately detect the nonsensity of Holdo not telling Poe the plan and was merely confused, it wasn't until later that it was revealed to me that Holdo's actions make no sense and is clearly bad leadership-- and to go along with what the movie suggests is the lesson (don't question your superiors, and don't expect to know information as a senior officer, and don't take action against authority even if seemingly justified) opens the door for an unchecked, functional authoritarianism, even if that authority is wearing a dress.

&amp;#x200B;

But ""woke washing"" seems to render certain people unable to acknowledge that the very authoritarian system they proclaim to fight against is the one they are now defending, simply because of a switch of the genders of the characters involved.  Instead of rightfully looking at actions objectively regardless of gender identity, the actions of the characters are being interpreted through their genders and assumed archtypes-- Poe's actions are rash and unjustified because he looks to be the prototypical male flyboy.  Holdo's actions are justified because she looks to be a caring, nurturing matron.  But if their genders and archetypes were flipped, their actions would likely not be viewed the same.  A male Holdo would seem to be authoritarian, passive, self-absorbed, with ""humility"" warped into a sort of narcissism.  A female Starbuck-like Poe would seem to be taking the reasonable course of action.

&amp;#x200B;

Now of course it's possible for gender swapped Poe/Holdo to still come across similarly to the audiences as Johnson intended (just with opinions distributed somewhat differently), because a female Poe could read as overcompensating, a male Holdo could read as no-nonsense and fatherly, and because audiences sometimes are willing to go along with a writer's intended story if emotional beats are hit even if they don't quite make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

In either case, a negative interpretation of a character's actions based on their gender, or an unjustified positive one based on that same gender is what you could validly call sexism.  And sure, there might be folks who would adamantly defend a male Holdo's actions as justified-- but the most consistent and vocal of these would likely be the sort of folks TLJ would consider ""misogynist man-babies"", or at least ""regressive patriarchal authoritarians,"" maybe with good reason.",1551398624

"politics","t5_2cneq","Fuck trump, and fuck everything to do with the #metoo bullshit.

You can't hate trump and like #metoo. 

Asia Argento is a fucking child rapist and a #metoo founder. A lot of men who did NOTHING had their lives destroyed because of #metoo and still have not received due process.

Chris Hardwick, Aziz Ansari, Morgan Freeman to name a few.  No, I do not support Weinstein one bit; but you cannot sit on your little green chair and call other people out for the shit you do yourself.  

I used to be more concerned for the welfare of women - but more than a year later from #metoo - it has shown that it is nothing but a retributive tool for angry women to employ against men, so that these women can get something - a job, more cash, or even more - RUIN SOMEONE'S LIFE. And all they need to do is point a finger.  These are facts. You cannot dispute them.

Hell, Louis C.K. asked women if it was cool and then whipped it out and started beatin' it.  No assault, no nothing. And he lost his job.  That is just a crazy complex thing in and of itself - but hey: he asked.

And why are women allowed to go back in time to punish someone with zero evidence and other minorities aren't? What makes women so special?

To make the pewdiepie literature club initiative bigger and better, I can share that we've had some success over at https://jordanbpeterson.community where we have held weekly digital meetings for over 2 years now.

Part of our initiative is the Jordan B Peterson Reading Group https://jordanbpeterson.community/reading-group/ which changes the meetings on the last week of every month into a book discussion instead.

Some of the books have also been pewdie books, and some of them have also had recorded sessions: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL68A9KvUGBlq-szz3LSLufczHzYntrLR3

"twilightimperium","t5_2ssn4","On the other hand, let us take a game like Starcraft.  A lot of times in Starcraft FFAs they'll do something like toss the casters against the pros.  And the casters will often team up against a pro.  Do you know what that means?  Literally nothing.  Here's a video of a decent pro - not the best in the world, but good - [going up against two Diamond players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9VrOYIsFTQ).  He ruins them.  Why?  Why can Mr. White and Mr. White2 not take out Mr. Black here?  How is that possible?

Because games have an element of management that you're not capturing.  Managing your position and resources to give yourself the best chance is very, very important.  Even in a literal 2v1, where both players have a joint win condition, the 1 is able to triumph thanks to better management and use of resources.  

So in the end, your problem is your game is too simplistic.  Now the question is, what is Twilight Imperium closer to - Starcraft, or a ""Bang you're dead"" game?

I’m 26 weeks tho. I feel for you because I’ve had a lot of run arounds about the whole thing.  its just so stressful and annoying . By the time we get a marriage certificate and I can be added on, I’ll be finding a new doctor in my 3rd.

But the reality is that it's not more background on him or his story, but more time with him period, that's needed.  A villain works when you hate them.  They work BEST when you hate them but sympathize with them.  He fulfilled neither requirement.  He was literally a personified conflict, in a plot device given speaking lines.

I'm genuinely hoping they pull the rug out from under us about him and he's still alive because of his connection to the Cenotaph.  That he gets more time as the big bad, even if it's only to set up for a bigger big bad down the line.  As a DnD DM, having smaller villains for shorter arcs is kind of the standard, but even in that metric he's a let down.

And there was so much promise there, too.  When he talks about not wanting Fort Tarsis, when he says ""You can have it and it's people.  That's not a bad offer for one measely javelin."" I was totally hoping for the ""But it's not just one javelin, is it?"" line to come from the Freelancer.  But it never went there.

I have had Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis since I was 3 (38 now) and have experienced so much bullshit from heartless or just thoughtless people offended when I get “special treatment”. Often they see a young person and just assume I’m cheating the system somehow.

Disney World was one in particular that got folks extra riled up. This was years ago, like around 2004, I went with my mom, young cousins, and aunts and uncles; I was 24. I was in a wheelchair. I can walk with a cane but of course at a place like Disney I absolutely needed a chair. 

Well, people with special needs get to go to a different, much shorter line, because we need more time getting on the ride, sometimes need special seating, etc, etc. The number of times people spoke LOUDLY to complain that “gee it must be nice to get to *cut the line*!” and other comments had me blushing crimson. (Same with preboarding on flights! And handicap seating at concerts and shows!) Once when I was wheeled up to the ride (I think it might’ve been Soarin’ at EPCOT, which back then had especially crazy long lines) and when my mom helped me get up out of the wheelchair and get into the seat, people saw and started flipping their shit. “LOOK! SHE CAN WALK! That girl is CHEATING!!” That kind of stuff. I cried and it ruined much of the day for me because I was so humiliated and paranoid. My mom did snap back “would YOU like Arthritis?” Somoneone had the gall to say “it must not be so bad *since she can walk*!”

People have even *argued* with me over *parking*! I’ve had nasty notes left on my car despite having a legit handicap sticker. I’ve had a woman *follow me into the grocery store* and accost me about being in a handicapped spot. I said “I actually don’t need to tell you why I’m legally handicapped, but I have Rheumatoid Arthritis”. 

And she said “You’re too young, that’s a lie, you must be using your grandparents handicap sticker!” 

I just lost it and went into this whole thing about what JRA is, and shoved my gnarled, fused hands in her face and was like “Now are you satisfied? I’d much rather NOT have a crippling disease, chronic pain, a compromised immune system, and the skeleton of an old woman instead of getting the “privilege” of parking a little closer to the door!”

I mean, I sort of get it, I hate when people abuse handicap spots, because I legit need them, and some need them even more than I do. I’ve called tow companies or informed store and restaurant managers of people who are illegally parked.

 Able-bodied assholes do park intentionally handicap spots, claiming they’re “only running in real quick” or “there’s no other spots”. It’s a hefty fine, by the way, I don’t know why they risk it. *They’re* the entitled ones! 

 (And incidentally, if someone’s legit and just forgot to put up their tag, all it takes to get out of the ticket is mailing in a copy of your tag. It’s happened to me.) 

 But if someone has a handicap sticker, I don’t scrutinize them or *quiz* them to determine wether *I* think they’re legit or not. Not every condition requiring handicap accommodation is immediately obvious. Heart conditions, for example.

For the past several years I’ve been wearing wigs and cancer beanies because I also have Alopecia, or hair loss, another autoimmune disease. I’ve found that ever since I’ve worn the beanies, nobody has bothered me. It’s sad but a relief, too.

My husband does joke, when we do park in a handicap spot in a lot that’s full and parking otherwise minimal and hard to find, saying “Thanks for being a cripple!” And we joke that’s is soooo worth it for the sweet parking. But we can **joke**. Others cannot.

Wow that was long.

**Tl;DR**: I have had Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis since I was 3, and have had many thoughtless people snark about the “perks” or have accused me of cheating or faking.",1551398632

Lifeline lets you, without any risk, loot outside of the zone after the first ring has collapsed because her drone can out heal the damage. Long range fights where you don't go down first you can get someone up pretty risk free. I have actually won a game where I rezzed the same person twice in the final fight because the enemy team did not push us hard enough.

And her ultimate is just free defensive upgrades which increases your teams change to win a team fight. your team has 2 purple armor against a team with 1 due to your package you can strait up win a fight based of nothing but the free items you gain.

Oh and you don't have to drain your supply of healing items which allows you to be much more prepared for the next fight than a team without a lifeline.",1551398633

in my case i was pretty depressed, and it didnt help that all my freids drank as much as i did. also where i lived you could get super cheap booze. and when you live like that the only people you meet also like to drink, so if you happen to go to a bar there's a chance someone who knows you is there and maybe buy you some drinks.

If you consider the New York times to have solid evidence:

&gt;...Fundamentalist preachers of all faiths have long warned about the evils of contemporary culture. But for the Jehovah's Witnesses, the message is more difficult to get across these days because of the popularity of the most famous Witness of all - Michael Jackson, whose rock music and videos have made him one of contemporary culture's biggest stars...

&gt;Michael Jackson has been threatened with disfellowship for his ''worldly'' activities, according to Mr. Penton. Faced with the threat, he said, the singer renounced his popular ''Thriller'' video in the May 22 [1984?] issue of Awake!.  ''I realize now it was not a good idea,'' Mr. Jackson is quoted in the magazine. ''I'll never do a video like that again. There's been all kinds of promotional stuff being produced on 'Thriller,' but I tell them, 'No, No, No.' I don't want to do anything on 'Thriller.' No more 'Thriller.' ''
According to his mother, Katherine, Mr. Jackson regularly dons a disguise to proselytize on street corners, distributing copies of The Watchtower and Awake!. At the same time, perhaps more than anyone else he exemplifies the music, videos, fashion and much else that is frowned upon by the hierarchy of his church.

&gt;...Gary Botting, another former Witness, said the leadership was reluctant to alienate Mr. Jackson. Mr. Botting and his wife, Heather, wrote ''The Orwellian World of the Jehovah's Witnesses,'' which compares the Witness faith with the mind-regulating vision in Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four.''
He said the leadership was reluctant because Mr. Jackson helped bring contributions and credibility to the faith by what many consider his exemplary habits, including abstinence from sex, liquor and drugs.

I feel you. I've been in the same boat, but I'm trying to get out of it. I'm also 25 and have recently realized a large part of my depression is from ""not wanting to grow up"". I've spent all my life trying to escape ""real life"". Books, movies, video games, alcohol, drugs, you name it. I didn't want to grow up. I didn't want to be an adult and have responsibilities. A large part of that for me stems from low self-esteem. Having no confidence. Although my anxiety/depression runs much deeper than just that. 

But I'm ready to move on now. I've made goals and have started working towards them. It may be years before I'm better, but I'm ready to grow as a person. To be an adult. To have responsibilities. Try to focus on WHO you want to be in the future. Who is your ideal self. And start working towards it. Good luck. ",1551398638

Dropped like 10% of my money in when it was \~$4, then 10% more when it was around 4.50, continued selling positions to buy nvax until it was about 5.50, and had made so much money thus far, and every forum post said it was going to 14. I dumped all my savings and sold everything to put into it and convinced all my friends to put money into it too.

I was literally rolling in $ up until that day (for a 21 year old). I thought I was the next warren buffet. I knew they were announcing trial results that fateful day and thought my life was about to change. I was deciding do I buy an M3 or an EVO X. Took my mom out to a $100 sushi lunch. On the drive home, my dad texted me ""NVAX afterhours disaster. You ok?""

That was the day my life changed alright. Hit me so hard I switched from E-trade to optionshouse because I thought the commission fees were too expensive now. After that I lost the rest of my money in GPRO, SCTY and the killing blow was ADPT. Spent the next few years of college eating pizza rolls and top ramen, thinking about how if I had just bought the damn M3 before they announced results, Id still have something to my net worth.

Graduated from school 6 months ago and got a cushy software engineering job. Made some good gains in IQ, MOMO and VNDA lately. Decided to give nvax a shot again. CUCKED. Luckily it was only 15% of my portfolio this time and only 63% down but still...

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","It appears to be far from the truth because you’ve not really been introspective about yourself or about the way in which women chose men.

You have suggested earlier in the thread that you rejected him because he (to summarize) said some things you “found offputting.”

Point is that you were evaluating him based on his fitness to your list of specifications for a partner that you desire, a list that is itself based on characteristics that you believe will provide you utility in some sense (inclusive of emotional utility). Some he got the OK check on, and some he didn’t.  In this particular case you didn’t think that the way he thought would be compatible with yours, so you rejected him. 

Like all females of sexually reproducing animals on the planet, *all* women chose men like this until they become conscious of their own attraction cues and modify them.  Women are attracted to and choose men based on the chosen men’s perceived utility to themselves, *not because they appreciate any given man for who he is, but rather solely for what utility he might bring them*.

Unfortunately, that’s not how we build mutually loving relationships with other people, that’s how we shop for objects in which we then *invest* with the expectation that they will provide some utility to us in the future.  That shopping and investment precludes *actual* love of men. Rather, it promotes appreciation of men as little more than objects for for the satisfaction of the choosing woman.

You will note that the majority of people whom you (hopefully) actually love *are not people that you have consciously chosen based on a list of what you thought was most suitable for you but are instead people with whom you “found” yourself placed as if by random selection (e.g. your family)*.

Actual love can only develop from appreciation of a person’s being (flaws and all) and that just doesn’t happen naturally when you are the unconstrsrained chooser.

Men are a little luckier. Because we are the sexually chosen in the species, very few of us have the power to shop for women in the same way that women shop for men. As a result, we have to learn to accept those who choose us *regardless of their fitness to our list of preferred criteria*.  Being in this position enables us to better able to appreciate the women choosing us for their beings as opposed to their utility to us, and therefore to actually love them. 

Please note that although I have spoken of this male/female dichotomy in absolute terms, it is not an absolute dichotomy, but a relative one. ",1551398638

"BattlefieldV","t5_2uxp8","My favorite maps are Arras, Narvik and Twisted Steel.

My least favorite maps are Hamada, Rotterdam and Aerodome.

What I like about Arras, Narvik and Twisted Steel is the fun mix of urban warfare and open fields for vehicles. When I play Narvik, I spend the entire game fighting for the objectives directly around C where it’s super urban and fun to sneak around flanking opponents and using the gadgets. Some of my favorite BF moments are using fun gadgets.

I dislike Rotterdam because it’s so exposed running from objective to objective. It’s an urban map, yet I can’t find the right class for it. I find myself using Scout (my least played class) just so I can keep an eye on getting picked off either from across the river or down the alley from B to A. It feels claustrophobic but also exposed - I don’t know how to describe it.

What’s interesting is that I loved Pearl Market in BF3 and Amiens in BF1, but can’t stand Rotterdam. To me it comes down to the *long* sightlines; it’s a pretty linear map with only a couple ways to get from one objective to another, and each lane is long and narrow.

I dislike Hamada and Aerodome because there’s not enough urban warfare or towns to play in. The maps would be fun if this was a vehicle-only game but it’s not and they don’t quite balance the duality between infantry and vehicles quite right.

The best maps IMO are the ones that have fun urban combat mixed with sandboxes for vehicles. Hamada would be a great map but it needs a town near A/B/C.",1551398640

"JordanPeterson","t5_32jqy","That's actually a tough question. 

I don't believe it's a strawman as I believe my description of postmodernism is accurate, but I did spend more time criticizing postmodernism than talking about what elements of it have merit. 

The problem with postmodernism is, many of their strongest points are trivial ones that don't actually contribute any new ideas or approaches. 

Of course we are not by our nature objective. The way the human mind works, by default, is to personalize everything and therefore, not be objective. (But that does not mean objectivity, to within an acceptable margin of error, is impossible) 

Of course absolute truth doesn't exist - truth is like an asymptote. You can approach it by ever closer margins, but never fully achieve it as that would require near-omniscience. (But that doesn't mean there's no such thing as ""effective truth"" - i.e. that which accurately reflects reality, or truths which we haven't found a way to disprove - like much of accepted scientific theory). 

Of course we make assumptions with every truth claim. Logic itself is built upon assumptions which we call axioms - things which are necessarily or categorically true, like 1 + 1 = 2, or ""existence is that which exists"". (Just because something can't be deductively proven doesn't mean it's wrong, or an invalid assumption) 

What postmodernism does is take those trivial complaints and attempt to use them like a magic bullet, which can deconstruct any  logical argument, any truth claim, anything the pretense of an objective meaning, including postmodernism itself. It's the philosophical equivalent of dividing by zero - doesn't matter what it is, the answer is always the same, no answer. 

Postmodernism doesn't prove anything, or even really assert anything. It just undermines everything with trivial criticisms. And I use trivial in the literal meaning of the word - technically true but meaningless or of dubious relevance. 

Ultimately there's two things that convince that postmodernism is a philosophical fraud and therefore can't really be steelman-ed. The first is that postmodernism doesn't actually make any claims, it just criticizes. And the second is that the postmodernist argument is itself circular. Postmodernism can't be truly criticized because all that would happen is you'd go around in circles until the very concept of meaning itself is fatally undermined. It's an exercise in nihilism. It rests upon the very same basic premises and assumptions it simultaneously rejects. 

Therefore, postmodernism is intellectual fraud. ",1551398642

"SandersForPresident","t5_2zbq7","I completely disagree with your sentiment here. The internet hasn't made classrooms and lecture halls obsolete. Within colleges are different communities, clubs, dorms, office hours, study groups, tutors, libraries, labs, and much more. The people you meet, interact, and take classes with can often become lifetime friends and job connections once you move on from school. Meeting your professors in person is much more important than you let on.

Perhaps people would have more time to go to office hours, attend every lecture, and join study groups if they didn't have to work one or two jobs in addition to studying and taking classes. All you're saying here is that most students 'probably' don't do things, based on nothing but your own experience of wasting time, to be honest.",1551398643

I understand people who don't feel comfortable doing something like that and honestly, I only did it because I felt comfortable that she wouldn't react badly at my bringing it up - but if someone had done the same for me, it would have saved me some grief when I first met this guy.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","My partner (27M) and I (23F) have been in a long distance relationship for years now, and still happily together.

First and foremost, communication =/= conversation. 

Communication is open and honest and direct talking to each other about what you need, what you want, and what your concerns are.

Conversation is talking to each other regularly on things like how your day was.

You're talking about difficulty having conversation due to busy schedules and maybe also difficulty with communication. Don't confuse the two.

If a partner in a long distance relationship needs sex in person, a long distance relationship is not for them. For my partner and I, we're entirely fulfilled and happy with mutual masturbation in video call. I love it and I don't feel like anything is lacking. But I've also never had an interest sleeping around and neither has he. We're just happy to be together. Some people want to sleep around. Hookup culture is everywhere it seems. Some people fresh out of high school want to sleep around. I never did and still don't, so I don't feel like I'm missing out at all. Perhaps she wants to sleep around though and that's something that's incompatible with a long distance relationship.

Frequency of conversation is something you guys have to make time for. My partner and I have at least an hour video calling each other on a daily basis, and that's with a 9 hour time difference with me in California and him in the Netherlands. The long distance relationships that thrive put in so much time and effort towards each other. We have traditions, like talking together when he goes to sleep and when I wake up. There are routines and habits that give us meaning, like how he kisses the Pusheen plushie I sent him every time before he leaves his apartment. And I bring the gigantic Totoro plushie he sent me on every road trip and vacation I go on.

My advice to you is to communicate with your girlfriend about these relationship issues, get to the bottom of why she's concerned about the lack of physical contact and what you both can do regarding frequency of conversation. Plushie stand ins for each other may help. Handwritten letters as a surprise may help. Maybe having a shirt with your scent on it would help. I can personally vouch for how healing smelling my partner is when I get to my lowest points. Instantly makes the loneliness I feel go away. For us, love is mostly in the little things. Consistent affection and communication has made our relationship incredible.

I’ve struggled to figure out what I am politically, doubt in the regular demographic here though. I thought I was a liberal but that was wrong, then I thought I might be a libertarian, and that was flat wrong. I’m something like a champion of individualism with a acknowledgment that regulation is vital and the government can have a profound impact for the better. However, regulation should not trample in the rights of individuals, and I think trying to engineer a system like AOC espouses is incredibly dangerous. Not because she’s bad specifically, or that he ideas aren’t coming from a good place, but because when you try to control outcomes you create an artificial system that is ripe for corruption.

*The people who WOULD have worked at HQ2 in NYC are now going to work wherever the new HQ2 will be built.  That tax base is now gone from NYC.*

New Yorkers flocking out of NYC to follow a corporation... you really think so? I will believe that when I see it! Unless you are acknowledging that Amazon wasn’t really planning on training and hiring locals...?

*This is irrelevant to the location of HQ2*

My train of thought is usually online vendors do not have to collect state or local sales tax unless they have a qualifying physical presence. I had not realized NY already qualifies Amazon for that without HQ2, my bad. Apparently some judge slapped the book across Amazon when they tried to take it to court.

But since Amazon isn’t a regular brick and mortar retailer they will collect the same sales tax in NY since all the online shoppers in NY will not have their shopping behavior affected by a physical location that doesn’t do direct sales. So I guess both your point about new sales tax revenue as well as my point about redirected economic activity are both not applicable

*that site will remain abandoned and generate little to no economic profit for the area.*

That’s a good point, and NY has a heavy property tax. The caveat there is that Amazon’s presence was going to balloon property taxes like we’ve seen in Seattle, and as a hugely profitable corporation they will not struggle with that the way New Yorkers will.

*Local politicians want to use the tax break for local investments without increasing revenue stream.*

Where is this assumption coming from? Investing into the community can absolutely generate new revenues. Small businesses may not generate as much revenue as Amazon but they also won’t drive up rent in a city where people are already losing their home to gentrification.

I appreciate your hypothetical scenarios. My point of dispute is that I don’t think all of that revenue is new and necessitated by HQ2. I have not been able to find any comprehensive overview of the specifics if the subsidy package that was offered, but you seem to have specifics like about the grants for the land, I would be interested in seeing that as well as where exactly this projected revenue  comes from.

"csMajors","t5_33vsv","As a student, some of the best tips to doing well in class are as follows:

1. Get help from those who’ve done it (TA’s/Professor/etc)

2. Try to understand any errors or issues your code has, so you know what to look up. 
(For example, if you get a segmentation fault when running over an array, you’ll need to know that it’s because you’re trying to access memory you don’t have permission to access)

3. Problem solve, and try to break down every problem into small, successive steps. 

4. Understand that coding can be HARD, and that you aren’t stupid if you don’t get it right the first time. 

5. Practice. Coding is a lot like cooking, and you can use parts of some problems in other places. For example, if you know how to cook a Mexican chili, it isn’t all that difficult to cook an Indian curry (similar ingredients, spices, etc). 

Good luck OP! I was crap at coding when I first started, and through some of the tips above I got a lot better. I currently work as a TA in my University’s CS department, and a big part of why I think I do my job well is because I grew to understand those points above! ",1551398647

How about:  
Mass immigration is a Tragedy of the Commons that will destroy the local social contract and thus also the local environment. Global environmental problems can only be solved with a global social contract that can only stand on stable local and regional social contracts - which necessitate reasonably small native ethnic nation states. The long term tolerable immigration flux is 0,1% annually as a percentage against the number of natives. Higher migration rates than that are part of a pyramid scheme that has brought about the Anthropocene - the 6th mass extinction event on this planet.",1551398647

And it's frustrating since we're now practically back at square 1 in terms of where our trio are at, there's not many episodes left at all and there'll be a long wait for the second season-- if we even get one. Me thinks they set this up well to get some nice manga sales.. But at the cost of a satisfying season.

If you had ""Simple weapon proficiency"" (Free to all classes), you can wield spear, staff, slings, daggers and a host of weapons. So you really don't need to take anything in slings, it come for free. 

Martial weapon proficiency (Free to fighter/rangers but require an talent for mages) cover most western medieval weapons (Sword, Long Sword, 2hand maces etc). 

Exotic weapons are stuff like Katana blades, Ninja stars, dual bladed weapons...they are non-traditional in a western RPG so you need an talent slot for each type of weapon you want.

Then there are weapon focus/specialization which boost 1 weapon. 

So weapon specialization is a CHOICE, my fighters usually never bother to pick one weapon and he does fine. If you want to role play the Dark Elvish Assassin in BDSM gear dual wielding whips...then take the talents when you find a whip, but you can certainly progress without it. ",1551398648

As it stands, if migrant from subsahara arrives to Germany he isnt going to be deported. It simply wont happen, unless he is one of the unluckiest sods alive, as vast majority of German deportations go to Georgia, Ukraine and Balkans. Hell, invent a sob story and you are in for a humanitarian protection status where burden of proof is shifted onto state to prove that some virtual persecution did not happen (and there are ton of NGOs which give training on that, especially in Greek detention centers, but also in Spain). To be fair, this is not only German problem, this is virtually entire WE situation as it is.

So WE does have lax internal system, that it needs to keep that way because otherwise its not ""humanitarian"", but that creates problem because then its open season - get through border and ""prosper"" (or at very last that is dream smugglers are selling to millions). Which in turns gives birth to backslash like AfD or LEGA or take your pick, and then EU states decide to deal with that by magnitute harsher external policy when it comes to migration. Having a deal with Morocco. With Egypt. Shipping billions to Erdogan. Making deals with militias on western coast of Libya (they dont really have religious affilition they would care a bit about to be fair). Everything goes.

Now, of course, this whole cascade could be solved by actually making things right where they began - at internal situation, but nooooo...that wouldnt look good at local telly report. Having actual asylum system that respects spirit of post-Geneva consensus, that actually doesnt encourage illegal crossing of border or asylum shopping through two continents. But since legislature in Germany is impotent enough that it actually votes down proposal which would establish Tunisia, Georgia and Morocco as safe countries, despite them being fricking safe countries, fat chance of that happening.

Because while your local telly wont be sending someone to Libya, and even if they did they will never get to hundred yards of one of those detention camps or actuall hell that is happening in Fezzan region that even AI heard only stories about, getting news from home is easy.

I used up my cupcakes a lot faster before when completing quests because of that. 

Before I go to bed every night, I set up two sims on Long work events, one on a standard work, and one on short. The reason is because work events collect the most simoleons, and second, it helps complete Emily’s tasks a lot faster in the morning. And the faster you finish a task, the sooner Emily arrives. 

I regret 3/4 furniture packs that I purchase with real money. They look cute at first, but remodeling is part of the game’s fun, so in my opinion is not worth it to spend $10 dollars on something that you’re going to get bored of in two months. 

There are some quests that might be worth completing and some quests that are not worth the stress at all. For example, I was stressing over the Halloween event, when I don’t even like Halloween, and now my storage is full of stuff I don’t want at all.

"golf","t5_2qhcs","I recently heard a podcast and a player who grew up in Germany said that he didn't get to play on a course until he passed a test. Apparently there was a learning process to go through so that before people stepped on a course to play, there was a basis of knowledge about how to keep up pace of play and play by the rules and be courteous to others and keep up the maintenance of the course, etc. The German ethic (pervasive all around their society) was such that everyone knew how to do things and anyone could/would call you out on your non-adherence. This was expected and received generally well. 

This would take a lot of our issues with the game away (slow play being the biggest).

I also wish golf was cheaper to play. Paying for equipment is fine because you can always find good clubs used or on sale. But the greens fees get to be prohibitive for too many people to enjoy this regularly so they can fall in love with the game. I do understand that golf courses generally are not gouging people and that some barely make enough to get by, but I do hate the costs.

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","As a builder - there is typically more involved with this type of change than just choosing a different color. Most developments have architectural review committees that have to approve of the color selections prior to permitting and building the home. 

Petitioning the ARC is typically not a quick, easy or enjoyable experience - and by no means are they required to allow this type of change. 

This can even be the case regardless of whether the builder is also the original developer of the community - as most often a committee of people still have agree on the change. 

So although it’s frustrating for you, which I completely understand, with a zero change policy such as you described, the builder has no obligation whatsoever to accommodate such a drastic change in a plan already put in place. Nor does an ARC have any obligation to allow such a change. 

I hope this helps with at least a bit of understanding from the builders side. ",1551398650

I agree we need to go after the middle, but the middle isn't made up of Very Serious People with sober thoughts on how both sides need to work together, but rather apathetic people who want somebody with an actual message, as opposed to a bunch of bromides. 

That what we saw in 2018 - a bunch of people in the middle who got fooled by Trump in 2016 switched back over to the Democrat's, because the Democrat's are running on issues that matter and attacking the Republican's on those issues, as opposed to be nice 'n' fluffly and working together. 

Also, the people who watch the SOTU fall into two camps - the President's supporters and hardcore opposition. Which is why every President get good ratings from the people who actually watching the SOTU. Clinton, Bush, and Obama all got good approval ratings for their SOTU's for that reason. 

I also have no problem with meeting in the middle, but since the majority of the country largely agrees with the policies of the Democratic Party, there's no reason for the Democrat's to moderate their policy message.

The person who opened the account /credit card sent it to your address to avoid any suspicion from sending it to a non billing address. If they have all the information needed to open this account, then they probably have other accounts opened under your name. Also be aware, in most cases when opening an account or card with a company you already do business with, you are required to call from the billing phone number which means they’re probably spoofing your phone number to create these accounts if it is being done via phone. I advise you to look into your credit report maybe get in contact with a credit agency and place a fraud alert. Also, look into using an alert system for future use. I personally use LifeLock.

-Vitamin D. Ok, listed.

-Mindfulness is something that i've lost care about since a long time ago, but i'll take it in account also.

-Social media usage: I only have WhatsApp. I read most part of the week, and usually people ask me why i leave conversations so suddenly while i'm studying. I left FB and Twitter in order to improve my mental health some months ago.

-Sure, i'll go outside for a while soon, after taking a shower. Thanks for that advice too.

"aliens","t5_2qktn","The Fermi Paradox states that statistically, we should have been visited already. Some might argue that we have, and it's been covered up for the most part because of whatever reasons. Others might argue the opposite, and reference the Fermi Paradox when it states that we might just be very very rare, and that super intelligent life like us homosapiens is SO rare, that any other super intelligent life out there is still progressing in their evolution. That theory also suggests that they're either behind us, at a similar level, or ahead of us in terms of scientific advancements but not to the point of being able to traverse the entire galaxy and every solar system to eventually stumble across us. 

In answer to OP's questions, I think it is definitely an important consideration, though I personally believe that super intelligent life developing on land is more likely the case as opposed to there being MORE super intelligent life in oceans across the Universe. Just look at our own evolution, all life came from the oceans, and the super intelligent life came from the evolution of land-faring beings that LEFT the ocean, came on land, and over millions of years divided into many different species, eventually resulting in our ancient primate ancestors, which eventually became us.

&gt;I liked Black Panther, but it definitely wasn't as good as the accolades it received. For all it's ""look how progressive we are by showing black people as intelligent and advanced"" the end result was all of their problems stemmed form following ancient tribal customs of their dictators being chosen by combat to the death. **Turns out it was a movie about how blacks are still backwards as fuck and hold on to tribal rituals and feats of strength to chose their leaders as opposed to modern concepts like democracy or even some form of meritocracy.** It's also convenient that the only reason they even exist as a nation is because they happened to find a massive amount of wealth and not through any particular accomplishment of their own. Implying finding wealth is what made them successful.
&gt;
&gt;I felt the same way about Wonder Woman (except I hate WW the movie as opposed to at least enjoying Black Panther). Wonder Woman was not a movie about how progressive and strong women are. It was a movie about how women need to conform to societal standards to get anything accomplished, and that means wearing a sexy dress and looking fabulous.

Here’s how it happened: I asked Male who was working at his desk to replace the water jug. It is a heavy jug - 4 gallons of water.  When he came to assist, I was in the break room chatting to some female colleagues. He saw this, became indignant presumably because we were on break and he wasn’t?, and so he asked one of the female colleagues to install the water, which she did. To make him feel better, she told him it wasn’t that hard to do. AITA? I asked him to help me, not to help the ladies I was chatting with, by the way, if that matters.

I ended up hurting the ligaments in his knee and breaking his nose, we both got suspended the same amount of time, but I could still play school sports, and no one ever picked a fight again so I’d say it all worked out okay.

Still, I wouldn’t have done all that if it weren’t for Zero Tolerance. I’d have just tried to control the fight, keep distance and wait for teachers to break it up, but if I’m going down anyway, might as well make a bit of a statement. ",1551398658

Please know there are so many options for medication that may work better for your son and have fewer side effects. Multiple meds, multiple dosages, but it unfortunately has to be trial and error. Find someone who understands ADHD and is willing to put the time in to find the right med and dose. Don’t be afraid to use stimulant medications, and don’t let anybody shame you for it. They are the only treatment proven effective for ADHD symptoms, and they’ve been studied like crazy. Your son will be who he is regardless, so don’t rule out options that may help him be the most competent and confident kid he can be.

The other thing is there's absolutely *no chance* China and Russia would allow a unified US-allied Korea sitting right on their borders. Russia's main Pacific port (as well as Pacific Fleet naval headquarters) is at Vladivostok, about 80 miles from the North Korean border, and there's several large Chinese cities not much further away.

This is what he actually said (from their article).

 

&gt;“I was a renter for 15 years,” Wilkinson said. “I lived in a dozen different rentals.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“It was challenging at times, but it was fun,” he told the Legislature.  
&gt;  
&gt;“It’s kind of a wacky time of life, but it can be really enjoyable. Being a renter is a fact of life. it’s a rite of passage.”

He never said that 'struggling to pay rent' was fun, he said it was a fun time of life. Of course it was, he was a renter when he was young and most young people enjoy their youth. I wish the left-wing media wasn't borrowing from the dirtier parts of the right-wing media playbook. There's no need for dishonest and misleading headlines.

Here is about the most recent robbery against an ambulance, it was about a month and a half ago, someone called our ""911"" requesting help and met the paramedics with a gun to take their medicine.

Here is an example of an ambulance that got burglarized while the medics were resuscitating someone.

""And now behold, I say unto you then cometh a death, even a second death, which is a spiritual death; then is a time that whosoever dieth in his sins, as to a temporal death, shall also die a spiritual death; yea, he shall die as to things pertaining unto righteousness"" (Alma 12:15-16).

As for the quantity of those who will ultimately suffer the second death, I will say that Joseph Smith believed that it would be ""the case with many apostates of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints"".

"BurningMan","t5_2qj68","I was 16 when my dad took me the first time. I took my daughter when she was 1, last year.

There were other kids the same age, lots of 2's and 3s especially, and those parents really focused on providing the right environment, and were ready to bounce at a moment's notice. We had an AC cooled yurt, a shade structure, and a pack and play. We pulled her around with a shaded and lit up off-road wagon, she always had a camelbak nozzle and a sippy cup. She loved walking around on the playa and looking at things, and could nap in the wagon if she needed a lay down. 

My wife had a blast the whole time, but I had some anxiety about everything and was never as 'in the moment' until the last day when I had everything packed up except the wagon, so we could leave at any time. Then I had a blast and was super connected and really enjoyed bonding with my daughter. This year I'm buying an RV so we can leave at a moments notice without packing - not that we will, but it's necessary for me to relax. It might have been better if she was old enough to follow instructions, but this still worked and we had a blast.

Contrary to that my buddy once brought his 2 year old for a couple of days and decided to never bring a child again.

It's possible to take a child to Burning Man at any age, but how well it goes depends on you, what you're capable of, what you're comfortable with. If you feel your daughter should be at an age where she can communicate well, or at an age where she can follow rules and instructions, or at an age where she can make sound decisions about interacting with strangers and be self-directed, you should wait until then to go.",1551398664

He wants to ensure the continued limitation of population growth worldwide, ensure the US economy maintains openness to immigration, and ensure the technocrats hold the whip hand over economic affairs.

I don't believe the goals he has are in conflict with UBI. It just makes the jobs of the technocrats easier if they can continue with the control they exert over the economy.

So, he's not going to tell you why he doesn't support it yet, because his goals may be in conflict with yours.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Because that isn't how immunity deals work. 

Let's get one thing straight right now: his immunity was only with his dealing with Cohen's payments for the felony campaign finance charges. That is the scope of his immunity and without seeing the deal you don't know what would break it but testifying about it wouldn't break it regardless.

If he had normal immunity then he would have had to proffer up every crime he ever committed and every crime he saw someone else commit because that is how the SDNY works, Cohen refused that immunity btw which is why he doesn't have a cooperation agreement with them. But in any case, you need to say how you think someone could break immunity by testifying because it just doesn't work that way. 

Regardless this is how it works, you are asked a question, if it is something you have immunity from, you have to answer, you have no 5th amendment protection anymore. If you refuse that is contempt of congress/court pending on the setting and you can go to jail. 

If he worries he could incriminate himself with the answer he can plead the 5th, he might have to specify why (this isn't covered by my immunity is good enough). 

But the main point I was trying to make is ""this is an ongoing investigation"" isn't a reason to not answer a legal question for witnesses. That is DOJ policy, but he isn't a DOJ employee and gag orders for grand juries do not apply to witnesses called before them (first amendment). The reason Cohen gave it and the congressmen backed off was courtesy but they could subpoena the answer if they wanted to (and the SDNY might file a motion to quash it but that is another story).",1551398668

"ems","t5_2rmg0","Cuffed tubes are available down to 2.5 iirc. It was popular to used non-cuffed ett in peds but now there is growing support for using cuffed in peds; my ERs are using cuffed now. 

3.0 tube sounds about right for a 1 month old. 

Using a cuffed tube may or may not have helped...probably wouldn't hurt.

Anyway the anesthesiologists I've talked to have had disdain for most  tube holders and the one's I've shadowed have always used tape--and seem to do a better job on more difficult airways and do a half-assed tape on the in and out cases... Other than that I think anchorfast &gt; thomas type ett holders. So in the case of ped I'd just go straight to the best tape job you can do.

On your first lost airway I wouldn't trust anything else otherthan someone holding the tube for the rest of the way. Pedicodes are so airway dependant it isn't worth the risk again. ",1551398668

&gt;Thanks for the suggestion! It’s actually one we’ve debated on the team. One concern we have is anytime we – the OW team – make assumptions about what you want to do without giving you some agency in the situation. Our concern is, we believe there are a number of players who want to or like to play different roles but because they are thinking of “the good of the team”, they flex to needed roles. A player like this, under your design suggestion, is going to end up always having to play tank or support. We really want to avoid design solutions that further reinforce players being forced to play roles they don’t intend to.

&gt;I hope this explanation makes sense. To use myself as an example, by your suggestion, I am a “tank main” because most of my play time is on tanks. But I really love playing healers and damage heroes as well. I would be worried if the game just assumed I should be playing tank all the time, because I did it so much previously (mostly to be a good teammate, not because that’s what I wanted to do).

&gt;Hope that makes sense.

**Jeff, just wondering does the Overwatch team have any Symmetra Mains?**

&gt;regarding symmetra main question… our live ops producer has 700 hours on her.

- [**Kaplan | Game Director**](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/role-queue-compromise/311123/6)

**Regarding the role queue, have you and your team considered separate role SRs (similar to say, Splatoon 2’s separate ranks for modes) or do you intend to keep us to 1 SR per account?**

&gt;if we did role queue, we would do separate SR’s. this is one of the things i think would be really fun (plus make the game way more balanced and improve matchmaking)

You are pressing your pencil MUCH too hard and using a bad grip, which is making you have bad control. Further, you should be laying down light lines and using basic shapes to guide your construction. You can't build a house without a T-Square, so why would you sketch without [constructs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KfmA6cEpU0)?

&amp;#x200B;

You need to practice [holding a pencil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiPJlhvTuQg), and also [drawing a line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k1zbULdBRs). 

Practice drawing circles...lots of circles. Draw different sizes using the close and mid tripod grip.

Then practice drawing curves using your wrist, elbow, and even shoulder in the mid-tripod and overhand grip instead of incorrectly using just your fingers.

He always made you think you were the bad person and you did everything wrong, and I just couldn't take it anymore. Also, on a more positive note: I went studying again! I failed miserably in Uni last year and was depressed for most of that year but managed to struggle through and I tried again this year, studying to become a teacher, and passed 4 of my 5 exams I had a while ago!! I am very happy with how my life is turning out to be, although I find myself balancing on the verge of depression some days, but on those days I find help in my wonderful girlfriend (of now almost 2 years😊). Turning 18 was a changing point, it was a year of decisions and one of the hardest years in my not-that-long-yet life, but now I'm 19 things have settled a bit and are finally beginning to be on track.

Using about a gallon of butter, breathing techniques and a few hours I managed to finally get it inside. However it was too uncomfortable so I tried to shit it back out. This is where things got confusing because rather than a melon sliding out half a dozen apricots did. Now there is a chance that I just blacked out upon excreting the cantaloupe and it rolled away somewhere and that I happened to have a dozen or so left over apricots lying around my rectum from earlier but I cannot for the life of me find the melon anywhere. I think I may have the power to anally turn melons into apricots. Further experimentation will be required of course (once my rectum has recovered) but if this turns out to be true then I may be able to solve world hunger.

She doesn't have the kit of a full wizard, just a few unlimited or relatively unrestricted spells and innate levitation/flying as long as she's wearing her glass-armour.

People have suggested switching out what she can control with another element but I like the idea of her briefly conjuring the glass she uses from the elemental demi-plane of processed silicates more and it gives her a nice visual flair compared to more 'normal' magic, enhanced with how rare glass would be in a faux-medieval setting. The party is naturally going to be impressed by someone wearing a costume made out of stuff they would ordinarily only see in churches or wealthy estates, conveniently retaining Shatterbird's high-class air.

Alternately, I'd switch her element to metal but she has to use her 'magic' to shatter metal items into useable shards, maybe lifting some of the restrictions on her spells because she has to manually gather a resource to use them.",1551398671

"phenibut","t5_2z9gw","I'd recommend dosing once a week and taking breaks of at least a month like every 6 months. The breaks really bring your tolerance town and make you appreciate it a lot more once you go back. Every other day is way too much, the absolute maximum would be every three days. 

&amp;#x200B;

Phenibut definitely makes falling asleep easy, sometimes way too easy. However, it's not really a viable sleep aid since you take it so infrequently. I'd recommend low amounts of melatonin or maybe magnesium before bed to help   get you on a good sleeping schedule if you're not on one. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for how much, I'd start with 500mg and go up in increments of 250mg if you're not feeling the desired effects. Too much makes me way too sleepy, to the point that I'm nodding off throughout the day. Larger doses like 1.25 grams can also give me a headache sometimes. Once you start getting around 2 grams, you may start feeling nauseous. I wouldn't recommend going above that. ",1551398674

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","Do you mean that the Ranged Damage role should be for sustained damage dealers only? In practice, I think that assertion will be true most of the time - Mages (who are usually associated with burst damage) will often be in the Flex slot. However, the important thing (in most matchups) is that you're: 1. getting *some* sustained damage from somewhere, and 2. have the capacity to output good *ranged* damage. It's important to realize that these two 'types' of damage do not necessarily have to come from the same source! In other words, if you want sustained damage and/or the capability to deal with a tank, you don't always need a traditional Ranged Auto-Attack DPS.

For example, you can have a Kael'thas as your Ranged Damage Dealer and a Maiev in the Flex role. Maiev provides sustained damage via Fan of Knives and her autoattacks when she's in range. While these two heroes together can fulfill your team comp's basic needs in many situations, you might still want some more capability to deal with tanks; add in a Muradin with Give 'em the Axe! at lvl 7, a support Kharazim (maybe with Seven-Sided Strike), and you've got more sustained damage presence that can deal with a tank. As you can see, it's more important to look at the combined package/holistic view of your kill patterns (as well as what your team comp's goal is - maybe you're looking to dive the backline and avoid the enemy tank) rather than the specific types of heroes in each role. But again, it will end up being the case the majority of the time that your Ranged DPS will be a sustained damage dealer, and so on - just keep these kinds of edge cases in mind. They can sometimes come up, and utilizing such a setup can contextually be powerful.

Additionally, some mages, like Gul'Dan or Jaina, can bring a lot of sustained damage and you'll be fine having them as your Ranged DPS. For example, Jaina + Orphea - both of whom are mages - in the 4-member squad will usually be just fine (particularly after Jaina gets Ice Lance at lvl 7) in terms of providing damage output.

Finally, the enemy team's composition is a big factor in deciding what you want to pick. If your opponents have a composition that doesn't heal/deal with poke damage well, go ahead and have a Li Ming as your Ranged DPS and maybe a Thrall or something in the Flex role. It'll also come down to how you play fights. In the aforementioned example, make sure you get some poke in first before there's a decisive engagement, as that's where your team comp gets an edge. If the matchup shapes out in such a way such that your team doesn't have to think about killing the enemy tank very much and can dive the enemy backline, then sustained damage lowers in value a bit, too. There's a lot to think about!

It's a great question to ask - this is something I should've talked about in my article, haha. In general, you're right - mages will often be in the Flex position. But it's important to note that it's not always the case.",1551398674

I shop at Safeway and buy a lot of stuff that's marked for quick sale. They'll be either 30% or 50% off. I'll also do the same thing at Superstore. Then I abuse the scanning code of practice by noting the date and picking up items that are incorrectly priced due to the end of a sale. You get incorrectly marked items for free (up to $10). I usually make off like a bandit. I also use manufacturer's coupons to bring the price down in tandem with these discounts. You can't combine coupons, but you can add a coupon to a quick sale sticker. Also, items discounted this way count toward the gas discount... So I take a couple jerry cans and fill them up at 15 cents a litre cheaper... The 100L limit on the receipt? That's not enforced, as the cashier told me when I hit 112L and was expecting to pay the difference on the last 12 litres.

Safeway is preferred since I usually come out ahead over Superstore due to the fact that there are more quick sale stickers and for the gas discount, but Superstore is almost always cheaper without these tactics.

I see a lot of posts here mentioning that a 504 sounds appropriate. I agree, from what we've heard. If your son is academically successful in general education classes, then he likely only needs the accommodations as opposed to specially-designed education. That's more for students who are struggling academically. I'm sorry your son is having trouble emotionally, but unless it's affecting his academics, an IEP would be unnecessary (as opposed to a 504). 

All of that has already been mentioned, though. What I haven't seen mentioned is the transition to college. My understanding is that IEPs (under the IDEA as described by teenytinyducks above) mean nothing to colleges. However, 504s (under the ADA) can carry over to college. A college classmate of mine, for example, had accommodations for extended time and separate setting on tests. Those accommodations were protected, even in college, by the ADA.",1551398676

The Ironblood official art is really confusing. It does look cool, but it contradicts all the description Ironblood has in the novels. Also it's 19km long, so each broadside cannon has to be almost 500-700 meters in diameter (the cobra class escort is 1,5km long in that picture). Also the supporting struts are really not in the spirit of Perturabo's ""no structural weakness"" policy. 
I think that the artist who did the sketch did not go in detailed research when he did it and it was just approved for the artbook because nobody cared.

I think Ironblood was more bulky than that. Like [this](https://pp.userapi.com/c851016/v851016403/d372e/iodv6Zky7MY.jpg)

I think to pass proper judgement though I'd need more INFO  on you as people  which is a bit too hard without hearing their sides so i'm going to give you all the benefit of the doubt and go with NAH.

which does seem pretty negative about the EU as a whole, but he loved Shadows of the Empire. He has been quoted as saying he would have made a story like this into a movie if he had had the time and effort back in the early 1980s. He even added the Outrider into A New Hope's Special Edition.

Then you have things like Coruscant and some PT species being taken from the EU (""That’s a different world than my world. But I do try to keep it consistent. The way I do it now is they have a Star Wars Encyclopedia. So if I come up with a name or something else, I look it up and see if it has already been used.""), Aayla Secura debuted in a comic and George liked her so much he put her Episode 2, Darth Bane and Revan being added to Clone Wars as Sith ghosts and George loving it upon finding out who they were (Filoni had to beg George to remove them from the final cut), and George only imposing one demand on the EU, the Clone Wars being declared off-limits at first because of his own ideas for the PT. 

Which was a good thing because the small mentions of the Clone Wars in Thrawn's trilogy were retconned. 

So it seems like he's more lax on the EU, if anything his more ""negative"" views seem to be towards the EU after Episode 6, rather than Clone Wars or even ones set during his movies. Something tells me after the Disney ST, George prolly is rethinking his views there lol

The babies are adorable once they get fur and I pamper the hell out of them. They get enrichment, hide boxes, stuff to chew on, climate control and lighting all set to optimal mouse conditions.

The first DLC of the pass was Black Armory. It includes 3 quest lines to unlock 3 forges, a 4th forge that is unlocked once you unlock any forge, and an optional quest line. The forges can be used to grind specific weapons that rotate week by week. The forge encounters also have a quest line for an exotic sniper, and an exotic bow can drop at all forges, and an exotic fusion rifle that can drop from the 4th forge. There's also armor sets that can drop randomly, or be farmed, and a second set of legendary weapons that can drop. Lastly, during the season of the forge Annual Pass owners got the quest line for The Last Word.

The second DLC Joker's Wild and we didn't know much about it until this morning. You can see more about it for yourself here:

The brother looks very similar to my starter machine which has been everything I need, and I've done knits, buttonholes, bras, you name it. It's not *perfect* and sometimes I need to really put some manual work into getting over bulk, but you're not looking for perfect at that price anyway.  


The alternative in the cheap price range is a vintage machine! Very sturdy and actually 'heavy duty' but will need a bit of TLC and research to appreciate, and with less features obviously.

"italy","t5_2qkhk","&gt; Aspetto ancora il tuo punto di vista. Io le tare di questa europa le ho nominate, noto che non riesci a elencare nulla.

Io potrei elencare tutta una serie di ragioni per cui la merda italiana, come dice lei, é di fabbricazione autoctona, non europea. I problemi li abbiamo creati noi, non la UE. L'Italia fatica ad attrarre FDI rispetto ai suoi pari europei, e questo non per l'Europa cattiva, ma perché non conviene investire in un paese dove i contenziosi legali tra aziende vengono risolti con tempi biblici e dove i governi dimostrano poca serietá e affidabilitá cambiando le carte in tavola in corso d'opera.

Le delocalizzazioni sono frutto della globalizzazione, non dell'Europa. A casa mia, a Bologna, un'azienda che produceva telai per la Ducati ha chiuso perché quest'ultima ha ingaggiato una societá vietnamita. Le risulta che il Vietnam sia nella UE? O la Cina, altra grande destinazione per le delocalizzazioni?

La sovranitá monetaria? E' un feticcio di voi sovranisti, roba che neanche la bacchetta magica della fata turchina. Peccato che per voi sovranitá monetaria voglia dire svalutazione monetaria. Un giochetto che funziona nel breve periodo ma di cui l'Italia ha abusato per decenni e che porta piú problemi che benefici.

L'Italia ha basato molta della sua concorrenzialitá sul tasso di cambio mantenuto bassissimo per decenni nei confronti dei suoi pari europei e americani, col risultato che gli imprenditori locali hanno smesso di investire in R&amp;D, i dipendenti a salario fisso venivano colpiti duramente, l'inflazione viaggiava a tassi doppi rispetto a quelli attuali e con oscillazioni piú sostenute e i lavoratori italiani si ritrova(va)no con il potere d'acquisto piú basso tra i paesi del blocco occidentale (cosa che permane, vedi Renzi che diceva ""investite in Italia che gli ingegneri italiani prendono poco"").

Senza contare che l'Italia é un paese senza giacimenti di materie prime, quindi quelle le doveva comperare sul mercato internazionale con prezzi denominati, nella maggior parte dei casi, in dollari.

Ora che i paesi emergenti come la Cina, l'India e il Sud Est Asiatico sono entrati in competizione con noi, il giochetto della svalutazione non funziona piú. Sia perché i Cinesi fanno con il renminbi la stessa cosa che facevamo noi, sia perché noi non possiamo competere con il costo del lavoro asiatico.

L'introduzione dell'Euro ha messo fine ad un trucchetto che avrebbe smesso comunque di funzionare, perché una volta che i mercati si globalizzano e i paesi emergenti entrano in competizione con noi, non cambi i meccanismi macroeconomici da solo. Non ci riesce la UE da sola, figuriamoci l'Italietta di Salvini e Di Maio.

&gt; Uno che ignora l'uso della svalutazione per sostenere l'esportazioni e il fatto che l'euro abbia negato questa possibilità creando problemi al Paese è un cazzone che non sa di cosa parla. Ogni riferimento è puramente casuale.

Uno che ignora i molti risvolti negativi della svalutazione monetaria é un cazzone, un coglione e una vajassa. Ogni riferimento é puramente intenzionale.",1551398681

"skyrim","t5_2s837","I like using Alternate Start and just being a normal person trying to survive. Frostfall and Realistic Needs and diseases are two awesome mods to make the game challenging no matter what your level.  

It’s funny to start out with the nice house in Solitude and see it just bare in a couple weeks of game time because you’ve had to sell all your belongings in order to buy food.  So that you don’t starve to death and all.  Because you tried gathering flowers to sell to the potion store but those goddamn saber cats wouldn’t stop maiming you the moment you got 10 feet out of town.   It’s not like you could defend yourself because you’d sold your sword on the first day.  And bought booze, which you drank by the river, which you promptly fell into after everything started spinning.   Thank the Gods that nice hunter fished you out and let you dry off next to their fire.   

With those two mods, just living can be challenging.  One of the Alternate Start scenarios puts you on a shipwreck off the coast up north.  Even surviving to get to a town at all can be hard.

"VirginiaTech","t5_2r39x","I also have been renting from TNT for 2 years now. Here's my adventure with them.

I moved in sophomore year and everything seemed ok. Then one night the wind caught the storm door and pulled the lock catch plate off the fram. I called maintenance and they said they'd come fix it.

For a 6 weeks I would randomly get woken up from the sound of the wind pushing the door beating up against the siding. Called every week and kept getting "" maintenance will be come out this week""

After that during winter break a valve broke in the air handler (hot water heat) and was just streaming hot water out a drain under the porch which raised our water,electric, and natural gas bills. All those listed above said the rental company will cover it. Tnt said the opposite.

My lease dictates we have to change the air filter. When I checked what size filter I found a filter bent in half just wedged in there. I knew that wasn't right so I called tnt asking for the correct filter size. Tnt says ""use the same size that's already in it"". I explain and they insist. Finally I was able to get maintenance to come out and it turns out they fucked up installing the air handler and had nothing to hold a filter.

Tnt also found snakes in our dryer exhaust and instead of saying to us "" hey there's a snake, we have people coming"" they just leave. Also had to wait up until 11pm because all the cheapo snake guys kept flaking.

After that a toilet had to get replaced because maintenance couldn't figure out why it kept clogging and found rotting wood around the toilet. So they cut a 1.5'x1.5' of the linoleum up and replace it with new wood. That was the middle of February last year. Because the maintenance can't measure properly there where air gaps letting freezing air into our house until the first week of April.

They also have an awful lease agreement. The first group to start a lease fill out damage reports for the apartment. If anyone on the lease renews there is no new damage reports for incoming tenants. So as long as that patern continues of people coming and going they get there full deposit back until someone(me) is slapped with the bill. 

TNT is awful, this is just a highlight of what I've gone through. I'm already planning on taking this to small claims when it comes time.


Edit: I forgot to add this gem.

Last month I was on my porch and smelled natural gas. I walk to the gas meter and it is deff leaking. So I call the non emergency police line because 1) the meters are beside my bedroom window and 2) the neighbors smoke and flick cigerrate butts everywhere. So the fire dept comes out and they get the gas people out and everything is all good. 2 days later the property manager calls me and chews me out for not calling the emergency maintenance guys first and letting them handle it and how they had to find out ""through a 3rd party""",1551398682

The truth is the idea that any ""defined political block"" thinks the rural is full of poor, ignorant stupid people is ridiculous since many of the voters on the left are from rural areas.  

I would say that the representatives of the rural states are not looking like they give a shit about the rural states and sure aren't presenting the best of america.  Rural states should consider if they are picking the best people and I would also say that for non-rurals states.  

BTW I fully understand the purpose of the electoral college, but it has been failing in modern times because it was designed for a smaller scale and it doesn't work on the scale we have now.  50 states and the expansion of cities as well as evolution from a rural farming economy to manufacturing has altered the basic underlying specifications.  rural states have to change as this idea that you have the luxury to live outside the modern economy is part of their own problem.

This latter problem is less of an issue in modern than legacy since blue isn't so dominant, and you can't pitch it to force like you can in legacy.

"copypasta","t5_2r6z7","Today I attempted to insert a whole cantaloupe melon into my anus because the local shops had run out of apricots (I buy a lot). Using about a gallon of butter, breathing techniques and a few hours I managed to finally get it inside. However it was too uncomfortable so I tried to shit it back out. This is where things got confusing because rather than a melon sliding out half a dozen apricots did. Now there is a chance that I just blacked out upon excreting the cantaloupe and it rolled away somewhere and that I happened to have a dozen or so left over apricots lying around my rectum from earlier but I cannot for the life of me find the melon anywhere. I think I may have the power to anally turn melons into apricots. Further experimentation will be required of course (once my rectum has recovered) but if this turns out to be true then I may be able to solve world hunger.

"interestingasfuck","t5_2qhsa","&gt;I will start from the very beginning. About 1 1/2 years ago all I did was play video games. Every time we went somewhere, all I would think about would be going home so I could play more video games. Well, one day I had a sudden epiphany. I realized that I could be the absolute best at whatever video game, but in the end it still wouldn't mean much. I realized that, in the grand scheme of things, video games had no role to play. So, I changed my ways. Immediately I switched to the closet thing to video games in real life: science. At the time, all I knew was that I wanted to be smart. That was it.

Just to get through school you had to learn how to study hard, work long hours, and grind through work that you may or may not want to particularly be doing in that moment. That also means that we didn't have time to get in trouble, build up a complicated social and family life, or pick up a drug habit.  We show up on time(ish) and get the job done.  

We're critical thinkers and problem solvers first and foremost.  Our technical knowledge and ability to break problems down mean our solutions will be practical and actionable.  

If you've made it to 35+ as an engineer that means you're at the very least solidly mediocre in your field.  If you were to slide over to the business side or start work doing literally anything else you'd a gold star employee every day. 

You're not unemployable, you're just working for the wrong place.  Maybe pick up a job working in the blue collar wing in your industry.  The engineering background and experience means you'd probably walk on as field boss, even if it meant a pay cut.  

If you've got the cash on hand, maybe pick up a law degree and become a patent lawyer.  By all accounts 4 years in that field and you'll be making 5x what you're making now and come to... really appreciate the job you have now.  

Really want a change? Start slinging kettle corn outside of your local Bass Pro shop.  The guy outside of mine was an engineer that got laid off, and now makes 70-100k/year selling $8 bags of popcorn that cost him $1.30 +$500/yr to make.

Brad Dowdy is one of the owners of Nock co. (In addition to one of the hosts of “The Pen Addict” Podcast, the man behind the blog of the same name, and a million other things.) He is also the nicest person in the world of fountain pens. If you walk up to him and just say “Hi, this is my first pen show and some one told me that you were a good person to talk to” you will be swept up in a whirlwind of positivity. I know it sounds awkward, but I promise you he is the nicest guy at the show.

I’m not sure off the top of my head who is manning the table, but they have free stuff to give away to pen newbies, and just everyone will be super friendly and help you figure out what to look out for at the show. 

Also feel free to stop me and say hi. I am a giant with dark hair and a beard, and I’ll be wearing a blue shirt with a very iconically Baltimore brunt all over it tomorrow. I’ll be wandering the floor until around noon tomorrow (then in workshops.). I answer tot he name “Evan” if you need something to yell across a room.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I don’t listen to emo music, Nine Inch Nails isn’t emo music, the person originally commenting doesn’t know what the fuck emo music even is. Nine Inch Nails is industrial hard rock. He or she is calling it ‘emo’ (and it looks like you’re doing the same thing) because the lyrics to the song are ‘emotional,’ but emotional lyrics do not an emo song make. If so we’d have to consider Eminem emo on some songs, Hank Williams, Led Zepplin, Lynyrd fucking Skynyrd would be emo by that definition. 

From Wikipedia: “Emo originated in hardcore punk and is considered a form of post-hardcore.” 

Nine Inch Nails is pretty far from any version of hardcore punk or emo and I’m pretty sure anyone who listened to the band for five minutes would agree. The closest Nine Inch Nails song to emo I can think of is ‘March of the Pigs,’ which sounds absolutely, positively, *nothing* like ‘Hurt.’ And even calling that song emo is a crazy stretch. 

Referring to NIN as emo isn’t an opinion, it’s a fucking factual inaccuracy. The type of shit most people think of when they refer to emo is prototyped on albums like Weezer’s *Pinkerton*. You’re referring to a fairly specific sub genre with emo.

So when I said this person had never listened to emo music, I didn’t mean it in the way you seem to think I did. I’m not ‘gatekeeping’ emo music, because that would be fucking impossible since I don’t fucking *listen* to emo music. I’ve heard some, but it’s not my personal bag. Not a fan of Screamo either, but to each their own.

I’m saying this idiot doesn’t even know what emo music is, because it’s definitely not Nine Inch Nails.

The addiction comment was directed at the fact that they pontificated Trent Reznor has nothing to be sad about. 

The song (and album) are very much about self destruction with a number of references to addiction mentioned throughout. Their idea that one could have nothing to be sad about sounds like the musings of someone who’s never dealt with addiction. Either firsthand or seeing it consume a loved one. 

Not to mention, I’m perfectly within my rights to opine that your opinion is drivel. Just because something is subjective doesn’t make it beyond scrutiny. Everything you experience is subjective.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","I can't answer your India question but I want to challenge part of  your question in assuming that China is currently (or ever was) a monolingual country. 

Written Chinese (which, depending on when we are talking about, was also the form used in Korea, Japan, and Vietnam) is standardized*ish*. It is, however, not the same as Modern Standard Mandarin nor was it the same as the language which would have been used at court during any of the imperial dynasties 

Without getting into unacceptable-for-here anecdotes, a lack of quotable sources, or breaking the twenty year rule, 说普通话写规范字 Speak Putonghua (""the common language"" aka MSM) Write Standard Characters is an *ongoing* campaign. I've got photos of 30 year old propaganda posters for that but I've also got photos of 6 month old painted wall slogans.

To try to veer a little more into acceptable-for-here territory, Charlie Soong (father of a clan of impressive children including Madam Chiang Kai-shek) went from his native Hainan to Singapore, to the US, became a Christian, went to some very impressive schools, and then came back to China to work as a missionary in Shanghai. And failed. Miserably. Because, among other things, at the time the only language he could speak fluently which was understood in Shanghai was **English**.

Hainan in particular is a veritable clusterfuck of languages and the common tongue on Hainan (what a person from Sanya would use to speak to someone from Baoting prior to 1950 or then abouts) is Hainanhua. Wenchanghua, Haikouhua, Dinganhua are all basically Hainanhua but Li or Miao or Tanka or Danzhouhua range from if you squint funny it is sort of the same language group to probably a different language family altogether. 

Yet *all* of them, along with languages like Zanhae (Shanghai) use the same writing system. In the same way that writing in European languages is all Phoenician Alephbet based, the norm in Asia is/was Chinese character based writing systems.

A lack of a unique writing system for Hainanhua, educational materials, or a romanization system means that, despite 15 years on the island, I barely speak any Hainanhua. However, the first four or five sentences I learned was enough for me to realize that it's got different vocabulary and different grammar than Mandarin.

Overall, as travel and mass media (from the printed book to the radio) have become more common, we've seen a worldwide trend in the reduction of local languages (someone recently posted an excellent write up on Napoleonic soldiers not speaking a standard French) in favor of regional languages and regional languages in favor of national ones.

India just happens not to, so far, been as good at this as France or Germany. China has only been slightly better at it that India and mostly that's by convincing people who know nothing about Chinese languages (including rather a lot of Chinese people) that what most of the country *currently* have are regional ""accents"". These so-called accents which the government might deign to agree are ""dialects"" are sufficiently mutually unintelligible that movie theater movies have subtitles.",1551398685

"india","t5_2qh1q","The Indian Air Force went in, did their job and left. So that there won't be anymore Pulwamas. And the situation in Kashmir, though dire, is not something to be thrown around when the nation is in a war like scenario (Pulwama was Ana act of war).

You make it seem like there is no truth in the 'old stance of Pakistan Murdabad'. You make it seem that the fact that India has claimed again and again that it had passed on the proof to Pak about Balakot is not important at all. You make it seem Balakot wasnt on the US watch list for terror as per wikileaks. You make it seem that Pak is serious about JeM as it was serious about laden and Qaeda. You make it seem that Pulwama was some naxal like issue purely domestic and unsupported by Pak in any form.

So. Pulwama was a domestic problem. Balakot is Pakistan's innocent ""child"" - let it carry on with its terror camps (who cares who they kill? The important thing is Pakistan's feelings should not be hurt). The US DID find Laden in Pak but that's not really relevant to this problem. And also, let's not get into how many people were saved from terrorists because of the Indian Forces' action. Let's conveniently forget how Pak attacked our military instalments.

Cool.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","First, there are different degrees of enrichment of uranium. Weapons grade uranium is 95+% U-235. PWR or BWR fuel is 3% to 5%. Natural uranium is 0.7%, and this is what CANDUs burn.

And secondly, CANDUs produce plutonium. A substantial fraction of the total energy output of each fuel bundle is from plutonium burning, where the plutonium is produced *in situ* from fertile material being bombarded by neutrons. 

It's the plutonium production that freaks people out about CANDU as a proliferation risk.",1551398687

I think it's a little naive to suggest that the objective of any energy company (especially in an economically driven industry like nuclear) is anything but profit from the start. I think during commissioning economics definitely played a role and the pressure to build it in as shorter period of time as possible was likely highly important, but I think this is the case with a lot of nuclear; whether it be in past (at least when civil/commerical nuclear power production became feasible) or recently. But I think the glaring ommission of safety may be more of a cultural/political thing here, for example, why put the back up generator in the basement if you know there's a potential for tsunamis and flooding?

Regardless, hopefully you or someone else can use this comment in the future. 

As far as my situation is concerned, (scoliosis), my back pain that results because of this could not be managed through any of these programs without my twice daily stretching routine that I strictly adhere to whether it be a rest, or workout day on the schedule.  The hip flexors and hamstrings will do wonders for your back pain if their flexibility is increased.  I start on my back and pull my legs to my chest doing the various stretches you can do from this position with [this one](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRe4zzJP0hQdCTTnRsCl08Sn1GP7WM9STHp9e2dX4InXv1JcdFW) being of the most importance.  If you are unsure of what stretches to do you can use the LIFT4 rest day stretching workouts or youtube search for leg stretches to perform.  

I also make sure to do 30 [hip hinges](http://www.bloomsbury-osteopathy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LSPM13-Pelvic-Tilt-Stretching-and-Strengthening-Exercise.jpg) on my back, and 30 [cats and camels](https://www.whyiexercise.com/images/exercises.for.low.back.pain.cat.and.camel.jpg) to finish up the twice daily routine.  Consistency is key here, you claim that you don't want or expect any sympathy and I respect you for that, but I'm not gonna sugar coat it, stretching and flexibility along with these exercises will not produce results for you unless done at least once a day, (also do not expect the results to magically appear overnight it will take about a week or two of doing this to see increased flexibility and hopefully reduced back pain as a result). Once I made it part of my daily life my back pain has been in the rear view mirror.",1551398688

Just know that there are reports of Pilates showing a 'trend' of reducing scoliotic pain.

"hapas","t5_33rcf","Don't worry too much, man. Self awareness is a huge first step, so you're part of the way there. Before I had a son, I filled my mind worrying that I would project my insecurities onto him and that I had to do everything possible to prepare and protect him from them.  I was worried he would carry my negative traits and negative coping strategies.  After he was born though, I was so shocked at how utterly happy and innocent he was, with none of the flaws that gave me so much anxiety.   It changed my perspective that I just wanted to keep him that way-- keep him happy, by showing him that I was happy simply being myself around him and being a good person around others.  Every time I see him copy something good and exhibit a trait I value, it really keeps me going and keeps those anxieties away.

I grew up externally looking more white even though internally I felt like I was more Asian; I really prioritized external recognition of being Asian (I grew up in a city with a huge Asian population and 95% of my family growing up was on my Asian side), so the disconnect between how I was treated and accepted by others compared with how I felt inside bothered me for a long time. I understand where you're coming from.  

I had times in my youth when I resented being Asian and I had times when I resented being white.  At some point in my around 30 I stopped being so bothered by these feelings and trying to force myself to be seen as one over the other.  I recognized that my racial identity was like... a quantum superposition,of all things, where the racial identity I was judged on was always relative to the observer.  When no one was observing or judging and i was left to myself, I would always be both simultaneously, even though the world is wired to see in binary of one or the other.  Who I was, when i was by myself, was always the most important and was the only aspect of my identity that I had absolute control of.  You can't control how people see you or treat you, but you can definitely control how you let it affect you.  You alone know what you like, what you're comfortable with, and that you're a good person.  

What race or culture people see you being is only one super tiny aspect of who you are.  I would personally rather be recognized for being smart, being kind, being patient, being strong, being compassionate, being curious... over being recognized for just ""being Asian"".  ""Being Asian"" or super in tune with Asian stuff means very little compared with those other highly positive personal qualities.  

It's obviously easier to say than do and experience, but most of us do eventually get there.  Just about every multiracial person I've known or grew up with had these similar identity issues, but we all eventually grew out of it as we got older.  I think a lot of posters in this sub are in their teens and twenties, so there's an over-representation of people still on their self identity journeys, processing a lot of challenging emotions and questions, occasionally manifesting itself by negatively lashing out in a lot of posts.  Some might be in a phase where they're negatively blaming and hating whites or women, others might have gone past that phase and become more pragmatic in their dealings.

Finally, I bet she's convincing people to support left-wing policies.

That is the only question. Any P5 school will be in the Playoffs if they win out and therefore have a chance at the championship. It may be unlikely but it is possible. BYU is in a weird limbo area where they are close and could be in. There might be a program or 2 that plays a rough enough schedule that they could sneak in with some luck. 

Some people call the P5/G5 distinction arbitrary but that is what is the real distinction. If you know that every year if you win out you will be in the playoff, then you are P5. ",1551398694

I do know she won't change and know it's fucked up. It's typical - abusers need to be nice at least part of the time. 

I live cross-country and was moving to VLC or NC. The dying thing makes it a bit harder - plus another complicating factor is that my family has life-changing amounts of money in a trust and I'm paying off a loan they gave me for a house, so it's harder to yell ""F\* Y'ALL!"" If my family had no money, I could much more easily walk away. I don't think my step-father will play GC/SG as much, and if he does it's easier to just have VLC. 

I don't really care that much about my relationship with my brother - we've had very little relationship for the past few years and I thought we were building up one, but f\* that noise. 

If I go visit again, I need to go knowing it will be for me and fulfilling the obligations I feel like I have - not any final bonding.

I think this was a good message, but I do want to add the caveat that it's not always a dichotomy of either being right or having love.

My deconstruction started with [this TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_honey_on_god_and_the_tsunami?language=en) by Tom Honey, in which he put forward an idea of God quite different to what I had grown up with (God is not an interventionalist God, effectively).

[The Liturgist Podcast](http://www.theliturgists.com/podcast) then provided most of the push to move through my deconstruction, and probably had the largest single impact from a piece of media. It moved me from trying to hold onto many more traditional aspects of Christianity as being necessary, to more freely exploring my faith.

In terms of books though, Bishop John Spong's book: ['Why Christianity must Change or Die'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80209.Why_Christianity_Must_Change_or_Die) has had the largest impact. It largely articulated what I was thinking at the time, and helped me put my faith at the end of my deconstruction into a framework of sorts. However, Spong does have, and articulates, quite an unorthodox view of Christianity- if you're unaware of him- so it may not help if you hold a more orthodox view or if your deconstruction is leading you down a more orthodox path than mine did.",1551398695

That’s no different than, say, posting an ad on a message board at a gun club or shooting range, which isn’t covered in this bill at all.  Arranging a sale and *making* a sale are not the same thing, and you’re a fool if you conflate them.

What this bill addresses are *sales* on websites like Gun Broker and Cheaper Than Dirt, which—again—is already a subject addressed in existing law.

&gt; Private sales are not subject to background checks and this bill makes them so.

Again, no it doesn’t.

&gt; Dude come on.  Maybe where you live gun shows are only FFL conventions

I didn’t say that.  I said the people who populate the sales floor are almost always FFLs.  Nobody is going to pay for space to sell firearms unless they have enough firearms to cover the cost of joining the venue.  Who is going to do that?  Not the guy looking to offload an old rifle he doesn’t want anymore.

"CivVI","t5_346b8","I think it's disingenuous to include Stalin and Hitler in the same sentence here, and that triggered the other person and gave them an easy way out. Hitler's systemic extermination of Jewish people was unforgivable, horrible, and blatantly fascist in a way that used colonial tactics at home on a grand scale. 

People argue that both Stalin and Churchill are responsible for famines, that both had problematic views and toxic ideologies. Hitler is a different ballgame.

Though murderous colonialism and imperialism were something both Winston and Teddy practiced, a loose parallel to the USSR's Eastern Bloc and Warsaw Pact, people regard treating your own citizens that way and so rapidly genociding a specific race on purpose to be the most evil. 

Stalin's treatment of USSR citizens is a very contentious topic, but he (despite many claims to the contrary) wasn't systemically genociding a race like Hitler did. I agree that Churchill and Roosevelt can be regarded somewhat like Stalin when it comes to acceptability, but not that Hitler should be regarded like any of them.

Also, contemporarily, there are a lot of Nazi sympathizers that happily champion Hitler. Stalinist ""tankies"" are rare and maligned. I think it would be ideologically irresponsible to allow pro-Hitler people to play as Hitler.",1551398696

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","So you’re telling me that cattle raised in a factory farm setting have an important role in the ecosystem? They produce manure that’s about it, aside form the negative impacts on their environment. We are not discussing other ruminants here, because that has literally nothing to do with factory farming, so it doesn’t matter what impact they have because that isn’t what this discussion is about, try to stay on topic.

You do realize that their deaths are painful and not to mention, incredibly stressful. They are put on filthy feedlots where they can only lie in their own shit and eat so they can gain weight quickly, they are packed onto cattle cars and semis and carted for long distances all smashed in together, shitting all over each other in all kinds of weather, and then they are brought to a packing plant where they can smell the death that surrounds them. Ever seen videos of it? Absolutely disturbing and they know. The reason bison are difficult to farm is that their biology is such that their terror causes certain chemicals to be released in their bodies which destroys the meat. This happens so often that slaughtering them on a mass scale is really expensive because the whole animal worth of meat is ruined. So tell me again that they don’t know and they don’t feel it. Quit trying to fool yourself. If you eat meat you need to accept that you are eating animals which have suffered. Humans are omnivores so I wouldnt tell anyone that they couldnt eat meat because we are biologically capable of doing so, but to pretend that it the animals dont have feelings or feel pain is some weak shit man. Own it and deal with it and accept your role in it. ",1551398696

The TBT-7M, UZL-5P, BSW-P1, -S2, and -X2 can also run some variation of the build above.

The [GRF-2N](https://mwo.smurfy-net.de/mechlab#i=300&amp;l=5d8cb7d9291d34b05b1afcbaa0b94ff7ab2b66a5) can do it with ECM.

Several variants of Kintaro, Shadowhawk, and Wolverine can also run variations of the build.

The CHP-1N, and -1N2, and the QKD-4H can all do variations of the build.

Almost all of the Roughnecks, and several Thunderbolts can run a variation of the build, as can the Archer.

The [WHM-7S](https://mwo.smurfy-net.de/mechlab#i=384&amp;l=6dacf416004ef0956de4ef4c779ea2f37efc6268) runs a particularly deadly version of the build.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Thats an interesting idea for OC's, though it may be a bit much, maybe start OC's with 0 energy then?  But its definitely in the vein I'm thinking.  Another idea would be a ""totally not a hallucinated phoenix"" scouting drone that casts for much less than scan but, obviously, can be shot down.  Would be a great scouting tool early when you're trying to see your opponents build, since a big limitation of scan is the fact that while its unstoppable, the ability to just see an entire base is weaker than halluc.

I think a better idea for mines would be an upgrade like in the campaign, which reduces friendly splash from terran stuff (mines, shredder missiles, tanks).  Mines need splash to be good, but in the theme of ""dont buff their early game too much"" limit it to be something that appears later on, but make it cheap.

The tech queuing thing is a QOL for every race, and frankly not one I think they're going to explore, and I dont think autocasting MULES is totally necessary, since energy management wont be an issue anymore, remembering not to cap wont be hard.",1551398696

"DMT","t5_2qhvk","The ""everyone sees elves"" thing is a bit of a myth, you don't need to look hard at all to find trip reports that don't mention them. I do think there's an element of suggestion, yeah. Combined with how vague the term ""elf"" can be, it's pretty easy to see any sort of slender or short weird-looking human thing and make the ""elf"" connection, especially if you've heard the same thing from others.

I'm sure you can find trip reports that involve Jesus and similar, but the thing is that any figures you see on a trip are probably going to look *weird*. This makes Jesus less likely because we have a pretty specific cultural image of what Jesus looks like, whereas a whole rainbow of weird-lookin' dudes could be an elf or an alien or a hypothetical mesoamerican-looking god figure.

Final note, breakthrough trips are really abstract in a way that's hard to describe. A lot of trip reports are written in way that's made to be relatable and entertaining, but these will by necessity be more concrete and matter-of-fact than the actual trip experience. You pretty much have to connect some dots and use similes and metaphor to get something more than ""It was like....*fuck*""",1551398696

Carbs are not evil. You shouldn't eat only carbs anyway or you're gonna have problems, but you can say the same of fats or proteins too. Nutrition has more to do with balancing your bodies needs with what you eat, which ALSO relates to how much you exercise, what kind of exercise, all that stuff. 

You shouldn't eat an abhorrent amount of carbs, but that doesn't make them inherently bad. I mean. Carbs are in vegetables. If you ate only veggies and meat, you would probably be fine. 

I think you're saying carbs and meaning specifically stuff like breads and candy and pasta and ramen and fries (a starchy vegetable) (now fried in tasty fats), and not thinking of the carbs in stuff like Greek yogurt and spinach and milk.

Draw calls are extremely important and AMD is just flat out slower at it. I highly recommend you go Intel if you're seriously thinking of getting into game development for VR. Ask VR dev's like Anton Hand or, Davevillz. They will tell you to go Intel/NVDA.

I recommend you learn what drawcalls are and how to optimize them as they're very important for VR and gaming in general. 

[Here's a great article on Drawcalls](https://medium.com/@toncijukic/draw-calls-in-a-nutshell-597330a85381)

[Here's a brief view of how they are important in VR.](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/dg-performance-guidelines/)

edit: just to be clear, do not get more cores confused with better. VR is all about single core performance and AMD is far behind with that. The thread ripper has a completely unnecessary amount of cores, it is an arguably bad way to go in the development of CPUS.

""I'm not one of those players who is blessed with Theo Walcott's pace who can run behind you. When I'm on the ball, I have to get close to [the defender], which is going to cause him to attempt to tackle me or mistime it as we have seen in the past. That is part of my game.""",1551398700

Back when that episode happened where Goten and Trunks wanted to make a wish with the Dragonballs I got that idea that it would be neat if they someday decided to actually go get that wish and wondering what to wish for they'd realize that neither of them had met their saiyan grandparents.

So shenanigans ensue, King Vegeta and Bardock would show up in front of them ( I didn't really have Gine in mind back then since Father of Goku Bardock was still very much my preference) and obviously have no intent to listen to a word these children say ... 

and then they get their asses kicked and over the course of the arc they come to accept the little guys and befriend them all while Goku and Vegeta are away training with Whis and have no idea of any of this happening until the end of the arc when K. Vegeta and Bardock have to leave again for ... plot ... reasons and both families get to have a big party together, Vegeta gets to relieve some of those daddy issues and Goku gets to meet(and most importantly: fight) his actual dad and that in turn inspires Goku to quickly hit up old witchy B. so he can introduce his sons to the man that raised him. 


But yeah, our chances to ever see any of the old guys again have flown right out of the window. 

An F in chat for our fallen heroes and villains: King Vegeta, Bardock, Gine, Raditz, Nappa, Cell, Yamcha, Grandpa Gohan and Farmer with a shotgun. Bye guys.

My biggest tips are to stay hydrated, sometimes you cant bring water so like get enough water consistently the days before so you can last. Also in the pit you should be doing what everyone else is doing if you stand still and everyone is jumping or moving you might get hurt its way better to just move along with the crowd and hold your ground with your feet if you want to take a break. Fighting against the crowd when there was pushing was way more tiring than just going with it. Also you’re never trapped, if you need to leave for any reason let someone know and they will all help you out and move out of the way to let you pass. 

I would bring as little as possible onto the floor, in a small drawstring or in a zipped pocket. I like having only the essentials so I dont need to keep track of too many things.

"consolemasterrace","t5_2weqc","I never said Mobile was better, I was just giving a small explanation why that one was higher despite arguably being the worst platform. Are you trying to say their aren’t people like that on consoles? 

I’m doubting that you play on pc. Those options are there for multiple reasons, partly because some people want higher frame rate, partly so you can adjust it until to you it looks best, and partly for people with weak pcs. Yes you can choose two options on consoles, two. That’s it and I am aware that they exist. Which is why I said actual options, full customization. On consoles can you change resolution and some have enriched visuals options but you basically get two presets for most games, mean while every thing is fully and customizable, and can be customized individually. things like texture quality, poly count, particle effects, resolution ( more than two options) and in the case of gta v and a few other games the population density of the streets. You don’t get those options on consoles.

Ok

https://youtu.be/_-YLM_q9kiU this one, the one I sent you earlier and you came back saying there was no parts list without even checking the description

Yes I forgot consoles do indeed have a few rts games. Thanks I’ll check it out, pc has ace combat as well, I’ve enjoyed it so far.

I’ve played games from the 80s and some a few years older on my pc, plus I have access to all the PS3 back compat games through emulation. But I agree I owned a PS3 and still do before I switched to pc, by far my favorite console that I ever owned.

Rust actually officially released last year, pretty sure everything before was early access but correct me if I’m wrong, and it still looks gorgeous. Yes SC2 is old but it still holds up very well today and is still a big game today because of esports. It has great longevity. Yes digital combat simulator, yes it is old but yet again it still holds up incredibly well even today. All of these games still regularly get updated (actually not sure about DCS) and rust gets new content regularly. All three games are still active.

Go on steam and look around, you’ll find them. Imagine trying to sift through all of the pc exclusives, it can’t be done. In fact it is so hard that you’d be very hard pressed just to find a list of them all, let alone a modern list. The only list I’ve ever seen has a link that doesn’t work anymore sadly. AAA does not equal high quality, you need to get that misconception out of your head. Not to mention when has goty ever meant anything? For example how about last years goty god of war? Yes it’s a good game I’ve played through it myself. But it gets repetitive using the same puzzles, the same enemies (most of the time just with upped health), most of the bosses are reskins of the first, and the game was very predictable and had no replay value. Yes it was a good game, a great game actually and I liked it the first time. But there was a lot it could’ve done better. 

The pc version of Terraria has more content, same with Minecraft, tf2 etc. due to being updated more and more frequently. Last I checked pc is not a year behind on updates for gta v, could you provide a link?

I already did, the YouTube link. That pc does out perform the console on most gamers and won’t require an upgrade for about a console gen. I haven’t been avoiding you just haven’t been paying attention.

No I’m not. Used games hurt the companies just as much as piracy buddy, if not more because of how much more it happens than piracy. Which is why in the terms of service on the PS4 it says that you cannot re sell any hardware or soft ware (including game disks) because it hurts the gaming industry. Also steam key distributors exist. I know the consoles get discounts, but not for as much off or as often or as wide spread as steam sales. Not to mention you need to pay for psn just to get slightly more off of a game you buy. If you think those sales compare at all to steam sales then maybe you should try playing on pc.

If you can only find one then maybe you should follow your own advice and do some research. 

And you do realize the optimization on pc is about as good as it is on consoles right? Not to mention the fact that the last of us didn’t require that much ram in the first place. And both platforms have about an equal amount of poorly optimized games, for example skyrim on the PS3, shadow of Mordor on the PS3, and Crysis 1 on both the Xbox 360 and PS3. Consoles have lost the plug and play argument buddy, you plug pc in download and install game/updates and play. On consoles you plug in console put in game download from disk and download updates and install game, if its online you also have to pay for that which is an extra step.

Stop being a console peasant, look things up, stop spreading misinformation about pc and consoles to make consoles seem better and just educate your self in general because in your current state your logic and arguments are laughable at best. 

I’ll tell you what if you give me 5 OBJECTIVE reasons, valid objective reasons that have no counter argument about why console is better, then I will tell you that I was wrong and leave. But it’s not gonna happen, because there aren’t 5 objective reasons, there’s like 2. And they’re small reasons that don’t affect anything much like “you don’t have to install steam so that saves you a couple seconds”",1551398702

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","It was really hard to stop eating back calories!! Just realizing ‘hey, do I want progress or do I want a snack because I’m no longer full’ is a reasonable question to ask if I’m at my calorie cap. I think exercise does make you hungrier in the beginning but once you stop giving in its a little easier... I think haha.

(FTR a lot of people push their eating window incrementally— eat breakfast an hour later for a week, then 2, etc., but do your research and maybe talk to your dr) 

I work mostly from home and actually prefer to cook my own meals. I’m also freelance and building a career (read: basically unemployed and contribute very little currently) so eating less is also part saving money. 

Me? Right now I eat half a brick of tofu (cut into large cubes and lovingly browned on each 6 sides, tossed with soy sauce at the end when the heat is off)  w/ 2 cups frozen veggies for lunch, plus a light and fit Greek yogurt, and a protein bar or muscle milk light. Lately since it’s been cold out here in LA I’ve taken to roasting potato wedges (cut from a medium sized ol russet) with a tsp olive oil and salt + pepper and I bake a chicken sausage, with a salad of romaine, tomato, English cucumber, and a little rice vinegar on the side. Snacks are usually almonds (16 for 111 calories are surprisingly satisfying), or an egg or two basted in a nonstick pan, maybe with toast. Sometimes peanut butter on a rice cake but I’m beginning to think pb is a trigger food 😪 (Most of what I eat is from Costco, FYI)

My meal plan wouldn’t work for everyone but! I currently am on that ‘I know what I’m eating, I know it’s working’ vibe which I’m sure will fade. Like, I look forward to my daily tofu right now. I’ll change up my meals soon just to make sure I’m eating the right things and getting a variety and tbh— def want to avoid disordered eating.

That said, I think you should be prepared for the fallout if this situation goes south. If your boss finds out you told his wife, can you weather that storm or find another place to go? If he doesn't find out, will you be perpetually anxious assuming that he will?

"CompetitiveEDH","t5_2y62p","Without the willingness to upgrade your mana base with better lands and mana rocks like [[mana crypt]] and [[mox opal]] for instance, cEDH isnt the right place for this deck. He is a fun commander no doubt (I built him and I will link my deck to this comment later) unfortunately hes just too narrow to be competitive. Your removal looks more or less fine (maybe some artifact and enchantment control aura shards is good for that) and you have about as many counter spells youll be willing to afford.

To be honest with you, and this isnt meant to be mean or anything, but your deck is kinda a mess. if a land enters tapped, replace it for one that doesnt. There are budget ones available. shocks, pain, ceck, bb, and filter are all affordable.  First, since [[arcades]] is good at one thing which is defender tribal, cut things that dont have anything to do with that like lab-man and [[temur sabertooth]] for some enchantments that help you ramp or maybe elvish piper to cheat things out.  Second, you need more card draw and mana rocks. The [[signets]] are good for you and cards like [[ponder]] fit right in. Id also recommend running some stax pieces like  [[propaganda]] [[sphere of safety]] and maybe even [[stoney silence]] you could even go [[winter orb]] if you really wanted to go stax route.  Since your win stratagy is to deal damage with defenders faster than your opponents can block it, you need things to make creatures unblockable as well. Especially since you dont have red to give them haste. Also, the card [[high alert]] should be included as well as some enchantments that protect your creatures like [[asceticism]]. 


I suggest you go over to r/EDH and ask for some help with a budget tuned deck. cEDH is kinda different format than regular commander. You should also get a [[shield sphere]]. Its a top wall that can be played turn one. [[Glacial wall]] and [[menomic wall]] are also top choices. 

Other good cards for you are big artifact creatures and things with affinity to reduce their casting cost. 

Colossus of akros

Blightsteel collousus 

Darksteel collosus

Mycosynth golem  

Foundry inspector

Chief engineer

The bant colored gearhulks are good budget too. Its important to have big dangerous guys without defender for when arcades isnt on the field. He will be removed more frequently than you hope. 

Finally, get some stuff that synergizes with walls like heralds horn.

Some general advice about deck building is that if you are going to play combos, your deck has to be centered around those combos. If you just throw in random peices that you might get to combo with but otherwise do nothing, you are wasting space. This is what makes cedh different than regular commander where top decking and playing what you draw is a fine strategy. In the future, if you decide that a CEDH deck is in your budget and want to stay with green-blue-white Bant colors, I would suggest derevi stax or roon stax for a cheaper version.",1551398703

"australia","t5_2qh8e","It’s not that simple sometimes - ex-Government IT buyer here. 

Depending on where you work the rules might vary, but to approach the market formally you usually have to draft up detailed scope notes for an open tender, or pick from pre-panelled companies and offerings. Both suck, because you might not ever get close to that cool new software devd by that trendy new company. 

Also, the big established companies already know this - they have whole teams dedicated to making sure they win government tenders - but they aren’t necessarily the best. 

Of course the good buyers in government will already be making contacts in the market to figure out what’s new and good out there - but here’s where it gets tricky - that isn’t really supported by the processes and rules. You kind of just have to do it off your own back and pre-apologise to people that have great solutions, because now they have to become experts in government procurement rules before they can officially start talking to you again. And even if they invest all those time and resources, they still might make no money - they need to compete with the big guys, not on merit but on processes and documentation. 

This is a good new feature of procurement, because it lets buyers officially ask software companies to come make a pitch. I’m sure it’s still bureaucratic AF but at least it lets us do what any private company would do if they want to try something new, and want to shop the market for the best. ",1551398704

I would like to say, that for many a relationship fluctuates on what the emphasis is. At times I cannot get enough sex with my SO. At others... I just want to go out and do fun things with him! Perhaps this is what is happening. Maybe she is just really feeling social and excited about getting out of the house and unfortunately with the limited time you two have together, getting back home and in the bed is just not ending up happening. 

It is 100% a good sign that she wants to hug, kiss and touch. That leads me to believe that what I just mentioned is actually the issue and there is no actual aversion to sex going on. 

As scary as it is, you just need to talk to her. I would go into it assuming that the above is what is happening. She probably has no idea you are feeling this way and would love to help you realize that she still wants you sexually. ",1551398705

"PleX","t5_2ql7e","AMD's equivalent video encoding is basically non-existent in the discussion of Plex. Intel Quick Sync Video (QSV) is where you are going to want to look. The current gen of Intel CPU's you'd probably want to look at is detailed on Wikipedia pretty nicely:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee\_Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Lake)

The first place you will want to look is at the wikipedia page for Intel Quick in the section that details what each gen can handle for codec encoding/decoding: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel\_Quick\_Sync\_Video#Hardware\_decoding\_and\_encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Quick_Sync_Video#Hardware_decoding_and_encoding)

Once you have looked that over and rightfully concluded that you'll want to look at Kaby, Gemini, Coffee, or Cannon Lake CPU's, then scratch Kaby (old) and Cannon (only one crappy CPU) off that list and go directly to Gemini or Coffee.

Gemini Lake CPU's: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldmont\_Plus#List\_of\_Goldmont\_Plus\_processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldmont_Plus#List_of_Goldmont_Plus_processors)

Coffee Lake CPU's: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee\_Lake#List\_of\_8th\_generation\_Coffee\_Lake\_processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Lake#List_of_8th_generation_Coffee_Lake_processors)

If you want to build your own for cheap, I'd suggest looking at the Pentium Gold G5500 and G5600. Compared to the other cheap CPU's, they'll have the faster UHD 630 GPU's, which does the hardware encoding. You'll notice even the considerably more expensive 8700k has the same UHD 630 GPU included, which is pretty funny since they'll have nearly the same hardware encoding performance despite the price difference. Because of that, it makes very little sense to go expensive if you intend to hardware encode.

The CPU in the NUC7CJYH in my prior post is the Gemini Celeron J4005. There is a slightly more expensive NUC called the NUC7PJYH that uses the Pentium P5005.

Here's a great [Lon.TV video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o82NWFnoDZw&amp;t=208s) where he runs Plex on the Celeron J4005 and gets 3 transcodes going on it. He talks about the J5005 a little later in the video.",1551398705

&gt;and asked them about **the impact that their adult children were having on their own retirement plans**

The impact of supporting someone would be the marginal costs associated with them. The impact would be the difference between no adult child, and an adult child. The question isn't *""If you were trying to teach your adult child about life how much would you estimate this standard of living should cost them?""*

The article has nothing to do with the expected cost of living for an adult, and so showing what ""reality costs"" is not really the point of the article at all. 

&gt;Arguing ""you would have to pay for X whether or not I was here and using it"" is the weak, freeloader argument.

I'm not arguing it, I'm saying it's not an incremental cost. It's not a weak, freeloader argument. You just don't understand the argument I am making. 

This kind of response directly highlights a major issue with this article though - it's self-reported and so it's hard to tell if respondents understood the questions being posed to them. The article makes it sound like there's no issue with the survey by talking about the polling method but doesn't cover this major weakness. ",1551398705

Not to mention American TV shows and their camera angles would be different from what they're used to in Korea.

"politics","t5_2cneq","First let me say the whole birthism thing is dumb. However it is a bit more complicated than that. It's been awhile since I've looked at all the details, but here's the gist:

At the time of Obama's birth, the American parent couldn't pass down American citizenship unless they had lived in the USA for at least 10 years (or some amount of years) AFTER their 16th birthday. Since Obama's mother was only 16 or so when she had Obama, she wouldn't have transferred citizenship to Obama if he had been born in Kenya (which he wasn't, so the point is moot but still). This law was changed at some point and it is also why Cruz is eligible, since his parents lived in the USA long enough after their 16th birthday to pass citizenship on to him even though he was born in Canada.

IRONICALLY, McCain wasn't technically eligible to be president, because he was born in Panama, which due to the laws at the time, didn't count towards military bases or some such and even though his parents were American's they hadn't lived in the USA recently enough to pass on citizenship anymore (or something like that). Here's an article that briefly explains it: https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/us/politics/11mccain.html

Even more ironically, the Senate passed a nonbinding resolution that stated McCain was eligible to be president. Guess who voted for that resolution? You'd be right if you guessed Obama.

The whole thing is so dumb it boggles the mind. But I hope this gives you an idea of why there's at least SOME debate about whether Obama would have been eligible IF he had been born outside of the USA (which he wasn't, so it doesn't matter).

Thank you for reading.",1551398708

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Some of those are f2p, which is different. For instance, I tried POE like 8 different times and finally felt like it had what I wanted last year, so that is the first time they got money from me.

The real issue for me though, is that bugs aside, anthem faces the exact same gameplay/loot issues as those games, as in the devs for those other games already provided an idea of what is good and not. Why, was it ever possible to get local pistol damage on a rifle? D3 did something similar, and changed to smart loot for ROS, in 2014.

Anthem has potential, as the javs feel pretty cool and distinct, and it looks great. It's that so many of these other systems clearly needed more iteration before launch. If they had put all of the work they have on their roadmap into the game, and then did the demo/launch, the reception would be so much better, and they could build on that foundation.

TLDR Making the exact same mistakes as those games you mentioned is the central issue. ",1551398709

A friend of mine who I used to hang out with all the time is getting married. I used to hang out with him all the time. A lot of fun, drunken nights. 

A couple of years ago, my friend started dating his future wife and since day one of dating, my friend has fallen off the face of the planet outside of text messaging. He refuses to hang out when I have invited him to do stuff numerous times. Now, when all my friends get together, normally beer is involved and he said he doesnt drink anymore. That would be a fine excuse but he gets a monthly delivery of whiskey and drinks that all the time. 

I feel like I should have stopped inviting him out to things a long time ago butt he's still my friend and i dont like giving that cold shoulder.

Fast forward to today. I receive an invititation to go to his wedding. I told him I am not going to go. He is upset with this news. It's been a long running joke with my friends on what excuse he will provide when he declines an invitation from us but I'm not allowed to decline going to his wedding. AITA?

"Coffee","t5_2qhze","While the Sage has PID, so will maintain a stable temperature better, it could be ""one more thing to go wrong."" The gaggia is far more serviceable, and you'll find a lot of info online for brewing tips from people who have used them for years. If you really want a PID, there are conversion kits for the gaggia. Similar for if you want a different steam wand: you can change the gaggia's cheaply and easily.

It's a bit like apple vs android. Both will do a mighty fine job straight out of the box, Sage has some more bells and whistles while Gaggia will let you tinker and customise

"guns","t5_2qhc8","For your first optic probably just stick to a red dot. It’s just a dot so it’s plain and simple so it’s easier to learn with. Considering you’ll be learning and I don’t know your budget I’d start off with a Holosun optic. If you don’t mind spending a few extra hundred then go for a Trijicon red dot (not an Acog), Aimpoint or EOTech. Personally I think Holosun is equivalent, if not better, in quality to Aimpoint and EOTech now and Holosun is cheaper. You’re really just paying for the decades of military usage so the brand name is a chunk of the price when you buy EOTech and Aimpoint. The ruggedness and tech quality seems to be pretty damn equal in my opinion with Holosun (the tech even seems better) and seemingly everyone that uses a Holosun or does reviews and torture tests including claims by Holosun themselves. A company to watch I’d say. People don’t realize it but their prices have increased a lot per optic over the past few years. I’d stray away from an Acog or any scoped optic as your first AR optic personally. ",1551398711

Any country with a population larger than Iceland is inevitably going to have hot and cold spots in their economy. Hell, every individual city has hot and cold areas economically speaking. 

Honestly if you want separate currencies might as well have separate states at that point. Why do BC and Ontario or Quebec need to be in the same country to begin with? Confederation was primarily driven by the need to resist further invasion and annexation attempts from the US. Since that’s no longer a consideration there might not be as many advantages to being part of a large nation.

On the other hand, small states generally are easily manipulated and bullied when it comes to trade. Hence the EU being such a good deal for its small members.",1551398712

"alcoholicsanonymous","t5_2s3xd","What makes me an alcoholic is that when I start drinking I can’t guarantee you how much I will drink every time and when I honestly want to stop for good I am unable to on my own power. By that standard, I used weed alcoholicly. 

I used any mood or mind altering substance I ever enjoyed in an alcoholic manner. Every time I tried to stop drinking, tried to kick dope, tried to not use whatever was becoming a problem at that point in my life, if I was using some other substance to fill the empty, aching space I felt inside my mind that begged for a buzz, I would inevitably wind up compromising and caving in, emerging remorseful as ever from yet another miserable spree. 

I realized I had to completely abstain from all mind and mood altering substances if I wanted to avoid going back through that again, but when I tried to stay stopped I repeatedly found I lacked any sufficient defense against the first drink, drug, whatever. At some point that ache inside my mind that needed to be filled with some kind of buzz would win out and I would go through the whole cycle again. 

My only hope was to achieve a complete rearrangement of my thinking - to replace that almost constant, desperate longing to change my internal condition with something more powerful, something that would keep me from living consumed with the obsession to use and drink. Once I reached that point I realized I was completely hopeless unless I could somehow achieve the necessary internal change to overcome that flawed thinking and therefore had completely accepted Step 1. After accepting Step 2, making the commitment of Step 3, honoring that commitment by doing 4-8 and starting 9 I realized the obsession had left me and that nagging need inside my mind that always needed to be tended to had been replaced by a power greater than myself; I had recovered from a seemingly hopeless state of mind and body. 

My only hope today is to continue to grow and maintain this state by continuing to take personal inventory, seeking guidance and power through prayer and meditation, practicing these principles in everything I do and carrying the message of my complete psychic change (my spiritual awakening) to those who still suffer. It’s not a struggle, but an automatic response to life, much like the obsessions to use and drink was for me for 20 years. ",1551398712

Using about a gallon of butter, breathing techniques and a few hours I managed to finally get it inside. However it was too uncomfortable so I tried to shit it back out. This is where things got confusing because rather than a melon sliding out half a dozen apricots did. Now there is a chance that I just blacked out upon excreting the cantaloupe and it rolled away somewhere and that I happened to have a dozen or so left over apricots lying around my rectum from earlier but I cannot for the life of me find the melon anywhere. I think I may have the power to anally turn melons into apricots.

At level 11, they both would have level 3 spells as the max they could cast. The ranger could do 4 1st level spells, 3 2nd level spells, and 3 3rd level spells per day. The artificer would be able to cast 3 spells per short rest.

If you somehow manage to do the recommended 6 encounters per day with 2 short rests, ranger and artificer would end up casting about the same number of spells in total. Most games usually only have 3-5 encounters per day and just one short rest, meaning the ranger is tends to be better off in terms of overall spellcasting. Even if you do manage two short rests per day, the artificer only slightly edges out the ranger in terms of overall power of their spells.

On top of that, the limited spell slot number would mean that using low level spells like expeditious retreat, shield, or arcane strike have a much greater opportunity cost for the artificer than they do for the ranger. For example, at level 11, an  artificer that uses one of their 3 slots on shield, only has two slots left until their next short rest. A ranger on the other hand can use a first level slot on shield and still have 3 remaining 1st level slots, and not even touched their higher level slots.

The change would make the artificer feel more unique and make their spells feel more like actual devices that could be repaired/recreated during a short rest rather than some weird archaic daily recharge slot. ",1551398712

Not sure where you're getting this from, but ""Ally"" has nothing to do with being in the closet.

"toronto","t5_2qi63","I don't know the costs to use it, you're right.  It's far from the only building in southern Ontario that is abandoned and could be used for a lot of those scenes however.  I do pass it often and it rarely seems to be in use.  I did discover a few things not on that list in my research as well.

They did apply for a demolition permit at one point which has now expired.  The contract did state the that the film studio had first purchase rights as per their contract and an outside firm did evaluate the market value of the property.  OPG like all corporations doesn't want major liabilities on it's books so selling it makes sense.

Financially, there will be a time where it's more financially sensible for the current owners to tear it down and sell or develop the land.  Sometime in the future, it will require an astronomical amount of money repair the building to a state where it's even safe for filming.  Without heat, buildings will rapidly deteriorate and the amount of water in it isn't helping.  This will likely be further than 10 years out but I'm damn certain it will happen.

No, I'm saying that generally one country doesn't outperform the world very often, but when it does it's probably for a good run, like ten years.  So imagine the scenario where Canada outperforms in years 1-10, then tracks on par years 10-30.  You've lost a huge chunk of your starting growth and will have a far smaller valuation at the end.

"politics","t5_2cneq","
&gt;I agree, and automatic weapons and explosive ammunition are banned. What you're describing is called the assault weapon ban of 1986. This ""compromise"" was already made. By asking for more bans you're asking for further erosion of the rights we ""compromised"" to keep. By using undefined terms like ""assault type weapons"" when there is an actual legally defined ""assault weapon / assault rifle"" what you're saying is that you believe technology that was deemed below the danger threshold in 1986 in comparison to assault rifles is now somehow too dangerous to be left on the streets despite crime statistics showing the opposite. 

Glad we agree on the premise. I don't see any reason we take the 1986 law as infallible non-negotiable gospel. Laws change all the time. I think we could improve this law. Maybe we could unban guns that are unjustly banned too.

&gt;&gt;I get it, as fast as you pull the trigger. Can't different guns with stand longer and more frequent bursts because of how some heat up and malfunction worse than others? 

&gt;What you're asking about is barrel build quality, which is completely unreglated, and no proposed laws have called for limitations to be placed on barrel build quality. Also the cheapest barrels can withstand about 800 rounds of automatic fire before failing.

OK, maybe we can advocate for barrel build quality being limited. What do you think should a gun available for the public should be limited to in that respect? 

&gt;&gt; Also, there are many tools and add-ons that convert semi autos (as fast as you pull the trigger) into nearly fully auto (bump stocks, cranks, see Vegas shooting). 
&gt;
&gt;And every such method of doing so is banned. 

Bumpstocks just got banned. Why was that OK to add in if you thought 1986 law should settle it? 

&gt;&gt;I'm saying maybe we should limit mag size to 10 rounds or something. 
&gt;
&gt;None of these shooters ever used standard capacity magazines, its always the 10 rounders or like a 15 round handgun mag. Why are we looking to ban things that are not used in murders?

No its not. Look into what many of the mass shooters of the last 20 yrs used. 

&gt;&gt; Some people would and do skirt mag size by carrying extra mags and reloading in 2 or 4 seconds. If the gun and mags are such that changing mags takes longer, perhaps that is more justifiable 
&gt;
&gt;This would fundamentally ban almost every semi-automatic rifle and handgun in the USA. 

OK. If we designate a good criteria and it disqualifies all those, so be it. I'm telling you it comes back to the fact we need to debate the criteria. 

&gt;The bill will fail because it essentially mandates a 30 day wait period, while the 4437 check is only good for 30 days, meaning you'd be stuck in an endless loop and be unable to purchase any firearms, not because Republicans are against background checks.

Hopefully you realise you should only invest money (in stocks) with money you don't need for at least 15 years. 

Why 35% in bonds when you're only 26? In other words, what is your time horizon?

Why 10% in Europe when you already have a worldwide ETF (overlapping)?

Why 30% in Emerging Markets? Do you think Emerging Markets will perform better than developed markets in the future? If so, why?

My advice would be to KISS, Keep It Simple Stupid. Pick a more aggressive asset allocation since you're so young (90/10 or 80/20), put around 80% of your stock allocation in the world ETF and then 10% in EM and 10% in small cap. This is just my opinion, I'm not a financial advisor. ",1551398721

Well, fair enough. But, let's remember that  JonBenet is the victim here. Not Burke. JonBenet was attacked and killed in her own home. True, Burke is not his parents, but he is one of the three people who were in the home at the time.

The mother and father chose to cover-up, lawyer up, and tell lies on the Larry King Show. Those sins are now being revisited on their son.

Hey Jenner how close are we 

to reaching the February

Not good... still about

Do you think we'll hit goal by
