&gt;It means that in a population such as the one enrolled in the trials, with a cumulated COVID-19 attack rate over a period of 3 months of about 1% without a vaccine, we would expect roughly 0¬∑05% of vaccinated people would get diseased. It does not mean that 95% of people are protected from disease with the vaccine

If everyone were vaccinated, the virus would have a hard time spreading if it were 90% effective in halting the spread. Granted, that super high number may not be the case since Delta, but it still works to reduce spread (to a fairly high degree), as well as prevent serious illness and death. Hopefully this will be the case with Omicron, as well.",1638316800

Scalpers sell the solution to a problem they cause. Often times when people pay over market price, they justify it by the peace of mind they get. I see this a lot in a pokemon tcg community I'm in.

"WordsWithFriends","t5_2rzdy","My strategy for this board has been determine quickly if I can make a horizontal 4 letter word to the left of the middle start tile (or whatever it's called), where the second letter is a vowel. This places the vowel below a TL score tile. If I can't do that, my alternative is a horizontal two letter word to the right of the center tile, where the second letter is a vowel. (So the vowel is below a DW score tile.) Do this for all the boards and that usually leads to at least 1, and possibly more chances for higher word scores the next time I see that board. (To optimize the score for the follow-up words, play a horizontal word with a high value consonant on the TL or DW tile.) The important thing is to decide quickly and move on, continuing to set up similar double or triple score opportunities for higher value consonants each round. Hopefully this makes sense.  
Not sure whether this is the optimal strategy, but so far it's worked for me. (I haven't lost a dual yet since this latest round started, but I expect that will change as players become more familiar with this board version and improve their strategies for it.) Good luck!",1638316800

When I told him it was possible to go through a process of conversion and that I was interested in doing so, he told me he didn‚Äôt mind me finding value in Judaism through watching services &amp; my own independent learning but if I insisted on trying to convert and joining a synagogue/ participating in organized religion, he wasn‚Äôt sure he could continue to have a relationship with me. Unfortunately that made it hard for me to consider going forward with it bc we have a child together, and it felt like too great a risk.

"valheim","t5_jb05l","I run a few. Most of which are summed up by Greyden Factor of ""I work 60+ hrs a week and don't feel like wasting time"".

 

1. In game clock - I got tired of wondering if it is getting dark or light and wondering how much light I have left.
2. Portals transport everything - I appreciate the idea behind exploring and boating back metals and it isn't a bad idea, but for me it feels like both a needless step and a way to increase playtime rather than a real ""feature"". Also a Greyden Factor.
3. Farm Grid - I, once again, appreciate the aesthetic of imperfect rows of crops, but once again is just a pain in the butt to me and doesn't break the game in a meaningful way so I use it. To me it is like snapping together parts of a build.
4. 3x Bronze - Tin isn't hard to get and instead of digging out 2-3 copper nodes I can do it in 1-2. After the first one, it no longer any challenge so it becomes busy work which invokes the Greyden Factor.
5. Bonus non Mod: Refuse to play without map seed and map viewer - After one multiplayer server had my ship taking damage on the water for no reason and, being stuck in low level bronze gear, I couldn't find land anywhere that wasn't swamp or plains resulting in me dying miles away from anywhere, I vowed I'd never play again without being able to see the map first. I don't look for much. Usually just location of bosses and does ""x"" swamp have Sunken Crypts.

There's not a lot of chances for players to shop at my table between going to dungeon, doing said dungeon, so it's usually at least 3-4 sessions before they can stock up again. That translates to well over a month in the real world, so it's still fun if they want to haggle when given the chance for big purchases or roleplay. 

But if it was a full encounter every time they dropped gold on something, then I'd abstract it like this. This would also be good for side purchases or moments when the player says they need to buy something but we gotta get on with the session.",1638316802

It's even the main reason I couldn't get into Subnautica despite the glowing reviews. I played it for a few hours and was immediately bored by all the mechanics and micromanaging. I want to get past it because I know both games are such critical darlings and everyone says they're masterpieces but it's just a big hurdle for me.

Well yes, otherwise we are ignoring some pretty cool history. 

""Surely if Portuguese speakers see √á as C with an accent, that makes it so""

No. Not at all. I can declare that ‚ü®h‚ü© is just an ‚ü®n‚ü© with a diacritic, but that wouldn't ""make it so"". What I could do however, is make an entirely new letter based off of ‚ü®n‚ü© and modify it so it looks like ‚ü®h‚ü©, but then it wouldn't be a haitch at all. 

Seeing W as a letter or not is different than seeing a letter as coming from a different place than it actually came from. No matter if you consider W a single letter or not, I think everyone can agree that its origins are 2 Vs/Us. If someone tried to claim that W is a turned M, they would be wrong. Sure, it can look like that, and they both make labial sounds, but their actual origins are unrelated.",1638316803

Even if 90% of the local votes are for one party, still 10% of the votes are ignored, and basically anyone who doesn't vote for said party feels like they shouldn't even bother to vote because their is no chance their vote will be counted.

"dayz","t5_2ty3s","I can't remember the date or the exact dev blog, but there was a very defining point sometime after 1.0 where they literally admitted that they'll never reach parity with DayZ Mod (a freaking community mod from 2012) and that they were ending principle development and would not be adding any major features to the game but rather just fixing bugs and adding small features.  This means that vehicles will for the most part always be bugged, there will most likely never be dynamic lighting with the natural sunlight (the *main* thing that makes DayZ look like the most bland apocalypse ever since there's no real shadows/darkness in building interiors), and you'll never see things like helicopters, boats, planes, etc outside of modded servers.  I was honestly dumbfounded that the hardcore DayZ defenders didn't see this moment for what it was which was BI admitting that their roadmaps and promises were all bullshit and had been for some time and that *everybody* was scammed when they slapped ""1.0"" on it and started charging full price.  They literally admitted how fucked up the development was and fans were like ""but there's still hope!"".

IMO the only reason DayZ has seen a resurgence and has so many positive reviews now is because modding was added. Some of the most popular servers literally try to make the game resemble DayZ Mod as much as they can.  DayZ Standalone was supposed to bring us a *COMPLETE* game that had all the features of DayZ Mod plus more with less buginess and better anti-hacks.  Instead we have a shell of a game with vehicles that barely work and a heap of features that never made it into the game.

Edit: found the [status report, it was in July of 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/cdvzk5/status_report_july_2019/).  It was also when they mentioned many of the key members of the development team leaving.  This was literally the ""okay, we fucked up horribly and are never going to finish the game but we're still going to charge you suckers full price"" status report.  A lot of the comments in that Reddit thread call it out for what it is but amazingly a lot of people still defended them which just baffles me.",1638316803

You are welcome to argue that the organ donor example doesn't apply, but it is an appeal to emotion.  Killing and murder are loaded terms meant to illicit emotional responses.  It is not murder to deny a person access to anothers bodily resources. It is simply put, allowing them to die. Not saving a person, and killing a person are two very different things.  Abortion is just a refusal to save another.  I already know the next rebuttal is that the abortion is an active termination. The argument that the life is terminated in the act of abortion is inconsequential because the life would end even if it was removed unharmed, just at greater risk to the mother. This is assuming it is a legal abortion. Nobody is going to advocate that a viable fetus, able to survive outside its host should be terminated.",1638316804

I'm in the UK and we're running on empty here too in our own way. There are so many people (60million+) squeezed into a weeny little island, roughly the same size as the U.S state of Oregon.
Our housing situation is shameful. Professional couples in their 30's, unable to afford even a starter home of their own.
Private rentals have virtually all been split into multiple occupancy houses by greedy landlords, who then MASSIVELY increase their rents and so their profits. (Especially in my city, the manager at the cities homeless advisory centre, gets backhanders from certain private lettings companies. She ensures they get a 'supported housing' licence, and then furrows homeless people towards said lettings companies. Nepotism is a wonderful thing isn't it?)
The social housing sector is bursting at the seams with applications, so single people or couples with no children haven't got a hope in hell! It's a fuckin disgrace in all truthfulness. The standard of living here decreased terribly between 1990 and 2005, but the decline in standard of living between 2005 and the present day is an absolute disgrace! The welfare state is in shambles, personal and student debt is at breaking point, and social inequality and unrest is ever prevalent. 
If I were a 25yr old in todays Britain, I would be exceptionally despondent and pessimistic about my future. As I am older, I have less financial pressures, and I assume I will probably be dead by the time complete social meltdown envelopes our country into a miserable and premature dystopian decay.

A black driver won a race this year, and instead of celebrating this historic achievement they're still arguing over how it wasn't a ""true"" victory (despite rain outs not being a problem when they cause a guy they like to win) and how he lucked into it (despite racing hard at the front all day to earn his place at the front when all the drivers knew rain was imminent and were racing like it could be the last lap for about 10 laps or more)

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","I keep seeing cool tchotchkes that would be neat to have on my desk, or a shelf somewhere. But ultimately, it's usually just a colored dpiece of plastic that'll sit on a shelf getting dusty, until the cats knock them over and I need to make a shelf to raise them up high enough the cat can't get to them. 

Ultimately I'll have spent 20√ó the value of the materials just to have a cat toy on a shelf that he's not allowed to play with. I set the money aside and don't worry about it.

Pretty much stopped Christmas with the families as well. My wife's family does secret Santa, which was cool. I made up an Amazon wish list of things I might use but wouldn't buy for myself. That worked for 2 years, then the third year was just everyone spending $75 on each other's lists to have things that we didn't REALLY want enough to buy for ourselves.

My parents wanted to stop as well because they just buy what they want. But every year now I buy mom a copy of her favorite cooking magazine and we go through it together, cause it's fun. Dad always gets a small box of chocolates, and my brother gets a bag of candy. They get me a magazine related to whatever I'm obsessing over this year (woodworking recently).

Massive Attack's 1991 ""Blue Lines"" album is considered the first ever ""Trip-Hop"" album. Looks like the Russian record in the comments also came out in 91, so it might be interesting to also dig into the origins of trip hop as well.

Book-Mat is the only one of the three boys who never even considered going back to Edmond's Field. It had nothing for him, and his familial ties were tenuous at best. 

Show-Mat (and here we only have four episodes to judge) already isn't that same character. Sure his parents are dicks and he doesn't have any ties to them, but now his absence is defacto abandonment of his sisters to a broken home with unreliable parents.

Both versions may still play him as a somewhat care-free carouser with an eye for the ladies and the Dark One's own luck, but what each of those characters is leaving behind is radically different, and speaks volumes about who they chose to be.

Being pregnant can leave a woman feeling vulnerable about many things and I think the best course of action is to try and have a talk with her. I agree with other people on recommending counseling as that will be an extra help to her during this time.  Another thing is maybe you could both find ways to get moving together without actually working out and try to combine what food you both like into a suitable meal.

Signed Seth, one of the best shooters in league but the defense was shite. 

Year 3: Traded A really good shooter for a player who could defend and play make to start next to Luka to help defense and also play making. Neither of those happened. 

Year 4: Traded JRich and FO said fuck defense of play making next to Luka, let‚Äôs just get shooters.

Regardless of whatever timeframe they promised (and however many times I've followed up), profiles have never been successfully merged by the time I canceled the card. Not once!

Furthermore, when you suggest that a profile should be able to hold more than one card, they talk to you like you're some kind of weirdo. ""*No!* Each card needs its own profile. It's *always* like that!""

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I cannot answer that but what I can tell you is that the legal system fails victims constantly.  I know of a man who was reported to have molested a 7yr old relative of his partner, the kid was taken from the parent because she was negligent and the guy was let out within 2mo of the accusation despite the fact that he is a registered sex offender and was also a repeat offender. The parent is struggling to get it together for the child while CPS is constantly doing wellness  checks on her despite the fact that the incident happened while she was working to provide for the child and the kid was under the supervision of her relative who has a license to run a daycare center while having a registered sex offender on the premises. There are some really sick fucks out there. I also know of a person I know casually through work, who was constantly talking about sexual escapades with a very young person to a coworker of mine, and during the shut downs his wife discovered him abusing his 17yr old and fortunately she had the balls to report him. Because she could have turned a blind eye as he was the only person providing for them meaning they would be completely destitute by reporting him. That happens alot with poorer people they have no option but to put up with the abuse. One last story when I was 16 in high school I worked  evening shifts at a fast food joint the problem with that was that I had no way of getting home as my entire family were dependent on public transportation, so I  had to take a cab home most nights.  After a while I ce to befriend a cab driver who would charge me a flat rate a week, the issue was he left for sometimes 3weeks at a time back to his home country of El Salvador to visit his ""wife"". I was always questioning why he hadn't brought her back to the US as he was a citizen, he waS in 60s but his wife was 14! Two years younger than I. So obviously he couldn't claim that but her family was poor and he took advantage of that so he would send money here to support her family in exchange that the kid would perform wifely duties when he visited her.

Image living in an apartment where you either have to park on the street and can't run a cord out to the car or in a parking slot with no electrical port (or the port is broken...yeah, I had that happen and they never fixed them) and you simply can't run a cord to your vehicle from your apartment (wrong side of the building, or your cord would be stolen/cut to be sold for scrap) and they don't allow you to run a cord from the outlet on the side of the building (they turn off the power to the building's external electric plugs and only turn them on when the grounds people are there).

Or you are a University student having to park on the far side of the student parking lot.

Also, 'just put on a coat while driving to work'.  Here, you have to let your vehicle run for 10-15 minutes or more before you even attempt to get in and drive it, not just for the engine but so the cabin isn't so cold that you could get frostbite while driving to work.

edit: I'm not naysaying them or what works for them. I'm just pointing out that places like Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Northern Idaho, northern Michigan and even Alaska are not the same as Maine or Washington state (especially the first 4).  These places can get life-threatening cold on the regular and while I'm happy an EV works for them in Maine, that's a completely different winter than these other places.   When people say you just can't understand the southern humidity or a phoenix summer until you have experienced it first hand, I'll say the same about a North Dakota winter.",1638316808

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","This. If you're looking for recommendations beyond that, I'd say level your DoLs first then DoH (I did it in groups of 10, so getting to 40 bot/min, then 40 DoH, then 50 bot/min, 50 DoH, etc etc) so you can get any expensive/annoying/sold out resources yourself.

GC has daily turn ins that are worth a lot, especially HQ versions, for all DoL/H jobs. I remember getting 2-3 levels at the start, and even  towards the end getting at least half a level (each day, for each job).

Look into beast tribes, each xpac has at least one dealing with crafting/gathering and are good sources of easy XP since you just, run around gathering and crafting stuff with materials they give you.

If you unlock custom deliveries, they give pretty good xp and you can choose what job to get that xp in. Only 12 deliveries a week as well so it's something easy and nice to knock out once it's unlocked.

Those 3 things should keep you plenty occupied if they appeal to you. I also recommend looking into what's selling if you're doing the GC turn ins, as some of the HQ stuff sells for cheap so you can buy it and save yourself the hassle, while other stuff is a good money maker so I'd make 2-4 extras, turn in 1 to the GC, and sell the rest for a neat profit.",1638316808

I made out with this woman in my car. We must have been making out over an hour. She was grinding on me and then she undid my pants and teased me with a 3 seconds of a blow job. Then eventually she left.     I was new to sexual activity in general, so I didn't try to ask for more cause I didn't want to seem like a bad person or something and I liked her and didn't want to lose her.  Anyway, the 30 min drive home my testicles hurt so bad. Like as if I had been kicked there. I got nauseous and almost threw up in my car.      The intensity got worse and worse and I got home and got out of my underwear and just laid with my legs open and tried to relax. It helped enough to the point I could then ya know, take care of it.

There's not really any other advice to offer at this time than what's already been given.  Be mindful that even if CPS took the case, it can be opening a can of worms.  It would mean your sister has to work a case plan, that you are beholden to CPS policy and will have to do things like have monthly visits from caseworker, weekly visits with mom, court dates, required doctor visits, etc.  You'll need to pass an emergency home study.  In many states, if you want a stipend or other benefits (sometimes even medicaid), you'll need to get formally licensed which means even more visits and policy to follow.  

Obviously you know your own family situation best but if it were me and I weren't already a licensed foster parent, I would probably be having conversations with my sisters and family about it before a hotline call. Most of us foster parents have had placements that came from kin that didn't work out because they either couldn't pass a home study, couldn't meet other requirements, or couldn't deal with the invasive nature of CPS.

"BreadTube","t5_iezap","u/pointsOutWeirdStuff, at first I understood your reaction to u/Land-Cucumber's words

But I think your infinite repition was too much and u/Land-Cucumber already explained their words [better]. 

Here's my analogy of what happened in your conversation, my understanding:

- **Person 1:** I do bad things sometimes. But I don't want to! I'm a good person in my soul. Or, my goal is to become a good person. I do less and less bad things with time, I make progress!

- **Person 2:** For me your categories don't make sense. From my view, if you still do = you still want. And while you still do it you're not ""a good person in your soul"". And talking about ""goals"" and ""progress"" again doesn't make sense for me in that context: until you're a good person I don't believe in your ""goals"" and ""progress"" - they may be just an illusion of ""goals"" and ""progress"" (pesudo-goals and pseudo-progress).

Yes, it may sound very harsh, but I think it's **sequitir** and can be **just**

**What I see as your mistakes:** (1) you assumed that both persons talk (agree) about **Person 1** ""(not) being a good person in reality"". (2) You tried to steelman **Person's 1** words, but that doesn't nessecerily help. ([It started from this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BreadTube/comments/oh41mx/social_constructs_philosophy_tube/h4oivo3/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3))

Maybe you were **100% right** to assume both (1) and (2) initially, but then you just never updated/revisited those assumptions

How I imagine the dialogue could continue:

- **Person 1:** Wow, chill a bit! I meant *""I think it's my goal to become a good person""*. Key word *""think""*

- **Person 2:** OK, but I still have the right to criticize your behaviour itself (it's just easier to formulate as a critique of *your thoughts about your behaviour*), to try to prevent you from having any unrealised illusions about yourself, to criticize your choice of words, call you out and etc. ... In the end we're just having a human interaction and there're no strict rules about what we can and can't say to each other

***

I personally have that principle:

- We don't 100% control the meaning of our words and the topic of the discussion

So it doesn't always make sense to become ""hung up"" on supposed ""non-sequitirs"" (I think it even may be harmful)

Sometimes it makes sense to just be more flexible and empathetic",1638316810

Because of how button priority works in old GG, you can press forward + K and H at the same time as Sol. If the opponent is close enough to throw, or able to be thrown at all, you'll get throw. If they're too far away, or unable to be thrown for whatever reason, you'll get 5k, which is a lot better normal to whiff/toss out than 6h.

Cause of this throwing has a lot of layers to the way you can mindgame it against your opponent and how good a character's best throw OS is adds another dimension to their pressure game.",1638316810

The government decides which religious groups are subsidized or tax exempt and therefore can influence, which religious groups are supported. The last president banned travellers from countries with one particular religion. There's exceptions to laws based on religion which the government explicitly allows to exist. The government can indirectly regulate religion. They can for example decide a certain sub-group of christians that thinks it's part of their religious freedom to murder non-christians is put into place. Religion exists in the space that is allowed by governments, even though some groups have blatantly abused religious freedom for political agendas. 

Social interaction is of course not directly regulated but it is highly influenced. We can see that in the pandemic right now where some of these rights were limited because we have had a medical necessity to do so. So basically it's not that the government does not have the power to regulate this, it's that it is actively deciding to set the default amount of regulation to zero because there is no necessity.

 This is a rule that applies to almost every aspect of life that happens in some kind of public space. And that's the core aspect of government control: as long as there's no power dynamic, there's no point in regulation. What the government usually does is to protect the interest of the individual and various groups against the interest of others with more influence or some natural occurrence that endangers them. Of course it's way more complicated than that but it boils down to this in a lot of situations. And of course other situations normally don't require regulation or, to put it more exactly, has a level of regulation close to zero. But an analogous conclusion could only be drawn if the situation has at least some similarities. That means even if I would concede to the point that a lot of things don't need to be regulated and are fine by themselves (which I wouldn't but I get your point), my point was about how the pandemic showed that stronger regulation is often times needed to improve situations. Like mask mandates - before there was no reason to regulate what's in your face, but then it became a necessity and people still did not adhere even though it would not only have been better for them but for their beloved as well.  
I'm not saying all government regulation is good or useful. But it can be, and sadly, a lot of people have proven to me that they need to be regulated",1638316811

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Well then. It sounds like he‚Äôs a narcissist at its finest.  Most likely someone he idolizes is also the same way.  

Okay then, one of the best ways to get him  if you have no physical evidence is then record his excuses in a public confrontation.  Depending on your state, if your in a public place then your free to record without permission.  Self admittance in an alter ego is a definite shit excuse for a defense attorney.  

Secondly, if you have evidence then take it to a victim advocate center as unaltered as much as possible.  No washing just pack the clothes in a paper brown bag.  Any pictures or people testimonials who were there or around right before and after.  Including any friends you discussed it with.  Once notarized statements are useable in any court.  But if you need help on how to approach the police station to file a report‚Ä¶you can ask and I‚Äôll give you a full run down on what to expect.  Or you can post that publicly including slipping his confession into the school year book or a school event where the audio playback is accessible to yourself‚Ä¶in other words put yourself in media within your school.  That‚Äôs a good way to expose his ugly but at a safe distance. Yes more people will know what happened which will involve authorities definitely.  But then everyone including Himself will know the truth and see his ass for what he is.  A Narcissistic rapist.",1638316813

"RedditReads","t5_33xfn","From the #1 New York Times bestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the LusitaniaOn May 1, 1915, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were anxious. Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone, and for months, its U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era's great transatlantic ""Greyhounds"" and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. He knew, moreover, that his ship - the fastest then in service - could outrun any threat. Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger's U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small - hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more--all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history. It is a story that many of us think we know but don't, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour, mystery, and real-life suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope Riddle to President Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love. Gripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster that helped place America on the road to war.",1638316813

The reason to  wear an insulin pump is because without one, a person needs to calculate, dose, and inject insulin multiple times a day, and while insulin needles are small enough it isn't painful, it's also not pleasant. So instead, a pump that can accurately dose your insulin, and pump it through one larger needle that can stay in for a few days is far more convenient.

Your HRT is probably a once, rarely twice, weekly injection.  The dosage is always the same so there's no calculation required.

The characters are great, they feel alive which is basically all you can ask for, they did a great job at creating ,,the villain‚Äù which is supposed to be Abby, but what you know, fans love her more than Ellie so i guess she‚Äôs more of an anti hero now. Skipping all this, even the attention to detail, graphics, how natural everything is, animations, voicelines and all, is enough to make for the best game ever even this day.

Then you need to get on live chat with support and have them approve that amount of expenses by pre-authorizing the client‚Äôs card. Only then should you accept and schedule the task.

If you don‚Äôt do these steps, then if the client‚Äôs card declines (or they remove their card info from the site), then Taskrabbit will not pay you for the stuff you just bought for this client and you‚Äôre SOL. Also, always put a photo of the receipt on the chat in case the client tries to dispute the amount of the expense after the fact.

Thank you for posting on /r/guessmyage! 

**A few notes:** if you post (***or comment***) in this subreddit and you have an OnlyFans account, or if you have posted links to OnlyFans elsewhere on Reddit, our automatic moderation bot will flag your account and you will be banned - we are kid-friendly and G-rated and due to the incessant spamming by literally hundreds of people before you, we've been forced to moderate this subreddit this way. This also includes accounts that post explicit content anywhere else on Reddit.


If that is you, please either post exclusively in /r/guessmyageXXX or use an alternate account that has both no NSFW content and/or no links to OnlyFans. 


Please do not **SPAM** the group with reposts. This includes deleting your old post and reposting a new pic a day or two later, or spamming us with posts period. We do notice, and that will result in a temporary or permanent ban, depending on how grouchy your mod team is that day.


Please **ENGAGE** with people who comment. Guessing includes you eventually letting people know they got it right or wrong!


Don't get **OFFENDED** if someone guesses wrong. It's sometimes not an easy thing to guess. Obvious trolls to make you feel bad should be reported.

    
Please **REPORT** comments on your post that are creepy, insulting, harassing, or otherwise shitty. We do take them seriously and will ban people who behave like this, with no exceptions. 


We will delete any posts where we suspect you are posting **someone else's photo**. You will be banned and asked to provide a verification picture to remove the ban. (Screenshots are a big red flag).


**Do not engage with trolls** - two wrongs do not make a right. We do take action when comments/posts are reported... give us the time to review, we're not here 24/7. 


Any other questions? You can always send your mod team a mail message.

Alejandro's strategy was to attract a female contestant with his personality more-so than his looks, or befriend a male character with aforementioned personality, then have them do something that would get them eliminated(e.g., kissing the pole, slapping Heather, prioritizing honor).

Meanwhile, Justin's ""strategy"" was to use his looks to temporarily borderline hypnotize targets into doing nice things for him, not necessarily relating to the game. The one time he used his looks to eliminate someone, he did it by getting his attractees to vote Izzy off rather than having his attractee do something stupid that would get themself voted off like Alejandro would do. His other strategic maneuver, guilt-tripping Gwen into throwing her own challenge, had nothing to do with his looks or even his personality, it was just taking advantage of Gwen's sense of remorse",1638316816

Once you‚Äôve identified some counter examples, the proof shouldn‚Äôt be hard (I‚Äôm too lazy to write them in full) 

One example: 
 f(x) = {sin(x)+2  if 0&lt;=x&lt;= pi
              f(x/2) otherwise }
This is slowly varying as f(x/2) = f(x) when x &gt; pi
But it doesn‚Äôt fit the +r definition.

edit: if the any means all, the claim holds true. 
I would argue that the prior implies limit x to inf f(y)/f(x) = 1 if y&gt;x 
Then that implies limit x to inf f(x+c) / f(x) = 1 for c&gt; 0
That covers c&lt;0 by symmetry (since x tends to inf)

Women are more neurotic and can't see reason. If a woman *feels* she's doing more it doesn't matter if she objectively isn't. 

Women DO complain more. I don't see how you could suggest otherwise. 

Stats show men work an hour more if you include inside and outside work. 

Women want 50/50 housework while men work more outside the house. That's not 50/50.

If you honestly believe every woman who claims their man literally sits motionless for weeks at a time yet they somehow fell in love and moved in with him you're naive",1638316817

From there, I only assumed that it was being controlled remotely (hence the constant overlay, reminiscent of some real-world technologies); but that involves a problem if the engineer broke into the facility where the official probe had been created.  
My supposition, based on, ""there's a barn..."" and also using the earlier dialogue, ""the signal is coming from everywhere"", is that other people were able to build the craft too. Think Zefram Cochfrane from Star Trek (maybe not THAT level of amateur though; literally constructed the first working warp drive on his farm).

To me, I really liked the kiss scene because it felt like a culmination of all the little moments between Alphen and Shionne throughout the course of the game. From the combat dialogue (I loved all the moments you mentioned, along with some other stuff when Shionne shouts 'Don't Leave Me!' if Alphen goes down or Shionne saying 'we'll do this together' to Alphen when a boss is close to going down) along the campfire dialog between the 2 (the first one where Shionne is annoyed at Alphen's attempts to get her to open up but begrudgingly agrees to do, to their last one where they're talking about cooking together and having a kitchen once this is all over). There's also a lot of examples of Shionne more 'warm' personality as the game progresses that I really like, from her general dialog in the story, later skits, her lines when she cooks, etc.

Throughout the game, I feel Shionne and Alphen both express a lot ofaffection for each other, but in Alphen's case I think it's a bit more overt with what he says verbally, whereas Shionne is a bit more reserved in that regard (which makes sense based on her personality and backstory with the thorns). So I think that's what makes her initiating their first kiss more 'powerful' to me (including her tearing up a bit out of joy). Specifically seeing her expressing and reciprocating those feeling nonverbally just feels very much in line with Shionne as a  person (and also represents her letting go of some of those 'reservations' without the thorns in her way now), and it's just a  really beautiful moment overall to me. And again, I feel the music playing here (Blue Moon by Ayaka) just was perfectly emotional to me.

I also really liked how Shionne stops Alphen short of confessing his love for her on Daeq Faezol (I believe) until their work on Rena was truly resolved. They both knew how they felt for each other at the time, but I also think that's also what made their 'wordless' embrace and kiss at the end all the more emotional and impactful to me.

Anyways, that's just how I felt. I would have liked some more moments between the 2 after their kiss (I think you had some nice suggestions for potential moments!), but what was there was already very powerful and impactful to me, since their kiss and wedding helped affirm their romance and those 'little moments' in the game for me (and I love that they committed to their romance in the end with that kiss and wedding scene), but that's just me of course.

[I posted a longer thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/tales/comments/r1jgx5/anyone_else_feel_this_way_after_the_ending_of/) recently going over my thoughts in more detail as well, and thought we had a good discussion about a lot of this stuff with the rest of community as well.

You are, however, being taken advantage of after reading most of the comments. 
My recommendation would be to talk to your executor and a lawyer. You say you don‚Äôt want to kick them out and that charging rent would make you uncomfortable. What I suggest is looking into the legalities of charging them a token amount of rent, like $5, and drawing up a tenancy agreement that protects the house from having changes made to it without explicit written permission that is also signed by your lawyer so it can‚Äôt be fraudulently written. This would give you power to evict them if things get more sour. It also protects your bedroom from being renovated. A tenancy contract could also protect you from any claim to squatters rights if it is applicable where you live. 
I would sit your family and Jen down with your executor and your lawyer and explain that this is how it will be going forward. You are not kicking them out, you are putting the house into a landlord-tenant relationship. You could even say that this is for tax purposes or something to make it more palatable for them as it sounds like you are against upsetting them. They have the option to all sign on as tenants (make them EACH sign an agreement and put a clause in against subletting so your mother can‚Äôt sign the agreement and then have Jen and your sister as subletters) or they can move out. If they move out you can rent out the house to a family who would treat you and the house with the respect you both deserve. 
Nothing about what you are doing is homophobic. I am a bi woman. But the homophobia accusation is being used to manipulate you. 
I really wish you the best. Please update us when you‚Äôve spoken to your trusted advisors.

Edit: what I‚Äôd really love is for you to call them out and say they can all shove it up their behinds and get out of your home that you are choosing to take control of now that you are an adult. But it sounds like you are far too lovely for that.",1638316819

My brother 4 (m) me 15 (m)
Ever since my brother was born over had the responsibility to babysit him some times my parents don‚Äôt even ask me to look after him and just leave when I already had plans I know it‚Äôs not his fault but the other stuff is 
He‚Äôs keeps on getting into my after countless times of me asking my parents to get locks on my door. 
He has broken my tv screen and snapped my chrome book (for my school) that the school had given me that I had to pay to repair he makes my room all messy when I have it cleaned and steals some of my stuff. 
And anytime you tell him to go away or kick him out of my room he cries for like 30 minutes and I get my phone taken away for a few days not to long ago I broke my right arm (dominant) and wasn‚Äôt able to right and do other things. 
At a family event my brother found a stick and was hitting me in the face and on my Brocken arm. 
I pushed him over so he would stop hitting me. 
He cried until my Aunty gave him some lollies. 
I was sent to sit in the car and wait for the event to be over I had to sit in the car for 2 and a half hours without dinner or water luckily it wasn‚Äôt to hot in the car but as soon as my family got home my mum screamed at me for 30 minutes when I was grounded for 2 months ( got my phone back yesterday)
My brother just sat next to my mum with a huge grin

Longevity retirement is the only way to get CDRP, which allows you to receive you full military retirement and your VA disability compensation as long as you VA rating is at least 50%.

Medical retirement rules are quite different. Once you receive your DoD disability rating, which only focuses on conditions that are unfitting and make you not worldwide qualified, most folks choose to have the DoD disability offset by their VA disability dollar for dollar. Most people select this option because VA disability is tax free while DoD medical retirement is not.

This is also true for a medical separation severance payments. If you opt to take VA disability, then you will repay whatever severance they receive for a medical separation.

"FATErpg","t5_2toez","Ok, FATE!  And congrats!  I have ran D&amp;D and Pathfinder and years ago I started shifting to FATE.  So the big thing I can tell you is get to know the FATE system.  Learn about aspects, compels, character creation.  The BIGGER thing I can tell you is frame it properly for you players.  Because if they are like mine they are use to CRUNCHY systems.

Some players can get bogged down in minutiae of aspects, or character creating.  So I always tell them that their high concept should be why the player exists.  Write the high concept as the fibre of their being. So they understand, because most are use to just picking skills and then figuring out alignments later.  This way they know what they need to figure out first.

The next thing I tell them is what is the characters trouble.  Are they conflicted, running from something, running TO something?  And it doesn't have to be related to the high concept, but helps if it is.  And I usually nudge them to make it a offset of their high concept.

Next I tell them to write at least one aspect.  And in most of my campaigns I generally say don't do more than two.  This allows two things: 1. They don't have to get bogged down on figuring out aspects and 2. It allows them to grow the character.  As I mentioned above some players can't deal with an open book and just writing as aspect.  They are used to just picking skills.  So I will hand hold a bit on skills and just probe of ""what is their profession"" or ""Where did they come from"" to nudge them towards some helpful skills.  And I give or let them add more aspects as we play.  Because the one reason you play other RPG's is mainly to level.  This gives them a feeling of leveling and most importantly character growth.  Now, if you're doing a one-shot you probably want your aspects filled.  But this I've noticed help them stick with the game.  And just like other RPG's giving them some good extras that go along with their characters help as well.  And the same goes for  skills and stunts.

The important thing I mention with aspects to them is it should be good and bad.  I have no idea if you have ever seen the TV show Alphas, but I always reference that.  For each aspect you should have something that helps but their should be a drawback.  It's like a two sided coin and if you flip it maybe you having a good day or maybe a bad day.  In Alphas each superhuman would have a amazing power, but also a drawback.  One guy could get really strong, but only for a few minutes before it tiring or almost killing him.  One of them could enhance one sense, but all the others senses would go blind.  So I always like to make that point with aspects because it really does with the RPing.

After all that I introduce them to the FATE ladder.  And once they understand how the ladder works everything usually clicks for them.  And then I will mention invokes and actions of overcome, create an advantage, attack, and defend.

I will also try to get to know their character sheets pretty well so I can call compels.  Which just makes the games awesome.  Because this character will most likely act like ""this"" because of their aspects.  One player I had made a character that liked to gamble.  So anytime they were near anything that could be bet on I would compel him to gamble.  Which always made for some good fun and RPing.

That's mostly my view coming from D&amp;D and Pathfinder.  I hope you enjoy FATE along with your players!  It's a great system and I use it as much as I can!

Good luck!  And This is the way.

Oh, and sorry for the edit!  I ALWAYS reference ""Losing will happen!""!  A lot of players feel they should always be able to win or don't know when to back down.  FATE encourages players will lose.  You shouldn't always win!  Retreating is always an option.",1638316821

I don't think Overseers is that great. The bonus to crit damage does \*NOT\* (currently) apply to headshot damage, sadly. I tested this pretty thoroughly because I had assumed it would, since headshots are described as ""automatic critical hits"" - but + crit damage only applied to crits on normal hits, and only + headshot damage applies to the headshots. As such, Overseers is sort of weird. It gives you both, which I guess is nice, but I'd rather focus more strictly on headshot damage. I believe (but have not tested, sadly) that Enchanted should affect headshot damage - making Ancient Intentions the BiS named musket, I think.",1638316821

Im sure not everyone has this, but many probably do.  I think it‚Äôs swings and roundabouts.  

One thing I‚Äôve realised since having the money is that it wasn‚Äôt money I was missing but the ability to reflect on my life and all of the non money things.  Ironically it took money to realise that.  Perhaps someone reading can skip the chase for more money and move straight to the good stuff.

(P.S. I forgot to explain the reason I didn‚Äôt examine ‚Äòlife‚Äô before is that I so obsessed with trying to earn more money and making it my sole focus.  Only when I got to a point I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd achieve did I realise money wasn‚Äôt the ultimate happiness I was looking for).

i was responding to that.  i wasn't saying the reason I posted was the ONLY reason for the war.  Just that it was sufficient to disprove your assertion about the illusion of the impossibility of war due to economic interconnection.  People at the time were rightfully concerned that the domino-like overlapping alliances could lead to war and thus the notion that the potential for war was perceived as impossible is facile.",1638316822

Every working person goes through this situation to balance personal and professional lives and it's endless sometimes so you're not alone on this. Coming to cuti, from your post it appears you're fairly new in your system and normally its seen that employees right after starting their job start requesting for frequent leaves and supervisors do get itchy about it. Maybe your sup has similar sentiments in your case too. Try to build trust with her and sometimes that takes time too so you may have to juggle a bit until then with possibly taking mum's hospital appointments over the weekends or after office. Again depends on your working shift patterns, if it becomes too pressing then it's best to have that one to one open conversation with your sup on your condition and also come to agreement with few options like flexible hours for you as an exception until your mum recovers or also on your exit plans if no support at work. Ofc these are few ideas for guidance and you will have to work what's best for you depending on how situation unfolds. Hope this helps",1638316822

We know from the leaked audition tapes they weren't picking specific races for these characters.  I mean, Pike is 6 inches to tall for Moraine, but no one seems to complain about that casting.  Maybe... just maybe, they decided they'll take the best actor and actress because  that's the most important thing when it comes to acting?

"awfuleverything","t5_346d4","Live in a major US city. Work at a bar and have for over a decade. Have a decent amount of homeless friends. 

Darion is homeless (and has been since 17--he's 22 now) because he's gay. He can sleep at his grandma's house 1 day a week maximum, but can't be there during the day; she doesn't approve of his ""sins"". Recently he was ""dating"" a guy and I googled the dudes name for him: registered sex offender. Was incarcerated for attempted murder. I asked Darion if the dude knew where Darion stayed, and he said he gave him a different location (smart), but the guy will constantly hang around the Walgreens he knows Darion stands by, asking for him. I gave him my pepper spray and told him to go chill somewhere else for a bit.

Alexei is a cool older guy. His sign says ""Homeless, Hungry Vet :)"" and he wore a military fatigue jacket with his last name. He's buddies with one guy who refuses to tell me his real name (fine)--so I call him Sticks, because he's always banging away on these decrepit ass drumsticks to this ancient transistor radio. They wait for the liquor store to open at 9AM. Sticks tried telling me Chris Cornell never killed himself: he was alive, somewhere in the Bahamas, all while banging away to ""Black Hole Sun"". One day I asked if Alexei really was a vet. I come from a strong military family, and I was curious what branch he was in. He said he wasn't, it was actually his wife's jacket, and his wife was the vet. I was bummed, and I told him that he should change his sign. A bit later I saw his sign said, ""Sure could use the help :)""

I've also had a lady scream in my face for walking on her sidewalk. In front of my apartment.

I also have had someone walk in the bar that I work at and pepper spray me when I asked for her ID, screaming, ""I DON'T APPRECIATE RACISM!"" Apparently, she's a bit... known. 

So, uh, not all great stories.",1638316824
"mormon","t5_2qky2","Yes. In the Joseph Smith papers, you can find where he was really upset with the Danites.  They got out of his control really fast.  Oliver hints that Rigdon was playing him and what Rigdon was doing behind the scenes wasn't very kosher.

The Danites were formed in June 1838.  By November we had the famous affadavits.

&gt;That about four months¬†ago, a band called the Daughters¬†of Zion,¬†or¬†&lt;‚Äãsince cal[l]ed‚Äã&gt; the¬†Danite band was formed of the memberes of the¬†Mormon &lt;‚Äãchurch‚Äã&gt; the original object of which was to drive¬†from the county of¬†Caldwell¬†all those who dissented¬†from the mormon church, in which they succeeded admirably &amp;c to the satisfaction of those concerned,‚Äî I consider. Joseph Smith Jr as the prime mover and¬†organizer of this Danite band‚Äî the officers of the band¬†according to their grades, were brought before¬†him at a school house, together with¬†Hiram [Hyrum]¬†Smith¬†&amp;¬†Sydney [Sidney] Rigdon¬†the three composing the¬†first presidency of the whole Church, Joseph¬†Smith Jr blessed them &amp; prophesied over them, declaring¬†that they should be the means in the hands of God¬†of bringing forth the Millenial Kingdom.

From the Church Website:

&gt;JS attended at least one of the society‚Äôs meetings and reportedly expressed approval of its aims, but the precise nature of his involvement with the organization is unclear.

Here was the fuse to the powder keg.  Joseph Smith approved a religious millitia.  There are many who auote Joseph and say he thought they were a horrible bunch.  It was a main cause to his imprisonment.  But what really shows me that he was upset about the Leviathan he had helped create was one of his last dreams.

&gt;I was back in Kirtland, Ohio, and thought I would take a walk out by myself, and view my old farm, which I found grown up with weeds and brambles, and altogether bearing evidence of neglect and want of culture. I went into the barn, which I found without floor or doors, with the weather-boarding off, and was altogether in keeping with the farm. ""While I viewed the desolation around me, and was contemplating how it might be recovered from the curse upon it, there came rushing into the barn a company of furious men, who commenced to pick a quarrel with me. ""The leader of the party ordered me to leave the barn and farm, stating it was none of mine, and that I must give up all hope of ever possessing it. ""I told him the farm was given me by the Church, and although I had not had any use of it for some time back, still I had not sold it, and according to righteous principles it belonged to me or the Church. ""He then grew furious and began to rail upon me, and threaten me, and said it never did belong to me nor to the Church. ""I then told him that I did not think it worth contending about, that I had no desire to live upon it in its present state, and if he thought he had a better right I would not quarrel with him about it but leave; but my assurance that I would not trouble him at present did not seem to satisfy him, as he seemed determined to quarrel with me, and threatened me with the destruction of my body. ""While he was thus engaged, pouring out his bitter words upon me, a rabble rushed in and nearly filled the barn, drew out their knives, and began to quarrel among themselves for the premises, and for a moment forgot me, at which time I took the opportunity to walk out of the barn about up to my ankles in mud. ""When I was a little distance from the barn, I heard them screeching and screaming in a very distressed manner, as it appeared they had engaged in a general fight with their knives. While they were thus engaged, the dream or vision ended.""",1638316824

"movies","t5_2qh3s","What? Democracy should not gate keep. That is the entire point. Disenfranchising based on arbitrary means is antithetical to proper democratic processes. If the only people allowed to vote or be citizens, are those who bolster the ONE PARTY states power. Yea. Dunno how you don't understand this guy.

Fascism does not have to be based on race, or sexuality. In this case, the Terran Federation ascended based strictly on political ideology. What happened to the political dissenters to this movement? Oh yea. They were all killed, and or were politically disenfranchised (those incapable of armed resistence). So, like, nothing like Modern Germany, which has a universal franchise of voting rights. No gate keeping. No neo-fascism (fascism is illegal there ya know).

Yes. The end state of Nazi Germany would have resulted in the ethnic genocide of everyone who wasn't Aryan, or Aryan adjacent. Would it have stopped there? Who knows. Oh I get it. I understand what you are now. If you think me saying fascism and Nazism is horrifying is me saying ""They were totes right bro"", then I don't know what to say.

You are coming across as a not very veiled closet fascist. If you think that ethnically exterminating people based on the false premise of some sort of genetic purity is ""correct"", because in the end it results in exterminating all opposing thought. Then yea. If you kill everyone in a room you're in disagreement with, then I suppose you're sort of correct in a ""I just murdered a room full of people and now I am the only remaining voice"" sort of way. Yea, that totally seems like a perfectly legitimate way to achieve a post racial, post sexual, post ideologically divided world.

"aspergers","t5_2rm6u","I see perfectly where you‚Äôre coming from.  I‚Äôm a longtime user of Anki, which is an open source cross-platform flash card system based on the principles of spaced repetition.  I absolutely love it.

What I‚Äôm talking about is broader‚Ä¶ Let me try and make as efficient a distinction as possible:

Spaced repetition is a method for committing to memory atomic-sized facts (more or less, I make flash cards work for simple concepts too but stick with me).

A mindmap - and even further the type of tool that I envision and desire - is not meant to assist in remembering facts with long term memory.  Rather, the objective is representing the _relationships_ between nodes of information.  

Anki is great for storing and remembering facts.  Mind mapping is about organizing facts and concepts _relative to eachother_.

What a mindmap-like system enables is infinitely more than simple memorization.  Mindmapping allows us to mix and match concepts and mechanisms _across disparate knowledge domains_ so that we may discover new connections, useful analogies and much more.

Mindmapping does, however, act as a mechanism effectively expanding our wetware‚Äôs [Working memory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory) capacity, allowing me to dive deeper into a new topic without getting lost or overwhelmed.   But this is fundamentally different from committing a fact to long term memory.

One personal example is that I use Mindmaps to validate the feasibility of a project I‚Äôve been thinking about building, especially a complex project for which there are many dependencies and variables I need to explore for compatibility and which are hard to keep track of in my mind all at once.",1638316824

‚Äûhow much bites you are getting for you hook‚Äú, what does that mean, I don‚Äôt quite get it. 
But yeah, online dating is very exhausting to me, I had some few really good experiences but a lot of bad feelings as well. But offline dating is not happening at all, I find it quite hard.

it's not something I should expect, but I am more
concerned about staying in his lab. I work in his lab
paid during this semester, and the day before he
told me he would also support me next semester.
I am only a UG researcher paid for 6hr/week (barely
because i'm dual enrolled through my high school)
with no support from any other UGs or a grad
student. I also end up working more than this 6 hour
mark a week because of his expectations. I also
control the research direction in it's entirely, unlike
other labs where there are grad students facilitating
the direction of a project. After this, I feel very
unmotivated to continue in his lab.

lab is very small so I am concerned that he is

God of War 2018- it's indeed a good game but for me it's a horrible good GoW game. Everything that made me love the franchise (excellent combat, a camera that allows you to see the entire battlefield so that you don't have to worry about cheap hits while also freeing up the analogue sticks up for rolling, multiple unique enemies to fight with different ways to fight them, a block that works, a jump button, never putting graphics in front of gameplay, upgrades, multiple weapons to use, magic, a game that makes you feel like a badass, etc) is just gone to make ""art"".

Manufacturing supply and demand, 

And take note of the parent companies that own the institutions driving up the demand for said ‚ÄúProduct‚Äù 

Also have much to gain from the sale of said ‚Äúproduct‚Äù 

Within a capitalistic democracy is it not the consumers RIGHT to decide what ‚ÄúProducts‚Äù they may or may not receive? 

And if the consumer vote is taken away do we still live in a capitalistic democracy? 

No... 

we now live in an economic dictatorship where business people can run amuck and extort the masses via rights &amp; freedoms into receiving their ‚Äúproduct‚Äù

Imagine your car dealer threatens to take away your job and bars you from participating in the economy unless you sign the 0 down loan agreement...

‚Äúwhat about the scientific research?‚Äù

"fnaftheories","t5_36f29","&gt;Where does it say that. Elizabeth wasn't able to possess Baby in TFC.

Well yeah, but that's because TFC Baby was, before she killed Elizabeth, already infused with Henry's anger. She essentially absorbed Elizabeth's soul as fuel to become aware, which Baby says herself. If there wasn't any emotional energy in her before, Elizabeth would have possessed Baby. That's also why she possesses Baby in the games. There isn't any emotional energy in Baby prior to Elizabeth's death. It also says in the novels that ""the spirits follow the flesh, but also the *pain* it would seem"".

&gt;And the mci sprites in GGGL are called ""endo"" in the game files

That's actually false. Someone on our discord checked the files, and the sprites from GGGL are called ""help"" and ""child 5"" [(as seen here).](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/914944986146045982/915073504683130900/X0fMH6O.png) Maybe the sprites from the other minigames are called ""endo"" or smt, but GGGL explicitly stats those things to be children that Puppet puts a head on.

&gt;Wym and when did she say it

""The others are like animals... but I am very aware"". 

The souls of the kids aren't in control of their bodies, except for Charlie and maybe Cassidy. This is shown to us multiple times throughout Sister Location, FFPS makes mention of this through Henry, the novels, and even the Frights show us that Chica is in control, while Susie just kinda exists.",1638316827

Or that Epstein died while under Barr's supervision, and his death was cleared by Barr.

Or that Trump wished Ghislaine well after she was arrested.

&gt; Vladimir Putin has warned Nato countries that deploying weapons or soldiers to Ukraine would cross a &amp;quot;Red line&amp;quot; for Russia and trigger a strong response, including a potential deployment of Russian missiles targeting Europe.

&gt; In his most expansive comments on the crisis yet, the Russian president on Tuesday complained of Nato&amp;#039;s historical expansion to Russia&amp;#039;s borders and warned that substantial Nato military support for Ukraine would cross a &amp;quot;Red line&amp;quot; for Russia.

&gt; Western countries have sanctioned Russia for sending its soldiers and heavy weapons to fight in south-east Ukraine, where more than 14,000 people have been killed since 2014.Since 2017, Nato has deployed four international battalion groups to Poland and to the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, in order to deter Russia from launching an attack.

OTOH, yall have actually gotten tougher which sucks when we don't get any credit for beating you while Bama et al get credit for beating UF, Ole Miss, Miss St. and other schools who are good but not great. 

Then the political side of me thinks that the Joes (AD and President) just want to go SEC similar to how Boren wanted the Big 10 and the SEC said yes.

Either way, know that most of the Sooners I know are sad to leave but get much less so when the Cowboys cry foul that we didn't bring them along. Either they are a strong independent school and program or they are little brother. They are quite vocal on their choice until this dropped.

Anyway, good luck my friend in the title game. I am rooting for you!",1638316828

Although it might be hard, hold these thoughts in! You don‚Äôt want her to think you‚Äôre obsessed with this. Not now at least. Do your best to play it cool. 

Something that might work is talking about that hot guy she saw on TikTok while you guys are in the heat of the moment. My bf would do this and it was such a turn on for me, especially if you‚Äôre good at describing a scene and asking good questions. Sex is mental for us just as much as it can be physical. Paint a picture of that hot guy while your touching her. Tell her to imagine how big his dick is. Tell her to imagine what he would do to her if he was right here. Then try asking some open ended questions to see where her head is at, like, where would you want him to kiss you‚Ä¶if she responds positively continue playing with the idea by asking more questions. 

Not sure if this will work for her but it‚Äôs what worked for my bf and I, however we‚Äôre not fully in the lifestyle. I don‚Äôt fuck other guys. Not yet at least lol.

When you break it down for 59%, it‚Äôs 34% completely disagree and 25% somewhat disagree? What does somewhat disagree even mean here? 

14% says agree for gay marriage, but 4% says completely agree and 10% somewhat agree. Again, what does somewhat agree even mean here? Saying somewhat to me isn‚Äôt a sincere in supporting gay marriage. 

Ok this is where it even makes less sense, they put partly agree and partly disagree together with 17%. What does this mean? What is the difference between somewhat and partly? And then 10% says ‚ÄúHard to answer‚Äù. 

So, if we compare it to other polls. it didn‚Äôt change much with 5-10% differences when it comes to including completely agree and somewhat agree and undecided. When people says don‚Äôt care or undecided or even says somewhat agree, they still have abit of homophobia.

Also, I don‚Äôt buy whole idea that decrease is support in gay marriage is due to youngsters growing up from heavy propaganda campaign.

"nailbiting","t5_2vaej","i think the area of the damaged nailbed is about the same size, logically and if i look at the pictures you posted. With the damaged nailbed i mean the rough underlying layer of skin and fragments of nail where the top layer of nail is missing.

Your skin above the nail seems to be healed and less irritated. Maybe some dried out slivers of nailbed have fallen off, what could make you damaged nailbed look a bit smaller. But i guess it is mainly from the growth of your nail from the cuticle that might make the underlying damaged nailbed it seem a bit smaller to you.

Edit: i later realised you probably mean the pink part at the cuticle is getting smaller.
To my eye, the pink part of new nailbed, at the cuticle might be the same of just a bit smaller. This nail might easily split  as it has all the space underneath. I guess it would be good to minimise stress on this nail to prevent splitting. You could wear a band aid on it, but personally i would very gently file it shorter and smoother. I would not worry about it, just let it grow.

So just due to sheer audience, I think you'd have to speculate that left twitter is reaching a tiny group that's largely an echo chamber in comparison to Facebook shuttling everyone's right-of-center relatives straight into Qanon content for the last year or two.

"crystlfinance","t5_51daq6","As for the $CRYSTL token, I assume you are interested in our Pools: [https://polygon.crystl.finance/pools](https://polygon.crystl.finance/pools)  
Right now most of our Pools are on the Polygon chain, but we will start to add new Pools on Cronos as well in the coming weeks/months as we start to build new partnerships on Cronos.  


On Cronos You can buy the $CRYSTL token on Crodex here:  
https://swap.crodex.app/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xCbDE0E17d14F49e10a10302a32d17AE88a7Ecb8B  
Then bridge it to Polygon using the Relaychain bridge, you can see a guide and video how to do it here (the video shows Polygon to Cronos, but the process is quite similar the other way):  
[https://polycrystal.gitbook.io/polycrystal-finance/crystal-clear-education/fundamental-tools-for-success/guide-to-bridging-from-polygon-to-cronos](https://polycrystal.gitbook.io/polycrystal-finance/crystal-clear-education/fundamental-tools-for-success/guide-to-bridging-from-polygon-to-cronos)  


On Polygon, you will need $MATIC tokens to pay for transactions. Relaychain will airdrop you a few $MATIC if you use their bridge.  


Alternatively, you can use the [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) exchange and purchase $USDC or $MATIC on their exchange, and then use the External wallet Withdraw menu to withdraw either $USDC or $MATIC to the Polygon chain.  


You can then purchase $CRYSTL on our ApeSwap DEX Router (on Polygon): [https://dex.crystl.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x76bF0C28e604CC3fE9967c83b3C3F31c213cfE64](https://dex.crystl.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x76bF0C28e604CC3fE9967c83b3C3F31c213cfE64)  


Please keep in mind that $CRYSTL may be cheaper OR more expensive on one chain or the other. It is the same token on both networks and can be bridged between either network (Polygon &amp; Cronos). It might make sense for you to start with the chain where you will be able to buy more $CRYSTL at a better deal. The price can be seen in the upper right on our Polygon or Cronos site: crystl.finance  


Let me know if that makes sense or if you need further assistance!",1638316829

"Crystals","t5_2tg20","Yea I was freaking out and sent an email, before i saw her Tik tok comments. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault‚Äù but it is smh. As a business owner you need to take full responsibility over issues with your site. She knows how many followers she has. She knows she sells out fast. So she either needs to get outside help or just stop selling. Another thing that gets me is the fact that in all of her order packing vids, she has soooo much inventory. Is it the sheer amount of orders that she needs to take care of that causes her to shut down her store, what, like every month? I‚Äôm not trying to be mean to her but come on. Her whole attitude is whack. Edit to this: she turned off her comments lol. But I took screenshots of the replies I saw. An in a new vid she said she only had 175 mystery boxes available. 1) she should‚Äôve said that (and if she did I must have missed that) and 2) it‚Äôs a PREORDER you have plenty of time to fill those orders. Her shop is shut down, so it‚Äôs not like she still has an influx of orders still coming in. And she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm one person‚Äù ok so get some outside help. People love her content, I‚Äôm sure she gets money from Tik tok. And she has a store if I‚Äôm not mistaken. She said the comments were mean to her but I didn‚Äôt see any mean comments.

Damn, that's kind ...heavy for Varric 

&gt;\-Alexius was desperate to save Felix, Erimond was an asshole, Calpernia was an idealist and really failed to see through Corypheus actions unless you give her proofs, Samson did saw through Corypheus, but though that at least his fellow Templars could die feeling proud. Lucius did want to see the world burn, Florainne probably saw him as the best shot at getting power for herself, though she admits she suspected Corypheus would not honor the deal. People like Servis were really making profit from Corypheus' campaing. The point is Corypheus did not fool all of them, some just were ok with the world going to shit if they had a chance to get what they wanted.

Maybe I'm giving people in thedas too much credit but you'd think if a 5 meter tall darkspawn magister comes to you for help you'd be a bit more cautious, I can understand Alexius being desperate and some of them being assholes but all of the rebel mages took no issue over siding with him ?

Now if you add another hydrogen hose to the other side of the tank, then you will cut fueling time im half, which would be about 30 mins. Now, lets put bigger hoses like diesel trucks use for more volume and bigger motor in that mobile unit to create more pressure. Now with 2 big hoses and bigger volume, you get to cut that 30 mins into another half, which gives you roughly about 15 mins. I think that there is tech out there for this as it needs just bigger hoses and bigger motor to create more pressure for more volume. But how will hydrogen react under more pressure?

"ESL_Teachers","t5_2xx1d","I‚Äôm a big, big fan of both Cutting Edge and English File, although I‚Äôve been using older editions as that‚Äôs the materials I‚Äôve got on my hard drive. I think I‚Äôm using the 2nd editions of both, as they‚Äôre both new cutting edge, new English file. They still stand up as great texts.

They are both fully comprehensive coursebooks for general English, and as long as you‚Äôre familiar with how to use the supporting communicative tasks both courses have in the back of the teacher‚Äôs books, then you‚Äôll have more than enough materials to deliver lessons with lots of productive student talk time.

I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre equal in terms of the way vocab and grammar are realistically introduced, integrated into skills tasks, and the course progresses over units, repeating vocab taught in earlier units later on. I also like the way receptive tasks have very good comprehension questions or communicative tasks - my biggest problem with some of the glossier new textbooks or online materials is that while they select interesting texts, they don‚Äôt mine them with enough questions or tasks to really develop reading/listening skills.

The differences that leap to mind are that English File has neater grammar resources at the back of the student‚Äôs book and a photocopiable page of grammar exercises in the back of the teachers book for every unit, if your students prefer clearer formatting for their grammar, whereas Cutting Edge has some slightly more inventive speaking activities in the teacher‚Äôs book.

You could do much worse than to select either of these; just make sure you‚Äôve got the student &amp; teacher books, audio etc, and if your students like homework, get hold of the workbook and give photocopies. 

New Headway/Headway is similar, with good tasks and activities, though again, I‚Äôve been using an older edition.

Speak Out is good too, I‚Äôm using the first editions and I like the dvd lesson and speaking activity at the end of every unit. Sometimes their readings don‚Äôt give enough questions to develop better reading skills imo. Sure, you could write your own, but that‚Äôs one more thing to do. Nice lessons though and the course is well designed.

With all the choices you‚Äôre considering, I‚Äôd probably recommend English File. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.",1638316833

Also, the shit they're talking about the Tyrell P34 F1 car (""in the 70's...80's..."" at least get the dates right if that's where you're drawing inspiration from) - sure, it was banned, but it was banned because 6 wheels allowed them to skirt the rules on tyre size, and increase the contact patch on the road whilst staying within the regulations. It was competitive, but also required ridiculous racing lines that resulted in DNFs on multiple occassions, because it had to be driven in an unorthodox way. Nothing about what Tyrell did is relevant to this.

Also: Tyrrell's car had 4 *front* wheels, not 4 *rear* wheels - the closer comparison would be the March 2-4-0, which *did* have 4 rear wheels, and failed on it's first test run, before being cancelled before it even raced because the team didn't have the money to develop it successfully, and they resorted to pulling parts off their other race cars during development to build it - something that sounds kind of similar to Hennessey's path through history...",1638316834

The immunologist said it's likely an over reaction of the immune system like op said. We did an immune panal and indeed my immune system seems to bring missiles to a gun fight. He mentioned more people are like this then we think and the vxns are created as strong as possible to get the strongest response possible for the most amount of people. In doing so, hyper responders, like us, get fucked. He instructed me to change my diet, more paleo, and come back in 4 months to recheck as it is supposed to Rebalance my immune system.

The metal channel should be installed on all cables to protect them from the plasterers trowel, or at least clipped to the wall. Either way the electrician who did this is an ass and not being helpful,the plasterer could do it but there will be a cost involved for the labour and materials.

I would ask the plasterer for an estimate for this work if he hasn't also stipulated this in his terms too. And then go to the electrician and ask him to make good below finished level (which is by no way unreasonable) if the electrician won't then if he is still looking for money tell him you will keep money back from him to pay the plasterer, if the electrician knows what's good for him he will do it",1638316834

"HaloStory","t5_2vomh","That‚Äôs not really the actual sentiment of proper fans. That‚Äôs just the loud minority. Osiris team and palmer are great, they were just not well implemented. Let‚Äôs be fair, H5 marketing to release was a major reason why Locke and his team got such a hard shaft from the fan base because we had 3 missions as the chief in what felt like HIS story or should have been.

This is where I want games to start making more campaign DLCs so we can see more. And not the halfassed shit either. Like imagine if we had H5 be about chief with Locke and his team essentially in a bit of the background and 6 months down the line got an almost same length campaign that explored how it went for Locke? That for me would be great, it would give the players a lot more love for a team that really isn‚Äôt bad but just forced into us rather than given.

We liked ODST for many reasons, but it was also its own story that didn‚Äôt make us fight over wanting to be MC because he wasn‚Äôt present. H5 was made out to be Johns story and that was robbed from us by the campaign. Not saying the campaign was bad, I genuinely loved it but I understand why people did get upset.",1638316834

I stopped playing Pokemon when I was 14 after Yellow came out. I've dabbled here and there with Let's Go and SwSh. I am loving Diamond. The underground area is nice and reminds me of the field area in SwSh (forget what they're called) without all the lag lol. It's been really fun. 

Deep Rock Galactic might be the most fun I've had playing anything in a long time. My wife loves it too. We played for 5 hours yesterday before we realized we should go to sleep. 

Cyberpunk I haven't sunk too much time into as of yet due to work and other responsibilities but I've enjoyed what I've played thus far. I really dig the atmosphere and soundtrack.

"smallbusiness","t5_2qr34","I am a general contractor, generally I expect payment upon/shortly after completion but I will make exceptions (an extra week or so) for long-term customers if they explain ahead of time - but certainly not 30 days, and not on a regular basis. If there are dragging out payment regularly they probably can't afford my services and there are plenty of people who can.

 I see no reason why a customer should not be able to pay a bill within 5 days. Generally my practice is to invoice on Fridays and be paid by e transfer on Monday or Tuesday.
Clients who want to pay me in cash receive an invoice in person upon completion of the work. If I think someone is acting sketchy and they want to pay by etransfer I will invoice on the spot and get the transfer before I leave.

I honestly cannot understand how as a business owner you are not able to send you an e-transfers, write your own cheques or pay with petty cash.

If your accountant can't handle recording your paid invoices at the end of the month you probably need a new account.

I would never consider taking credit cards, and I stopped taking checks other than occasionally from trusted long-term customers over 10 years ago. Chances are if a contractor is large enough to be accepting credit cards and extending long payment terms, you will likely be paying extra for the services, probably considerably more.",1638316834

"Dodgers","t5_2ra0i","Well..if you start thinking about it..it makes more sense for us..

Lets say we sign him..this upcoming year the infield could look anything like:

C - Smith
1B - Freeman
2B - Lux/Muncy
SS - Trae Turner
3B - Muncy/CT3/Justin Turner
DH - Justin Turner/Master Beaty

IMO - 3B makes the most sense for Muncy, as its JT‚Äôs last year and I don‚Äôt imagine us bringing him back unless its strictly to DH. Look ahead one year, Muncy has a team option for his 2023 season at 13 mill a season + potential bonuses depending on a threshold of receiving MVP votes. At that value, it would be dumb not to pick it up by the Dodgers specially if he‚Äôs still playing the way he is today. But thats it, 2024, we‚Äôre out a 1B (if we don‚Äôt sign Freeman). We‚Äôll have Cody to worry about that offseason too. Maybe Friedman looks at this as an opportunity to get ahead and have our 1B guaranteed for the next half a decade. We could front load the contract too and that could give the team more flexibility to re-sign Cody on a mega deal (assuming the next two years he is back to his badass self).

So if we pushed him forward this season, then he‚Äôs way ahead of where the other characters are.‚Äù 

He sat out a season because his story caught up to the books and the other's had not. And at the time the plan was the books would still come out before the show ended. They weren't trying to go past the books yet. The plan was not for the show to finish everything. You can find various comments over the years about this.",1638316835

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","I had a similar job at your age (10 years ago). 

I ended up going back to school taking online classes to get my BA.  With all the resources available today, I would use the time to learn high value transferable skills in an area that interests you. 

I ended up starting my own businesses, but if I were talking to my 22 year old self today, I would tell her to consider the following: 

-  Enroll in a tech bootcamp, learn to become a full stack developer or learn data science. Most bootcamps will help you find a high paying job at the end. I have friends that went to general assembly and are making over $100k/ year working minimal hours with incredible benefits. General assembly has free ‚Äúintro classes‚Äù you can take to see what might interest you. You can also self-teach yourself these skills, there‚Äôs a ton of free resources available (I tend to work better with a structured program). You can also look into learning about blockchain or crypto-currency or becoming AWS certified. 

- Free Certifications: Google has a ton of free certifications. I loved the Google Digital Garage certificate. Google analytics/ Google AdWords certification is great too! Hubspot social media certificate &amp; anything from Facebook/ TikTok. You‚Äôll learn skills that will make you employable or you can freelance on sites like upwork/ Fiverr or run your own online business‚Ä¶ keep updating your LinkedIn and your online network. 

- Shopify has a ton of great learning resources on starting an e-commerce business. You can start your own store with basically nothing and run it while at your current job. You can source products easily now from online wholesalers (you can use your marketing skills learned from those Google certificates to sell your products online). You can get a store setup in a day! TikTok is great resource for learning. 

Most important, continuously invest time in improving your financial literacy. I took a basic accounting then a basic investing class at 28 yo that changed my life coming from a low-income household. 

Learn about basic finance, investing (stocks, real estate) building credit, taxes, managing expenses, etc. etc. etc. Napkin Finance is a great resource they have some mini courses that make everything easy to understand. Read books, watch YouTube videos, podcasts, etc. on these topics. Little by little what you learn will compound and have tremendous benefits. It can be overwhelming  at first but take your time. 

Learning the high value of the future skills will give you choices. With these skills you now can start/ run your own business, freelance, or get a high paying job (whenever or wherever you want). 

Improving your financial literacy will allow you to have control over your time. Time is the most valuable asset we have. You can never get stuck in a job, relationship, or place your not happy. 

Obviously everyone‚Äôs situation is different but I‚Äôm speaking to my 22 year old self who was working a similar job and wasted too much time! 
 
Use your time wisely! 

I wish you all the success in whatever path you choose!",1638316835

When I was young we had quartback club, game day, madden, 2k,  and blitz(underrated and needs a comeback) and now all we get is madden‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs lazy and neglected as a franchise and the abuse of the nfl rights is bullshit. The fact that they‚Äôre justified to put an updated roster and maybe some wack game mode or feature that was in the game 15 years ago that they removed and added again‚Ä¶ they are crooks and scammer. I‚Äôm tired of corporate gaming developers‚Ä¶ there is no love in the madden development. Animations are boring, plays are broken and the A.I. is either dumb ass shit or able to predict your play. There is no balance‚Ä¶ this game should run like a well oiled machine after 30 years of development‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a shame to see what they‚Äôve let the greatest sports game franchise turn in to‚Ä¶",1638316836

&gt; The deck uses Second Sunrise and Faith's Reward to get back cards that generate mana, such as Lotus Bloom, and various artifacts that draw a card. A common choice to win the game is Pyrite Spellbomb. However, the way the player gets to the point of forcing a win might involve casting Second Sunrise so many times that the entire library is drawn, and only cards put back with Conjurer's Bauble are left. A single turn might take fifteen minutes or more.

&gt; In a large tournament, such as a Grand Prix, when time for the round expires, players are given five additional turns to complete their game. Usually, this takes a few minutes to conclude the rest of the games. However, a player playing Eggs might have a fifteen-minute turn during the additional turns, delaying the start of the next round by ten minutes or more (beyond the next-longest match). Over the course of a day, this can mean an extra hour of waiting for everyone else in the tournament.",1638316836
"hoi4","t5_2zvvb","15MIC isn't anywhere near a good tank, the cheapest possible design is 10,5MIC and is weaker than Mech 1. 15MIC gets you a tank that is slightly worse than a pre-NSB LT1 (as opposed to getting Medium IIs for 14 MIC which is much closer to accurate figures).  
A tank that is vaguely similar to the Sherman in terms of design features and has pretty much the same stats as the old Medium II is now 34,7MIC despite a handful of national spirits and a pretty good designer (maxed out soviet).   


That would put it at around 120,000$ if we're using the B-17's unit price/MIC as a reference.  


Funnily enough, that's 20,000$ more than the original price for a B17 which was deemed too expensive and twice as expensive as the 1936 price of a B18",1638316836

I finally figured out that air was the key, whether its in the form of a compressor and airbrush, or a rattle spray can. I will say that as far as dry brushing goes, this is one of the better applications as the coat and consistency is thin enough. These days all I use dry brushing for is figure work and broad diorama work. You might try shopping for some sspray cans, I think you'll really like it. For the American and Soviet vehicles it's great since they are one coat (mostly). For German vehicles 1939-early 43 I use Dunkelgrau/Panzer Grey and mid 1943 onwards I use Tamiya's Dark Yellow and find it perfect.",1638316836

"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","Yeah, I had to show a couple of my friends who've been playing for a while how to do it, as well as why they should with such amazing rewards.

Every room and outside area has it's own load limit.  Every item takes up a percentage of the load.  NPC's like companions, dogs, cats, and boars take up a fat 10-15% by themselves, while tree's and rocks take up something around 1-2%.   You can look up a proper guide to how much each item costs and the total, but I've not personally done that.


Generally, place as much furniture as you can in an area then repeat that in each new area.  Your house has a lot of individual rooms to place things in, the most difficult part comes more in obtaining enough raw furniture to fill the place up. 


The number of additional outdoor areas, as well as your maximum realm currency the pot can hold, depends on your trust rank. You can rapidly build trust rank by crafting new pieces of furniture. The higher your rank the more furniture you can craft at once.  Place all that new furniture and continue building up that adeptal energy.   Once you've hit 20k energy, you have the maximum gains per hour. 
At which point you can coast off just going inside and reaping your rewards, or you can start to build furnishing set's for your companions which can net you achievements and primo's for your effort.

Your husband needs to understand that he has a family with you that he is neglecting every time he runs off to another country to save his family. What is so important that he needs to physically be there? Why can't he play an advisory role from home?

What steps has the person needing help taken to resolve the issue? What help can your husband be from your home? What will happen if he doesn't travel?

You can get paid a few hundred dollars to play a game as advertising for the game. You can make a few thousand a month just by uploading special content to Patreon, breaking up streams into 30m YouTube videos also nets you a nice amount of money and diversifies your earning even more.

If you're a good channel you likely have a podcast or some similar extra revenue, and then merch/donations/bounties also make up a significant amount of money too.

When you look at it microscopically, and only examine one facet, yes it's not a lot of money.

Some already had a place in the old tower, but not you have empty spots where old characters are no longer at 

How is this Supposed to work in the old tower? The old tower was made for the past. Cayde, The speaker, the factions, vanguard and crucible weapon vendors, Xander, and Eva are no more or used for events.

We need a new tower that doesn't feel like the past is weighing it down.

I wasn't saying the current tower is best, im saying we need something that's the right size that allows enough flexibility for them to add some in without it feeling cramped and yet have enough space to where each vendor has a proper space 

I mean shit, Saladin was shoved into a small corner of an area that was only used twice outside of iron banner.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"zen","t5_2qhmf","People have translated ""dhyana"" to mean all sorts of things, including ""meditation"". What kind of meditation though? Are you visualizing being in a pure land? Are you sitting in a specific posture and focusing on your breathing? Are you concentrating on making sense of a koan?

There's like a thousand kinds of meditation, but I've generally found that the people that hew to the over-simplification that dhyana/chan/zen == meditation have some specific form of meditation that they have in mind, that they're saying is the root of all these traditions in a round-about way.

So there's really two different ways that I disagree with the dhyana/chan/zen==meditation trope. On the one hand, I don't think that's an accurate way of approaching translation. Words in Sanskrit from 500 AD aren't going to have 1-to-1 correspondence with modern English, especially when they're for concepts like ""dhyana"". And on the other, I don't agree with this sort of erasure of the diversity of meditative practice through human history and culture.

As to your broader question I'd first need you to describe *exactly* what you mean by ""sitting meditation"", because some people have ideas about what ""sitting meditation"" is that Zen masters certainly don't think is helpful. They *do* tell people to grapple with stuff and figure their shit out, and if sitting quietly and thinking is an effective way for you to do that I think they're not against it. But quietism is pretty universally derided.

I leave you with Linji:

&gt;One day Constant Attendant Wang called on the Master and together they went to look at the monks' hall.
&gt;
&gt;Constant Attendant Wang said, ""This hallful of monks‚Äî do they read sutras perhaps?""
&gt;
&gt;The Master said, ""No, they don't read sutras.""
&gt;
&gt;""Do they perhaps learn how to meditate?"" asked the Constant Attendant.
&gt;
&gt;""No, they don't learn how to meditate,"" said the Master.
&gt;
&gt;The Constant Attendant said, ""If they don't read sutras oe they don't learn how to meditate, what in fact do they do?""
&gt;
&gt;The Master said, """"We're training all of them to become buddhas and patriarchs.""
&gt;
&gt;The Constant Attendant said, ""Gold dust may be precious, but if it gets in the eye it can blind. What about it?""

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","5 kids here. Every one took MONTHS before they slept through the night. Every. Single. One. They would wake up every couple hours and cry. Tell your husband ""welcome to being a parent"" You don't do it because it's ""super fun"", you do it because you love them, and you believe they should have a chance at life. You especially don't do it thinking, ""oh boy, I'm gonna have such a great body when this is all over"" or ""man I sure hope my wife keeps up her sexy bod"". I'm not going to downplay the importance of personal health and exercise, but those babies come first for a while before you'll be able to get back into the swing of things and stay working on your own body again. Take it easy, and tell him to back off and have some empathy.

I don't recommend it this early on (talk to a doctor), but when it got to that point, we started the ""5-10-15"" rule, as recommended by our doctor. We would put them down for sleep. If they started to cry, wait for 5 minutes, go in and re-swaddle. Wait 10 minutes. If still crying, same thing, wait 15 minutes. If still crying, then feed and soothe and things. AGAIN, THIS IS MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD.

This is HARD to do, too. Listening to that baby cry is heartbreaking, typically even more difficult for mom. But I'm the end, they sleep better, and you sleep better. In many ways, good parenting never gets easy, just had different difficulties. Instead of poopy diapers and feedings, it's potty training, then it becomes teaching basic etiquette and responsibility, then it becomes helping them feel valued and navigate relationships. It's all hard, but it's all worth it.

Good luck. I hope you're able to work it out. Might not be a bad idea to sell out some couple's therapy.",1638316842

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","I never said anything about casuals, and the whole discussion is about going forward since it's mostly too late to implement any new measures in this gauntlet.

I also never said anything about immediately being able to compete at the top level, that's obviously not possible and strawmanning the argument doesn't help anybody.  It *is* however a huge deterrent to potential competitors if some kid could come along and pull 3 days straight to get an advantage on better players, and I'm sure even the top competitors recognize this as a possibility.  It hasn't happened yet, but as ziz said the growing prize pool increases the likelihood.

I didn't word the last sentence very well, so it comes off as if I think the recent competitors have been pulling 36 hours, which isn't the case.  It was based off of not an assumption, but an inevitability brought up in the top-level comment by ziz that it's a question of when, not if, the growing prize pool will entice someone to do something dangerous.  We may not even hear of it if someone overdoses on stimulants for the chance at a million dollar prize, and even if we do it shouldn't take that much for this to be taken seriously.

"Spanish","t5_2qtt1","&gt;Usted would need to be in there.

You could just say ‚Äú¬øQuiere (el) f√∫tbol?‚Äù the usted is normally implied if you‚Äôre talking directly to someone. 

I went to Mexico for 2 months with a similar worry to you and it really was just a case of retraining my brain to lose the ‚Äús‚Äù on present conjugated verbs like ‚Äútiene, va, hace‚Äù instead of ‚Äútienes, vas, haces‚Äù for instance. Plus even if you lose your flow by using it people will definitely appreciate that you‚Äôre addressing them correctly, whenever I slipped up and used t√∫ on someone way older I could tell from their reaction that it sounds jarring. 

Obviously you get loads of slack since you‚Äôre a foreigner but it is an important part of courtesy in most of Latin America (way less in Spain I‚Äôve heard). Assuming you‚Äôre in your 20s or younger then definitely use usted on waiters, shop staff etc unless they‚Äôre within 5-10 years of your age or younger, anyone over 60 is default usted. Same with talking to random people on the street. 

If you‚Äôre meeting with a family or friends then anyone over 40 it‚Äôs a safe bet to address them as usted unless they ask for you to call them as t√∫. I talked to a couple in their late 30s using usted and while the guy didn‚Äôt mind the woman jokingly told me ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making me feel old.‚Äù 

So it is quite important in sounding polite even if it doesn‚Äôt affect communication. That said I wouldn‚Äôt worry if you get it wrong sometimes since someone would have to be a huge a-hole to bring you up on it or get upset when you‚Äôre still learning the language.

Plus I see with my own eyes that many many of my vaccinated acquaintances in Italy got covid in the past few months, they don't even know why they got vaccinated at this point since new variants take over and make the vaccines ineffective. (Plus my mechanic died right after he got the jab with a heart attack when he was cycling one Sunday.. but ok, just wanted to point it out. Oh and yes, that other guy who had to get it to travel to Sardinia but now cannot move his frickin legs anymore.. hmm I wonder why some people just don't blindly take the vaccine..  I am gonna stop the rant now.) Either way, I am pro-choice for everyone",1638316843

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","You should stop framing it as a matter of interest. Frame it as a matter of your own success. You will be more successful in math because you have prepared for math. You will be handicapped in finance and trying to catch up.

&amp;#x200B;

If they say ""well you can work hard to be great in finance too"" then tell them that working hard with that same effort will make you even greater in math, because it was what you prepared for, and what you have already put so much work into. If they were going to put their foot down about finances, the time to do this was years ago. Ask what changed their minds, and if they think it's smart for them to suddenly require you to study advanced financial classes when they supported your decision to pursue math and therefore you have never taken the basics.

&amp;#x200B;

Flip the script. Their current script is that they are helping you achieve greatness - resist this, it's not true. You are going to have to stand firm in your presentation that they are asking you to shoot yourself in the foot. Tell them they are sabotaging your greatness by reducing the value of your previous hard work. Do they want you to be a great mathematician, or a nobody in finance?

&amp;#x200B;

You need to be ready to say that you feel so strongly about this that you will pay for the math classes yourself by taking out student loans, because you are determined to be successful.

&amp;#x200B;

I would also try to show them a little of your coursework, to show them how much you have learned and your great potential in math. Sometimes it is simply that people do not value a subject when they don't know how hard it is. Math is just as complex and ""prestigious"" as finance or engineering in my opinion. If you have an advanced project you're working on, try to share a little about it with them and its applications to the real world or a career. Try to figure out a career plan and share with them what that is.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I think the optimal way to do this is a sit-down talk. Tell your parents that you are excited to share your progress from school with them so far, launch into whatever your most impressive current work is. Then segue into this is why you want to pursue math, this is what you have prepared for, this is the greatness you are determined to achieve, and this is the career or career options that you are considering, which make from X up to X salary per year. You have A or B professor or mentor or mathematician who has achieved great success and you think they are inspiring. Finally, say that you don't understand why it is a smart decision to waste all the work you have done so far and start from basics - just because it's possible, doesn't make it the best decision for your success. Listen to what they say, try to respond with kindness but hold your ground - and be ready for them to withdraw finances.",1638316843

Combat just.. doesn‚Äôt compare though. DMC (especially 5) is ALL about the combat. There aren‚Äôt builds technically but there are MANY weapons and techniques. Everything has a place and time to be used, and a lot of combat boils down to button timing and spacing attacks out while rapidly switching weapons. Then you factor in the GUNS and styles and shit gets nuts.

No one said anything about eating. If I kill someone because I'm a sadist and simply enjoy the act of murder,  what's wrong with that? 


&gt; We give humans rights because we consider them people.

So because society doesn't consider them people, they *shouldn't* be considered people? Animals are more smart and sentient than you give them credit for. We know that they feel pain.

Now why is a small amount of our pleasure worth tons of their pain?

&gt;Again, it's to eat them. Not just for pleasure. The fact that they provide nutrition is inextricably linked to the act.

We are no longer a hunter-gatherer society. It is absolutely 100% for pleasure, because we can get every single nutrient an animal gives us from elsewhere. Hell we already eat way more meat than is recommended.

&gt;We've been over the human bit, but as for dogs/cats? That's a cultural difference. There may be other cultures that eat dogs or cats. I, personally, don't, but I also don't see it as morally different than eating a cow or a pig.

So you're genuinely okay with people fattening up dogs and killing them when they're maybe a year old? Props for the consistency I guess. 

&gt;It's nearly impossible in this day and age to act perfectly so that no action you do contributes to any suffering anywhere in the world.

Just because there's no such thing as ethical consumption, doesn't mean there isn't less unethical consumption. We should try an minimize our consumption in ways we can. 

The internet is a necessity in the modern age. Good luck getting many jobs without it.

If you play Sunfire them rush it for drakes. But first understand that objective control is another win condition, just like camping top for example. The problem with objective control is that it requires:

1) Lane priority in at least 1 Lane.

2) Favorable wave state of that winning lane. Sometimes people don't want to fuck their wave for going with you to take drake. Rammus can easily repay the favor by diving/path ganking to fix the state of the wave. Communicate.

3) A suitable champion for the task.

4) Tracking of enemy Jungler.

Number 3 is where our buddy falls off.

So what can we do Johnny? Easy! Force a skirmish mid. Wait for their jungler to show their cheeks and give him a clap. Or spam ping drake and force a fight there ""ALWAYS FOCUSING ENEMY JUNGLER"" don't be afraid of pinging your ape following who to focus. Without the enemy Jungler around Rammus is alright at taking drake.

Arrive early at drake and STACK YOUR SUNFIRE! Fighting a rammus full spell &amp; with Sunfire stacked can be a VERY bad idea. People underestimate the output so much.

In short, force a fight. Look for that fucker delete him and go secure drake. Any drake pre-sunfire never belonged to you, think it that way ;) Pre-sunfire you should be focusing topside map anyways. Shelly pre 14 is game changing together with demolish and R.

And remember ""no drake for me but also imma not let you take a drake until I get Sunfire"" is also effective. Especially more on Rammus for being Heavily late game oriented. In even situations that decision-making puts you on top.

Hope I was able to help you.",1638316844

But again we have very good medications now as long as people are constantly on them and dont skip doses and so on they should be fine. Game publishers have to put the warning for legal reasons to avoid any possible liability issues, while emergency services are exempt, you generally cant sue them. That being said, EMS lights are rotatory most of the time and they‚Äôre actually very slow if you‚Äôve noticed before.

These people, Adam and Eve, would have looked to us like gods. Golden, pure starlight, colours radiating from them, I dunno... They would make you squint, they glowed. They shone. They were luminated.

Today humans still glow, no matter what skin pigmentation or 'colour' you wish to apply. Hexidecimal code doesn't allow any Human to be purely black or white, we aren't either color. Humans do glow, slightly, they proved that.

Adam and Eve lost that glow when they became naked from sinning. They hid and covered themselves from the psychological shame of sin and the literal loss of light which used to clothe them.",1638316845

*****
&gt; At least 20 Sudanese troops have reportedly died following clashes with Ethiopian forces on the countries&amp;#039; shared border.

&gt; Sudanese soldiers fell into an ambush on Saturday after traveling across the Atbara river and being bombarded, Bloomberg reported, citing Alrasheed Ali, a member of the border commission of Sudan&amp;#039;s southeastern Gadaref state.

&gt; The deadly clashes occurred after more than a year of conflict in al-Fashqa, an area that touches both Sudan and Ethiopia and produces cotton and sorghum, according to Bloomberg.

"Psychosis","t5_2tyg2","You didn‚Äôt twist my logic at all. You just asked a question, and the answer is whatever you want it to be. You can choose to care about what your wife is saying and you can choose to not care. The decision is up to you. They do try to teach us about caring about others, but ultimately it‚Äôs our decision. And I‚Äôm not making a case against something I know to be wrong. It‚Äôs not wrong. I know I‚Äôm right. Well, technically, there is no right and wrong with this. We‚Äôve gotten extremely far from my original point. You did nothing but nitpick a small detail of my original point and focus on it since it‚Äôs the only one you could argue against.

You know that we aren‚Äôt actually killing the planet, right? The planet will be fine and life will continue long after us. People really love to blow the whole thing out of proportion because that‚Äôs the only way to get them to do something. Killing yourself isn‚Äôt going to solve this problem. You could instead go and actually do something to help it.

I‚Äôm not going to be hurt by this at all. Knowing I‚Äôve tried and can‚Äôt change the outcome makes me feel better than not trying at all. You want me to give you a reason to live, but do you really need a reason? You‚Äôre going to die eventually anyway. Why not see it to the end? None of it is going to matter once you‚Äôre dead, anyway. I think you‚Äôve been sold a false idea of how the world should be. The way you‚Äôre talking about why you want to die just screams ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt how it should be‚Äù. Well, how should it be, then? Would you be happy if people worked on farms all day? You‚Äôre looking at the world through a very cynical lens. You‚Äôre right, I don‚Äôt know you, but you‚Äôll never know if it gets better if you end it right now. Life is full of surprises and things will change if you‚Äôre patient and actually try to do something to change it. You talk about people being ungrateful and resorting to substance and enjoyment when you‚Äôre doing the same thing, except you‚Äôre resorting to suicide to cope. 

You‚Äôre right that the world is a place of suffering, but that‚Äôs no reason to kill yourself. That‚Äôs a reason to stay alive and try and help the world to not suffer as much, even just a little bit. Is this the world I want to live in? No, but it‚Äôs the only world there is. You can focus on the bad or you can look for the good. It‚Äôs up to you. Who cares about whether or not you deserve something? If you don‚Äôt deserve to be happy, then be happy anyway. Why not? What do you think will happen if you get something you don‚Äôt deserve? It happens all the time in life.",1638316846

So let's use silly numbers let's say you have 10 Bitcoin and it costs one Bitcoin to withdraw so you get 9 Bitcoin to your wallet. Well say a Bitcoin is worth $1 million. But you wait too long till later in the evening you still have 10 Bitcoin it's still cost one Bitcoin to withdraw so you will still get nine Bitcoin to your wallet but the cost of bitcoin has gone down to $500. You've actually not lost any money and you not gained any money either had you done it at the higher price your gain and loss occurs at the moment you sell the coin not the moment you withdraw it.

The only other options left would be teaching, engineering , doctoral posts which allow recruitment until age 28-33 etc 

The other thing is dual nationality isn‚Äôt allowed, you have to give up british passport at the Britain consulate and only keep Pakistani passport.

Isn't is possible for you so install HA OS in a proxmox-container, like you would do on bare metal? HA provides several images, although not for proxmox. However, you can take the Virtualbox-image and convert that to proxmox. Look here:

[https://www.calidade.systems/en/2019/08/04/moving-a-virtual-machine-from-virtualbox-to-proxmox/](https://www.calidade.systems/en/2019/08/04/moving-a-virtual-machine-from-virtualbox-to-proxmox/)

If you take the Home assistant Operating System version for linux, virtualbox:

[https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/linux](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/linux)

And convert that to proxmox, you have HA OS running native in a proxmox-container. Problem solved. :)

&gt; At least 20 Sudanese troops have reportedly died following clashes with Ethiopian forces on the countries&amp;#039; shared border.

&gt; Sudanese soldiers fell into an ambush on Saturday after traveling across the Atbara river and being bombarded, Bloomberg reported, citing Alrasheed Ali, a member of the border commission of Sudan&amp;#039;s southeastern Gadaref state.

&gt; The deadly clashes occurred after more than a year of conflict in al-Fashqa, an area that touches both Sudan and Ethiopia and produces cotton and sorghum, according to Bloomberg.

The Russell can be a bit funny/counter-intuitive. It can be the small+irrational stocks, instead of value stocks.

Generally though, of course it should do poorly with rising interest rates because these are small companies that are hopefully growing and probably need to borrow to fund growth. But OTOH, if there is a bubble in large caps that gets corrected, some of these look like better values. So the Russell can be down overall but still contain a lot of the big winners, even in broadly unfavorable market conditions. And another factor, tapering doesn't hurt them, few of these companies are selling bonds compared to the large caps, and fewer also hold bonds as investments. So they could benefit from rotation out of the companies who stop getting free money from the Fed bond purchases.",1638316849

"WhitePeopleTwitter","t5_35n7t","It used to be annoying that people cannot distinguish between *pointing out the difference between what redditors say and actual facts*, and *'defending' the accused persons*. Now I'm just disappointed.

Andrew isn't being accused of 'taking advantage of highschool girls', he's accused of having sex with a girl who was under the age of consent, and of being involved of the sex trafficking of girls generally, and of being involved in a poolside 'orgy' at Epstein's island.

I strongly believe he had sex with Virginia Roberts, and it was stupid of him to pretend he didn't. But she was at least 17 when she was in London (age of consent: 16). And I have not seen any detailed allegation that he 'knew' that she had sex with him although she did not want to do so and because she was ordered to do so by Epstein/Maxwell.

If you look at the photograph, that was clearly a party; there were a lot of people there. An large number of people go and have one night stands with someone they meet at a party every week. Rich and influential single and celebrated men, as I understand it, frequently do so. Is it distasteful that this happens? Yes. But it's not criminal - usually.

And yet Andrew's name is bandied about on the internet in exactly the same way as if there was film footage of him raping 10 year olds.

It's unreasonable to assume there *are* girls we don't know of. What we do is wait to hear about them, and then we can draw conclusions. Otherwise we can just accuse Andrew of being responsible for a school shooting because, well, you never know.",1638316850

"PCAcademy","t5_9qtyf","Hey'o, although I'm not to sure if this is going to be helpful generally speaking the best use of a class can be it's subclass, so while levels are hard to get putting one more into Bard can unlock the College Of Swords, which adds a bit of zest to your PC, 

First up is a Fighting Style which has no downside really, if you use 1 weapon or a Great Weapon. You unlock Blade Flourish, which let's you use that Bardic Inspiration for giving you some extra damage, bonus AC, moving around after a hit or pushing them away giving an opportunity attack to you or close by allies. That plus your Rouges ability to disengage/dash as a bonus action gives you alot of mobility.

Now that you have some combat uses for the Bard levels aside from magic, you can really be skilled at nearly everything, with 2 Expertises (Rouge 1/Bard 3), Jack of All Trades.

Of course the biggest part of the build is using your Sneak attack and as another comment mentioned Swashbuckler subclass for the Rouge would be a great fit, giving you that sweet sweet Fancy Footwork (can't get hit by opportunity attacks if you land a strike) which pairs up with the Blade Flourish like Kolbalds and Shiny Objects. And lastly the Rakish Audacity which let's you use sneak attack in a 1v1.

With all that paired together you can get a pretty interesting character, although the biggest thing is to play a character you enjoy. There are plenty of Class Combinations that we can give you but if you aren't having fun with the character talk to the DM and just ask for a class change, a character doesn't have to die for you to have a different playstyle. Though if you don't change classes I hope my advice helped and I wish you all the luck in your adventures OP!",1638316850

This one looks pretty much the same except we use different variations of vegetables - basically, you take the meat, put it in a pot, add vegetables (carrots, celery, onion, parsley), salt, pepper, bay leaves, add water and cook it (the length depends on the type of meat you use). We usually cook noodles in a separate pot and add them immediately before eating but only to our bowl not to the whole soup (we don't want to spoil it). 

If we use chicken, we usually shred the meat and add it to the soup. If you for example use beef you can add it to soup but you can also have a ""2 in 1"" meal - the soup + the meat from the soup with a tomato sauce and mashed potatoes. It's delicious. Hope I helped !",1638316851

"science","t5_mouw","&gt; So, it is possible to build reactors in a prompt fashion, if there's political will.

And a trained, experienced workforce and supply chain.

You're completely right that France and China (among others) ramped up their nuclear construction industries admirably, and as a result could (France in the 70s) or can (China today) deploy large numbers of nuclear reactors quickly, efficiently, cheaply, and safely.

Unfortunately, France *could* do that; it *can't* today.  Therein lies the major problem with nuclear as a driver of decarbonization.

Looking at the history of nuclear power development in [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_commercial_nuclear_reactors#France) and [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_commercial_nuclear_reactors#China), it looks like it takes ~15 years to build up the construction capacity required to go from the first few reactors to starting rapid deployment.  A second way to estimate is [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20437-0) on carbon capture which estimates 20% annual growth as a reasonable maximum for a large, well-funded industry; that also gives ~15 years to get from nuclear's current 5-10% of net new global power to 100%.  For either one, add on another 5 years for that first wave of plants to be built; the result is that it would be ~20 years before nuclear could start making large-scale contributions to global electricity.

That takes us into the 2040s, by which time the [IPCC emissions scenarios which hold warming to under 2C](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf) say we should be 30-70% decarbonized *across all sectors*, not just energy generation.

Nuclear is great -- it's clean, safe, reliable, and scalable -- but it's being built in far too small of quantities to be a meaningful driver of near-term decarbonization.  Major nations should start rebuilding their nuclear construction industries ASAP, and those few countries who are already building them should build more, but [renewables are being deployed at 10x the energycapacity-factor-adjusted rate of nuclear](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/q3fl64/explaining_why_green_hydrogen_is_our_best_maybe/hftki52/) right now, and due to sheer logistics we have little choice but to rely on them for most of our near-term decarbonization.

Fortunately, [renewables account for 90% of global net new generation](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewable-energy-market-update-2021), or 80% adjusted for capacity factor, meaning they are currently being added at roughly the scale needed for decarbonization.",1638316852

&gt; At least 20 Sudanese troops have reportedly died following clashes with Ethiopian forces on the countries&amp;#039; shared border.

&gt; Sudanese soldiers fell into an ambush on Saturday after traveling across the Atbara river and being bombarded, Bloomberg reported, citing Alrasheed Ali, a member of the border commission of Sudan&amp;#039;s southeastern Gadaref state.

&gt; The deadly clashes occurred after more than a year of conflict in al-Fashqa, an area that touches both Sudan and Ethiopia and produces cotton and sorghum, according to Bloomberg.

Usually a call goes longer because either the agent or the customer goes off on a tangent.

*****

&gt; En opini√≥n de Elisa God√≠nez P√©rez, doctora en ciencias antropol√≥gicas, las razones por las que civiles se arman para hacer frente a la delincuencia surgen como ‚Äúmedidas desesperadas‚Äù.   

&gt; Desde la √≥ptica legal, existen condiciones claras para la defensa leg√≠tima, que se describen en el Art√≠culo 16 de la Constituci√≥n y en los 15, 16 y 17 del C√≥digo Penal Federal; pero intervienen muchos factores: el riesgo inminente, la causal de exclusi√≥n del delito, proporcionalidad, y en el caso de uso de arma de fuego: si contaba con permiso, si el arma no estuvo involucrada en un delito o si la persona que se defendi√≥ contaba con portaci√≥n de arma.   

&gt; ‚ÄúLa fracci√≥n cuarta del Art√≠culo 17¬† (de la Constituci√≥n) establece lo que es la defensa leg√≠tima que es: la amenaza real inminente de sufrir una agresi√≥n o un da√±o, que puede ser un lugar, su casa, puede ser un bien o un lugar donde el agresor no tenga el leg√≠timo derecho de ingresar.

&gt; En ese sentido estar√≠amos ante la defensa leg√≠tima del uso de la fuerza y amparada ante el supuesto de la defensa leg√≠tima que est√° prevista en el Art√≠culo 17 de la Constituci√≥n y en el propio C√≥digo Penal‚Äù, detalla Ernesto Villanueva, investigador del Instituto de Investigaciones Jur√≠dicas de la UNAM.   

&gt; ‚ÄúSon medidas desesperadas, son estrategias desesperadas, no tanto de, como se dice, sustituir al Estado, cuando no cumple sus obligaciones de garantizar seguridad, que hasta cierto punto es verdad, pero muchas veces, lo que yo encuentro en el caso espec√≠ficos de los linchamientos es que tambi√©n se vuelven una forma de exigir mayor intervenci√≥n estatal‚Äù, dice la doctora God√≠nez P√©rez.

"CommunalShowers","t5_2858fg","&gt; I don't think teachers today are willing to monitor showering. 

I don't think so, either--not in this current climate. Teachers would realize all it takes is one accusation of improper conduct that would be hard to disprove (like: ""he kept staring at my penis every day!"") to potentially end the teaching career. And possibly generate legal problems. And I'd bet schools, too, would be worried now, and might have rules keeping the teachers out of the locker room as much as possible.

One of my old PE teachers died a couple of years ago. There were some stories about him that his former students remembered. One guy said he got into a fight one day in the showers. (Needless to say, they were nude--back then, that was a given.) And the teacher restrained the guy who told the story. I told this to some younger people, including one who is a therapist. This therapist couldn't believe it--and obviously was thinking ""improper conduct."" It was sort of a reminder for me how much the world has changed since I was young. Today, after so many news stoires of teachers who do something terrible,  people assume the worst. But I'm sure that teacher's only thought was: we have a problem here, and it needs to stopped--now! I'm sure that's what the guys involved probably thought. That's probably what all his students of that era would have thought. 

This incident also shows why the monitoring is pretty essential.

&gt; They weren't even turned on in my Junior High

Not unusual. You also hear stories about the showers becoming a store room. 1971: this is used so students can clean up after PE. 2021: this is where we store textbooks we'll never use again!

I now wonder if ""storeroom"" is the fate of the showers in my old junior high. I can almost imagine the kid of today coming into the locker room, and seeing the shower area first thing (like I did). And seeing nothing but old desks piled up!",1638316853

&gt;	‚Ä¢ Which DAC is superior?

The iPad doesn‚Äôt have a DAC. (Well, it has one for sending a signal to the internal speaker, but it doesn‚Äôt have a DAC that you can connect another device to.) That USB-C to 3.5mm dongle *is* a DAC‚Äîjust a very tiny one. The DAC circuitry is built into the dongle barrel itself, not the iPad.

And the same would be true if you found a USB-C to RCA adapter. Except that one wouldn‚Äôt be made by Apple, so it wouldn‚Äôt be made with Apple‚Äôs attention to audio quality and it would likely sound worse than the situation you have now.

If you‚Äôre asking if the DAC in Apple‚Äôs dongle or the DAC in your Denon is superior‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure. But I seriously doubt the difference between them is going to be as significant as the difference of getting away from Bluetooth.

If you want a better experience here, I wouldn‚Äôt look at different wired options. I would instead look at getting an AirPlay2 receiver with digital output, and connecting that to a digital input on your Denon so you can do lossless wireless playback.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Can we prove God to exist by human reason alone, and without faith? Let's consider the following argument, stated first in a short form.  Then let‚Äôs explain it in detail and then cover two standard objections to it.  
   
1. Either the universe has always existed, or God has.   
2. But, as shown by the second law of thermodynamics, the universe hasn't always existed.   
3. Therefore, God exists.   
A. The point here is that something has always existed because self-creation is impossible. Something can never come from nothing. A vacuum can't spontaneously create matter by itself. Why? This is because the law of cause and effect is based on the fact that what a thing DOES is based on what it IS. Causation involves the expression over a period of time of the law of non-contradiction in entities. Hence, a basketball when dropped on the floor of necessity must act differently from a bowing ball dropped on the same floor, all other things being equal. Hence, if something doesn't exist (i.e., a vacuum exists), it can't do or be anything on its own, except remain empty because it has no identity or essence. This is why the ""steady state"" theory of the universe's origin devised by the astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle was absurd: It said hydrogen atoms were popping out of nothing! How can a nothing do anything?!  Since self-creation is impossible, then something had to always exist. So now--was it the material universe?  Or was it some other unseen, unsensed Entity outside the material world?  
   
B. The second law of thermodynamics maintains that-the total amount of useful energy in a closed system must always decline. ""Useful energy"" is energy that does work while flowing from a place of higher concentration to that of a lower concentration. ""A closed system' is a place where no new energy is flowing in or out of it.   
The universe, physically, is a closed system because no new matter or energy is being added to it. The first law of thermodynamics confirms this, since it says no matter or energy is being created or destroyed. Hence, eventually all the stars would have burned out if the universe had always existed. A state of ""heat death"" would have long ago existed, in which the levels of energy throughout each part of the universe would be uniform. A state of maximum entropy (i.e., useless, non-working energy) would have been reached. But since the stars have not burned out, the universe had a beginning.  
   
In this regard, the universe is like a car with a full tank of gas, but which has a stuck gas cap. If the car had always been constantly driven (i.e., had always existed), it would have long ago run out of fuel. But the fact it still has gas (i.e., useful energy) left in it proves the car hasn't been constantly driven from the infinite past. The stuck gas cap makes-the-car in this example a ""closed system"" because no more energy can be added to make the car move.  ""Heat-death' occurs when the car runs out of gas, as it inevitably must, since no more can-be added to-it.  Likewise, the universe then is like a wind-up toy or watch that has been slowly unwinding down:  At some point ‚Äúsomething‚Äù must have wound it up.  
   
OBJECTIONS:  1. ""Who created God then?"" The point of the first premise was to show something had to have always existed. At that point, we didn't know what it was‚Äîor who it was. But if the universe hasn't always existed, then something else--God--has.  
   
2. ""The second law of thermodynamics doesn't apply to every part of the universe (or to the whole universe), or else didn‚Äôt apply to it in the past and/or won't apply to it in the future."" This statement is pure materialistic prejudice, because there is no scientific evidence anywhere that the second law of thermodynamics doesn't apply. It‚Äôs circular reasoning by naturalists to assume, ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôre here, and there‚Äôs no God and miracles aren‚Äôt possible, so therefore the First and Second laws of thermodynamics didn‚Äôt apply in the beginning.‚Äù  This law won't change in the future because the fundamental essence (nature) of the things that make up the physical universe aren't changing, so nature's laws wouldn't change in the future.  That is, unless God intervenes through miracles (i.e., ‚Äúviolates‚Äù nature‚Äôs laws), it won‚Äôt happen and didn‚Äôt happen.  So a skeptic can‚Äôt turn around and say there are places (or times) in the universe where nature‚Äôs laws don‚Äôt apply which no human has ever investigates or been to.  Otherwise, that‚Äôs the naturalist‚Äôs version of a miracle:  Belief in a unverifiable, non-observed, unrepeatable event in distant past is arbitrarily labeled ‚Äúscience.‚Äù  And to know whether the second law of thermodynamics is inapplicable somewhere in the universe, the doubter ironically would have to be ‚ÄúGod,‚Äù i.e., know everything about everywhere else.  So to escape this argument for God‚Äôs existence, the skeptic then has to place his faith in an unknown, unseen, unsensed exception to the second law of thermodynamics.  It‚Äôs better then to place faith in the unseen Almighty God of the Bible instead!  Plainly, nature cannot always explain nature:  Something‚Äîor Someone--to which the second law of thermodynamics is inapplicable (i.e., in the spirit world) created the material universe.  
  
Let‚Äôs make another argument for God‚Äôs existence based on the argument from design using the impossibility of spontaneous generation.  Here I quote from the astronomers Sir Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe, ‚ÄúEvolution From Space,‚Äù p. 24.   
  In context here the authors here are describing the chances for certain parts of the first living cell to occur by random chance through a chemical accident.  ‚ÄúConsider now the chance that in a random ordering of the twenty different amino acids which make up the polypeptides it just happens that the different kinds fall into the order appropriate to a particular enzyme \[an organic catalyst--a chemical which speeds up chemical reactions--EVS\].  The chance of obtaining a suitable backbone \[substrate\] can hardly be greater than on part in 10\[raised by\]15, and the chance of obtaining the appropriate active site can hardly be greater than on part in 10 \[raised by\]5.  Because the fine details of the surface shape \[of the enzyme in a living cell--EVS\] can be varied we shall take the conservative line of not ‚Äúpiling on the agony‚Äù by including any further small probability for the rest of the enzyme.  The two small probabilities are enough.  They have to be multiplied, when they yield a chance of on part in 10\[raised by\]20 of obtaining the required in a functioning form \[when randomly created by chance out of an ocean of amino acids--EVS\].  By itself , this small probability could be faced, because one must contemplate not just a single shot at obtaining the enzyme, but a very large number of trials as are supposed to have occurred in an organize soup early in the history of the Earth.  The trouble is that there are about two thousand enzymes and the chance of obtaining them all in a random trial is only one part in (10 \[raised by\]20)2000 = 10 \[raised by\]40,000, an outrageously small probability that could not be faced even if the whole universe consisted of organic soup.  \[The number of electrons within the universe that can be observed by mankind‚Äôs largest earth-based telescopes is approximately 10\[raised by\]87, which gives you an idea of how large this number is.  This number would fill up about seven solid pages a standard magazine page to print this number--40,000 zeros following a one--EVS\].  If one is not prejudiced either by social beliefs or by a scientific training into the conviction that life originated on the Earth, this simple calculation wipes the idea entirely our of court.‚Äù For more on the impossibility of abiogenesis or spontaneous generation, click here:  http://lionofjudah1.org/Apologeticshtml/Spontaneous%20Generation%20Is%20Impossible.htm  
The theory of evolution has not refuted the argument from design.  It‚Äôs simply materialistic philosophy masquerading as science.  It simply assumes and extrapolates from agnostic premises into the unobserved past.  It reasons in a circle, and then proudly and loudly concludes there‚Äôs no need for God as a Creator after initially assuming there isn‚Äôt one in its interpretations of natural history.  For more on this issue about the flaws in the theory of evolution, click to read this essay here:  http://lionofjudah1.org/Apologeticshtml/Evolution%20Based%20on%20Philosophy%20not%20Science.htm  
Perhaps more generally it would be helpful as well to read books on Christian apologetics, such as those making the case for belief in the Bible and for faith in God's existence and goodness, including those by C.S. Lewis, Josh McDowell, Lee Strobel, Henry Morris, Duane Gish, J.P. Moreland, Francis Schaeffer, Phillip E. Johnson, R.C. Sproul, Norman Giesler, Gleason Archer, Stephen Meyer, etc.  Stephen Meyer‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Return of the God Hypothesis‚Äù would be particularly important for the college-educated skeptics to read with an open mind. There are great reasons for having faith in the bible, such as its historical accuracy, fulfilled prophecies, and archeological discoveries, as are explained here:

"INTP","t5_2qhvl","You're right, they do rely heavily on Twitter and the ""generally accepted"" morals of the Internet to formulate their own opinions. Nice observation!

&gt;(...) so people get the idea that maybe there is really a moral imperative which should be obeyed without question.

That's exactly what I think too. Many people think that because certain moral principles seem to be accepted by a majority on the internet, then that is probably the only acceptable way to look at things. Although this is often the case with certain subjects, it is very far from being a generality. And, without being condescending, I think it is frankly a bit sad to see all these people behaving like little soldiers, without making the effort to form their own opinion.

&gt;These days, it's generally better to just sit out on certain types of conversation.

This is also a conclusion I have made over the past few years. Unfortunately, sometimes, I am forced not to express my opinion even with my closest friends, because I know that it doesn't always coincide with the pseudo activism of Twitter (or other places), or because I know that it will be misinterpreted. Or that I will be judged for it, and told I am a bad human/citizen.

&gt;If you're stuck in a toxic culture, keep your mouth shut and your eyes open, and try to identify people who won't treat you as inferior just because you don't parrot virtuous language back at them.

This is good advice. Very well said!",1638316855

As soon as I went to college my bedroom went to my younger brother and no one asked me, it was up to the people actually living in the house and when my older brother left, I was moved into his room and my room became a shared family room.

"antidepressants","t5_2szuo","I was taking amitryptline for severe abdominal pain and nausea. It worked great for two months (and on and off for years). Then this November I got severe nausea that Zofran didn't help and amitryptline didn't help. So my doctor switched me to mirtazapine because it could help the nausea (which it did) and could help my appetite since I've had no appetite for months. I've basically had really severe gi issues since August and my gi doctors been throwing medicine at it to try and treat the symptoms. 

I have some anxiety but it's been a lot better since August funny enough - I was having panic attacks this whole past year that were an issue, but as my gi health went to hell my mental health got a lot less severe and the attacks stopped. I started neurofeedback in september for the panic attacks and anxiety and those issues dropped a lot (neurofeedback really helped a ton). So nearly all the reason I'm taking antidepressants right now is just for the way it affects my gi symptoms - they work good as pain meds for gi pain (especially amitryptline which took my 10/10 had to go to ER pain down to a 5/10 after a few days on it), and now currently the mirtazapine because it works on my recent worse nausea when the amitryptline and Zofran didn't. 

Mirtazapine would be okay if I wasn't so exhausted on it, I'm already extremely tired from gi issues so I'm barely functional lately. The amitryptline made me somewhat tired but it wore off fairly quick and it was working good for me until the nausea got worse. But I need the anti-nausea help otherwise I can't hold down food, and then my gi health would backslide again to how bad it was in september when I couldn't eat. 

Tldr I've got some anxiety but its gotten better and I'm doing neurofeedback for it, I'm on the meds for gi symptom relief, I couldn't stay on amitryptline because after a month it stopped working on the new nausea I was getting. And I need to be able to hold down food so they switched me to mirtazapine since it's stronger for anti-nausea and it is working for that it's just sedating me like a tranqillizer which isn't great on top of the fatigue my health issues were already causing. I've missed a lot of work lately just because first I got too much nausea/dizziness to do much early November then they put me on mirtazapine and now I'm barely able to wake and barely alert I really hope this wears off soon.",1638316857

Obviously he'll have made very little at 18 and a lot more by 40, but that's even worse because he likely didn't pay much during his late teens and early twenties and then made a lot more in order to pay that much more in taxes later. So he's got a high income and didn't invest in college funds and he chose to have 4 kids, which could be said to be financially irresponsible. 

He's also ignoring that he could send his kids to a community college for two years, then a state school for two more to save a lot of money and have them live at home so he's not paying for dorms. But I'm guessing he's the type to want to send his kids to ivy league schools where the reputation and networking tends to help job seeking alums a lot more. He's also ignoring that people far poorer than him also don't have the ability to send their kids to college and it's not because the poor pay too much in taxes. Their kids take out student loans, why can't his? College does cost too much, but he belongs to a political ideology that is...wait for it...anti-taxation when taxes could be used to decrease the cost of college tuition!",1638316857

 &gt;Operation Paperclip was a secret United States intelligence program in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians were taken from former Nazi Germany to the U.S. for government employment after the end of World War II in Europe, between 1945 and 1959. Conducted by the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA), it was largely carried out by special agents of the U.S. Army's Counterintelligence Corps (CIC). Many of these personnel were former members, and some were former leaders, of the Nazi Party. The primary purpose for Operation Paperclip was U.S. military advantage in the Soviet‚ÄìAmerican Cold War, and the Space Race.

To how he responds as each event takes place.  I think the last scenes we see him in are up for a lot of interpretation, but needless to say there‚Äôs a heck of lot that happens to him over 4 seasons.  He is constantly actively making decisions as events unfold that effect the outcome of everything else almost parallel to Elliot.  I think maybe the first time through I watched through the lens of Elliot, the 2nd time more Darlene, and this time it was easier to see it from all perspectives, and I gravitated to really seeing Tyrell as a someone who wasn‚Äôt meant to be a sociopath.  Like he‚Äôs not Bale in American Psycho. I mean his value system is a little off.  Some of his decisions could be considered crazy.  But he doesn‚Äôt see it that way.  So why?

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","&gt;How are you counting without first having numbers?

Oh good point. But I'm trying to figure out if the error was in my phrasing or my thinking. Let me put it this way: can there be numbers without first encountering things to count?

&gt;Even if you can explain the origin of numbers as resulting from non-numerically counting ducks on a pond, that explanation will likely not account for the concept of infinite ducks, or the square root of negative one ducks.

I don't know if I agree with this. The question of origin would probably differ from those of abstraction and imagination (maybe we produce conceptual mathematical models by deriving other relations from reality and applying them to abstract numbers).

&gt;The process you described would be difficult to apply to zero,

Not if zero is derived from some understanding of potentiality and the non-existent.

&gt;or ùúã, or ‚àû, or oodles of imaginary numbers. What particulars demonstrate the similarity from which we get ‚àû? If your story of the origin of numbers is correct, then what did we bump into that gave us infinity?

Again I think this has more to do with cognition, abstraction, and imagination, not the original points of reference from which a concept's constitutive data is received.

&gt;There probably is not just one answer to where numbers come from. The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero provides some helpful real world examples for all the different ways to explain where zero came from.

That does sound interesting, I'll have to add this book to my ever-expanding list. I'm not well studied on this question so I appreciate the recommendation!

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","This is a though one, because it has a lot to do with how your mentality. Not to say that it's something wrong with you or that it's uncommon. It's actually something EVERYONE and I don't say that lightly experience. Even the cool people you'd think never had suh a worry. I'll try to give some advice that made it easier for me overcome it. Bht as I said, it happenes to everyone and that includes me. So one thing that helps is realizing that, but that's easier said than done. You can see it in how when people like celebrities makes a mistake, they often double down on it. Usually this is due to the fact that you don't want to feel like you are feeling right now so they try to make it seem like they are in the right. It applies in many other ways than this, but I hope you get the point. I wanted to get a better example of someone doing something embarrassing, but I couldn't think of anything good, which kinda proves the fact that no one remebers stuff like that, other than their own mistakes. So that's advice one, only you (most of the time) think of stuff like that.  Other people might remeber it if you remind them, but usually people are way too busy being scared of embarrassing themselves. Second point, someone under mentioned jt I think, but do you think about all the embarrassing stuff other people do? And if you do, do you think of it as something that devalues them? If the answer is yes, you are probably an asshole, and so are other people who think that way, not worth your time. If you encounter such a person remeber that in your head, they are in the wrong, in a way that makes them worse than you. Which leads to my third advice. You hold the chains to control yourself. And it will stay that way unless you give it to them. Might be a bit too metaphorical, but idk. Advice four. Think of why you are you are finding it embarrassing. Did this thing hurt somebody else? Was it something that couldn't happen to everbody? Did this thing make you any less worth than anybody else? Making mistakes or having an accident in any form happens to again to everyone, but you probably hear that all the time, so it's up to you if you believe it or not. My last point for now is probably my favorite, owning up to embarrassing is hell of a fucking power move. People who aren't afraid of getting embarrassed or who won't let it affect them in a negative way, are hella fucking cool. And everbodys thinks that, trust me. In general there is no right way of exciting and what people perceive as such is just culture. And we all go along with it because we see everyone else do it too. But if you show that you don't see yourself to be in the wrong people will think they are in the wrong, and will be forced to change their view. As long as you belive that it's okay for anyone to be embarrassed and that other people are dicks for thinking otherwise, you'll be in power. Or in the worst case, you don't want their company anyways. I'll end my monolog here. I hope it can be of some help, if you have to patient to even read it at all, hahha. You can always send me a message in my dms if you need to talk with someone, or if you didn't understand anything of this ramble. No matter what happens you'll be fine, trust me.",1638316860

**AITA for telling my daughter there is no Santa**

Ok I am a 23 year old father and my wife is also 23. We grew up in the same youth group at church and now I am the youth pastor at that same church. We got married at 18 right out of high school and had our daughter about 12 months later. She‚Äôs 4 now, and Christmas is everything to her. 

Well, the other day, we were with my wife‚Äòs family for Thanksgiving. And my wife and her sister were talking about what they got the kids as their Santa gifts. Well my daughter overheard that part and so she came to talk to me. 

She asked me why Mommy was shopping for Santa instead of Santa buying her present hisself. Well, I wasn‚Äôt going to lie to her so I said, ‚ÄúAddilyn, Mommy and Daddy are Santa Claus.‚Äù And that‚Äôs when all hell broke loose. She started screaming and throwing a hissyfit and my wife came running in the room. 

My daughter told my wife that I told her about Santa and my wife was mad. So now she barely speaks to me because of something so stupid as Santa Claus. She says that I shouldn‚Äôt have said that and that I needed to talk to her first because that‚Äôs a decision we need to make together. Last I checked, I‚Äôm the man of the house and I really don‚Äôt need her permission on how to parent our kids.

&gt; A high-profile inquiry into sexual harassment and bullying in Australia&amp;#039;s parliament has found &amp;quot;Sexist culture&amp;quot; to be widespread. The government-backed report - released on Tuesday following a seven-month investigation - said one in three people currently working at the parliament &amp;quot;Have experienced some form of sexual harassment while working there&amp;quot;.

&gt; Green Party Senator Sarah Hanson-Young described the report as a &amp;quot;Damning expose of the sexist culture and harassment in politics&amp;quot;.

"nursing","t5_2ra72","Oooh I get to give you knowledge that I‚Äôll pretend is helping me study. There are two types of discrimination at play: one is religious discrimination, one is disability discrimination. 

Religious discrimination requires that a person have a sincerely held religious belief (doesn‚Äôt have to be a mainstream religion, can‚Äôt be political or economic in nature) and remand that the work place has to accommodate unless it places an undue burden. In this instance, undue burden has been interpreted to mean like anything pretty much, they call it ‚Äúde minimus‚Äù. It‚Äôs a super low bar. Hospitals can just say ‚Äúthis places too much stress on our scheduling system to ensure vulnerable patients aren‚Äôt exposed‚Äù and they‚Äôve met the bar to deny a religious accommodation.

Disability accommodation, you have to show an impairment that impacts major life activities. Major life activities are ones we do every day or at least often. Eating, breathing, standing, walking, sleeping, fucking. If you have that kind of impairment, you need a reasonable accommodation that does place an undue burden, but undue burden in disability law is much higher than in religious discrimination law. There‚Äôs more pressure to accommodate. HOWEVER there is an exception to accommodating disabilities, the harm and safety exception, so if the employer can show giving a reasonable accommodation would put either the employee, employer, customer, or coworkers in potential harm they can deny the accommodation. 

Also, employees can‚Äôt choose a reasonable accommodation, and if they refuse what they‚Äôre offered they lose. So if an anti vaxxer wants to be able to come into work normally but the hospital says ‚Äúyour accommodation is staying in this office and doing paperwork‚Äù the anti vaxxer can‚Äôt say they want a different accommodation that still puts them bedside or something. 

Long explanation, but essentially all the cases on this point suggest these people will lose so",1638316861

Otherwise we use whoever's credit card is handy at the time on food purchases, groceries, regular expenses etc.  I'm notoriously bad at leaving my wallet at home so my partners credit card see's the most use.

FWIW we used Ally for our accounts because the savings buckets feature, but now that we are using YNAB that's not really any help as my buckets are now tracked within the YNAB software.

This is just common fucking sense.

The only exception is if they treated you well and I've left personal development tools for those kinds of companies, and even this should be carefully thought about.

Companies are not your friends, they arent family, most will drop you if they have to. I'm fortunate enough to have found an employer than dont treat employees like cogs in a wheel but even they still have their days. Its straight up politics and you better play the game or make your own damn business which is *not* easy even if you had all the funds. Hell, the game is played just as easily with a shit employee just getting a ride while they look for their next opportunity. Alls fair in love and war.

You put in the time, you presented them with tools that advance the company and they passed up on you. Good riddance, now you can take that awesome shit elsewhere. Leave with a fake ass smile (or dont) and dominate in your next job.",1638316862

**To participants in the comments:**

***---&gt; ALWAYS cite sources when you debate anything in this sub &lt;---***. ""Cuz I sed"" is NOT a sufficient basis.

**Good** - Discussion is rooted in science, provides links to peer reviewed science, and it focuses on the food taking into consideration any of poster's stated goals. Recipe improvements are encouraged. EDUCATING your POV without BERATING others for theirs.

**Bad** (may be removal or ban territory) - Generalizations and assumptions about ingredients, portions, the poster or their diet (ask instead) and the sub. Non-constructive criticisms.  Claiming something is ""unhealthy"" without linking to peer reviewed sources. Infotainment or social media sources. Gatekeeping. Expectations that pictured foods should be perfectly ""healthy"".

**Not Allowed** - (IS removal or ban territory) attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, vote complaining, trolling, crusading, activism and agitation trolling, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy. Medical condition and general diet help or analysis requests, especially in cases of minors

Lucretia +30 &gt; Ainz +30 is debatable. The gap between Lucretia +20 and +30 is bigger than the gap between Ainz +20 and +30.

Skriath +30 &gt; Izold +30 is also debatable. It depends on your hero pool. Skriath +30 is highly recommended if you have Queen.

Khazard +30 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mehira +30, Mehira should be on the same tier as Merlin imo. Khazard should be above Oden. Oden can work at +20, Khazard is useless at +20.

Kren, Antandra and Granit are very underrated, especially Granit. I'd put Kren and Antandra on the same tier as Grezhul (I personally invested on their +30 before Grezhul. No regrets). And I'd put Granit on the same tier as Silas, it is a very strong investment if you have Lucretia.

Tidus, Ferael, Skreg and Pippa do not need +30, they're fine at +20. Ferael +30 is understandable, but is just for the stats because he is a super useful hero, the +30 effect is mediocre.

I'd put Leonardo and Zolrath +30 on the same tier as Desira.

 You are not being removed for political orientation.  If we were, why the fuck would we tell you your comment was being removed instead of just shadow removing it?  We never have, and never will, remove things down politicial or ideological lines. Unless your ideology is nihilism, then fuck you. 
 
 Let me be clear: The reason that this rule exists is to avoid unscrupulous internet denizens from trying to sell dong pills to our users.  /r/PoliticalHumor mods reserve the RIGHT to hoard all of the dong pills to ourselves, and we refuse to share them with the community.  If you want Serbo-Slokovian dong pills mailed directly to your door, become a moderator. If we shared the dong pills with the greater community, everyone would have massive dongs, and like Syndrome warned us about decades ago: ""if everyone has massive dongs, nobody does.""""
 
 If you wish to rectify your low karma issue, go and make things up in /r/AskReddit like everyone else does. 

 Thanks for understanding! Have a nice day and be well. &lt;3

Second, because I work in enterprise development where we exchange data with outside companies through ERP systems. Companies don't always have standardized ways of talking. Some share CSV, XML, Restful/SOAP APIs, or some other way to communicate. And internally most systems in even top companies are running on old, outdated systems, and plagued with tech debt which could lead to this exact type of error. Or they still have very human and manual processes.

Promise you, these types of mistakes happen all the time. As recently today I converted a system with 21,000 users, and some 500 users didn't belong to any company. They had been active in our system, but their parent companies had either been disabled or never activated.

Scholarship

Pro Potential: We may not send as many names as the Ohio States and the Notre Dames, but we have had a history of being able to send players to the NZFL and we hoped to continue to do that with you. I believe you have the talent to become a star in college and one in the NZFL. I want to put you in a place where you can succeed and become one of the best to ever be seen. 

Winning: It may not be happening now, but Boise State was once a team that would be able to win and take down most opponents on any given Saturday. Times have changed though, and now you can join us to headline a new change and bring Boise State back into the limelight. I promise that with you joining this next recruiting class we can get 5 wins next year and that we will increase our total every year after that.

Location: I know moving away from home is hard and it's a challenge for any young college student, but staying in state and being able to play in front of your family will be a good way to avoid many of those challenges. You will be easily able to go home for holiday and not have to worry about travel.",1638316864

It was called Andover Children‚Äôs Home and was associated with the Swedish Lutheran Church. His name was Harry Alanson Maxfield (b. 1879/80/81 in Rock Island Co, IL) and supposedly Alanson was his original last name (pre-adoption). Given the 'son' suffix and the fact that the orphanage location + fire 'fits' makes me wonder if he might have been Swedish. But...the records are gone!

You can use the hotkey it comes with or edit it in the drop-down menu of the banter trigger.

BTW OP: The way you speak about parents who need babysitters is just down right disgusting. There‚Äôs parents who need babysitters because they both work.

"Art","t5_2qh7a","I would think an art piece based on a Reddit trend is just as derivative as one based on a trend from Tik Tok.

Not entirely sure what you mean by hyperrealism - is that the pencil drawings that look like photographs? If so, no I don't particularly dislike that. I can understand why there's a vocal group of art purists who say that style leaves little room for someone's personal interpretation or experience. I don't think OPs post is comparable to that at all.

Hyperrealism obviously take years of practice, and demonstrates incredible skill depending on the subject matter.

Dipping your ass in paint and then sitting on a canvas because you saw someone on social media do the same doesn't mean you're being creative.

Imagine I wrote a song using only four notes/tones arranged in a basic musical structure. Just the bare minimum required to call it a song or jingle.

Now imagine you heard that song and then decided to remake it yourself. Maybe you change the pitch a little, or add some reverb - but it's the same four notes. Is this really being creative when you're just replicating what was already a min-effort creative output?",1638316867

Mediaeval Baebes - Mistletoe and Wine (2003). Pretty covers of ancient carols, some in Latin and French.  


Anuna - Celtic/world music/new ageish - all of their holiday albums feature covers, but are quite nice - and most of it has a dark, cozy, cold outside-warm indoors feel to it.  


Loreena McKennitt: To Drive the Cold Winter Away (1987) and A Winter Garden (1995). Classic carols with a new agey feel.

&gt; Emma Coronel Aispuro, the wife of the imprisoned drug kingpin Joaqu&amp;iacute;n &amp;quot;El Chapo&amp;quot; Guzm&amp;aacute;n has been sentenced to three years in a US prison, after she pleaded guilty to helping the Sinaloa drug cartel.

&gt; Coronel pleaded guilty in June to three counts of conspiring to distribute illegal drugs, conspiring to launder money and of engaging in financial dealings with the Sinaloa drug cartel.

&gt; &amp;quot;She met Joaqu&amp;iacute;n Guzm&amp;aacute;n when she was a minor. She was 17 years old, and she married him on her 18th birthday,&amp;quot; said Jeffrey Lichtman, a defense attorney who also represented Guzm&amp;aacute;n in his US trial three years ago.

I understand some requirements may be silly or outdated, but I knew my son could be failed for driving a car with automated features, so I did my best to avoid undesirable outcome.

As far as overall length, both the factory stock and the backpacker stock are shorter than the barrel assembly, so length is a non-issue.

Plus the chamber end of the barrel is protected, and there's storage in the stock for mags so it's much more self-contained and grab &amp; go ready.

Also while I'm sure it's heavier when fully loaded up with 4 mags, I don't think it's actually heavier apples to apples. Information I can find says they're both \~18oz for the furniture alone.

My brother has this tendency to voluntarily pay for things‚Äîinitially appearing as a kind gesture‚Äîand then request reimbursement a few days later. These Venmo requests are almost like afterthoughts. Almost like he was reflecting on the weekend and then realized he could squeeze a couple bucks out of me. 

For example, this weekend he bought me a bagel with cream cheese. I wasn't even awake while he ordered this breakfast. I didn't even consent to the purchase at all. I get out of bed and he informs me that he ordered me a bagel. Great. I then continue to accept the gesture as a brother buying me a bagel. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Fast forward to one week later\*.

&amp;#x200B;

I receive a $30 Venmo request for miscellaneous purchases from the weekend. He generalizes the request under a few things; from a train ticket (bought without my knowledge) to a sushi dinner (which he said don't worry about while I pulled out my credit card offering to pay), the request really pissed me off.

There were several things I did for him this weekend, yet I expected no reimbursement. Why? Because we are families and reciprocity is a thing. Apparently not according to my brother. 

It's almost like exploitation. Like he initially appears to be willing to pay for shit (i.e. saying ""don't worry about it"" or ""its on me"") and then demands payment later down the line. Its an uncomfortable position for me yet I always pay him when he asks for it. I sent the $30 after I informed him about my beliefs of money circulating in a family and how I didn't ask for payment with my gestures. It was a heated text message string in which I used strong language and expressed the position he puts me in. I asked that he never pay for things for me again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know if I'm the asshole.

My (16M) mom got this idea from a tv show a couple of years ago that, to reduce water waste, that the family gets three songs to choose from while we take showers and as soon as the last song ends, we have to get out, whether we are finished or not. 

We got to choose the songs so I chose two relatively short songs 1:44 and 1:32 minutes, respectively and one very long song - 9:30.) My mother is now pissed off at me for choosing such a long song but I need time and I use cold water anyways...plus I do other things to cut down on water consumption. But she made the rule specifically so we could help out the world and I kinda undermined her.

&gt;  
&gt;How anyone can look at all his actions and hours upon hours of conferences talking very seriously about it and being transparent on his thinking and action reasoning, and walk away thinking ""Wow, he's not taking this seriously"" ... is beyond me. It honestly seems like such a person is mentally challenged.

Because he's literally on record of saying ‚ÄúI wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don‚Äôt want to create a panic""?

He falsely compared it to the flu. 

He then said he wouldn't be wearing a mask...at a press conference held to encourage Americans to wear masks more often. 

At a campaign rally, he said: ‚ÄúWhen you do testing to that extent, you‚Äôre going to find more people...you‚Äôre going to find more cases. So I said to my people, ‚ÄòSlow the testing down, please.‚Äô‚Äù

When asked if he was jesting, he told reporters: '‚ÄúI don‚Äôt kid. Let me just tell you. Let me make it clear.""

He held three large indoor rallies over the summer months last year. 

And after he himself contracted Covid-19 and needed urgent medical help at a world-leading hospital and received cutting-edge medical treatment, he tweeted: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be afraid of Covid..Don‚Äôt let it dominate your life.‚Äù I mean, easy for him to say, right?

And it happened again with my girlfriend for the ""preparation"" for marriage, in which the old couple who was supposed to instruct us about Catholic marriage gave us a 4-hour long lecture about *all seven* sacraments at an elementary school level.

As someone who had a similar experience, consider the possibility that your medication isn't helping a whole lot. You may have developed maladaptive mechanisms to hide that too. People on the right medication will be able to focus almost immediately.

"meirl","t5_2s5ti","&gt;Just because we aren't smart enough...

You are missing my point completely. It doesn't matter how intelligent we are because human capacity for both thought and perception are limited. Anything constructed by the human mind is imprisoned by it. Our metrics are sentimental and born of cultural constructs. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And it's not the invention, art, etc. itself that makes the person intelligent, it's what is require to able to achieve those things in the first place

This shows a fundamental lack of understanding of human capabilities. This idea is challenged daily when someone who is considered to lack some capacity creates a piece of work thought to beyond their abilities; a constraint put in place by our cultural ideas of what intelligence presents as. 

The piece of work itself demonstrates cultural worth to the human mind as well as intellectual capacity. Can you really call someone who scores poorly on an IQ test but can create great pieces of work ""stupid""? This works with the backwards logic that intelligence can be presumed before being displayed. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Are you saying you don't think things like critical thinking, obtaining knowledge, applying it to practical situations, creativity and innovation are key asepcts of intelligence?

Honestly at this point with the level of tiring rhetoric you are making read through I think you deserve a little bit of sass. I think reading comprehension is a key aspect of intelligence.

But more seriously what I consider an aspect of intelligence doesn't really matter because I'm a human. We as a species do not know the bounds of intelligence and consciousness and what seperates us and trying to delineate any further is just a pointless excercise of the ego. ""I'm smarter than you because X"". We're all just dumb monkeys. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We don't have to have a perfect idea of it to (somewhat crudely) measure or indentify it

I may have been exposed to too many over the top conspiracy theorists on social media. 

I do think some things are too hard to explain to the average person and at some point we do have to extend trust to the doctor or institution that there are things they know that I do not know.

"AustralianPolitics","t5_2snwr","Someone slings a name or swears in the emotional heat of the moment: what a surprise!

Get a grip, people, this is what humans do: words are used to communicate and primitive emotions generate suitably communicative words. The words don't actually do anything, Mr. Albanese doesn't have the power of the word of god for his voice to turn Mr. Dutton to stone or even jelly. If you are offended by the words used, that's you subjectively manufacturing that response in your own brain by interpreting the input signals in a subjective way, Mr. Albanese isn't making you feel anything, you do that yourself, so your response is your responsibility not his.

If Mr. Albanese crossed the floor and physically assaulted Mr. Dutton, that would be something quite different, but words have no agency to harm: that is why we have the notion of free speech because the only harm that can be done is by a recipient responding to them.

I guess we should now expect Mr. Dutton to raise a defamation case against Mr. Albanese.

In the past this would get you a nagware/trial version of Windows 10.  I don't know if you absolutely have to have a license/serial key to make this installer work.  The safe way is to buy a legit license key.  

After you make the bootable USB installer, plug it into the new PC, in a USB 2.0 or 3.x port, and turn on the PC.  Make sure the monitor is connected to the correct port on the PC.  If you're using HDMI, make sure the monitor is switched to the HDMI input and not display port or other input.  Ultimately you need to get the monitoring displaying some kind of output from the PC.  

Once the monitor and PC show signs of life, you need to get the computer to boot to the USB drive with the Windows 10  installer.  That may take some config in the PC's BIOS, or it might just work automatically.  Can provide help if/when needed.  

Once you get past all that, the Windows 10 installer should run and you should be prompted to install Windows.",1638316875

I hope you report yourself to the police the next time you deal with a vermin infestation problem.

If some creators of the game say so, then their words apply to their work only not to all other authors who have previously written for or will write for that setting in the future. An author can put as much racism in their work as they wish, it doesn't mean all other authors do the same. If you've heard all of these arguments before then I'm wasting my time having this conversation with you. I've heard all your arguments before as well, and they are likewise from the same delusional tree being plucked from the lowest branches.

Julietta is meh, I'd recommend replacing her with Amane, unless survivability becomes an issue for you after that. Between Vixel, H.Laxi and her you should be good on dispel, so swap Luca for his gala version and slap a MUB chronos nyx on him for dragon form, that should carry you through her shadow phase pretty fine. Your water team is alright, but try swapping Aeleen for Sandalphon as she gives overdamage, which frees up a shared skill slot. Other people are saying swap mascula for tiki, I don't have her so I can't vouch, but yeah, they're probably right. Other than that, it terms of adventurers you should be set. As for dragons, that's where you're lacking the most. If you haven't done MG lv.64 yet, then that's easy sunlight stones if you just copy someone else's teams. MUB your chronos nyx and GR Poseidon, throw GnC on Sandy and GR Poseidon on tiki, S!Marishiten on Ieyasu to dragon form for amp, and either Mercury, Poseidon, or your other GnC on Gelly. For light, put Chronos Nyx on Luca, Jeanne and Cupid on Laxi and Amane, doesn't really matter who gets which, and throw Tie Shan Gongzhu on Vixel. Your weapons should ideally all be agito, at least 4UB and refined once, with all three wyrmprint slots unlocked. Onto wyrmprints, for Vixel, what I do is throw a 5* recovery potency, a 5* skill haste (preferably jewels of the sun since it has bow's boon) Free-Spirited Opera (-10% str but 10% chance to lower enemy strength by 10% with standard attacks) a 4* recovery potency, a 4* light skill haste, staff boon Impregnable Fortress, and Bow's Psalm. The light skill haste allows for skill haste to cap out, and a MUB Bow's Psalm still gives a full Bow's Boon bonus. Do the same thing with Sandy, just swap light skill haste for water skill haste, and don't worry about skill prep cause she has plenty of healing uptime. All your DPS should have double skill damage sindom prints, although this will require a veritable amount of grinding to be done to get enough copies of everything needed. Give Ieyasu sword crit rate, some sort of strength print, bleeding punisher, frostbite punisher, and crit damage. Avoid burn res, as Sandy gives a 30% hp buff when she clears afflictions. Tiki should have a strength print, water flurry devastation, maybe bleeding punisher, or else whatever you think fits, frostbite punisher, and dagger crit damage. I'm not too sure about Gelly, but try to throw buff time and skill haste on her as well as Impregnable Fortress and Bow's Psalm.  For light, Laxi should have FS damage, double punishers, and both 4* manacasters prints. Amane should have wand crit rate, double punishers, crit damage, and a strength conditional. Finally, Gluca should have enhanced shapeshifting (he's your chronos nyx monkey) double punishers, blade crit rate, and crit damage. For shared skills, put your healers in the first slot so they get them; Vixel should get overdamage (preferable S!Verica if you have her at 67 MC or higher) and something else, not many good options are left with 4 skill points. Sandy has overdamage in her kit already, so I use both Lowen shared skills, but you could use Sha Wujing's SS instead. Finally, I'm assuming you're aware of all Lilith's mechanics, but if you aren't, there are probably YouTube videos out there that can assist you with that. Hope this helps, and reply if you need anything else!",1638316876

They have no issues with racism, anti-democratic behaviour, inequalities, union-busting, deregulation or outsourcing, as witnessed by that support.

These people aren‚Äôt interested in anything but preserving their position in society at all cost.

Are they bad people? Many are, and many are not, but policing in the U.S. has deep and systemic issues, ranging from the absolutely underwhelming amount of training and education, lack of community policing and cooperation with other authorities in a wider crime prevention strategy to militarized outfits (thanks in large part to War on Terror-era surpluses), lack of civilian oversight and judicial discrimination in favour of police leading to no consequences for their actions.

It is a systemic issue, it requires strong individuals to be able to withstand the cognitive dissonance of staying true to the ideals and inclined towards reforms of the above issues while at the same time being surrounded by an environment interested in preserving the status quo.

LASD has at least [18 police gangs](https://knock-la.com/lasd-gangs-little-devils-wayside-whities-cavemen-vikings/), for example.

No other developed countries have the policing issues we have, and the needed reforms are obvious, but it requires time, consistency and organized pressure as voting blocs to ensure progress can be made. Case in point is Newark, where police reforms yielded results after being implemented by consent decrees, and even the police chief admitted that he was in favour of them in hindsight despite initial opposition to any changes.",1638316877

If the credit card pad requires a signature (or the place still has paper CC signature paper, like at a restaurant), it's also a class 4 felony: ""Obtaining money or signature, etc., by false pretense.* There are also possible identity theft charges, depending on how and where the card is used.

From everything I‚Äôve researched, low-carb/keto is absolutely the way to go for anybody with PCOS. 

I strongly suggest loosely counting your macros unless you‚Äôre susceptible to developing an ED. 
Try your best to limit carbs as much as possible and make sure most of what you‚Äôre consuming is protein, healthy fats and legumes. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing and it‚Äôs been a relatively smooth transition for me from a regular diet to a low carb diet.

And it can be something as petty as tires. Dental issues. Any medical emergency.

"prochoice","t5_2rg0n","What the other commenter said, but I‚Äôd also like to add my own two cents.

Using the term ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù would imply that abortions happen because that we believe that the unborn deserve to die due to some crime they‚Äôve committed. Which is not true, a fetus is not innocent nor guilty. Pregnant people get abortions because they no longer want to be pregnant, and it should be their right to decide who they allow in their body, not because the fetus is at fault.

You can‚Äôt be innocent or guilty if no one is accusing you of anything. I could argue that pregnant people are innocent too and that they shouldn‚Äôt be forced to sacrifice their mental and physical health in order to carry a pregnancy to term.

But it‚Äôs up to you to form your own opinion on it",1638316878

"toronto","t5_2qi63","I looked at the weekly change in the 7-day average in the past 20 days to have a more comprehensive look at growth rate trends. I chose a 20 day sample size because the 7-day average on November 11th was when growth for this current wave peaked. The 7-day average for Nov 11th was *+38.75% higher* than Nov 4th.

[https://i.imgur.com/X4hwt65.png](https://i.imgur.com/X4hwt65.png)

From Nov 11 to Nov 30 we saw a 49.27% increase over 19 days in the 7-day average. That's a daily (compounding) growth rate of +2.13%.

From Nov 23 to 30 we saw a 17.65% weekly increase, which gives us a daily (compounding) growth rate of +2.35%.

So the weekly growth rate right now is above-average for the past 19 days. But not in the danger zone. Hence why I've coded today in orange and not red.

We're not seeing +38.75% weekly growth anymore. But we are up from the +12.27% weekly growth we saw on November 18th.

Might be a worthwhile for the government to consider requiring the enhanced vaccine certificate and QR code scan to try to slow the growth back down. And introducing more vaccine mandates in the public sector. Encouraging vaccine mandates in the private sector. I'm opposed to placing more restrictions on the vaccinated. Considering that we averaged 1,462.88 cases/day over the course of Sept 21 2020-Sept 20 2021 (by the more accurate episode date) back in the days where we largely didn't have the vaccine, we sure are making a mountain out of a mole hill out of 794.14 cases/day (by report date since episode date lags for recent cases). We're nowhere close to being in danger of a lock down. We had 4,716 cases on April 7th 2021 (episode date). We had 900 in the ICU May 1st 2021. Tightening vaccine certificate enforcement and vaccine mandates would be the most common sense painless way to slow case growth right now without giving an F U to the people who got vaccinated.",1638316879
"Design","t5_2qh78","Designer isn't typicaly a ""job"" .  It's a skill. Meaning you get ""contracts"" for ""specific jobs"". In other words you are a self employed gig worker. 

Think about it  how many companies have the output necessary to require an in house graphics designer ? 

They have punctual, seasonal, occasional need.


So ... ( pay attention this is the important bit )


Stop looking for ""work"" and start looking for ""jobs"", perpetually.

You're like those double glazing people, or roofers or ... pick a job.

Your skill is required for punctual intervention. Yes there is a possibility that you may be asked for regular work but this is like my budy who puts down turf in new development. He's only asked when  the new owner takes the developer's recommendation. 

The whole point of this rant is this. WHAT EVER THE FIELD designing is a ""per project"" affair .  So either, expect to be on staff redoing work on the whims of every boss/salesman/client/tom-dick-harry-that suggest as they pass( I was up to 14 version of the same step ladder because everybody but me knew what was needed, and yet none of them bought any ...  ... learning curves can be arch.)


My advise : spread yourself around and be ready to ditch everyone (not anyone, everyone) who starts demanding spurious work. If you want to be respected, and you need to, you have too look these people in the eye and demand if they highered you for your expertise or because they can't be bothered.

Of course this is  all assuming you are competent and can do the job.",1638316879

&gt; Over the weekend, Japan tightened entry restrictions for people arriving from South Africa and eight other countries in the region, requiring them to undergo a 10-day quarantine at government-designated facilities.

&gt; Many other countries have moved to tighten their borders after the discovery of the new omicron variant, which was identified last week by researchers in South Africa.

&gt; South Africa&amp;#039;s government has responded angrily to the travel bans, which it said were &amp;quot;Akin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker.""

"CanadianForces","t5_2skgl","You know, the communicating thing is tricky. Be sure to talk to whoever you have back home BEFORE you leave. I've deployed with and without frequent communication, and honestly, I'd say it's harder if you talk everyday. When you are thousands of miles from home, you, well, aren't home. It's not reasonable to expect that you'll always have the opportunity to talk with your spouse, kids, friends etc, especially when you factor in time zone differences or shift rotations. Also you don't want to miss your regular bedtime call and have the person at home spooling up about an imagined disaster, even though it's really just that you were the last to hit the chow line. It's also really easy to get caught wishing you can help Tommy get to hockey, or yell at the neighbour for being a douche to your spouse. But you can't. You aren't home, so you can't help with home stuff. Frequency of communication is absolutely not a one-size-fits-all thing, so be sure to talk about it before you leave. In my family, I do a lot around the house, and if I slack off my wife really feels the increased burden. But when I'm just not here at all it's actually easier for her because she just **has** to be the one to do it all. Allowing that distance to be represented by not in constant comms might actually help make the time go by more easily. I hope this made some sense.",1638316879

"declutter","t5_2ustf","There are a couple of ways you could approach this. First, a big blitz where you come and stay for a week or two and really power along, acting as the motivator and helping your mother push through her roadblocks. This is effective in the short term, but may not address hoarding habits. It‚Äôs also a real energy drain and it sounds like your mother is already feeling a bit overwhelmed. I did this when clearing out my parents‚Äô place and it was hard work.

The second approach is a little at a time. The clutter did not appear in its entirety overnight, so there‚Äôs no reason that decluttering can‚Äôt also happen on a bit by bit basis. Choose one thing to tackle and a timeline to do it in. For example, your mother doesn‚Äôt want to get rid of the VHS player because of family videos. Ask her to collect all the family videos by X date and you will take them to a service that will digitise the videos. Pick a specific item of furniture and agree to put it on the curb with a ‚Äúfree‚Äù sign that weekend. Get your siblings involved: ‚Äúhey Sarah, I‚Äôm coming for a visit on the 15th December and I‚Äôm going to help Mom clear out your old stuff. You obviously don‚Äôt need it any more if you haven‚Äôt missed it in all this time. You have until the 15th to collect anything you want to keep, and the rest will be disposed of.‚Äù",1638316879

"anime","t5_2qh22","&gt; So the dedication to do something and the motive of that dedication are actually 2 totally separate things. 

I completely disagree, no one's going to risk their life over something they aren't intensely motivated to do. 

if his brother was threatening to kill him if he didn't give him a second helping of dessert there would've been no resistance because he doesn't care about that at all so there's no reason to be dedicated to it. 


&gt;As an aside do you find it difficult or pointless to discuss hypotheticals when none of them have a chance at becoming reality?

no? that's literally what philosophy and morality are, and what makes us human- the ability to think of the future and possibilities in the future and think about how we would act in them and why, and whether or not that is right or wrong. 

it's also what's interesting about fictional stories, you can think about situations that we don't deal with in everyday life but are still very real. child sex slaves are unfortunately a grim reality of the world, and it's really weird that people seem to be cheering for this guy's dedication when the thought of praising the real world version of him is beyond horrific. like do people who want child sex slaves really need our ""charitability""?",1638316882

If you go in every day you‚Äôre probably looking at around $300/mo for go + ttc. During the week trains are usually ever 15 minutes (not this week), and to Clarkson there is an express option at rush hour. Weekends are still trains every 30 minutes. There have been sporadic weekend service disruptions for construction but it‚Äôs not every weekend and I think from clarkson there were options. 

Driving to islington and ttc will be total hell. 

For myself I prefer the train on balance. I deal with fewer assholes on the road, have far lower risk of having an accident and in general have a much more relaxing commute. Trains are not busy right now so it gets a little less comfortable when more ppl are travelling outside of pandemic but it will take awhile for that to recover. 

The main downfall to transit is that you lose flexibility in when you can leave. You often lose 15 minutes here or there trying to catch the right train. At the end of the day I find it‚Äôs worth it to sit and let someone else drive. The time actually from A to B pretty much comes out as a wash. (And it‚Äôs better overall for the environment. If you care about such things)",1638316882
"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","No. It can be indefinitely renewed these days. The argument is applicable. Because money has made it so.  


Perhaps the correct way to address NDAs and IPs is... to remove the incentive for sharing secrets.... or having them to begin with? Research should and could (and already is) be publicly funded, leaving the benefits of said research to come back to the public that funded it, instead of into the pockets of the people who put their names on a building.  


Honestly, I'm thinking this post was a mistake. Most arguments have never even considered the multitude of issues, and focus on one single path; which is irrelevant. I'm not making an argument in favor of how to make some asshole a few more millions. I'm arguing about making life better for everyone; forever. Fuck your NDA.",1638316882

Want to acknowledge your bravery to try to get sober; not easy but can be done &amp; benefits are big. 

You mention health; keep dinking and it can only get worse. Never heard of someone saying their drinking cured whatever. My heart was damaged. 

I can only guess how many calories are in 2 bottles of wine, but as someone who drank 2000 calories a day and became very obese, it can't be good. Sobriety led to diet which led to major weight loss.

12/1/21 is a palindrome day--same forward &amp; backward, so in my mind this is a great day to start. 12/1/21 will only come around 1x tomorrow.

My much much larger gripe is with how wrong your assessment of the end of the civil war and reconstruction was. Theres a lot to unpack in your paragraph that would take a lot more to explain, and it is so much more complicated than you made it out to be. for starters the noble South and anything in the 20th century is already so far past where reconstruction failed its confusing to even bring it up in this context.

However, our new birth unto salvation and sanctification are something that is *done to* us by God. To say we can lose our salvation is to say we have dominion over God's election.

"PoliticalCompassMemes","t5_3ipa1","&gt;so i am waiting for you to answer how do you scale tax evasion so it turns into genocide.

That's not relevant, as those are obviously a difference in kind. I'm not saying the ONLY difference in kind is a difference in scale, but that a difference in scale is a difference in kind. Of course tax evasion isn't genocide, but I never said anything that would imply it was.

&gt;And if it is? They don't have the choices? they don't have ""a multitude of life style choices that efficiently and effectively cure it""? Because there are, clinical depression is curable, and depressed people have access to them.

With medication, but you don't have lifestyle choices to solve it. I hope you would agree their is a substantive difference between liposuction and diet and exercise along with a substantive difference between people who can't tell they are full and people who just don't have enough will to not be fat (like me).

My point was that non clinical depression is something that, for most people, is caused by their choices and failure to do the things that prevent and cure it, rather than something endemic to their biological condition in the way clinical depression is, that's literally why we classify them as different illnesses.

&gt;""Affect"" is a key word. You are not talking about controlling own emotions. You are talking about rational and healthy life choices. And this is not the question. Clinically depressed by those words also """"""""""can"""""""""" make rational and healthy life choices that will make them happy.

I obviously don't think all emotions are all 100% controllable, but that doesn't mean that we have no control over are worldview. The fact that you admit we can effect our emotions means that something far more complex, such as a worldview, is going to change more with how WE choose to interact with it. I do think we have an incredible amount of control over how we do react to thinks beyond the absolute immediate emotional effects.

&gt;Or you had, but you ""ignored tells that said you shouldn't have trusted them"".

I literally addressed this. If their were tells you were capable fo understanding but failed to, then yes, it IS your fault. This line of argument is just agreeing with my original statement, which is that people need to make judgments on the information available to them. Blind people can't see the color red, this does not make them irrational if they can't tell the difference between the colors of truck via feel.

&gt;I compare subtype with a type - emotional trauma with natural human change, not a subtype with subtype.

The thing we are comparing is the evolution of worldviews, which by in large is far more rationally originated than trauma originated for most people. Of course trauma changes people, I've never argued it didn't, I've argued that for most people their worldviews are far more rationally originated than that. You are proposing an absurd strawman.

The types being insinuated as being the same is the method we gain emotional trauma and the methods we d3eveloipes are moral and political worldviews, and while there IS some limited overlap, they are not the same circle.",1638316883

"weddingplanning","t5_2rv3t","It's hard because there really aren't consistent standards, so like what one person calls ""photojournalism"" is what someone else would call ""editorial."" And very often people will ride the line between one approach and another (like there are very few people that will take a purely candid approach). But there are some useful broad strokes...

**TECHNICAL APPROACHES**

Traditional Wedding Photography: Focuses primarily on staging and posing. This might also reflect on the sales model.

Photojournalism/Editorial/Lifestyle/Documentary: Focusing more on moment-to-moment capture and candids.

Fine Art: Also a bit nebulous, I've seen some that just have a ""photojournalistic"" approach and others that do really painstaking work to stage and create images (and even have like, a lighting team). Basically if editorial went to a fancy college.

Natural Light Photography: Prefers to avoid artificial lights in their work as much as possible. Do double check that they can use artificial light or how they approach unusual or dark lighting situations.

Shoot and Burn: More of a sales model, not as popular as it was 10 years ago. They'll shoot the wedding as per one of the above approaches, dump everything onto a disk or drive, and then hand it over with out editing (or minimal editing).

**AESTHETIC APPROACHES/EDITING STYLE:**

Dark and Moody: Tends to have subdued colors and tones. This moodiness often carries over into posing and the overall approach to photography.

Light and Airy: The upbeat counterpart of dark and moody, you want to get things generally clean and bright. Some of it tends toward being overexposed (but not all) to kind of goose that.

Warm: Brings up the warmer colors in a picture - gets a lot of yellows and oranges. Like light and airy they tend to try and bring out a little more humor and excitement from their posing.

True color/true to life: The goal is to provide true-to-life color as much as possible or at least make the color-grading/editing as obvious as it might be with other styles.

Vibrant/Saturated: Punching up the contrast and colors, they like to make stuff stand out and feel a little more vivid than necessarily realistic.

Those tend to be like the search terms, I'd also check out the people you do like on Insta and see what hashtags they're using, it could be helpful for your search as well.",1638316883

"Stims","t5_2z6kb","is it possible your current marijuana and alcohol usage could be contributing to the (possibly) meth induced brain fog type symptoms, or at the very least, preventing the neuro-recovery from happening as quickly as it would without ingesting these two substances?

ive noticed that weed (i vape it sometimes, at night mainly to relax me if i cant get to sleep otherwise) can make me feel foggy/slow/etc. also unless you were IV'ing say, like 6 points of the shit each of those 2-3 days a week i doubt you did damage that is impossible to recover from honestly. the human body is resilient, a lot more so than we give it credit for!

if possible try swapping out the weed and alcohol, for kratom + maybe some kind of nootropic. obviously theres a complete lack of literature on what kratoms effects on the brain are thanks to this country condemning any substance that could be of any benefit to anyone because muh war on drugs and big pharma and ~~slave~~  whoops sorry, i meant prison labor, however i was (for an entire year, too) taking kratom and kratom alone, alongside RXd gabapentin for nerve pain, nuvigil (armodafinil, r iso of modafinil) for adhd, alongside an occasional (i strictly limited it to one day every week) evening/night of ketamine or poppy seed tea or something.... and i felt pretty decent and normal (before i started using h &amp; clear. now my lifes fucked).

so try something like that ! but yeah weed can make you feel foggy and alcohol, i mean its literally a toxin (not to say meth cant be toxic). so that cant possibly be doing your recovery time any favors. just my thoughts. i definitely recommend kratom if you must have something. just obv dont go insane with it keep it reasonable maybe 2-4 grams 1-3 times a day, that was pretty much how i did it. and funnily enough my tolerance took like 9 months to increase and become noticeable. because i kept my dosage stable.",1638316884

"Tekken","t5_2s7yn","Are the character stories related to The Machinist, but they weren't held up by them. Nina, Bryan, Steve, Lei, Paul, and several others were all great characters in their own right in Tekken 4, and didn't need the Mishima's to accomplish this. Now Nina works for Mishimas, they never do anything with Bryan because he's not related to them, Steve is obsessed with the Mishimas, Lei is irrelevant because he's not related to them, and Paul's character's been assassinated because they forgot he was related to Kazuya once upon a time.


Making the lore more cohesive just makes the world feel smaller and more limited and hence less interesting. I wish more characters were like Ogre and didn't need to ask the Mishimas permission when they needed to take a piss in order to be ""important"". The idea that a character cant just come out of nowhere and challenge the Mishimas because they are strong by blood just because they're born strong and naturally no human in a world full of superhumans can defeat them unless they're related to them is honestly laughable.",1638316886

In the 3 days following the test did you develop covid? Did the test result in a false negative? 

I understand the need for 72 hours because we need a reliable way to have some kind of test with an amount of time that is not extremely restrictive, but it also is not the end all.

Comments: Honestly wouldn‚Äôt buy it again considering after fees this cost me around 1100 dollars. The StockX seal to keep the box sealed didn‚Äôt come off cleanly and scuffed the box so the outside is damaged. The packs were presented in this order: Sun and Moon base, fossil and lastly ancient origins. 

In my opinion they should‚Äôve ended with the fossil pack so maybe I could‚Äôve been less bitter at the end but instead the last thing I saw was ancient origins.",1638316887

"lotro","t5_2rfus","Here's everything I've *assimilated* after watching the dev interviews since the announcement:

* Severlin (LOTRO Executive Producer) has mentioned that they're actually hiring people both within and without the company to start working on the ""Graphics Update,"" though he doesn't go into detail here so it could mean lots of things. The stuff that he specifically mentions, though, refer to the UI. Stuff like resolution scaling and just overhauling how the UI functions: like being able to track more than 5 quests, and having a dedicated spot for the Epic Quests.

* Scenario (Senior World Designer) has mentioned stuff they would like to do, and commented on the hurdles they would face in upgrading things like textures. All of LOTRO's textures are ""hand painted"" so they would need to find a way to vectorize these textures, while not making them look gnarly or stretched.

* Raninia (LOTRO Producer) has said that any potential graphics overhaul would come in stages, using the recent ""per-pixel lighting attenuation"" addition as an example.

Some random stuff that I can't remember well enough to attribute.

* SSG is a small enough company that content development cannot stop in order to allow for this graphics update. It's like closing a business to remodel, only it wouldn't be just for a few days or months, so that's unrealistic. It would be a rolling update, if anything.

* All players have their own idea of what a graphics update would look like. Some are fine with the visuals now, others are expecting *New World*-tier. Essentially, they're aiming for an end result that comes at a comfortable intersection between time, budget, and results. Basically, if one of the methods requires millions of dollars and months' worth of time for a slight bump in quality... they probably won't do it. But if they can find a cost-effective way to somehow update 15 years' worth of assets within a reasonable timeframe, then that's probably the result we're going to end up with.

* They haven't commented on consoles at all. Stuff like that would be so expensive as far as time and money that I think it's out of their hands either way. EG7 would have to foot the bill and the work would likely need to be outsourced, maybe with SSG supervising. It's worth noting that Turbine's last attempt at bringing LOTRO to consoles ended in disaster, so SSG is probably not too keen on going forward with it unless the process is heavily supported.",1638316887

Realism is irrelevant to game balance.  This is just plain bad game balance, especially with jets being a 3HK.  

Let's say you put these SMAWs in the vanilla BF3 sandbox you've effectively made Scout helicopters and Transport helis completely useless.  And now the attack heli has even more reason to sit 800m away from the play area and just hovercamp. (so how about capping the AH &amp; Jet range instead of superbuffing the SMAW and upending the rest of the vehicle sandbox....)  Tanks have even more reasons to not even participate in fights, so they'll camp the outskirts of the map and shell areas to avoid being overwhelmed by a poorly balanced dumbfire launcher.

There's a reason why tank cannons and BASRs have much lower bullet velocities than in reeeal lief too.  Game would NOT be better if an Abrams could sit on a hill spamming shells across the map at 1500 m/s.  (it's only 200 m/s in the game, which is even more ""unrealistic"" in relation to the SMAW...)",1638316888

"Antipsychiatry","t5_2to28","I used to be pro psychiatry. Then I actually depended on one because I was in a very bad place. Instead of help, scientific based treatment and some diagnosis that actually describes my symptoms, they labelled me with two contradicting personality disorders (they couldn't test me for OCD in one session despite me bringing in a prescreening I did with a clinician and being afraid of networking meant I somehow feared abandonment), suggested things my GP and I had already tried and found harmful/ineffective then told me that ""I subconsciously didn't want to get better"" when I told her that. And there was little protection or correction from what she did. I literally had a team of people advocating for me, multiple GP/NP/etc letters and multiple suicide attempts before someone took pity on me and let me get a second opinion to get that corrected.  I lost years of my life and career because of that.  Said second psychiatrist was neutral as she was able to state I did not have a personality disorder but didn't actually help witn my orginal symptoms that I sought help for.  It was a bad bet - I was worse off then had I never sought help. 

Now I'm more ""stay away from psychiatry"". There might be a good psychiatrist somewhere out there but it is really worth playing medical Squid Game to win the jackpot?  I think not.",1638316889

There's need of faith and baptism, no more circumcision or being Jewish anymore. He's here to save us all.

Why did he died for the old covenant them? Because it was his people back then. Why should he died for people out of his covenant? But with His come that's changed so that the whole creation, His creation, can be saved by creating a new Covenant.",1638316889

But the article does equate P2P with high D-isomer meth which based on what I was just reading is not entirely accurate. Ephedrine meth was actually higher in D-isomer which is why it was more preferred by addicts because that is the isomer that gives the euphoria. But L-isomer is what makes your heart race and extends the effects of D. The mixture of isomers does have an impact on mental health impacts, including addiction potential, but to your point it doesn't seem like it's as simple as ""new"" meth vs ""old"" meth.  


In the article, they mention that seizures of meth have recently tested at D-isomer levels that we didn't think were feasible for meth producers. That raises some questions for me... and it also complicates this idea of broad decriminalization because what racemic mixture would the government endorse/support?

"zen","t5_2qhmf","I see what you mean, but there is almost no accountability for upper-level leadership in any religion. In mormonism, for example, most people don't even know that the upper echelons of leadership are paid, and there is no accountability on finances (literally none). I'm not talking about offshoots of mormonism but the core (main) religion. In catholicism, we need only look to the never ending abuse allegations to know that there was/is no accountability there, either. 

Agreed on the point of different experiences in different faith systems. This is what I meant when I said the term almost seemed to depend on the commitment of the worshipper. This goes for Buddhism, too. However, in past conversations with ewk (and I don't mean to speak for him), I think he is raising the concern that the structure of Buddhism, plus its decentralized nature, plus the frequent raising up of ""gurus"" or other notables as venerated and sage guides, creates a system ripe for predators of many types. I certainly think that categorizing Buddhism as a cult is unfounded (and unhelpful), but I don't think the concern unfounded (the facts indicate otherwise, obviously).

"CODWarzone","t5_2clyzt","&gt;I get what you mean and i agree with the sentiment that positioning should be very important in a br but even still verdansk has some god awful positions like atc and a lot of the sky scrapers downtown where its not just positioning is important, positioning is literally the only factor. if there is a team in atc or the tallest skyscraper downtown there is literally nothing you can do about it except leave and thats not right. you could be a 5kd god playing really well and some 0.1 kd bot will kill you 9 out of 10 times if they are in atc and you try to challenge it. i think by saying he wants less verticality he means he wants those pos positions deleted not that the whole map should be multiplayer flat. the 3-4 story buildings produce some of the best gameplay imo but when it goes higher, especially when theres only one or two ways to get up there the gameplay goes to shit

Exactly, I feel the same too. Positioning should matter but there should be a fine line between camping and ""positioning"" yourself well for the final circle. In Verdansk, 95% of the time positioning usually boils down to camping and cranking your headphones to the max to listen for footsteps",1638316891

Democrats used to love the electoral college.  In 2000 most polls showed Gore winning the electoral vote but losing the popular vote.  The GOP was up in arms about it and started proposing the abolishment of the EC, while the DNC was praising it. 

When the votes came in and it turned out the other way around, each party quickly switched positions.

They each support what will help them at that time.  That's the way it is and neither party has any moral standing.

It's the same when it comes to third parties.  Republicans fight like hell to keep libertarians off the ballot because they perceive them taking away GOP votes.  Democrats do the same thing with the Green party.  Both only have their interests in mind and both hypocritically blame the other party for using the exact same tactics.",1638316891

"DanmeiNovels","t5_2sbcqs","Kinda new to the genre, but i view it the same way i would any ""romance"" really: depends on the tone of the narrative and how its handled. If it's clearly shown to be unhealthy or toxic then generally anything goes if it makes sense and isnt just there for shock value.

By clearly, though, the author doesn't have to beat it into your head that "" X is a bad person"" or ""Y behavior is not okay,"" especially because the characters *themselves* might not realize anything is wrong, but we as readers should (eventually.)

The problem is when the *narrative* takes unhealthy behavior lightly. Like, no consequences/effects on the characters, used as humor, behavior is idealized/romanticized, glossed over, easily wrapped up, etc then pretty much all of it is intolerable if it is severe (or happens enough in the case of minor stuff like being rude) just because I think it's bad writing.

If it fits the characters to respond that way, that's different. It's believable that someone with negative self esteem or who's used to mistreatment might laugh off or trivialize what happens, but we as an audience *probably* shouldn't be expected to laugh with them, you know?

This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

More often, you're gonna run into issues with watering habits, pH ranges, and your primary nutrients(N.P.K), before anything else. Soil, right? Nutrient lockout in soil is typically from PH imbalance or overwatering habits that caused other issues. Potassium is absored at the lower range of the recomended pH 6-7. 

Test your soil pH if you can, but more importantly just flush it out for now with just water pH'd to the 6-6.5 range.If you just repotted them in new soil, it couldve just shocked them if ph range of that new mix was a lot higher. 

Find out if last person gave nutrients regulary or last time soil was amended. If it's been a month or so since any extra food, or if you're in a small pot like a 2gal or less the soil may just be running dry and you should amend the soil or use nutrients when you water. I'd def recomend advanced nutrient ph perfect line to give them nutrients and bring the ph into balance, makes it real easy.  Also consider getting a little Recharge or similar.

No such thing.

&gt;- want a solution that takes care of patching, centralized management, anti-virus, e-mail scanning (even more than m365 itself (?)) on ""auto-pilot"".

This can all be handled through m365, most companies will use a third party email filter solution.

Backups need to be tested regularly. No backup is a good backup until it has been tested. O365 needs to be backed up.

&gt;- we only use office products or cloud applications (think CRM and stuff), no servers, no IaaS, no AWS, nothing complicated.
Sounds suitable.

M365 sounds good.

You can use Intune to manage Local Administrators. [Here is an example](https://www.jeffgilb.com/managing-local-administrators-with-azure-ad-and-intune/)

\[*Image of One Punch Man staring up happily*]

\&gt;Had my grandpa over today, he's 894 and I'm 20

\&gt;We were talking about trends and such and the discussion moved over to the Japanese somehow

\&gt;""Yeah those cartoons they make are a huge industry over there. Their animation probably racks in billions each year and it's enjoyed by people all over the world, the animation was inspired directly by Walt Disney's work and made into a whole new industry.""

\&gt;""Really?""

\&gt;""Yeah wanna watch one with me?""

\&gt;""Yeah show me one.""

\&gt;Show him the first episode of One Punch Man on Netflix

\&gt;""Holy shit Anon that was great.""

\&gt;He especially liked the crabman and the kid with a pair of balls for a chin

\&gt;We went out for Icecream after I dropped him off home

\&gt;Get a call about 30 minutes ago

\&gt;""Anon I was trying to take a nap, but I can't stop thinking about that One Punch Man, can we watch more tomorrow?""

Sorry to blogpost but I love my Grandpa and I thought this would be a nice story to share. What are /a/'s experiences in introducing friends and family to anime?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","(A bit of backstory for the campaign. The dungeon master told us that they would essentially just direct us and describe it for us, but wouldn‚Äôt give us many tips or advise us to do things in the campaign. They wanted it to literally be, anything goes if you‚Äôre brave enough, which ended up going wrong)

Toxic player is fourth level barbarian, (4T)

Kind player is third level, (3K)

Me, cleric and my friend, wizard (1W) were level 1

Me and my friend had the idea that we were going to buff the party. 4T clearly knew the game better than we did. But didn‚Äôt enjoy role-play. Me and 1W are heavy on it. DM said to 4T that we could rp as much as we want, but not in combat or strategy to still keep it fun for both sides. And this already made 4T fuming. He wasn‚Äôt talking much when we joined, and when we started the session, he seemed even more irritable 

So we start, and we‚Äôre halfway through a dungeon. Expecting 4T to tank, as he‚Äôs a barbarian. He says that we should go first into a monster room. Okay, I guess. I have some helpful spells for this specific dungeon, I could run in, cast, and retreat. And 3K disagreed. She said we should keep me in the middle. So I can move to the front to cast, then retreat. 

4T goes on a wholeass tangent about how he has the most experience and has done battles like this hundreds of times. 3K gives in, I get put to the front despite uneasy hesitation. I get killed, immediately. 3K understandably is frustrated, as is 1W. And she starts arguing with 4T about how since we‚Äôre beginners, he should have known better, and how it wasn‚Äôt our fault. She essentially pinned the blame on 4T.

Then 4T rolls an attack on 3K with his big axe, it had extra damage or something and had the rage thing from an earlier bit in the fight. And knocks her unconscious in two hits. And 1W now tries to put 4T to sleep. But 4T has that elf thing where it doesn‚Äôt put you to sleep if it‚Äôs magic. 

And then 4T kills 1W. Essentially wiping the party. DM was indifferent, kind of a ‚Äúwell you fucked this up 4T, you deal with this backlash‚Äù and didn‚Äôt want to go back on their rules, despite the fuck up of the campaign. Needless to say, 4T wasn‚Äôt invited anymore. And we found a much better, less bloodthirsty and arrogant player

So there I was a religious antipsychiatry psychologist hearing them basically insulting me because I actually dare to follow the evidence because I truly care for the wellbeing of the patients.

I feel the strongest about Santana and I'm pretty set on Tina and Mercedes. Gold feels evident for Rachel, though I tried to sneak some orange vibes in there as well to fit into the colour wheel and how I colour-code her stuff in singing statistics. Originally, Brittany was going to be a more vibrant pink and Quinn more pastel-y but I'm actually happiest with how Brittany's turned out so no regrets. For Quinn, I was going for this cross-between-pink-and-purple vibe, to be between Britt and Mercedes.

 There are programs that will assist you with expenses. Like Cancer Care will give you a one time cash benefit you can use for anything you have a need for like your car repairs. It was ,$300.00 last year when I got help. You fill out an application and have the doctor or nurse help you fill out the paperwork part that they need to fill out. I think it took like two or three weeks to get the.money once they received the paperwork.
They were pretty fast getting me help.
Maybe ask your patient navigator where you receive treatment to get you on some of these programs for your specific cancer. Each cancer has charities of its own that help people with different needs.
It would help you a lot and maybe they could help you find a charity that could cover the cost of the car repairs..
I sincerely hope you find the help you need because it's rough enough fighting the cancer to have all this stress to battle everyday too.

O que faz o Marcos o maior goleiro da hist√≥ria do Palmeiras n√£o √© s√≥ dentro de campo, o cara foi nosso √∫nico basti√£o de amor, ra√ßa, esp√≠rito palmeirense nas nossas melhores, mas principalmente piores horas.

E n√£o √© dizer da falha do Mundial em pior, √© de sermos HUMILHADOS durante quase uma d√©cada e o cara todo fudido quebrado remendado botando a camisa Palmeiras sempre com muita honrs e orgulho.

O Weverton pode ganhar mais, qui√ß√° at√© ser melhor, mas maior que o Marcos imposs√≠vel, ainda - e isso n√£o √© desrespeito algum com o Weverton.

O Messi pode ser melhor que o Maradona, mas nenhum argentino diria que ele √© maior.",1638316898

"mexico","t5_2qhv7","Nunca olvidar√© como se port√≥ Walmart en esta pandemia. 


Dej√≥ de tener a las personas de la tercera edad como paqueteros cuando empez√≥ la pandemia, desde marzo de 2020, en ese momento era entendible por seguridad. Supuestamente te pedia y te sigue pidiendo redondear para apoyar a dichos paqueteros pero empezaron a salir historias de ellos mismos que no les daban nada, o les daban una migaja.

Posteriormente cuando estuvieron ya vacunados los de esa edad y quer√≠an volver a trabajar Walmart no los volvi√≥ a aceptar y sigue sin aceptarlos.


En mi estado coincidi√≥ la pandemia con la entrada en vigor de una ley estupida que prohibe las bolsas de pl√°stico, que hizo walmart? Simplemente dej√≥ de dar bolsas y ya, no te daban ninguna otra opci√≥n. En el supermercado Ley por ejemplo cambiaron las bolsas por unas ""ecol√≥gicas"" de otro tipo de pl√°stico biodegradable, el gobierno las acept√≥ y siguen dandote bolsas, adem√°s poco a poco ya est√°n volviendo los paqueteros.

Walmart simplemente les pint√≥ un dedo a sus clientes, dej√°ndolos sin bolsas y a los paqueteros de la tercera edad dej√°ndolos sin ingresos y no le import√≥.

Desde ese d√≠a no he vuelto a pisar un walmart, para que voy a ir a un supermercado m√°s caro, donde nadie te ayuda a empacar y ni siquiera te dan bolsas? cuando hay opciones que te dan todo eso y son m√°s baratas.


En mi punto de vista Walmart fue de las empresas que se port√≥ m√°s assholes en la pandemia con sus clientes y con los paqueteros, no concibo como la gente sigue yendo y no se da cuenta de eso.",1638316898

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","&gt;The clause under basic grammar has no effect on the later part of an amendment.

This is highly disputed and wasn't originally read the way you are implying. It literally took conservative law review articles by Federalist Society members to argue it *could* be read as a totally separate clause (despite being the same sentence). 

&gt;Because it was not tested, and firearms did not become as advanced as they are, until relatively recently

It was in the law books, tried in criminal courts, and it applied to all kinds of *modern* guns like sawed-off shotguns and machine guns. Keep in mind that DC v. Heller was about a pistol so we aren't talking advanced weaponry.

&gt;The ""well-regulated"" argument is even more recent that the conservative standpoint.

It was the plain text reading of the amendment from the start. The ""argument"" portion was definitely a response to the reimagining of the amendment though. For example, you could decided Tom Hanks is a lizard person and I could deploy the argument that Tom Hanks is a human. He was always a human but the argument in favor of that status had to be deployed in response to the new ""interpretation"".",1638316901

*****
&gt; &amp;Eacute;ric Zemmour, a controversial French far-right TV pundit who has convictions for inciting racial hatred, has declared he will run for president next spring, claiming he wants to &amp;quot;Save&amp;quot; traditional France from &amp;quot;Disappearing&amp;quot;.

&gt; In a 10-minute video posted on social media, Zemmour sat at a desk reading a speech in front of an old-fashioned microphone, designed to look like Charles de Gaulle&amp;#039;s famous June 1940 broadcast to Nazi-occupied France - provoking anger from the traditional Gaullist right.

&gt; Zemmour, a former newspaper columnist who has no political party and no election experience, has been attacked by historians for claiming the Nazi collaborator Marshal Philippe P&amp;eacute;tain saved French Jews rather than aiding their deportation to death camps.

Try to get a new card with a 0% balance transfer offer. Transfer as much as you can to that. **Pay the minimum payment on this card.** Don't worry about the promo expiring; follow the next step to reduce debt the quickest. You can always try to get a new balance transfer card just before the promo is expiring.

Pay extra on the highest interest rate card first (avalanche method,) or knock out very small balances first (snowball method at first for psychological effect,)  and then make extra payments to the highest interest rate card.

As others have said, reduce expenses and/or increase income. Follow the wiki and make a budget, then keep following the flowchart.",1638316901

-They have an effect completely counterintuitive to the safety argument, more guns do not mean less safe, less crime, or less violence. 
-whether they are legal or not does not limit or eliminate their presence, it only changes the identity of those who own them. Criminals have no regard for law, and the good and decent are subject to those ramifications.

"ottawa","t5_2qpoo","Completely false that the 'local economy' won't survive. And that's not a good reason to force 'back to the office' even if it was. When cars were invented, most saddle makers went out of business. Some didn't, they adapted/pivoted/whatever. Should we have forced everyone to continue to buying saddles? No. When Uber became a thing, taxis were forced to improve their service, and add new features and value to their service in order to compete. Does it suck for those that don't want to adapt? Yep. 

I'll give you some silly examples of things that could be done (silly so you don't try to pick them apart as bad ideas, it's the concept I'm trying to get across to you) To turn your restaurant into a destination, instead of waiting for walk-ins:

* \-Theme nights such as Halloween in December
* Offer to make patrons' family recipes, but better
* Bring in a close-up magician to walk around the tables
* Create a ""Hello Fresh"" service with YOUR recipes

Point is, adapt or die. Forcing people into offices is lazy, and harmful. Don't worry, you'll get your way because people in Ottawa give the grease to the squeaky wheel regardless of how ridiculous it is. To continue with the analogy, the wheel needs to be replaced with a hoverboard.",1638316903

That wouldn‚Äôt make sense because Zoro clearly puts the captain on a pedestal. Zoro would not compete with his captain lmao. 

But still even in Whiskey Peak, when Luffy didn‚Äôt want to listen any reasoning at all, he was willing to test his strength against him. Luffy‚Äôs strength vs Zoro‚Äôs swords. So the only time it would have ever made sense for Zoro to compete with Luffy, he did. Zoro‚Äôs naturally a competitor like Luffy, which is evident in Mock Town when they both get irked by Burgess calling himself champion. 

Sanji is passionate and can be competitive about things but he really is more chilled out compared to Zoro and Luffy. Sanji is closer to Marco in personality than he is to Zoro/Luffy. Doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs weak willed tho, nobody says Marco is weak willed. Doesn‚Äôt mean he can‚Äôt get CoC either, it‚Äôs still possible, but IMO he doesn‚Äôt really have the same dominating personality as the other confirmed users.",1638316903

Please understand I'm not slagging Janet -- I think she's been the biggest saving grace of this season and she ***certainly*** has pulled the most weight in terms of creating content ***by far*** -- she just isn't entertaining like Gina (intelligent, acerbic, ""boss bitch"") or, to a lesser extent, Lydia (delusional, oblivious, ""court jester"").",1638316904

"saskatoon","t5_2rbq2","I don‚Äôt eat meat so that point is moot. And I‚Äôm saying it doesn‚Äôt help this situation whatsoever. There are maybe tiny bits of cost saving, but not as much as you all seem to think. Every living thing deserves a chance at life so yes I do think animal lives are important. Plus I answered in financial aspects and emotional aspects so I‚Äôm not sure what to say about that.

Putting money into an animal in forms of food, getting them fixed, maybe getting them trained, getting them chipped, vaccinations, etc to get them adoption ready is all wasted if they don‚Äôt get adopted because it doesn‚Äôt allow the SPCA to get any money back for all they spent.

"EscapingPrisonPlanet","t5_53h1ns","I just read this from Billy Corgan with Howard stern:

Let‚Äôs just say I was with somebody once, and I saw a transformation I can‚Äôt explain.‚Äù

Howard asked, ‚ÄúThe person transformed into something other than human?‚Äù

Corgan responded, ‚ÄúYes, I saw it. I was totally sober. Imagine you‚Äôre doing something, and suddenly you turn around, and there‚Äôs somebody else standing there. It‚Äôs hard to explain without going into detail, I‚Äôd rather not do it.‚Äù

Corgan said he wasn‚Äôt hallucinating or imagining the incident. When he asked the shapeshifting humanoid-reptilian what had happened, the entity acknowledged what had happened.

Howard asked, ‚ÄúWhat did they say they were, from another planet?‚Äù

Corgan responded, ‚ÄúThey wouldn‚Äôt explain. It‚Äôs a really messed up story. I‚Äôm being vague on purpose. It‚Äôs up there with one of the most intense things I‚Äôve ever been through.‚Äù

The Smashing Pumpkins frontman later explained that he was being vague on air out of fear for his career and the wellbeing of his loved ones.

‚ÄúDemons exist. They are real. They are reptilian. That‚Äôs why the Bible says Eve was seduced by a snake. Substitute reptile for snake,‚Äù Corgan said, before elaborating about his experience with the record industry-Illuminati.

Describing the record industry executive who shapeshifted in front of him during a meeting, Corgan said that he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt remember the exact words‚Äù the reptilian said to him, ‚Äúbut it was something along the lines of: All humans will suffer in unending agony.‚Äù

She always runs around with this confident facade and she would have to break that to show these feelings even now with Tom that is not something she does often and very rarely when anyone is around.

Where does resistance come from, are there easy words to describe it? My idea is that one resistance would be "".. but I don't deserve it"" therefore, the solution would be to find and practice self worth so that the resistance of ""not deserving"" dissolves. but is this what it means? and what are some common ""resistances""?
I'd be super glad if you could elaborate",1638316906

"RWBYcritics","t5_wuw08","&gt; It doesn't matter how many people are whining about Adam, people are still whining about Adam and she thinks it's pathetic.

Whining about like, 5 people who have grievances with a story that she doesn't agree with is also pathetic.

&gt; Yes, because it's pathetic to still be complaining about this so many years later.

Nah. RWBY is a poorly written story and talking about why/how it's poorly written is fine.

&gt; Why does it matter if it's only some or all?

Dishonest framing is discussing in poor faith. Presenting an extreme, insignificant and harmless minority as a genuine ""problem"" is dishonest.

&gt; You think it's rotten because you don't agree.

No, I think it's rotten for a whole lot of other reasons. One of the biggest ones being trying to tell people to ""get over it"" like she's somehow the arbiter of what people ""should"" do with their time.

&gt; What motivated it was the actual posts you can find here every week talking about how Adam was ruined. 

Yeah, that's just ""people talked about something she doesn't personally care for"", egotistical at best, moronic at worst.

&gt; It doesn't have to be charitable.

Do you not understand discussion and debate at all? If you're not being charitable, engaging with peoples strongest arguments and and trying to be as fair as possible to things, then you're acting in bad faith and people *should* ignore you, or call you out on how you're acting.

&gt; ""because it has been years and everything has been said, nothing will change""

That doesn't fundamentally change anything. It's still amounts to ""stop talking about this thing that I don't care about"". She doesn't moderate the sub, hell the only time she's *participated* in this sub was to be toxic and mald at users who thought her video was shit. This doesn't affect her in any way, maybe she should move on with her life.

&gt; The point is this sub continues to harp on about the same things over and over while saying nothing new and circlejerking the whole time.

Well no, that's not true. There are always bursts of content that come from new volumes, new commentaries, new fan creator content, new secondary media sources (such as comics/manga) etc. There's often a lot of new things said, and there's always room for people who are *recently* disillusioned to speak their mind about what caused their issues.

If you don't like the subs content or it isn't meaningful to you, it's your obligation to leave, rather than to try and take it upon yourself to stop any conversation that you don't like or which you feel is ""too repetitive"". Media doesn't have an expiriation date as you've conceded, therefor people are free to discuss it whenever they feel inclined to, especially among likeminded individuals.

&gt; It's been said, by plenty of people over the course of years. It's time to give it a rest.

Neat. What does that change? Beyond you now trying to tell people they should stop talking about it because *you* don't find it interesting.",1638316908

It's a huge mess, and i feel bad for those who are genuinely passionate about helping people then end up having to go through so much nonsense.  Nursing requires less schooling, but is way too undervalued for what they provide.

Basically any trade: plumber, welder, carpenter, landscaper, HVAC, auto mechanic, electrician.  They're honest work, super important, backbone of infrastructure.  But are also often punishing on the body and discriminatory against those who don't fit the majority.

Mega corporation marketing or Finance: lucrative and ""high class"" work, but I would hate having to work in support of a company exploiting workers, polluting the world with plastic, making the rich richer, or psychologically abusing the public into a toxic dependency on consumption of excess.  

Musician or actor: nice in theory, but criminally undervalued.  We've collectively decided that we only benefit from about 1 in a million people being a musician or actor, and the rest can make their art in their spare time but if it's not free on YouTube we don't give a crap. 

Cook/food service/customer service/retail: like the trades, utterly essential work in basically all parts of the world, but treated so poorly and paid so poorly. 

The main industries/professions that seem to have decent pay, good working conditions, and decently ethical/important practices seem to be applied sciences (computer science, biotech, chemistry, etc) and many fields of engineering.

"ftm","t5_2t9mw","Just chiming in to say I know what you mean. As a nonbinary trans man, I always feel weird and torn whenever people try to make a stark division between the two categories. Especially because, like you, I do consider myself essentially a binary man with some bonus content. Man+, rather than man-lite, you could say. So am I not allowed in ""trans men only"" spaces just because of the +, even though I'm also a trans man? I feel like sometimes binary people don't really grasp how blurry the line between nonbinary and binary actually is. 

What words someone chooses to identify with is so subjective, too. Three people with essentially the exact same experiences might all use different terms: One might call themself strictly nonbinary transmasc, one might call himself a binary trans man, and one might call himself a nonbinary tran man, etc, with the word used really being the only practical difference. So what good does gatekeeping do other than exclude? I get the need for specialized spaces, but I would rather see spaces define themselves over the actual *experiences* they want to focus on. Like maybe spaces specifically for people with certain kinds of dysphoria, or spaces specifically for trans people comfortable calling themselves trans men (regardless of anything else they might call themselves). Though there of course still needs to be mixed spaces, too. I'd like to see spaces allow people to decide for themselves whether they fit or not, rather than actively exclude or try to dictate what other people do or do not experience.

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","driving isn't a right so apples/oranges.

&gt; But the accessibility of that is significantly more restricted than rolling up to Walmart.

thats an artificial barrier, and one that **any** black market would work to minimize. if your neighborhood wants drugs but there's nobody there to sell them, thats called an untapped marker and a dealer will be there shortly. guns would be no different.

&gt; There‚Äôs more than one single thing that needs to happen to solve this problem. But to just throw our hands up and say well these are ‚Äúmy rights‚Äù and ‚Äúthere‚Äôs always a workaround‚Äù isn‚Äôt working out so well.

oh yeah there's lots we could do to reduce gun violence. the problem is there's no political will from our ruling class for the difficult changes, so they'll just ban a few more things each time something happens and call it ""good enough"". that's ony treating the symptoms, not the cause.

- most gun deaths are from suicide, but our system makes mental health care too expensive.

- the next biggest group is from crime, but our system creates the conditions where organized crime thrives (not to mention banning guns will create a new income stream for organized crime)

- i don't remember how the statistics go after suicide and crime, but regardless of it's relative position on the map people being hurt by unsecured weapons is another problem with an easy solution: subsidize the cost of safe weapons storage. give everyone a one-time tax rebate or something to give proper storage facilities for gun owners. not just the bullshit little *chain locks that are all keyed alike and are only ever used to bring the gun home from the store*, i mean like an actual locker or quick-access safe that can secure the guns. 

boom. three solutions that cut straight to the heart of the problem, and three solutions that will never get traction in congress. and i did it all without infringing anyones rights.",1638316908

"tifu","t5_2to41","OP, as a child, I was bit by one of our dogs with truly zero warning signs. This dog was my favorite dog that we had; he was my buddy, and I was his buddy. I  was walking by behind him one day, not even within my reach, when he turned around and sank his teeth into my leg. Since then, I've been terrified of anything over abt 30 lbs. I've worked for YEARS to overcome this fear, with limited success. It's particularly hard for me because all but one of my favorite dog breeds are bigger than that. But the biggest tragedy of that occurrence to me isn't my fear.

It's that I could never bring myself to go near that dog again, and because he had been violent, my uncle chained him up, and he basically went crazy. Almost 30 years and it STILL makes me cry.

PLEASE do yourself AND this dog the immense favor of rehoming him to someone who can handle him properly. Offer to pay for training if you wish. But don't keep him. It will only serve to harm him AND you.",1638316910

&gt; The number of hungry people in Latin America and the Caribbean has risen by 30 percent since 2019 to reach its highest level in 15 years, a coalition of United Nations agencies said, calling the situation &amp;quot;Critical&amp;quot;.

&gt; More than nine percent of people across Latin America and the Caribbean are going hungry, the agencies said.

&gt; Along with the people who are going hungry in absolute terms, four out of every 10 people in Latin America and the Caribbean - 267 million people - experienced moderate or severe food insecurity in 2020, said the UN report.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","My answer covers these items, I will break them down to be more clear:

The DM implements the rules, makes decisions about when checks are required, and even if they run from a premade adventure, often needs to improvise these things when the players go off the rails. The DM is a designer, at least in part. This is a facet of the DMs job. To understand the rules well enough to bend and break them to facilitate fun. 

Session zero is great and all, but if you think on average players know what they thing is fun without fail you haven't spent a lot of time around people. The best indicator of peoplw is to have experience with people, so learning and adapting to the players is part of the DMs job. 

Lastly, DMs are to provide for an environment in which the players may have fun. Relaxing, intense, animated, chill, whatever is most appropriate. All the things that arent found in a manual (that I'm aware of) are present in the category of setting. The DM may purchase a traditional setting, but ultimately the best setting is meaningless if the DM doesn't understand it almost as well as if they created it. Not all the fine details mind you, but the important ones. And even knowing what details are important is part of this. 

The DM does not design the system, the DM is the system, the world, and everything all rolled up into a person with some paper, maybe a laptop, and other tools. And with all of that power, the best we can hope to do is create a world that MAY be fun, because if a player doesnt want to have fun they wont no matter how much work you put into it.",1638316910

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Here‚Äôs how this guy did it:

‚ÄúAnd He said, ‚ÄúA man had two sons. The younger of them said to his father, ‚ÄòFather, give me the share of the estate that falls to me.‚Äô So he divided his wealth between them. And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant country, and there he squandered his estate with loose living. Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to be impoverished. So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would have gladly filled his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating, and no one was giving anything to him. But when he came to his senses, he said, ‚ÄòHow many of my father‚Äôs hired men have more than enough bread, but I am dying here with hunger! I will get up and go to my father, and will say to him, ‚ÄúFather, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired men.‚Äù‚Äâ‚Äô So he got up and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion for him, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. And the son said to him, ‚ÄòFather, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.‚Äô But the father said to his slaves, ‚ÄòQuickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet; and bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat and celebrate; for this son of mine was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.‚Äô And they began to celebrate. ‚ÄúNow his older son was in the field, and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing. And he summoned one of the servants and began inquiring what these things could be. And he said to him, ‚ÄòYour brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound.‚Äô But he became angry and was not willing to go in; and his father came out and began pleading with him. But he answered and said to his father, ‚ÄòLook! For so many years I have been serving you and I have never neglected a command of yours; and yet you have never given me a young goat, so that I might celebrate with my friends; but when this son of yours came, who has devoured your wealth with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.‚Äô And he said to him, ‚ÄòSon, you have always been with me, and all that is mine is yours. But we had to celebrate and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and has begun to live, and was lost and has been found.‚Äô‚Äâ‚Äù‚Äù

His inherent design is flawed too.  Since the chains spawn from the direction you hit the survivor, you‚Äôll constantly be walking into and breaking the chains you just spawned.  Combine that with chains breaking so quickly on the environment and his power is almost just a detriment to use in every scenario.

His best playstyle was to just hard focus the box, since chain hunts are insanely oppressive.  Unfortunately, since chain hunts are so oppressive and nothing in the game makes survivors learn macro strategies naturally, that made him hell to play against if you weren‚Äôt coordinated.

It was so embarrassing I don't suck up or find excuses to these companies anymore. 

You people should do the same. These companies aren't charity, they are multi billions companies that have one purpose and it's sucking your wallet dry. Vote with your wallet and if you unfortunately must use their products because you can't find an alternative then at least criticize their greed. If you can't then at least don't give excuses for their greed.

You can hear the ringing in your ear, in fact it's all you can sense now that your vision is gone, like someone turned off your eye balls, and then... lights out.",1638316912

"Fencesitter","t5_38fvu","It sounds like you have this idea in your head of what it means to be a parent or to be ‚Äúmotherly‚Äù or ‚Äúnurturing‚Äù when the truth is that it can be many things; it‚Äôs different for each person. Teaching your child is a form of nurturing, at least I see it that way. There is no one-size-fits-all for parenthood, and no parent is always perfect and emotionally rock-solid with no problems. Even the kids of parents who seem perfect have issues, because it‚Äôs impossible to be perfect and trying to live up to that expectation takes a toll. Breaking down and struggling are normal things and they happen to everyone; I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessarily a reason to forgo kids if they would make you happiest.

But would they make you happy? The other things you talk about, like not wanting to share your partner, sound a lot more like reasons not to have kids. Kids are a permanent change (at least they‚Äôre supposed to be), so you need to be willing to take on the good and the bad that they bring. The question is whether or not the good things are worth the bad for you, and that‚Äôs really hard to determine before you have them, I think. You might not have a support system that allows you the alone time you like, and if your partner is a good parent, he will likely love your kids in a way that is different from the way he loves you; that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to be. 

The reality is that only you can determine whether or not the sacrifices are worth the gain. If you really feel like you want to be the ‚Äúbaby,‚Äù and you want to be cared for rather than being a caretaker, then maybe kids aren‚Äôt for you. You should reflect on what‚Äôs *most* important to you. But regardless of what you decide you want, I don‚Äôt think you should beat yourself up or believe you‚Äôd be a bad parent if you aren‚Äôt perfect all the time. You should feel secure enough that you aren‚Äôt going to subject kids to inappropriate levels of distress, but aiming for perfection isn‚Äôt the way to do that.",1638316912

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Worked 3 years as warehouse manager for a major telecom company (one of the top 3 tower side) and had finally decieded to purchase a house because it was the first place I‚Äôd felt confident and safe with my job  talked to my manager (he was over the entire states operations for future reference) about it and how to go about it and he even hooked me up with a realtor that he had used plenty. Precisely 1 month after closing the company laid off every warehouse worker in the United States. Including myself in favor of hiring a cheaper 3rd party to handle all of their logistics. The kicker is he knew that the lay off was coming almost a year prior :( he even encouraged me to buy the house knowing I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford it once I was let go. Luckily having experience with one of the big 3 matters a lot in telecom and I was able to find a new job within a month and not have a terrible gap in pay (although I make slightly less now then I do then so some months it‚Äôs hard to pay the bills) but like dude I get that you don‚Äôt have control over your employees but if you know a layoff is coming don‚Äôt encourage them to make such a huge purchase. Shit he could have told me I was getting laid off and I would have continued to work there until the day came as my pay and benefits were nice. I would‚Äôve just decided to not have gotten the house and probably would have had more time to find a much better then I‚Äôm currently at job to start after my last day there.

&gt;The researchers found more than 30 mutations on a protein, called spike, on the surface of the coronavirus.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/26/health/omicron-variant-vaccines.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/26/health/omicron-variant-vaccines.html)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Omicron has an unusually high number of mutations, with more than 30 in the key spike protein -- the structure the virus uses to get into the cells they attack -- South African genomic scientists have said.

[https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/26/health/omicron-variant-what-we-know/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/26/health/omicron-variant-what-we-know/index.html)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Of the 30 mutations found in the B.1.1.529 spike protein, several changes have been identified that are associated with resistance to antibodies from either a COVID-19 vaccine or natural immunity following prior infection.

[https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/omicron-covid-variant/](https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/omicron-covid-variant/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Omicron variant has more than 50 mutations ‚Äî with over 30 in the spike protein ‚Äî enhancing the virus' ability to infect the body.

"xbox","t5_2qoih","I was wondering if anyone found a fix? Fortunately this time I only needed to transfer from the usb and their expansion pack let me access the files in my usb double click them and press install. 
The addons were then automatically added to the game folder. 
But I can see an issue next time I want a world download or a game save file, as I can‚Äôt see the Xbox storage or ‚Äúisolated folder‚Äù. 

This worked for me last time I used files explorer and it was also the trial version. I think it was around 2 weeks ago. It was the only app in the store that showed that folder as well. 

I got my game file and uninstalled the file explorer app. Today I installed and paid for the app just to find out I can no longer access the isolated folder.

I‚Äôm finding that Microsoft‚Äôs future goals is to make their OS completely private and closed off. At least making it harder for normal users to find and make use of these kinds of files. 
I guess it‚Äôs their solution to cracked/pirated games.

If you can no longer access the game file you can no longer mess with it. It‚Äôs been like this since windows 10 came out. 11 is worse than 10 and it seems like they are pushing out their super regulated software on Xbox updates now too.

Over here we have Natwest, HSBC, Lloyds, etc, but they are International/Offshore variants and their own thing. I'd suggest creating a new account with one when you arrive in case you do need one. You'd be able to just transfer money to your Monzo/Revolut before you travel.",1638316915

UofT has a lot of research opportunities for life science students, some of my friends have name on publications 4th year. Depends on your high school study habits, it might take some effort to get used to uoft. If you are determined and willing to put in work, it really isn‚Äôt that bad, as you mentioned in the post. It really ends up being what mindset you have.

UofT life science is a legit way for you to get to medical school, I don't regret doing life sci because I had my shot at med and learned a lot outside of course work. I personally think if you want to make med and work hard you'll make it in from most schools, what UofT provides a lot is the research opportunities since research centres are one block away from campus, lots of courses are research courses that you can take to work with a supervisor. This leaves you with good experience when applying to med and some backup as well.

Another thing about life sci/arts &amp; science is you can pretty much switch major any year in acorn, so if you really don't like life sci you could switch to other majors under faculty of arts and science such as CS.

Also, in the Twitter comments from the link you posted people are asking wether this article has already been posted several times before.  Everything is not a conspiracy, you should reconsider how you view the world.  I have no problem with previous infection offering just as much resistance from the vaccine.  I hope it does.  The wsj article sites your Israel study as well as the study the other person posted that you had a problem with and said that there were issues with both studies.  The article states that common belief is that the vaccine probably offers stronger protection and infection probably offers longer lasting antibodies.  It does not include Moderna which seems to do be strongest and long lasting, the best overall.  Either way protection seems to wane and additional shot is probably a good idea for many people especially if new variants pose substantial risk.",1638316918

&amp;nbsp;

For a graph G with V vertices, to be a tree, how many edges must it have?
It must have V-1 edges.

&amp;nbsp;

For a graph G to be a tree, how many cycles can it have?
Zero. It must be Acyclic.

&amp;nbsp;

For a graph G to be a tree, how many components can it have?
Exactly 1. The entire graph must be connected.

&amp;nbsp;

For a graph G, which is a tree, what will happen if you remove an edge?
You will disconnect the graph, and it will no longer be a tree.

&amp;nbsp;

For a graph G, which is a tree, what will happen if you add an edge?
You will create a cycle, and it will no longer be a tree.

&amp;nbsp;

For a graph G to be a tree, how many simple paths connect each pair of vertices?
Exactly one path.",1638316918

There has to be some consistency across the board when doing kickback against microtransactions, only doing to to a big game launch, sure it's more visible but it leads to confusion about what is and isn't acceptable.

The most important advice I would give you right now is: stay passionate, stay patient, stay humble.

Passionate: remind yourself WHY you started this journey, and in how many ways you can improve the life of your participants. Get inspired by other instructors, dream big, you got this!

Patient: the path to your first permanent classes is long. Start introducing yourself to the other instructors in the area, offer your availability to cover their classes when they need it. At the beginning you'll make mistakes, and that's ok. Just keep going.

Humble: always be eager to learn, to improve, to understand your participants' point of view. The class is not about you, it's about them! Respect the journey of the other ZINs, don't assume anything.

Good luck!!",1638316919

And just like that your argument is irrational and disregardable without consequence.

That, and the implication that the guns motivate crime despite the fact places with legislation with your same intentions will see more shootings than places that don't, curiously, in many places, from people making straw purchases in the latter area then bringing them to the former. Never mind including a very, very distinct issue- suicide- to bulk it up by, what, 50%? 60%?

I mean seriously, guns haven't gotten noticeably more capable in the last century or so and they've only had further (often ignorant and arbitrary, based on fear) restrictions placed on them, so can you really not interpolate that there's something besides firearms causing this to increase? Just that ""there's too many guns and less will stop this"" despite the fact proportionally less are used in crimes over time?

&gt;But how we achieve that I don't know.

You don't know how you achieve it the same way conservatives and neolibs didn't know how to get rid of drugs. But still, you just really want it and will inevitably dog up to fear mongering kneejerk legislation that will do nothing to stop it, punish exclusively those who obey the law, turn former law abiding citizens into criminals over something this asinine, and/or create an illegal economy (just like drugs).",1638316919

When working for a wage i simply help people to reach their goals, and get bunch of IOUs with which i can get help from other people. The fact that the CEO gets more IOUs than me is simply due to the fact that organizing people is a really hard job that not everyone can do.

I installed Deluge a couple hours ago to give it a spin, but the webUI is not nearly as nice as ruTorrent. Though I have been using rTorrent/ruTorrent combo for probably nearing a decade now. Also development is very slow, with the current version being years old and progress on 2.0.4 is happening but taking ages.

I might try it with thin client setup (i.e. local client on desktop &gt; connect to daemon), but I don't want to run multiple torrent clients. I've always liked qbit (reminiscent of uTorrent 2.2.1, which IMHO was a downgrade from 1.6.1/1.8.5), I've only used it running locally, so that might be worth looking in to. Actually this might be the idea with the most potential so far.

&gt; Also I know you said you're not looking to race but that could be an easy way to bump up your ratio on whichever site you're on (as long as the swarms aren't too difficult).

I agree, and if it was because I was trouble maintaining a ratio I would probably try to race (freeleech) torrents. However, maintaining a ratio has never been an issue for me (luckily) and I only download content that I want to have. Even on the traditionally considered ""difficult"" trackers such as RED my ratio is well beyond 20, and I'm on several trackers with many TBs upload. I just like the stats :-)

Trinity having a mystery teen son that hunts down Dexter is pretty dumb and soap operish (sorry I‚Äôm trying not to be rude but it is).

Harrison did look visibly upset/traumatized when he was listening to the podcast about his mom‚Äôs murder and him being found in her blood. 

Also, how would Trinity‚Äôs teen son know about Harrison and Hannah in Argentina? How does it explain the letter Dexter sent to Hannah from Oregon with his new alias, Jim Lindsay?

Also, Dexter has always been worried about Harrison having a Dark Passenger since the original series. Deb is a manifestation of Dexter‚Äôs worries and guilt. Dexter has his fears of Harrison‚Äôs Dark Passenger and Deb is shutting it down by saying Harrison is nothing like you‚Ä¶when in fact by the end of episode 4‚Ä¶we now know there‚Äôs potentially a darkness in Harrison.

Replaying the game since, it resonates with me on a different level. I understand Ellie‚Äôs anger, as well as Abby‚Äôs, in ways I didn‚Äôt before. 

While Abby‚Äôs is more of a righteous anger, Ellie‚Äôs is full of regret. Ellie hates herself for never forgiving Joel when she could, and hates Abby for taking that chance away from her. 

Abby‚Äôs anger was born from her grief, and so she can untangle herself from it and move on.

Ellie‚Äôs anger is so much more complex, and so she struggles so much more to escape it. It‚Äôs full of guilt, and that‚Äôs why she can‚Äôt just live in peace on the farm until she fully comes to grips with it.

This game helped me understand my own grief when it was still fresh. The last flashback we see is like a mirror image of my last conversation with my dad, where I was desperate for reconciliation and he still wasn‚Äôt ready. 

It‚Äôs not Joel that Abby took from Ellie. It‚Äôs time. Time to forgive him. Time to thank him. Time to say she loves him.",1638316922

If you just want to kick some arse, the Painkiller is a lot of fun. A GWM PAM Painkiller would be damn solid I think. If you want a reliable ranged option though, you'd do well to keep your two Warlock levels.  


If you're considering the Architect of Ruin, I would look very carefully at their spell list. It is very strong but quite limited in a lot of ways, especially in the first few levels. You don't feel like a meaningful caster type until around 7-9 IMO. 9-11 ish if you're keeping your Warlock dip. They are **very cool**, but I really suggest you check that the spell list does what you want it to, before deciding to play one. (*Also your DM may hate you if you consistently turn your charges of Baleful Interdict Seals into Greater Invisibility. If the DM is kind enough to let you play 3rd party stuff, don't abuse it too hard.*)  


I presume as a GWM PAM user you're not thinking about Shadowmaster? Which is great, because I haven't played that one and I know very little about it. xD  


Going the rest of the way into Paladin from where you are now will yield a valuable PC (I wouldn't take any more Warlock levels myself either.) Illriggers are wonderful though. Whether you make the switch depends on what you want out of the PC. Either Illrigger subclass as a single class character will be fun, and strong, but a bit less versatile than what you have now, just like with any multiclass. The Illriggers with the Warlock dip are also excellent, but you won't feel any less behind than you do as a Warlock 2 Pally X.  


If you want to become stronger, give up the breadth of options provided by your multiclass and pick whichever Illrigger most appeals to you. If you want to stay versatile thanks to the dip, I'm not sure the Illrigger comes out ahead of the Paladin overall, so at that stage you're picking a preference from the options.    


If you have any questions I'm happy to oblige.",1638316922

"HaggardGarage","t5_38rtw","That's not far off the truth at all. Do 5 minutes of research. Pitbulls were created by mixing old English Bulldogs with black and tan terriers for bull baiting which was where a bull would be tied to a stake and there would be multiple pitbulls trying to kill this fucking bull. 

After bull baiting was outlawed people turned the dog's on each other on a greater scale than ever before. These things have been bred for the last 200 years to be as effective at killing animals as possible. It's only a recent phenomenon to view pitbulls as cuddly pets.

Being violent is their only purpose. You can't just erase 200 years of genetically predisposed tendencies with some half assed training. Genetics clearly affect every other breed, why do you think genetics don't matter when it comes to pitbulls?",1638316922

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","It's good that you are aware of the importance of developing your academic taste - this is one of the big and mysterious goals of doing a PhD.  You're doing a lot of reading - my recommendation is that when you read a paper, it's important to go beyond just understanding it.  Criticize it.  What's interesting about it, and what's boring?  Which parts are compelling and what is unconvincing?  Does anything seem unfinished?  What should have they done instead?  Why do you think so?  Give yourself permission to have a strong opinion.

And then after you've done that (and after you've done your own research too) for a while, back up, and try to understand yourself: what is it that you think is interesting, and why?  It is really important to understand this.

Your advisor can help you discuss about these types of opinions and value judgements. There will be things she thinks are boring (even though they seem brilliant), that might shock you.  Take note.  But your advisor can't give you your opinions - you need to form your own opinions on your own.

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","When a med is wrong you usually can tell right away. Unpleasant side effects will be there right away and not wear off after the first week. If you are experiencing nothing, then that's a good sign that this could be the right med, and now you just have to get up to the right dose to get the effect. After finding the med that did not cause bad side effects at low doses, my doc had me up my dose step by step, going up every 5 days or so. I gradually started seeing improvements with higher doses. When I got to a dose that started to cause side effects, he said ok, that's your threshold, and set my regular dose 1 step down from that. If it's working the way it should you should not feel high or uncomfortable. You should feel normal, but notice that you are doing things that were too difficult before. It often takes a few weeks before you realize that you just haven't been struggling so much lately, and that's how you know it's working. It can be subtle. Often I don't realize just how much my meds are helping until I have to go without them for a few days, and suddenly everything is so hard. When people talk about the ""honeymoon"" stage where they get all kinds of energy when first starting a new med and they're essentially describing being high, that is usually because they started at a higher dose instead of starting low and gradually increasing. Tends to happen when being treated by a doc who is not a specialist and isn't super familiar with how the meds should be monitored.",1638316925

[This page](https://everytownresearch.org/maps/gunfire-on-school-grounds/) has data from 2013 to 2021 (nine years) and says there were 784 gunfire incidents on school grounds in that time.

Assuming they all took place at different schools, that mean about 3% of schools experienced a shooting.  That's a little high though, because I excluded elementary schools and obviously Sandy Hook is one example.

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","Please don‚Äôt do that!

Have you heard about how statistics are ‚Äúlies, d-mned lies, and statistics?‚Äù

The 80% number isn‚Äôt accurate, and when there‚Äôs anything reported even close to it, it is usually a really bad methodology.

Here‚Äôs things I‚Äôve seen: They are measuring people in the Adult Services program, who 50% have a caregiver in-home in addition to parental support. (They also say in that study that the results of people in the program are not generalizable to the larger autistic population.)

Often it is confounding ‚Äúautism‚Äù with ‚Äúautism and significant co-morbidities.‚Äù Historically doctors have confused autism with ‚Äúother learning delays‚Äù, so people with learning delays or serious congenital health conditions from birth would get a bonus autism diagnosis. The statistic might be relevant to the health condition, not the autism, for why they are unable to get a job.

The UK study reported their median age in their study was 25. If you do a study where there‚Äôs 15 year olds included in it, were we surprised they don‚Äôt have jobs? So age-skewing is a factor.

I haven‚Äôt seen this on employment stats, but a statistic on autistic driving only used autism diagnoses from age 9 and under, and checked 17-24 year olds in driving, to make a scary statistic about how autistic people don‚Äôt drive. Autistic TEENAGERS with early diagnoses had a lower-than-average rate of getting their driver‚Äôs license while a teenager, in New Jersey. That‚Äôs what the study actually concluded. But it was spun and spun some more to be like ‚Äúautistic people can‚Äôt drive‚Äù, far beyond what the study found.

Also, the recommendation there was to have disability-friendly driver‚Äôs ed courses, to bridge the gap, because parents might be emotionally able to take a NT child out doing driver‚Äôs practice, but may need a more trained person to deal with explaining to their autistic child how to drive. Building a community program where experts demonstrate friendly ways of navigating using language comfortable to Autistic drivers, that may be the solution to solve the societal gap.

Societal factors are changing. Work-from-home is becoming a more viable option, and that allows you to work without navigating the break room‚Äôs office politics. Nobody will think you‚Äôre ‚Äúweird‚Äù because of the 10 minute forced conversation waiting in the break room, because you get to only see them on focused Zoom call meetings, not the chitchat that is often hardest.

Also, diagnoses and how the process is structured, are keeping them from adequately representing the autistic people who work. Right now there are people who are clearly autistic, their doctor or therapist or psychologist may think so as well, but they are ‚Äúfunctioning‚Äù and holding down a job, so why get the diagnosis? That is what the conventional wisdom is in the medical field. And that means that they don‚Äôt get counted in that census of ‚Äúwho is autistic? What is the range of autistic capabilities?‚Äù

If one of the wealthiest companies on the stock exchange has an autistic CEO, there‚Äôs a wider range of autistic employment than the ‚Äú80% unemployed‚Äù fearmongerers collect in their bad data.

Also, it‚Äôs okay to not be able to access employment at any moment. If you are 15 and diagnosed, there are programs you could qualify for if you have periods of being unable to work. SSI and SSDI if you are in the US (SSDI usually being the one that provides larger benefits and less income/asset restrictions.)

Also, it may be a good time to consider what things you want in a job, since you know not all jobs fit your needs/preferences. Talk show host? No thank you.

But graphic designer, where you work on a project and don‚Äôt get bothered by many people, and can take creative breaks? Copywriter (the person who writes your microwave manual, or the company newsletter)? Accountant/bookkeeper who files reports and makes sure the receipts get turned in, but doesn‚Äôt have to socially chitchat? Computer programmer? Video editor (the person who splices video together for content creators on Youtube)? Audio editor, the person making a podcast sound crisp and without water breaks and throat clearing sounds?

So, think about it and give yourself a headstart on a career path that gives you what you need.

And don‚Äôt let biased statistics make you feel worse about yourself - I‚Äôve read the studies and they are often poorly designed, and hide the giant caveats of where methodology or sampling went wrong.

"StLouis","t5_2qpnm","I'm a few years too old as well. 

I was private for high school and part of middle school, public for the first part of middle school and elementary. Private high school taught us EVERYTHING. No dancing around any subjects, no questions glossed over. We watched an actual birth (yes, it showed everything). We put condoms on bananas. Did some sort of experiment in the lab to show how easily some STD's are transmitted. You name it, we discussed it. The only mention of abstinence was that some people choose that path, some do not, you choose what path you want and neither is wrong, we're here to help you make informed decisions. We did touch on transsexuality (referred to as transgender/cross dressing at the time), which I think wasn't too common in 2001. Sex ed was a whole unit in both biology and health class.

Public school....yeah, not so much. It was limited to some of you might be getting hairy, you may have some feelings towards the other sex (no mention of homosexuality at all), be careful. Maybe you just shouldn't have sex. No mention of how the act itself happens. That is all, go back to your regular class. This was a one and done 40 minute thing. Wild rumors about how things actually worked ran rampant. If I had walked away with only what the school taught me plus the uneducated rumors, I'd still think women get pregnant from anal sex and Jews don't have penises.

I'm thankful that my high school was so open.",1638316927

I've heard a percentage of patients already have ovarian tumors when they go to get them removed with BRCA, and since I already got the breast cancer, part of me feels like it's inevitable.

"dirtykikpals","t5_2wtau","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Yes I think a lot of Mikey‚Äôs actions recently were a result of the horrible things he‚Äôs experienced. Like you said, the death of Shin, Emma, Baji, Izana, and now Draken. But you can also argue that South‚Äôs violence was also a direct result of the environment he grew up in and the experiences he had (I would argue that he had a worse upbringing than Mikey). I‚Äôm not defending South at all, he is a murderer as well and deserves to suffer the consequences of that. But saying that South deserves to die because he‚Äôs killed people and will kill more people is like saying that Mikey should die too because he‚Äôs killed people and also will kill more people. 

I believe that Mikey needs help and can be helped. Kazutora was able to be reformed and live a normal life in the future despite having killed 2 people, but he had to suffer the consequences of his actions by going to juvie/prison. It just all depends on whether Mikey is willing to accept the help or not. He actually has a good support system so I‚Äôm hoping that he will realize there are people who truly care for him. Bonten Mikey realized in the end that he wanted to be saved, but I‚Äôm not sure how Mikey feels right now :( He seems more far gone than Bonten Mikey now that Draken is also dead.",1638316931

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","The term ""polyamory"" was coined by [Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart in ""A Bouquet of Lovers"", published in May 1990 in Green Egg Magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20030508180124/http://www.lair.org/writings/polyamory/bouquet.html)

In 1999, Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart was asked by the editor of the Oxford English Dictionary to clarify the definition of the term when the OED were going to include it for the first time:

&gt; This term was meant to be inclusive, and in that context, we have never intended to particularly exclude ‚Äúswinging‚Äù per se, if practitioners thereof wished to adopt the term and include themselves. As far as we have understood, swinging specifically does not involve ‚Äúcheating,‚Äù and it certainly does involve having ‚Äúmultiple lovers‚Äù! Moreover, we understand from speaking with a few swinging activists that many swingers are closely bonded with their various lovers, as best friends and regular partners.

&gt; The two essential ingredients of the concept of ‚Äúpolyamory‚Äù are ‚Äúmore than one;‚Äù and ‚Äúloving.‚Äù That is, it is expected that the people in such relationships have a loving emotional bond, are involved in each other's lives multi-dimensionally, and care for each other. This term is not intended to apply to merely casual recreational sex, anonymous orgies, one-night stands, pick-ups, prostitution, ‚Äúcheating,‚Äù serial monogamy, or the popular definition of swinging as ‚Äúmate-swapping‚Äù parties.

&gt; Polyamory is about truthful communication with all concerned parties, loving intent, erotic meeting and inclusivity (as opposed to the exclusivity of monogamy and monamory). On the basis of our own personal friendships with a few participants in the very large, diverse groundswell 

[Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20061104021624/http://www.mithrilstar.org/Polyamory%20FAQ-Ravenhearts.htm)

Morning Glory died in 2014. She was very much not someone I was ever likely to connect with - her views had a lot more ""Woo"" than I have tolerance for. But we swapped a few communications online in the early aughts and I've talked a bit to members of her family and people who wrote with her and knew her and her family well. I've never seen or heard any indication of the intense gatekeeping that seems so popular with the modern polyam community from the people who were closest to the coining of the term.

I suspect OP is talking about a group I would describe as (in a gender non exclusive sense) ""internet fuckbois and their partners"". I think many, if not most ""Swingers"" that I know are fairly accurate in using the term polyamory to self identify. But I understand the intense frustration of people seeking non monogamous love, with internet fuckbois and their partners seeking casual sex in the guise of something else.",1638316931

I think the biggest change was between 6.0 and 6.2, when the licensing model and the telemetry changed from being sent to FortiGate to FortiClientEMS.  I could be wrong, since it's been so long.  6.4 may have introduced additional layers of configuration (profiles in policy groups perhaps)?  Again memory fails me.

I'd recommend spinning up a new VM and installing 6.4 on it, just to get a feel for the changes before pulling the trigger.  Good luck!

EDIT: Just looked at the FortiNet Product Lifecycle for FortiClient 6.2 and FortiClientEMS 6.2.  Both are end of support October 16, 2023.  So, you might want to check back with the TAC and gently remind them it's still under support...

"lostgeneration","t5_2r40j","Yep. We can take a two handed approach increase the minimum wage to say 15-25 dollars an hour and dramatically reduce the cost of living. thats making public housing compromise the majority of housing on the market  and that public housing be just as good if not better than private owned housing sold or rented to people. That's reducing car dependency so people don't have to be burdened by the cost of a automobile. That's making education affordable or free. Thats making Healthcare free. Reducing the cost of living and increasing the minimum wage benefits the market. Do you know why? Because people can fill their needs and have extra money for wants. They can go out and buy that pair of shoes they always wanted. They can afford to buy more expensive goods that are ethically manufactured. They can afford not just to live but live a fulfilling life where they can afford their wants and needs. They can afford to go to grandma breakfast all you can eat buffet instead of only being able to afford McDonald's or IHOP or microwave meals. People can actually choose what they want to buy and not have to decide based off of cost. Thats what devoted capitalist dont understand. A state either providing or making people's needs more affordable frees up income allowing people to spend more and vote with their dollar.  We need to democratize our labor and our market. The promise of voting with our dollar has failed as the majority can only buy whats cheapest.

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","Of course we only have your side of the story, but based on what you‚Äôre saying I think that your response to the way he is behaving is entirely justified - it sounds as though he really didn‚Äôt give you the consideration that you could reasonably expect after a 4 year relationship. Firstly, have some compassion for yourself - it is totally normal to be upset and angry with what has happened - don‚Äôt compound your suffering by thinking that it isn‚Äôt. But if you don‚Äôt want to be angry and upset you have to decide what to do about it. When you stop and think you will see that there is only one option - you have to let go. We could talk about impermanence, or how suffering arises, but what it all boils down to is that you need to look deeply within and resolve to change your own mind, to change your response to the situation, and work towards forgiving him for the hurt he has caused you. It isn‚Äôt easy. It takes a lot of courage and discipline, but that‚Äôs how it is. Even if that is just too hard right now, at least you can take comfort knowing that all these negative emotions you are experiencing and the conflict you are having to navigate will pass away in time, because everything does.

There is a video on YouTube from a Buddhist nun (also Vajrayana) called Robina Courtin, where she uses some examples that are closely related to your situation. The video is called ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Get Real‚Äù. It‚Äôs long (two parts), but if you have the time to watch it then I think there are things in there that might resonate for you, it has certainly helped me: https://youtu.be/_LIiLA7oEJA

"realestateinvesting","t5_2qnt1","What type of commercial is this? Is this retail, office, or multi-family? 

For contract, you would typically want 
1) financing contingency
2) feasibility (inspection, lease review, etc) 

During the first few weeks of mutual acceptance, you want to get the property inspected and make sure you‚Äôre happy with the condition of the property you‚Äôre buying. You would want to engage a real estate lawyer to make sure you understand the existing leases with tenants.  This is when you can negotiate any misalignment with the seller. Once you waive your feasibility contingency, you‚Äôre left with financing contingency to retrieve your earnest money.

Once your first part is clear, now moving into lending. Lending can be difficult if you do not have direct experience in managing commercial buildings. Some banks will ask for personal financial statement and projected pro-forma. They often require minimum 65% LTV for retail buildings, so you‚Äôd like to have 30-40% as your down payment. During this phase, the lender will conduct two key tasks: appraisal and phase 1 environmental inspection. You will be paying this up front thru your good faith deposit at the lender of your choice.  I recommend reaching out to multiple lenders to lock down. You may use a broker, but it will cost you extra money so extra hustle on your part can save you some money. 

Once appraisal and phase 1 report come back clean, it‚Äôs more or so closing the deal. The lending process takes about 30-45 days, but please buffer in 2-3 wks extra just in case due to backups for appraisal and environment report. 

A few things that id like to call out - 

1) consider creating a LLC to limit your liability. If you do create, make sure in contract you mention you intend to update the buyer name to a corporation which buyer controls and make sure you open up a bank account, get a loan, etc all under LLC name. 

2) commercial is different from residential.. so having a property management firm is important. If you haven‚Äôt personally managed it, I‚Äôd recommend working with a property manager the first year or so to understand how it works

3) commercial leases are different. Based on your descriptions above, it looks like the leases are gross. There are single net, double net, triple net, and absolute net leases that affect landlord cash flow and valuation, so please keep this in mind. 

4) lending is more difficult than you think. It is not as straight forward as residential and lending is heavily dependent on cash flow from the property itself. Please spend time and focus on finding lenders to avoid delays.

"ThailandTourism","t5_340kd","I am on my first visit to Thailand and I am amazed just how inexpensive things are.  There are a few exceptions.  Sun block for example is very expensive compared to the states.

Specailly food and beer is very inexpensive.   I had an excellent seafood spaghetti with three beers and a coconut icecream with a real coconut and it came to 310 baht or less than $10 USD.   That same meal in the states would be $40.   Taxi is very inexpensive.  A car taxi is about 1/3 the cost of the states.   You willing to use a scooter taxi and obviously even a lot more savings.    Or geting your cloths washed.   It is 40 baht for 1 kg.  Or a little over a buck per kg.

I am currently staying in a very nice hotel and it is less than $25 a night and very close to the beach.    You could not find the equivalent in the US for under $100.   Heck a hotel in the middle of nowhere in the US will cost you easily $50.

I have started to get a large mocha frappe from the 7/11 and it is 45 baht.  Which is $1.34 USD.   

There is some kind of funny things.  I was at a store and buying a bunch of stuff and they asked if I wanted a bag.   I was on foot and was like most definitely.   They charged me for the bag.  Which I thought was rather odd.   This is pretty common.   

I have wondered why more tourist from the US do not come?   I suspect it is the length of flight?

My flight was 30 hours and so I could not imagine coming here from the states for anything less than 2 weeks.

I am in Phuket and think it is just amazing.  Incredible beach and basically the same tempeature every day.   It is raining this early morning and the first I have not been able to go swim and run.     It is just perfect tempeatures everyday and this is while it has turned cold back home in the states.  Where there is no way I could swim outdoors and running would require getting bundled up.

What I do not know is how much Covid is triggering the inexpensive prices.   There is a lot of stuff still closed down.   But they are working to open things up.  It is very noticeable.   It almost looks like things were just abandonded and now they have to clean and rebuild.  In some ways it looks more like a hurricane hit and now cleaing up afterwards.  So for example I noticed they were trying to clean up the McDonalds on Bangla Street and I assume to re-open.

The problem is that there is really not the tourist here to re-open everything.   A lot of things that are open are empty.   So just  openning up more things will result in more things being empty.

"Bible","t5_2qqbz","Are we humans naturally immortal?  Will we live forever, whether it be in heaven or hell?  Do the dead even go to heaven or hell right at death?  Or rather, is immortality conditional upon continued faith in and obedience to God?  What does the Bible teach about where the dead go after they die?  When the Bible's text is carefully examined, without reading preconceived ideas or interpretations into it, it reveals that the dead presently aren't alive in heaven or hell, but they remain unconscious until the day they are resurrected.  Ecclesiastes 9:5-6, 10 clearly teach that the dead aren't conscious:  ""For the living know that they will die:  But the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.  Also their love, their hatred and their envy have now perished; Nevermore will they have a share is anything done under the sun. . . . Whatever your had finds to do, do it with your might:  For there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going.""  Therefore, nobody goes to heaven or hell at death, but each person lies unconscious in the common grave of humanity until his or her resurrection, excepting for those few Christians translated or ‚Äúborn again‚Äù (John 3:5-8) at the first resurrection when Jesus returns (I Cor. 15:45-55; I Thess. 4:14-17).   
  
The technical name for this doctrine is ""conditional immortality.""  People only have eternal life conditionally upon obeying and having faith in God and Jesus as their Savior.  According to this teaching, the soul doesn‚Äôt separate from the body's continued life.  The ‚Äúsoul‚Äù requires for its continued existence a ‚Äúbody‚Äù (the physical, biological organism) and a ‚Äúspirit‚Äù (the life force animating the flesh that God breathed into Adam when creating him, Genesis 2:7).  Similarly, a light bulb needs both a functioning filament within a glass (its ‚Äúbody‚Äù) and electricity flowing through it (its ‚Äúspirit‚Äù) to give light from being a functioning whole, i.e., like a ‚Äúsoul.‚Äù   So when the body dies, and the spirit/life force leaves, the soul dies or ceases to exist.  Notice Ezekiel 18:4 and 20.  Both say, ""The soul that sins shall die.""  Now, after seeing such a text, should we devise/invent a definition for ""death"" for the ""soul"" that doesn't refer to its ceasing to be conscious?  The ""separation from God"" interpretation of such texts is a (suddenly invented) definition for ""death"" that's been read into them because people have assumed the truth of the traditional teaching about the immortality of the soul.  So people only have eternal life conditional upon obeying God, and that the unsaved will have no consciousness until their resurrection.   
  
If the word translated ""soul,"" ""nephesh"" in Hebrew, is examined generally by how it is used elsewhere in the Old Testament, it can't refer to an immortal soul that separates from the body and has continued consciousness.  This word does appear in Eze. 18:4.  But it also refers to a dead body in Num. 9:6-10 several times and to animals in Genesis 1:21, 24.  So when the body dies, nothing conscious leaves the body and goes to heaven or hell then.  The ""soul"" then ceases to exist until the resurrection, when the spirit of man is reunited with the physical body God has just made by resurrecting it.  But this ‚Äúspirit in man‚Äù (I Cor. 2:11; Job 32:8)  isn't conscious when separate from the body.  It records the personality and character of the person who died, but it can‚Äôt think when not connected to the body.  Notice, by the way, how we have a ""spirit,"" a ""soul,"" and a ""body.""  An advocate of the immortal/eternal soul doctrine really should choose between ""spirit"" and ""soul,"" and not inadvertently assert humans have two immortal parts!     
   
Since people only have eternal life conditionally upon having faith in and obeying God, the unsaved won‚Äôt have consciousness until their resurrection either.  Jesus said Lazarus was asleep before resurrecting him (John 11:11-13; cf. Job 14:12).  Paul said that if the resurrection didn't happen, the saved dead were lost, which means they couldn't have been conscious souls living in heaven then:  ""For if the dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen.  And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins!  Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished"" (I Cor. 15:16-18).  Job said that fathers who die don't know whether their sons are honored or become insignificant (Job 14:20).  So dead parents supposedly saved and living in heaven wouldn't know what their offspring on earth are doing.  David said in Ps. 6:5:  ""For there is no mention of Thee in death; in Sheol who will give Thee thanks?""  (See also Isaiah 38:18-19 for similar thoughts).  So could the saved dead (in heaven or elsewhere) even possibly not be praising God?  It would be absurd!  The rhetorical question in Ps. 88:10‚Äôs second line implies the departed spirits aren‚Äôt praising God.  Psalm 115:17 says flatly:  ‚ÄúThe dead do not praise the Lord.‚Äù  In Psalm 146:4, it says we shouldn't trust in mortal man because, ""His spirit departs, he returns to the earth; In that very day his thoughts perish.""  Although the word translated ""thoughts"" here can be translated more narrowly as ""plans,"" the Christian writer Uriah Smith has said that the Hebrew word here refers to ""the act of the mind in the process of thinking and reasoning.""  If so, the dead can't be conscious according to this text either.  Therefore, if the saved dead, of whom Paul spoke here, aren't resurrected, then they are unsaved and aren't restored to consciousness.    
   
The doctrines of the immortality of the soul and of the resurrection simply aren't compatible (especially as taught in I Cor. 15).  After all, if the immortal soul is perfectly happy to live in heaven, why reunite it with the material body?  And if the wicked entered hell right after they died and are presently suffering eternal punishing, why pull them out of hell and reunite them with their physical bodies?  Would they be thrown right back into hell again after being judged again?  Could God have made a mistake the first time around after they died?  Does He review His previous decision for error after the millennium ends?  What balderdash!  Why reencumber spirit bodies (see I Cor. 15:42-45) with gross material flesh again after they have possibly lived in heaven or hell for thousands of years?  According to Rev. 20:13, ""death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds.""  The Great White Throne Judgment of Rev. 20:11-15 implies those who died before Jesus‚Äô return and came up in the second resurrection are all judged at the same time, not piecemeal down through the generations as they died. Paul wrote that if the resurrection didn't happen, the saved dead were lost, which means they couldn't have been conscious souls living in heaven then:  ""For if the dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen.  And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins!  Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished"" (I Cor. 15:16-18).  If someone is ""perished"" without a personal resurrection, then he or she isn't alive consciously while dead before it occurs.  Paul uses ""sleep"" here to refer to the state of the dead (as in verse 20 also).  So if the saved dead, of whom he's speaking here, aren't resurrected, then they are actually unsaved and aren't restored to consciousness.  The resurrection wouldn't be regarded as such a crucial doctrine if we were still conscious after death.     
   
When the dead enter the great collective grave of mankind, ""sheol"" in Hebrew, and ""hades"" in Greek, they aren't conscious of anything.  They aren't in heaven, hell, limbo, or purgatory.  When Jesus said this (John 3:13), no man had gone to heaven (i.e., where God's throne is, the third heaven):  ""No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven.""  Even after Christ's resurrection, King David, the man after God's own heart, hadn't ascended to heaven according to Peter (Acts 2:29, 34):  ""Men and brethren, let me speak freely to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. . . . For David did not ascend into the heavens.""  In the same passage, Peter cited David in the Old Testament to prove the Messiah Himself wouldn‚Äôt ascend to heaven before His resurrection, but His soul would stay briefly in the grave while He was dead (v. 27):  ‚ÄúFor You will not leave my soul in Hades, nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.‚Äù  So when the dead enter the great collective grave of mankind, sheol in Hebrew, hades in Greek, they aren't conscious of anything.  They aren't in heaven, hell, or purgatory.  So when will Christians experience what‚Äôs described in  I John 3:2?:  ""Beloved, we are God's children now; it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he \[Jesus\] appears we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.""  Notice that this text refers to Jesus' second coming, not to the present.  We wouldn't see Jesus right after we die nor, surprisingly enough, do saved Christians go right to heaven!",1638316935

Boebert's mother got him to do a dna test, but it showed that he isn't the father. However years later it turned out the woman who drew his blood for the test was involved in paternity scam in another case, she told her husband who turned her in when they divorced lol. She was forced to do a polygraph examination and when asked whether she falsified any other tests she said no - the polygraph indicated that she lied. 

There are/were comments on YouTube made by Boebert's mother and the father's family showing Boebert's mother is convinced he's the father. Funny thing is she was 17 at the time, he was an adult and he might have committed a crime back then (1980's, Florida), maybe a reason why he denied being the father.

Boebert and the wrestler's cousin supposedly did a dna test which showed that they're related after all. Boeber now claims her parents divorced, but there's no record of that, so it never happened.

This is just plainly wrong. GG may allow you to change direction during the activation, but nearly every super allows you to move during the super. Just do a short hop and you're floating while activating your super.

&gt; You don't need defense when you can one shot people by default with it.

Yes you do. Snipers, vorpal DMT, shotguns, other supers, especially other supers that have more health and can move *much* faster. Ever tried to use a golden gun in a cramped hallway? You're as vulnerable as you usually are against a shotgun, so it's still all about getting the first shot before they do. With a melee roaming super, you can usually just clear out that hallway with ease. Golden gun is good, but it's not invincible like other supers can be.

&gt;Three peeking is for cheap kiddos who want the easy win

Use what you get. Like it or not, three peeking is an advantage for other supers.

&gt;I don't get how ""no mobility"" factors in with the most mobile class in the game.

You can be more mobile with other supers. Arcstrider lets you move faster, and spectral blades gives you wallhacks and its melee helps you make extremely quick movements. Being able to left click spam will get you places faster than just sprinting with a golden gun.",1638316935

The lack of friends problem is solvable as you've solved it before. 

Happiness can be a simple thing. Find it in the simple and sensuous things; the taste of a strawberry, the smile of a beautiful woman, the sound of the sea, the setting sun.

Some quotes to think about:

This is true happiness: to have no ambition and to work like a horse as if you had every ambition. To live far from men, not to need them and yet to love them. To have the stars above, the land to your left and the sea to your right and to realize of a sudden that in your heart, life has accomplished its final miracle: it has become a fairy tale.
Nikos Kazantzakis, Zorba the Greek

I was happy, I knew that. While experiencing happiness, we have difficulty in being conscious of it. Only when the happiness is past and we look back on it do we suddenly realize - sometimes with astonishment - how happy we had been.
Nikos Kazantzakis, Zorba the Greek

Since we cannot change reality, let us change the eyes which see reality.

When I adopted my two daughters back in 2010,

President Obama called me just to say how proud he

was that I had adopted the first two children of an

alien. I told him that it was me that was proud, that I

could be proud of being able to give two of his

children a home.

A year later, a senior official from the CIA rang me to

ask if they could talk to my daughters. They said they

had never heard of me, and they wanted to adopt

them.

My daughters were 12 and 13 when they were

adopted, so they could not legally consent to it. But

they knew what was going on and were happy for the

extra attention.

The CIA were never officially told about the adoption,

so they never got the results of the vetting. The

judge who signed the papers just kept his mouth

shut.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Therapy and mindfulness practice are great things. Mindfulness practice specifically for feeling the feelings non-judgmentally, and getting the information from the feelings. And adding space between the feeling and the reaction. 

When I was single these feelings were so painful. I'd have crushes on people who didn't like me back, and it hurt so much. But I was brave and felt that feeling all the way -- and didn't die -- and then was able to let the feeling go, and get information from it. What did that feeling tell me? That I had a lot of love to give the right person someday. And that is true. I'm now living that life, and it's amazing. 

Controlling your behavior is good. Numbing your emotions isn't so good, because then they control you more. Observing your emotions non-judgmentally is where the power is.

Therapy is also great. Might help you to talk about the specifics and get objective feedback.

Otherwise -- I liked the Mark Manson book Models: Attract Women through Honesty (even though I'm a heterosexual woman). Lots of great, actionable advice without being misogynistic.

In my opinion (and according to the research), love is worth all the trouble and pain. Good relationships make your life (and another person's life, and the world around you) better. Keep trying.",1638316939

 [Information content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome#Information_content) 
 
 &gt;The haploid human genome (23 chromosomes) is about 3 billion base pairs long and contains around 30,000 genes. Since every base pair can be coded by 2 bits, this is about 750 megabytes of data. An individual somatic (diploid) cell contains twice this amount, that is, about 6 billion base pairs. Men have fewer than women because the Y chromosome is about 57 million base pairs whereas the X is about 156 million.

"ShenheMains","t5_3o99xm","I feel like this is a bad take because you're excluding all the vitriol of anger and disappointment in pre-release theorycrafting, which is distinctly most impactful in a Mains community. It's not rational theorycrafters doing ""pre-release speculation,"" it's impassioned fans having really messy understandings of how a character works based on limited information.

Kazuha's utility wasn't realized until the banner was live, nor was the double swirl technique which makes Kazuha a step above Sucrose.

Yoimiya theorycrafting was superrrrr messy all the way up till her banner. There hardly was any info out on specifically Yoimiya, and when version 2.0 did launch, most of the conversation was swept up towards how well would she do when given a proper artifact set, but at c0. And even when she came out, it's not the fact that she was a weaker Hu Tao that was her issue, but her lack of aoe. 

As to Raiden, there was quite a bit of drama before her leaks. Even her physical appearance when her model leaked was something that stirred up the RaidenMains community. And even that received arguments of ""it's just a beta build, her appearance isn't final,"" or ""it will look better in the live game with proper lighting technology."" And when 2.1 beta was live, whether or not her Musou no Hitotachi attacks counted as burst damage or normal attack damage was its own controversy, which by the way, was totally unrelated to Beidou interactions, but the Emblem of Severed Fate.

And while I am unfamiliar with the KokomiMains community and their story with leaks, I suspect it resembles more of what actually happened in these communities.

Now while I agree, we shouldn't lead people into believing false hopes, your argument reduces everything to ""nothing changes in beta, initial reactions are correct,"" when in actuality, that is so far from the case. ""Cryo Amber"" is enough to disprove that.",1638316941

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","Ars Magica is usually credited as the inventor of the Troupe style of roleplay, where there's a primary Story Guide who might have the occasional chance to play, while a secondary SG runs the show. This is usually ""Either they run the session/adventure or the Primary SG, while the other plays"", but they generally end up with more leeway for collaborative worldbuilding than most.

This works because of Ars Magica's absurd character creation, where players develop the full lives of two people (the magus, and their companion), and then stats up a group of Normies.  Every character is doing something all the time, but a given player's wizard could be in the lab while the companion is live in the adventure.",1638316941

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* You can check your karma here:  http://old.reddit.com/user/Financial_Taro_5654/overview

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

If nobody but yourself is understanding your point you have failed to communicate it properly. If everyone arounds you smells like shit - check your shoes. It's more likely you stepped in shit than it is that everyone else did.

So check your shoes and communicate your point better. Because it honestly sounds like you suggested it is the Tank that has the final say in things.

&gt;Shouldn't they be? 

Rhetorical or defending the point that tanks control pulls.

&gt;Is it not common for the tank to be the one expected to manage the pulls and progress in a Dungeon?

It is very common but it is also dated thinking from back when aggro management was actually a thing and ripping aggro off of a DPS was a pain in the ass if it was any more than a single mob that you could provoke off of them. If they pulled 2-4 mobs the DPS was as good as dead and it would slow down the run due to a Weakened DPS who was too impatient to wait for the Tank to pull. Now that aggro management is a joke it really doesn't matter who pulls as long as they bring the mobs over to the Tank so that the Tank can AoE and get aggro.

Times change but people are slow to adapt and old advice gets parroted or read in outdated guides all the time.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My searches for eyeglass wearing subreddits haven't returned anything but r/eyebleach. (Which is cute, and I'll recall that subreddit next time I want to unsee something I've come across on the interwebs.)

Though I guess I can ask my question here too. It is r/AskReddit after all.

I'm nearsighted, and as I get older, a bit farsighted too, and maybe a touch of stigmatism. It's been two years since my last exam and I don't recall what they said then. Anyway, I've been wearing progressive lenses as recommended by my optometrist(s) for like 20 years or so.  

However, I find (and this has been for quite a while) I'm either looking over my glasses, or just taking them off directly, when I need to to see clearly in a given situation (looking at a computer screen, reading a book/printed page, etc.) and leaving them on during other activities. 
I've heard from eye doctors, sales folks on the floor of the eyeglass stores, and from a variety of websites I've read, you need to ""train yourself"" to utilize progressive lenses ""correctly.""

Well, it's time to get new glasses again, and thought I'd ask a wider user based audience for opinions.  Are progressive lenses actually worth it, or is it an industry scam?  (Progressive lenses are far more expensive than single correction lenses.)  

Anyone out there using progressive lenses, what's your experience? Do you also default to taking your glasses off or are they comfortable for you to wear and clearly see at all times?  Do you have to tilt/cant your head up, down, and shift your eyes in order to keep your glasses on (potentially looking like an inquisitive or confused dog) and still see comfortably?  Or do you find yourself like me, saying @#$&amp; this $#!@, and pulling them off your head for a while?

Would appreciate feedback from anyone in the optometry field too.  Is it a scam? Or maybe I need to get lenses the size of basketball hoops to get any real value from progressive lenses?",1638316944

"stopdrinking","t5_2s7yr","For me, trust in my resolve grew through the struggle of trying to get sober. Every day of discomfort, every relapse just made me hate drinking more.

Now is a great time to quit: you‚Äôre young, you‚Äôre sharp, you have great things ahead.

My uncle and I talked about sobriety and drinking in our last conversation (I didn‚Äôt know it at the time). Most of my family is sober. We‚Äôre the only two, though, who started towards sobriety in middle age. He poked a little fun at them, how they didn‚Äôt quite understand the difference. Decades of pathways to rewire rather than years. Not that it‚Äôs necessarily harder or easier, just different. You don‚Äôt have your whole life ahead of you in middle age. You have a lot fewer good years ahead, and will die sooner. You have the wreckage of all your best years, the loss of all that opportunity and all that money‚Äîhonest, if I never drank I would have the money for a modest house, paid off. If I never started smoking, it would be a nice house.

We never seem to get these stories, until we do. Until we realize that we‚Äôre not special and we‚Äôve developed a problem like all the other drunks. All my life I‚Äôve had my aunts and uncles trying to warn me but I didn‚Äôt get it until 40.

So start now. Maybe you‚Äôll relapse, maybe not. If you do, examine the triggers, and find ways to defuse them, and try again. You just got stronger, and had a sober day or week or month. Look for help, from your doctor (lots of medications can help‚Äîthey can‚Äôt make you magically sober but they help) and maybe an addiction therapist. Look for support from people who *know* addiction from inside. It‚Äôs so important to understand you‚Äôre not alone, that this isn‚Äôt something particular to you: it‚Äôs a damn plague. Alcohol is the leading cause of preventable deaths in the world. From a post here I learned that in 2020 alcohol-related deaths were 1/4 the number of deaths from COVID. 2 billion dollars are spent each year to program us to think alcohol is a good thing but it‚Äôs always killed more people than cigarettes. I know, you probably think you‚Äôre smarter than that‚Äîso did I, so did everyone, but advertising works or companies wouldn‚Äôt spend billions on it. There‚Äôs a bigger picture. We can‚Äôt change that but we can get sober.

Start now. You might be the unusual alcoholic who stops for good the first time. You might be a normal alcoholic who relapses and really struggles. That‚Äôs ok. Happens to literally millions. 

You‚Äôre not alone, friend. Whatever you decide, we‚Äôll always be here, waiting with open arms. I wish you well in your journey!",1638316944

But I found a local hydroponics and grow store 20 min from my home, and they carry all the stuff to mix my own soil, and will be getting Build A Soil in the near future, so while this is growing, I am going to start figuring out a good mix.

If you have any recommendations, given your recent success, I'm all ears. ^.^",1638316944

I.e &gt;!Drrrraggy drrrrawing out all his Rrrrs, ZOAH SPEAKING IN ALL CAPS,!&lt; etc. It gave the cast some semblance of personality, but many of them lacked true depth, due to the story just not having space to explore them all.

It‚Äôs a bit of a downer to realize how thin many characters are, yet I still super loved quite a few of them and am beyond jazzed at the thought of getting to revisit them again. I used to spend ages just watching the model turn-arounds on some of them; I was particularly fond of Steena‚Äôs pants and trying to understand them enough to recreate the design in my drawings.

Arms - middle softness, pure silicone down to the metal. I would describe this area to be slightly harder than tpe.

The process to become a volunteer is where you might run into issues, from what my supervising teacher told me, he had to ""sell"" the fact that I would be there as a placement student from McMaster, rather than just someone who wants to volunteer at a school (right now they generally don't want anyone in a school that doesn't need to be there).

Teachers right now are generally really hesitant to take on student teachers from Teachers Colleges due to COVID, when a student teacher comes from Teachers College, the teacher has to do a lot of extra work every week to tell the school how the student-teacher is doing. In the case of this placement, my supervising teacher just has to give me a grade and a short summary of how I did at the end of this semester, which is definitely a contributing factor to me getting the placement.

You could see she admire Vi and suffer for the comparaison bewteen the two of them. Vi is brave, Powder is not, Vi is strong, Powder is not, Vi is a leader, Powder is a bad follower. All of this put even more stress to already fragile child. She love her sister but she know she will never be like her, look how many time she remeber Vi words ""That you difference who make you strong"" she never forgot and that why she try to use her own strengh her inguniosity she try to create artisanal explosive but it never work. The day her sister tell her she's ready, she messed up and it was the bigest plan they did, again she's a jinx. She's is at the bottom of the hole and then Vander is kidnap she's see all the band go for rescuing him but she can't come with them of course from Vi perspective she protect her sister but for Powder it mean that even in a life and death situation when the stake is high she can't help, she's a burden. Look her mental breakdown when they go without her, you could already see this is child who suffer from mental health disorders, she's not healty then happen what we know she try to help her family but end up kill them then Vi her cornestone, the one who she rely so much, lash out on her and confirm her doubts, she's a Jinx. I personly think at this moment she's at his most vulnerable self and it's at this moment she meet Silco who is a drug lord and a killer and who will growming her with his own value.   
So if i'm must resume i will say she always had pre condition for becoming ""Jinx"" because she already had mental disorders, Vi rejection and ""abondonement"" after the accident push her to reform her identity as Jinx who took Silco values.

"exmuslim","t5_2s7k2","No, our biology has not evolved that drastically just because we now live longer

First of all, we know that 9 year olds today are not ready to have babies regardless of whether they've had their period or not. The earliest recent case was a ten year old and she needed a C-section. [Doctors were appalled](https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html). Even [teen pregnancies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/adolescent-pregnancy) are fraught with extreme medical risks because the female body is still developing well after puberty. Moral of the story is: period alone does not make it okay. 

Now apologists claim that this development can vary depending on environmental factors. But so far the only data we have in terms of how puberty and biological development changes according to environment, would actually suggest ***the opposite.*** Puberty happens slightly earlier in developed countries than in developing countries and this makes sense: Developing countries will have higher rates of poverty. Poverty leads to malnourishement and malnourishment can negatively impact body development. So if anything Aisha's puberty and development would have likely happened on the late side, not on the early side (according to the science they claim supposedly justifies it). There is absolutely no good reason to believe a 9 year old girl in the 7th century would be anymore ready for pregnancy than now.

Moreover, the Quran contradicts you on the issue of puberty: [[PROBLEM](https://quran.com/65/4?translations=17,19,20,21,22,85,95,18,84,101)] The Quran says that wives ""who have not menstruated"" will have an iddah period of three months.

[[WHY THIS IS A PROBLEM](https://quranx.com/tafsirs/65.4)] Scholars before the 21st century were unanimous that this meant prepubescent girls. Basically a prepubescent girl can be a widow or a divorcee which implies child marriage and sex with prepubescents can be legal according to the Quran 

You claim that the Quran can be morally objective just by simply drawing the line at puberty but the Quran doesn't even do that much. The fact of the matter is that the Quran establishes no minimum age of consent whatsoever.",1638316948

I think even if you repealed the 2A tomorrow and banned ALL firearms sales it would be a LONG time before you noticed much difference in gun crimes. Maybe I'm wrong but at the end of the day it doesn't matter because it is completely impractical here, the 2A cannot be realistically repealed, and if you did would probably spark the worst civil unrest and violence the country has seen since the civil war, so not worth it anyway in terms of lives lost and violence avoided, if that's the goal.",1638316949

Google says the average garden spider is 19-28mm long. I approximated 20 mm (=2 cm) because the spidey I relocated seemed on the smaller end.

I moved the spider (and its home, in a tiny pot) approximately 2.5 feet from a table into the large pot containing the hibiscus. 2.5 feet = 76 cm.

If you compare this to my height (171 cm), that would be the proportional equivalent of moving me 64m, or just over 200 feet, to get to the buffet. Even if I have to walk my ass back to the original spot, I'm not mad at the free ride.",1638316950

As for weight loss drugs; Komijn extract was promising in animal trials, but there's no real good science about it in human trials. But you want to be careful with anything that heightens your metabolism at a sufficient rate to burn fat at a feasibly noticeable rate, because they tend to produce really bad side-effects in your cardiovascular system and liver.

If not, or if you have any of the insulin skin symptoms at link or if you have belly fat or trouble losing weight, you might want to experiment with dropping carbs lower for a few months, 3-6 and see what happens. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUp6JBMTw0o

Inositol is good for insulin sensitivity and is independently good for hair growth. Intermittent fasting can also be a powerful tool to lower insulin. 

If you have any signs of skin or scalp being unhealthy, check out r/SebDerm it is an additional source of hair loss.

It‚Äôs not the pharmacists job to second guess a physician‚Äôs choice of pain meds. A pharmacist should watch for fraudulent scripts and drug interactions of all sorts, offer advice - but not interfere outside of specific circumstances.

A pharmacist, or a large corporation that owns pharmacies should not be declared responsible here for stocking what their patients are prescribed.

Sometimes doctors may bear some responsibility, but in the US law enforcement types have a very poor understanding of what‚Äôs appropriate for actual pain management patients.

The Sackler family? Yes, absolutely.
Anyone who knowingly participated in marketing misuse? Yes.

Beyond that the DOJ as well as AGs and prosecutors in certain states need to fuck off and stay out of pain patients lives. 

Their understanding of addiction vs dependency, and of proper pain management is so ridiculous that to call it ‚Äúpedestrian‚Äù is giving them 50% too much credit.

While I‚Äôm happy to see the Sackler family and Purdue dealt with for what they did wrong, I have seen so many serious pain patients unable to get the meds that literally keep them alive - they‚Äôve been suicides - all as an unintended result of this bullshit.",1638316952

Was I a good bot? | [info](https://www.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/) | [More Books](https://old.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/comments/i15x1d/full_list_of_books_and_commands/)",1638316952

First two plots have case numbers on a linear scale, next two plots are exactly
the same but with case numbers on a log scale.

Expected case numbers if the current  trend continues:

    day  cases  68% range
    ---------------------
    Thu:     6       3‚Äî12
    Fri:     6       2‚Äî12
    Sat:     6       2‚Äî10
    Sun:     6       2‚Äî10
    Mon:     5       1‚Äî11
    Tue:     5       1‚Äî11
    Wed:     5       1‚Äî11

The current halving time is
13.5 days.

Usual disclaimer about trendlines:

&gt;The plotted trend is a simple extrapolation of what will happen if R_eff remains at
&gt;its current value. This does not take into account that things are in a state of
&gt;flux. As restrictions take effect, the virus should have fewer opportunities for
&gt;spread, and Reff will decrease. If restrictions are eased, it may increase. Contact
&gt;tracing may suppress spread to a greater or lesser degree over time. The above plot
&gt;specifically showing the effect of vaccines does take into account a reduction in
&gt;R_eff as vaccination coverage increases, but ignores any other possible future
&gt;changes in R_eff.
&gt;
&gt;Furthermore, when case numbers are small, the random chance of how many people each
&gt;infected person subsequently infects can cause estimates of R_eff to vary randomly
&gt;in time. As such the projection should be taken with a grain of salt‚Äîit is merely
&gt;an indication of the trend as it is right now.

I don't live there but I work there sometimes and I always think about how nice a place it would be to live. This might be off putting to some people, but for some reason a lot of the people in Dromore are just charming and have the gift of the gab. I've been approached quite a few times by random people who just want to say hello and ask me how my day is going and have a quick chat. Neighbours seem to look out for eachother too, and working there alone as a woman I feel very safe. 

Also I've spoke to a few people who live there and are originally from down south or work down south.

If you rewrite division as reciprocal multiplication and subtraction as addition of negative numbers then you don't have to worry about left to right, just multiplication preceding addition. The / operator makes fractions of the terms adjacent to it, and the negative sign negates the term that follows. These introduce the left to right mechanics despite addition and multiplication both having commutative properties. If the final step is A*B and you took different routes to get A, you'd get different answers.

"puppy101","t5_2rw7o","I was inexperienced with dog training and we didn't get to a training class until our boy was about 7 months, due to covid/classes crowded. What we discovered after the class was the puppr app, which I thought was very nicely organized for breaking down new commands by step and there's videos of each step! It has a section on basics (sit, stay, etc) and I believe those are free but you can pay more for more tricks/commands. 

It also lets you track progress. So you could start with a couple on one day but not go all the way to the final step, and mark how far you got before your pup got tired. We started right away with reinforcing the sit and stay he learned before we got him at 12 weeks. (Longer sits and stays, practice sit when he's excited.) Didn't add new commands until we had the professional help since we were clueless haha.

Having a clicker and treat pouch was a huge help. They are relatively inexpensive on Amazon.

Good luck!",1638316958
"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","I honestly don't think you can be good friends with your ex while you have feelings for them.
The reason I said it's a trap is that your mind is tricking you into finding any kind of contact with them, whether it's friendship or whatever else. How will you feel when she decides to move on and date others? How will you feel when you see her living maybe her best life with you as her partner?
I feel like by doing this you're setting yourself up for a lot of heartbreak and eventually prolonging your moving on process.
Do you want her back or do you want her as a friend? If you want her back then being her friend isn't trying your best. Trying your best would be giving her time and later asking if she's interested (if you still were).
Also I don't think Ross and Rachel ever did get over each other and were good friends.

It isn't humane, but it is possible. On a philosophical level you're ignoring the point to argue ethics because you don't want to feel bad about doing what is necessary. You can't save a species and reintroduce them into an an ecosystem if it's dead. Private breeding for human consumption is the only thing that will keep some of these species alive to do that.

I already said, if a species has been selected out, it's been selected out. The point was about an argument about if you want to save them, not whether to. But in the interest of entertaining your point, the benefit is knowing the world we evolved in had a sustainable ecosystem and losing species could have far reaching ramifications we don't fully understand yet to said ecosystems and beyond that could ripple into affecting the abundance of natural resources we have to work with for us. Keeping it as similar to the world we have an abundance of resources in as possible is in our best interest until we do have that full understanding. Like fuck mosquitos man, last I checked we're almost certain we don't need 'em, I'd love to say goodbye to those motherfuckers. But tigers? Rhinos?

"skiing","t5_2qig7","I would look for something directional (not twin tip) at 84 to 90 cm underfoot with rocker, camber, rocker and one sheet of titanal (Ti) vs two.  The Mantra looks fun, but the Volkl Kendo or the Blizzard Rustler might be a better fit for where you are in terms of learning your technique.  

Personally, I‚Äôd want a set of skis that you can really learn to carve and ‚Äúshort turn‚Äù on, but will also flex enough that if you get backseated - the stiffness won‚Äôt just throw you off the bull.  I‚Äôm having a hard time picturing perfecting short turns on the Mantra - they‚Äôre really heavy.  I‚Äôm about the same height, so 177 to 180 cm is OK - even for moguls.  Again, if it‚Äôs easy to learn to do short turns well - this length won‚Äôt get in your way.  I wouldn‚Äôt look at anything above 180 cm in length.

Take a look at the K2 Mindbenders.  If you do want a ski that can do all the turns and you don‚Äôt mind something heavier - the Nordica Enforcers (93 cm) are supposed to be pretty intuitive, can do all the turns, and can rip if you believe the reviews.  If we ever get snow in the Sierra it tends toward soft potato mush especially late in the day / season and not super icy, so having a ski with some flex actually works as you learn to bend it.  Any of those skis (or similar) can be skied well into your ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù stage.

I personally ski Solomon XDR 88‚Äôs and have loved stepping my game up on them.  My next ski will likely be something along the lines of the Enforcer 93‚Äôs since my Solly‚Äôs do short to medium turns at 179 cm really well with lots of energy, but I do want more dampness at speed, stability in crud, and less nervous chatter on hard snow.

People who vote as irresponsibly as that don't really deserve to live in a good society. They have played the stupid game of political apathy, and won the stupid prize of a shitty society.

So think about how you would sell your story. Maybe even think of it like a movie trailer. What will catch a reader‚Äôs attention, what will get them interested?

That isn't to say it doesn't have therapeutic or medicinal benefits, but I can guarantee that whatever way you are currently using cannabis would not be considered proper medical treatment. Not only has there been very little research on cannabis as a treatment for medical conditions - something that is changing, thankfully - but the way 95% of people consume cannabis is nowhere near proper treatment.

As a rule of thumb, if the primary method of consumption is smoking or vaping an indeterminate amount of something, it's not really medicine.

That isn't to say you should stop using, especially if it's helping you now and the alternative is worse, but at the end of the day cannabis is a recreational drug with some (largely unresearched) medicinal benefits.

Well, you'll know then that diagnosing cervical cancer takes more than having some odd discharge.  You'll also know that advising a woman to go to ER after having had a strange discharge helps no one, not least the people in ER, and in particular the patient, at this stage, because all the ER docs can do is say, 'No idea. Go see your GP.'

So, cleaning up down there, saving any evidence of discharge, (because often in a diagnostic scenario being described the artifacts of discharge from the vagina are pretty wild in the lingo of patients so having evidence of what it is that is coming out is really helpful) and going to see a doctor calmly is the better option.

I'm sorry you are repulsed by a woman saving her discharge evidence to share with her healthcare professionals.  Maybe see someone about that.

Well, obviously she's not a teenager, which is why having a brown mucasy discharge is alarming for her.

That's what Paul *believes.* What I was never sure of in the books was whether Paul was right or wrong. If he had ever just stood up and said, ""No, not doing this,"" what would have happened? Paul believes what will follow is the same, without even the small amount of restraint he's able to have on events by directing them. But, I was never sure if Herbert was going on about the irony of Paul's powerlessness to change the future or the irony of Paul *believing* he was powerless to change the future.

I did realize, in the second book, he was never able to see Leto because he can't see someone with his powers.

"BipolarReddit","t5_2qzru","There are long term residential‚Äôs I was in one for 3 1/2 months and missed a lot of my second year in high school. I‚Äôve also been hospitalized about 9 times, and in multiple outpatient programs within like 6 years I guess it‚Äôs not really a lot of times, but last time I was hospitalized was the only time I went willingly. They discharged me on ten new medications and told me there was nothing else they could do for me üò®.
Since then I stoped all my medications cold Turkey had really bad withdrawals like I was withdrawing from crack (do not recommend at all was terrible).
hospitals are kinda like a safe haven for some people a place where you can go to get away from it all but in reality they don‚Äôt really do much for you in the long run. (unless you are really in danger of ending you life). 
I would recommend a long term facility like a residential some of them can last a few months up to a few years if you need it. I actually really wanted to go to one for a longer stay one but I do not have the money for it at all. Rn live with my bf and only come out of his room to go to the bathroom and that‚Äôs only with him accompanying me, I have been outside twice in the past two months since I quit my job because I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. 
I guess my point is life fucken sucks ass and I don‚Äôt really do life anymore never really have, all you can really do is just live it one day at a time and take breaks from work or family if you need it. I hope you are starting to feel better.

"TheOnion","t5_2qhmj","I actually don't think there's anything we can do about it at this point. Not that there was never anything we could do about it but there are just too many guns in the US now. Guns outnumber people in this country. Even if you could buyback/confiscate/outlaw 75% of the guns in the country, which is laughably optimistic, there would still be almost 100 million civilian-owned guns floating around. (That's still 30 million more than India, the country with the second highest number of civilian-owned firearms.)

Guns have become so ingrained in our society that it would be like trying to outlaw alcohol. Remember what happened with Prohibition? You'd have millions of 2A nuts running underground gun trafficking rings to ""ensure armed civilian checks on tyrannical government"" or whatever.

It became common in the British royal family to add it to foreign orders from the Napoleonic Wars onwards. It allowed the garter to be worn even when a foreign order was being worn in preference to the garter.

If 90% of this country believed in eating babies, well, there'd be some babies being eaten and you'd have a hell of a time stopping that.

For your dream scenario where the ESRB or the MPAA gets rid of ratings, you would have to create either A.) a compelling economic reason for them to do so other than ""because it's wrong,"" because enough people believe it's okay that it's not worth it to get rid of the ratings, or B.) some sort of governmental action which would amount to the kinds of censorship you already abhor.",1638316964

"sexover30","t5_34cdl","The three obvious answers are:

2. [FC-2 ""female"" condom](https://fc2femalecondom.com/)
1. Diaphragm
3. Fertility awareness method

All three have a mediocre record in average use, slightly worse than condoms, but CAN be very effective if done right. I recommend starting with the FC-2. We've used them occasionally for years. There's a bit of a learning curve, but they're made of nitrile, which feels much nicer than latex and is MUCH stronger. I've never heard of one breaking.

However, this doesn't sound right:

&gt;I can't go on hormonal birth control again (pills or IUD) due to health reasons...

Can you explain? Because the differences between different kinds of HBC are considerable, and it's unusual for a woman to have a problem with all of them. Which ones have you tried and what were the problems with them?

Ou voc√™ n√£o vai fazer a vontade, vai ficar por ruim e daqui para frente ou ela melhora ou vai chegar ao fim do relacionamento. At√© porque mulher n√£o esquece.

Eu me neguei e n√£o dei nada ja de raiva. Estou separado a 7 meses, ela ja tem outro e todos me perguntam se eu estou bem, eu estou √≥timo. A vida n√£o termina com um fim de relacionamento assim, muito pelo contr√°rio. Melhora e muito, voc√™ n√£o obrigado pagar por tranquilidade e amor e carinho.

They told me that the term Mormon has been appropriated by these tribalist and overly violent/reactionary groups of hermits that thrive in the US-Mexican border and they're with some deep businesses with the drug smuggling underworld around there.

Game was crazy fun! I Wanted to share and give some tips on what I've learned by playing around with the new patch.

Tanks are still really powerful but much harder to design/use. I did all of my pushing against Germany with 6-9 30-width tank divisions

Rushing along coastlines is powerful as you don't need to wait 8 days to get coastal supply hubs working.

The old play style of breaking through and encircling still works, but you need to make sure that your encirclement doesn't outrun the range of your supply hubs. The encirclements were smaller but still worked. If your offensive ends at a newly captured supply hub then you can keep up a good cadence. Waiting 8 days to fix the rails did slow the pace. Grand battle plan was actually really useful, the downtime between offensives could be used to build a large planning bonus.

I found specialising tanks helped to keep costs low. My armor division had 4 cheap light tank battalions for breakthrough and hardness, 3 medium SPArt for soft attack and a 1 medium tank destroyer for armor and piercing (used riveted armor for everything but the TD, infantry couldn't pierce the division).

Also, inter-war fighters seemed to hold up really well. I started the war with 1,000 IW fighters from 5 mils and managed to keep green air for most of the game (with allied help). Poland starts with a production line of inter-war fighters. They also have access to an upgraded variant that you can switch to (the variant was an export version they made for Romania ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PZL\_P.24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PZL_P.24) , kinda cool the devs added that!).

"ft86","t5_2t4rq","Here's an opposite take for the sake of discourse. The stock gt86 hasn't aged as well and isn't without criticism. 
The exterior has a cheapness to it like the last gen Celica, though not as bad. The rear of the car is especially awkward without a spoiler, the boot lid doesn't look good. The styling is pretty bland and safe which is why it's been the perfect car for people doing visual modifications. It really is a canvas. But don't fool yourself into thinking you'll make something look unique at this stage of its life. Everything has been done. The interior looks and is cheaper than the GRs, the engine is not good by any stretch, and modifying it is an absolute necessity unless you're driving it with the goal in mind of having a more sporty feeling economy car. I've always thought of it as like a corolla+ in stock form. That's where your head should be for the car anyway.  The suspension on the earlier models isn't as good as it should be either, having exaggerated rebound stiffness which makes bad roads horrific at times. Let's not forget you're paying a premium right now for a used sports car that 90% of have over 100,000kms of driving which you'll never know if they've been hard or gentle kms, nor will you know when issues are going to start springing up at you. 

The GRs engine is the perfect evolution for this platform. 40 more whp than gen 1 without adding any complexities. A revised feeling and stronger gearbox. An oil cooler/warmer. The suspension makes it sharper to react but more supple for on road daily driving. More personality out of the box. Gen 1 modifications are able to be carried over. You're not being associated with stance bums for at least a few years and you will have a much more adequate driver until your warranty is over and you can decide on things like forced induction or other modifications. Your insurance premium will also be a much better value too. There's definitely stuff I've missed but I just wanted to give OP the other side of thinking.",1638316966

The city and county offer both of these services, free of charge, but you can‚Äôt force someone to go into rehab or receive mental health services (unless of course they are a immediate danger to themselves or others). The reality is society can‚Äôt function if we just make exceptions to all the rules.

"AskDocs","t5_2xtuc","No, I wouldn't ""assume"" your MD is incompetent based on some labs you haven't had done.

Chiropractic isn't just thrown around in relation to functional neurology. It's the literal basis for functional neurology. It's an offshoot of chiropractic, which is in itsself an unscientific practice. There's no scientific basis for either of them and they are related. This clinic have a shiny website and preach experience and expertise, but they're claiming that about syndromes which aren't well known. That's a red flag. A pseudoscientific charlatan claiming expertise in something that's not yet we'll understood. As stated by someone else here, at least actual doctors can admit when they don't know.

POTS is also likely not a distinct diagnosis. There's a massive amount of heterogeneity and it's likely that this syndrome is in fact a range of processes happening with overlapping symptoms. 

Medicine isn't like House, MD. There's not some expert who can find one unifying diagnosis and it all comes together. There may be multiple things going on here, many of them possibly not medical, and a range of psychosocial and environmental factors.

You're barking up the wrong tree at this ""functional neurologist."" That place should be outlawed for fraud. They're representing themselves as neurologists when they're not. 

Good luck, I have nothing left to say here.",1638316968

Over time, by not buying AppleCare on every new phone, new ipad, and new macbook, I‚Äôve easily saved enough to just buy a new macbook outright if I ever had problems.

Insurance companies (and offerings like AppleCare) make money by carefully calculating the average person‚Äôs repair and replacement rate, with very large real world data sets, and adding a couple percentage points on top of that for profit. Because of how they work, you should never buy insurance for an item you can afford to repair or replace yourself (even if it would be painful). You should only buy insurance for catastrophic financial disasters, like fire insurance for your home, liability umbrella insurance, and catastrophic medical insurance.

If you don‚Äôt believe me, create a new bank account called ‚Äúrepair account‚Äù, and try putting aside $279 into that instead of buying AppleCare, and SquareTrade, and every other product insurance you are offered at checkout. Then just pull from that account if you need to repair or replace a device.

"bisexual","t5_2qwnx","I am monogamous and bi. My partner is also monogamous and bi. I have never and would never cheat--that's an absolute deal breaker for me, and my partner feels the same way.

The myth that bi individuals cheat is just a stereotype deeply rooted in biphobia. It's created by people who don't understand what bisexuality is. But think about it for a second: if you were a heterosexual man in a relationship with a woman, you would not automatically lose your capacity to be attracted to other women, right? You may find plenty of other women attractive, and this would have no impact on your devotion to your partner and your faithfulness to her. Being bisexual just adds a wider pool of people to be attracted to, but just because you may find other people attractive does not in any way mean that you are going to cheat. So what if you find people of multiple genders attractive? You're with (or if not now probably in the future) with a partner that you're devoted to, so the fact that other attractive people exist in the world had no bearing on that.

And if people automatically think that you're a cheater because you're bi, they are speaking from a position of biphobia and ignorance. In that situation you can choose to either educate or not associate with them, but you don't have to put up with people around you spreading untrue and hurtful assumptions.",1638316970

So while we can sit on our high horse now there were many within the Nazi party that wanted to detract or may have simply just bought into it because that's what the government demanded. They did experiments on this in the '50s I think. There is something to it and while I'm not trying to abstain guilt there is an element to this where it isn't completely their choice.

My husband told me how ridiculous that was, that we had both worked and saved for our home, that me staying home with the baby was saving us money and that my work was valuable and he didn‚Äôt know how I did it day in and day out. THAT is a supportive partner. To this day, money is definitely still tight, but he encourages me to grab a coffee out when I do errands with the baby, he recently encouraged me to buy some new clothing after I commented that I had no idea where my maternity clothes went after we moved. He never guilted me. He never made me feel like I was spending his money. 

Your husband needs a reality check. If you feel like you can‚Äôt even buy a coffee once in a while and your husbands response is that this is what makes sense, he needs a reality check. 

Maybe a joint account will help. But honestly it sounds like your husband doesn‚Äôt realize how much you contribute to the household because you‚Äôre not bringing in money. Sounds like a serious discussion needs to happen",1638316971

"Hedera","t5_gtw7g","&gt;*the GC makes decisions that affect HBAR pricing (adjustments to the release schedule and price of HBAR when released - which can be priced below the exchange rate).*

This is a very common and **very important** misunderstanding of what the HBAR distributions are.

The HBAR distributions are not Hedera selling or ""releasing"" HBAR onto the open market. The GC have no control over **when**, **if** and for **what price** the vast majority of HBAR in the distribution schedule are sold.

&amp;#x200B;

HBAR are distributed to people/organisations who effectively already own them; early investors, employees, contracts, etc.

For example, SAFT investors effectively purchased their HBAR years ago, before the mainnet launched or even before Hedera (the council.) existed and before HBAR even existed (back when it was just an idea.). Those investors have been receiving their HBAR in small batches periodically, which is a significant portion of the distribution schedule.

Similarly, employees or contractors receive HBAR periodically.

And other parties periodically receive HBAR, such-as a third-party that sells HBAR on-behalf of Hedera to meet their future tax obligations.

&amp;#x200B;

The important point is that ""Hedera"" (the organisation.) is not selling any of those HBAR.

Those HBAR go to individual people, who can then make their own personal decisions about what they'll do with them (assuming they are not still restricted by other terms, like in the case of Mance and Leemon's HBAR, or the HBAR given to Immutable Holdings.).

At that point, it is no different from any other individual HBAR holder.

Some people will say that SAFT investors got their HBAR very cheap, so they will sell cheap... which might be true, but is a weird way to look at it.

I have a lot of HBAR which I also bought cheap... I could sell them now below market price and make a significant profit, but I don't ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug).

The point is, I think it's safe to assume that the majority of people receiving distributed HBAR are probably capitalists like all (most? haha.) of us, so they are probably interested in getting the best price they can for their HBAR, just like all of us.

Obviously they will all have different obligations and priorities, so some will sell, some will hold, some will sell high, some will sell low, whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

But it is not as simple as just looking at the monthly distribution schedules and considering all of those HBAR as being ""sold"" into the market and/or causing dilution.",1638316972

It definitely helps a lot of people see things differently, but most people taking psychedelics aren't terrible human beings who thirst for the suffering of others. 

Sure, myriad people have improved their lives through psychedelic use, and there may be a few monsters that cured themselves. 

I've met some real wack-a-doos that believe the craziest shit possible who use psychedelics.

*Opinion: Fidelity just made an oopsie on the worst possible stock*  
*Published: Nov. 30, 2021 at 6:26 p.m. ET*  


Listen, mistakes happen all the time, even in the highest echelons of finance.  
Someone fat-fingers a keystroke and few zeroes get added to a buy or sell order, or a trading-floor intern drops coffee on a disgruntled VP who then calls out for a move on the wrong stock, or a bank executive goes to a picnic with a mysterious client on his private Caribbean island, or that one time Standard &amp; Poor‚Äôs mistakenly downgraded France‚Ä¶the country.  
But if you‚Äôre Fidelity Investments ‚Äî and you‚Äôve spent much of 2021 pulling in a steady stream of retail investors, thanks in huge part to Robinhood‚Äôs HOOD, -4.17% January buttfumble that resulted in trading restrictions on popular names at the height of the meme-stock short ‚Äî the last thing you want to do is give those retail Apes a reason to lose trust in you.

He beats Darby than faces lower competition till Kingston. He could have wrestled Scorpio, Ethan, Dante, Jungle Boy, Silver , Reynolds, Caster, Starks etc and worked his way up.

If you beat one of the best young guys clean in your first match back in 7 years you already proved you can still go and compete with the best young talent. It would make sense to have him struggle in his frist couple matches back so this way when it's time for Darby or MJF to get their rub theyre not wrestling ""Ring Rust"" Punk theyre wrestling CM Punk.

&gt; I was contacted by a law firm stating there are excess funds from the foreclosure. I am worried about moving forward and claiming these funds.

I would be as well. You were not authorized to administer the estate (presumably) and even if you were, the debts have to be paid. I'd talk to a lawyer before anything else.

"Drumming","t5_2qxvm","Not a kit player, I play and teach hand drums (doumbek) so we address things like hand and arm tension frequently.  Most often, when a muscle group is cramping it is because it is having to compensate for other muscles that do not have the strength or stamina to continue as-is, and we are keeping tension built up in those muscles.  When that happens, we try to shift the burden to other muscles, and this makes those muscles work too hard and keep tension in them, and that makes a vicious cycle.

Solution is technique improvement at the slow fundamental strikes.  I teach my students to practice relaxing as part of each stroke and to practice the technique you want to do fast slowly and precisely.  You want to strengthen the isolated muscles that make the primary movement and teach them to trigger and relax immediately.  Relaxing the muscles is the ""follow through"" of each stroke.  As you practice this slowly, you can build up the speed and you will find your arm and hand are more relaxed throughout.  This will save your stamina and reduce stress on your tendons.

Well anyway. I certainly did something because the chat I typed it in got purged. Probably because of constant confusion. Maybe. Idk. I just can‚Äôt help but notice it after I typed it.

Also, uh, my anxieties were due to the fact that before joining, I dmed mouse. I kinda was extremely surprised her discord dms were open, so I expressed my support for her, etc etc.
I didn‚Äôt know if I was gonna join at that point, so I was like ‚Äúwell if I don‚Äôt at least I said it‚Äù

Then I finally decided to join and rewote it in the appropriate channel. Then got extremely anxious about being banned because I dmed mouse and oh my god what if I had accidentally clicked the call button?

Despite this, I said nothing, did notcause drama, unlike last time. I was very proud of that. It‚Äôs a huuuge step for me.

So yeah I simply wrote like ‚Äúwell I‚Äôve been hurting but didn‚Äôt cause drama, I‚Äôm proud of that. If anyone is concerned feel free to dm me, but I‚Äôll be fine dw‚Äù (in the ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù channel, ofc)

I added the last part as I know me and other people can get extremely worried about people online (my chest has been hurting all day because of my fear of being banned) so I could appease their worries.

Apparently mods didn‚Äôt see it that way.

Anyway, I doubt mouse is the person to get annoyed at one big dm to ban someone, so‚Ä¶maybe I‚Äôm ok?
Or maybe I‚Äôm overthinking again. Anyway. So yeah. XD",1638316981

And because it‚Äôs located behind a sofa there‚Äôs no glare from the lamp while in pass through and looking directly towards the area of the lamp.

Essentially the IR light comes from the centre of the ceiling covering the whole room just like a regular ceiling lamp, only difference is it‚Äôs invisible to the naked eye. And I always have perfect tracking.",1638316981

Sovereign status isn't determined by having laws, military or borders If that's the case, then every rebel breakaway province is a sovereign till re-annexed. Sovereign status is determined by LEGAL RECOGNITION as a sovereign, by OTHER sovereign nations. 

de-facto independent is not de-jure independent.

and sovereignty is 100% about de-jure, not de-facto claims. This has well over 100+ years of legal precedence in international law, which is why DeGaulle was seen as the representative of sovereign France post 1941, even when de-facto France as a province of Germany.",1638316981

Unsolicited advice - each time you lose to an aggro deck try to learn something that you could have done better instead of getting frustrated. If you lost, you didn't play perfectly (unless they got really REALLY lucky), so if you can take away something like ""I shouldn't have merged until I had to so that I wouldn't have high pip dice open to hack,"" or ""I should have kept my board more full of 1-pips so my high pip dice had less chance of being targeted"" you will feel less frustrated because you have channeled your rage into something constructive AND you will be more likely to win against those dice in the future.",1638316981

If she herself is male, what makes it dangerous to her? Because she wears a dress? She would be the dominant sex in those spaces. Would I, a masculine female, be safe because I wear pants like a man and have a man's name?

Male dominated spaces are dangerous for *females* gender presentation is irregardless. So females need female only spaces to be safe.

 If woman means feminine and man means masculine, are butch lesbians really just straight men? Have fun telling my wife she's a straight woman now and has a husband xD Are feminine gay men just straight women? Gender non conforming people (as in, masculine women and feminine men) are in danger due to people assuming they're homosexual, not because of any kind of gender.

You don't need to be feminine to be a woman. A woman is any kind of personality and appearance in a female body. Woman just describes a female human, just like a hen is a female chicken and a mare is a female horse.

We get Garrus' arc which reflects as much on Shepard as it does on Garrus. Their mentor/mentee relationship can also flesh out the Relay 314 Incident, and it's a better show don't tell story about Shepard's methods than almost any other plotline in the game. Besides, turians are one of the most visually distinct parts of ME and it'd be a damned shame to not include one as a main character.

In ME2, he's the Trusted. Liara could be cut out entirely (she could easily be replaced by internal Cerberus intelligence reports), and Tali comes in too late to really be the person that Shepard leans on. Romance or not, Shepard is tossed into a relationship with a human terrorist organization that they should not trust at all, and as Shepard says immediately after recruiting Garrus, they need someone that they can trust.

A Presence re-listen. I always forget this album, but it's really good.

I love prog and metal. I'm amazed I haven't listened to Blind Guardian before. And Then There Was Silence hits a sweet spot of progressive and metal (not djenty prog metal). All of A Night at the Opera has great concept and lyrics. The power metal might be a bit much for me.

But somehow Symphony X is the right level of symphonic progressive power metal. The Odyssey always makes me think it should have been the Pirates of Dark Water theme music.

Crown Lands starts strong, but the EP is inconsistent. I like the concepts of the mythology of indigenous people.

Usually, Christian rock bands pale in comparison with secular bands. I think Thieves &amp; Liars do a good job of being very capable prog musicians that write interesting music. The concept of Joseph's story is a good one. As you said, this more about telling the story than preaching.",1638316983

"FanFiction","t5_2r5kb","Well, there's something to be said for the multiple cakes theory. Your story doesn't have to be super unique. People will probably eat it up anyways.

But if you want to think of something more specific to the characters themselves, think about how their typical canon motivations might inform their AU motivations.

For instance, like your tutoring example, that trope is common in one of my fandoms because one of the pairing is a studious A+ student and the other one is the lowest scoring kid in the class. The manga itself doesn't really delve in to that aspect very much, but it is pretty obvious that a big part of this is because nobody had any faith in them growing up due to violent outbursts so they had mentally relegated themselves to the role of idiot failure and stopped trying in school, skipping and getting in to fights instead. That makes it rife for good character material for tutoring fics. Instead of it just being a generic tutoring session you can get in to the psychology of why one of the characters needs tutoring. How they feel about themselves, what their motivations are for trying to do good in school after all this time, etc.

So you want to look to canon to get your ideas, even if you're writing an AU. Have they been neighbors forever or did one of them just move in? Why did they move? Would they be friends under normal circumstances? How do they meet? Do they get alone right away or not?",1638316983

I've made one German friend with the same hobby as me about one year ago. We hang out about once per week or two.

It is all that micromanaged the wrestlers are robots, the product has lost all feel of spontaneity which is probably the biggest turn off. Guys like Owens just look like they are phoning in their performance until they can leave.  


I tried not reading reddit, dirt sheets, wrestling websites etc at the thought it was skewing my views, just try and watch it kayfabe, and nope it wasn't my imagination or outside influences, the product is just junk.   


I live in Australia, and because of COVID, WWE hasn't been here for a while, and though I booked tickets to their last tour here last year - that ended up being cancelled - just because, there is no way I can now consider even going to see them when they tour again, I have lost total interest.",1638316983

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","Ah so you are an English teacher. Well here's the facts. I don't need to have great ""writing levels"". As long as my writing is clear and understandable by professionals and nurses (Which it is) it's considered excellent. 

What I am judged by? Is being good at my job. I am very very good at my job. 

Read. My. Lips.

If you won't survive CPR? You are getting a ceiling of care. If you can't survive ICU? You aren't coming into ICU. Old people? Sadly? Don't usually make the cut as A) They are often left very unwell after. B) Likely to die in ICU and C) Likely to die from one of the machines. 

Anyone with a baseline first year HCA experience knows this. And HCA are relatively untrained compared to their co-workers in the clinical side (Nursing, Medicine, Therapists are all degree holders. HCA learn on the job).

The usual response from pro-covid people is ""you can't be a real doctor"". Not ""you aren't wrong for these scientific reasons"". 

I should just assume you are a Russian Troll. Not any sort of expert in education. 

The point stands. An English teacher is telling a doctor who treats Covid that the young aren't in danger despite having never treated anyone with covid or knowing about the long term repercussions of the disease with little to no understanding of what ""survival means"".

Sending Kel to Anevia is the same as sending him to the Free Crusaders, the only real difference is his role.

I have seen that video too and that's the reason I did factor that in my video that she does two damage instances per tick.

I got Kokomi despite knowing her flaws because she is cute. And for healing and as a driver for electro charged-reactions she does fine. It is fun to use her with Beidou.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;SALT absolutely hoses households in high cost of living areas (which, again, all blue), even those at the median income.

This isn't correct. Median income households are barely affected by the SALT cap:

&gt;TPC estimates that in 2021, only about 1.6 percent of middle-income households (those making between about $54,000 and $96,000) would receive any benefit from the increased cap. The average tax cut for all middle-income households: $20.

-----

&gt;a bill that is a net tax increase on the rich

It depends on what you consider ""rich"". Are people in the top 20% of income earners rich? They receive 96% of the benefit from the SALT cap change (with only 4% of the benefit spread across the rest of the population). Even with the other tax increases, 2/3 of the wealthiest 10% will receive a *net* tax cut. Similarly, nearly 70% of the wealthiest 1% will receive a net tax cut.

The net impact of the bill is still progressive because it's funded by an increase on about the top 0.2% of taxpayers, but changing the SALT cap makes the bill *much less* progressive by funneling a huge part of that money from billionaires to simple millionaires. As a reminder, over half the benefit from changing the SALT cap goes to people already earning &gt;$870K.

On its own, changing the SALT cap is [more regressive than the 2017 Republican Tax Bill](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/09/04/the-salt-tax-deduction-is-a-handout-to-the-rich-it-should-be-eliminated-not-expanded/). It would be better to pass BBB without it.",1638316984

I suppose the number of tasks and what tasks really depends on what you're testing.  In an ideal world with unlimited budget and participants with unlimited attention spans, I'd love to test 100% of an IA.  The more good data in this case, the better, IMO.  But, I don't live in that world so the questions you bring up are always the questions I need to make about tradeoffs.  Here are some questions I ask myself which might help

* What does the IA look like?  Is it wide and shallow, narrow and deep, or both?  Where does it get messy?  What stands out to you as potential problem areas?
* What do people feel confident about (and may not have an appetite for in-depth insights)?  What do they feel uncertain about?  Do you agree with them?
* Can you prioritize things?  If it's a large structure, do you really need to span the entire breadth of it if there are some sections that are pretty standard?  Do you really need to test the full depth of it if it's a lot of repetition, or would it be sufficient if you tested nodes on level 1 and 2?
* What's your budget and timeline?  

You can also lean on some best practices.  Like, cap your test to 10 tasks, aim to recruit 50 people.  It really depends on how risky your designs are and what the appetite is for your insights.  I've run test with up to 15 tasks (ugh it's long) and as few as 15 people (hey, the signal was clear).  If you're still in doubt, I'd recommend you run a very small pilot test with 5-10 people, make adjustments, then run your full study.  De-risking and iterating isn't just for design!",1638316985

Because it says they must also hold an eligible Visa, which are the same types of visa that you'd need to hold to apply for a SMC visa.

It says explicitly that people on Student Visas, temporary (unskilled) work visas, are nor eligible to apply even on phase 2.

From my understanding, at least the vast majority of people who are eligible for phase 2 would also be eligible for a SMC. As if you hold a work Visa and work in Skilled employment for 3 Years you probably have enough points for the EOI anyways.

 please correct me if I'm wrong, but international students, and seasonal workers (which are basically the unskilled migrants in NZ) are not eligible for residency.",1638316985

"MechanicAdvice","t5_2tkvu","so long story short. I disconnected the battery today and pulled the ECM fuses to reset the computer. the errors went away but shortly came back. then the car would not start and the car was telling me it was in low battery mode. I took it to a shop and they are leaning towards the battery being bad or a loose wire connection to the main computer. it's definitely electrical. we did a computer scan and I'm getting several error codes. one for the abs system and one for a misfire on cylinder 4. 


they need to run some testing but it could still be from a faulty steering wheel. I'm assuming all of my weird issues are tied together. 

random low pressure tire warning. 
ABS malfunction with grinding noise at times.
sluggish acceleration.
bad noise and vibration from the rear end. 
ECS service error.
terrible gas mileage.
flashing engine light.

I'm hearing the Malibu's are known for the ESC error. I'm hoping it's just a faulty battery. I guess when there is low voltage all the system sensors, traction / stability control and fuel system can go haywire.",1638316987

I think the government telling people what to do with their bodies is a massive over reach, and most conservatives would agree. However, conservative evangelicals will say abortion goes against the word of God, much like pre marital sex.

I think abortion laws are a lot more of a religious issue than murder. It's pretty obvious that murder is bad, and should have heavy consequences. I don't really see how having an abortion when the fetus is only a few weeks old (no developed awareness, nervous system), can be seen to be immoral. The result of outlawing abortions will lead to unwanted pregnancies, especially in low income communities. More children being born into poverty will exacerbate the cycle. I think that is more morally questionable",1638316987

Years later I went off being bottom fully, figured maybe I was now a top but during this trying to be a top a guy I met regular wanted to fuck me so I said I'd try it and well I figured best douche since I wasn't excited to be fucked and well we had the same incident as you though it wasn't much.....

I was on top because I said to him I've not been bottom for years and would prefer.just to be on top and I had a strange feeling so I reached back pretending j was playing with his balls when really was wanted to see if I was clean so pulled him out and played with him a second and and realised his Mr pointy had a pebble dash spray tan ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* You can check your karma here:  http://old.reddit.com/user/l_aeternum_l/overview

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

Agreed, nunca conoc√≠ a una persona que haya jugado alg√∫n dark souls (no hablo de sekiro ni de bloodborne porque no los jugu√© asi que ni idea) por su historia, incluso yo me met√≠ al juego porque la premisa era basicamente ""sos un loquito que subi muere revive y que tiene que pararse mano a mano con el 95% de los seres vivientes que se encuentre"", una Campa√±a al Desierto 2.0.

Y creo que eso tambi√©n es parte, si ponen el Souls en modo f√°cil sin contar una historia correctamente (si tenes que buscar el lore en internet, y seamos realistas, para enternder el lore del juego hay que buscarlo en internet, el problema no es tuyo, es del juego), la gente no va a decir ""ufff un juego que a priori solo proporciona una experiencia de juego f√°cil, vamo a darle"".


&gt; As√≠ que si, el extremo del fandom nubla el juicio y ya perd√©s el amor por el juego... No aceptas cr√≠ticas de mejoras.

Try to lighten up the actual pressure on your vulva and keep it just firm enough to where you can feel it without totally smashing it. Soft pants will totally help. Jeans might be the worst. Yoga pants might be the best (obviously, other than a lifted skirt but that might be further than you want to go...)

Maybe ironically, not having panties on is even better because the lack of the extra layer moving against the pants layer takes away some of the friction which will irritate you. BUT obviously this is likely to make a much bigger mess which you probably can't just stand up and walk away from. You'll def be leaving stains after that!

You might change your mind in 10 years, or you might not, but you can‚Äôt ever know that until you go through it. 

I think for many of us, the fear of ‚ÄúWhat if you change your mind??‚Äù is sometimes a result of the constant social pressure to adhere to the lifescript and have kids. It‚Äôs a bingo for a reason.

Of course, there are people who are genuinely fencesitters, but a lot of CF people are decided and done.

He can't change. He can take medication, He can go into therapy for several years and he could change.

Doesn't sound like he wants to and if you don't want to stick around to watch him fail then you should leave. Because hes not gonna get better hes only gonna get worse.

And he'll start abusing you physically. But he refuses to take responsibility for his actions hes not a man hes a boy and he makes excuses and he winds like a child. You would be well to be shut of him.

 I have ADHD I've been in therapy for 13 years for 13 years I take medication for my anxiety I don't take any medication for my ADHD because I don't want to take speed. I like speed way too much and it speeds me up while it comes me down and I don't like that.

Plus it turns me into a freezer I become a cold calculating machine and I used to be like that when I was really angry I don't like it.

It took me 70 years to find my ADHD so I've only been working on it for 8 years but I've been working hard. I can control my eyes and if I control my eyes I can control my arms and legs.

It's much harder to control my mouth and I am overly low quacious low quacious just the way it is

""everything is overpowered if enough people use it at the same time against the same target""

The best way to nerf zergs is a complete overhaul of the blueprint system and perhaps increased resource costs for bigger structures. Like first foundation 100% costs, second foundation 120% costs, third foundation 140% costs. With a clan or zerg you can still manage that, but you fall behind in terms of firepower.

If her mind is intact after the sheer amount of physical trauma, then she is going to have a lot of time to think about her actions and improve on them.

Da sexy Kleidung und Toys nicht ganz billig sind suche ich einen Sugardaddy der f√ºr mich meine Eink√§ufe zahlt, im Gegenzug gibt es nat√ºrlich Bilder/Viseos von allem und eine Online Beziehung mir sehr regelm√§√üigem Austausch.
Falls ihr Interesse habt meldet euch, regelm√§√üiger Kontakt findet dann √ºber Kik statt.

"evolution","t5_2qhs7","Before it reached an intermediate stage it might be something as small as a little bump of extra skin, which is so small of a thing that it wouldn't cause any change in fitness nor any noticeable change in energy costs. It would also not require nerve tissue at this stage.

Yes, wings do need nervous tissue to move, but not throughout the entire wing. In birds, for instance, the nerve tissue is only at the base of the feathers. While nerve tissue is expensive, if it provides a benefit that outweighs the cost, then it will be selected for in natural selection. 

At first, before reaching an intermediate stage, there is essentially no cost, because a little extra skin is negligible in energy cost, since skin is not expensive. It also doesn't impair the organism in any way, which means it will still have its normal amount of fitness, it will reproduce, and it will pass on having that little extra skin. As that develops beyond being a little extra skin, the energy requirement will no longer be negligible. If the energy cost outweighs the benefit, at this point, it will be selected agaisnt. If the benefit outweighs the energy cost, it will be selected for. So, if it helps you move just a little faster or farther than others, so they get taken by predators instead of you,  then the benefit outweighs the cost. If it helps you get to a slightly higher area of the tree that others can't reach, so that all the food up there is only accessible to you, then your food competition just dropped to zero and the benefits outweighs the energy costs. 

Essentially if something isn't costing an organism anything, or is costing a negligible amount, then it can easily persist. Many times, things persist through sexual selection, even though they have high costs and don't serve a survival purpose (they serve a reproductive purpose).",1638316992
