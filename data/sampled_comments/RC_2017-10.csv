"totalwar","t5_2rq9c","I think that's a bug, personally from a lot of campaign and a bit of custom battles night runners don't feel like a replacement for slingers.

Slingers feel far more useful for harassing units around your army and getting in that morale damage.(Some Skaven clan rats and a unit of slingers can make Kroxigores route with a good surround and focus fire, especially with a spell in the middle of them or sniping the lord.)

While Nightrunners are better at dedicated skirmishers, harass arches with them, force the enemy to draw units away and pepper them, and once they're out of ammo just use them to flank for your clan rats and break units.

I haven't really tried out the more expensive variants of the night runners, but I imagine they play the same but just a bit more annoying.

So, vs AI you can break up their army and possibly even pull half of it away with just a few nightrunners while constantly plinking at their health. Vs players they seem like an annoyance and way to distract/take away some of their micro or punish them if they're not paying attention.",1506816000

You'd get Mind Controller to onyx(!) by the end if you kept up that pace fielding for 19 hours, and if you do it in the right spot (or just put in one last field at the end) you could pretty easily get Illuminator too. You'd *just* get Connector platinum by the end of it, and could get Recruiter platinum with virtually no effort on your part if it's prepped in advance.

The 3 extra golds is where things start to break down a bit. Spec Ops is pretty easy, but you'd need to have a lot of easy 4 portal missions in the same area to do it and still have time for your last two. Translator gold is doable in that timeframe, but would take up a majority of that time and leave you one gold short. I expect Spec Ops/Pioneer/Explorer would be the best combo, since doing Pioneer would inherently get you half-way to Explorer. It's plausible that Spec Ops/Pioneer/Recharger might be faster with some good key management, but with how temperamental Niantic is for recharging I'd rather just go for the thousand additional unique hacks.

It's obvious that countries, that have such a low GDPs/capita aren't sensitive towards social issues, because they're not even first world countries, but emerging countries. Also the cultural difference is more severe, not only because of the culture itself, but the fact that those countries had until the 90s totalitarian governments, therefore they have experience with democracy (including minority rights) not even for 30 years now.

- I have a very young team, I am also not competitive this year. (Almost guaranteed to start 0-4 after my opponents Rodgers/Nelson stack on Thursday).

- **Receive:** OJ Howard, David Njoku, 2018 First (Likely mid).

- Rawls is just being throw in since I would drop him anyway. It's either him or Clement and I'm probably dropping Clement for Marlon Mack.

- It would also be my **fifth** 2018 first round pick. (Mine which will be 1.01 or 1.02 at the worst, two probable mids, and two probable late).

- I realize Kelce is a great asset. I do have Mahomes, which would make for a great stack in the future. But Kelce will probably be at the end of his prime by the time I am truly competitive.

It seems this form of corrupt government certainly has a limited life-span. It also seems relatively certain there lies a tipping point at which the majority of Americans will be so fed up with the failing system that unification to overthrow the gov is inevitable.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt; This makes no logical, rhetorical, or grammatical sense

Yes it does, because when you say the reasoning behind the action is fair but the action as taken is not you're defending the intent to take action, not the specific action itself. In this sense you defend an action taken in response to their thinking, just not the kind of action. The kind of thinking that leads to genocide is not rational, its not sensible, and its not fair. There is no just motive that makes people believe in mass rape. That is hate. Your entire premise is that there's a just way to think of another people in a way that can make you want to do this.

&gt;which is that you think I'm excusing rape

On some level you are to an extent. Its like if someone said ""so and so got raped by her ex"" and someone replied ""well she did screw him over hard in the divorce"". You know saying that is fucked up and you know the impulse to consider the action that way and then express it says something terrible about how the speaker is envisioning the dynamics of the relationship.

When people are tried for crimes the things you're saying are used as mitigation. The reasoning behind an act is used to lessen or strengthen the condemnation and ensuing punishment for the act. On any level where you look at how our value system manifests judgment for actions taken you are mitigating it.

&gt;The problem with your argument is that nowhere did I say I supported the how of the Burmese actions

I have used British Columbia plates in Washington and California, and successfully evaded the tolls because while my license plate was scanned, no agreement was in place to actually track me down and bill me. Same for using California plates in Ontario, Canada.

Toll collection authorities will only track down out-of-state plates that they expect to show up frequently. For example, New York is often visited by drivers from Ontario and Massachusetts, so if you're from those places and try to use NY tolled roads without an EZPass you will get nailed. Likewise, Ontario will track drivers from Quebec, Michigan, and NY for sure. But if your car is registered in California, then it's highly unlikely that they'll bother to track you down. It costs them money to do so, and California-plated cars are a rare sight in that region.",1506816008

"Bladesmith","t5_2u8ql","As for the name? I doubt he was the first to pioneer it but I've always called them Wheeler handles or Wheeler knock off's because he does it correctly while the majority fall short.

I love the look of these handles in photo's but the pinky swell is almost always too wide/fat for my tastes. Not a fan of having my index grip tighter than my pinky's. I prefer an equal grip across the handle or slight tapering towards the rear.

I understand the idea behind the design but it is actually counter intuitive for such a small knife. The flair is better suited on a chopper above 10"" in blade length. Think Kukri handles.

If my pinky doesn't touch or nearly touch the inside of my palm when I grip it, it's too fat and diminish the overall grip. I'm not a big guy but I have piano fingers and if the blade wont fit my hand it wont fit a 6' 5"" mans hand correctly either with there extra body fat.

If you want a great example of these in slight variations look too Nick Wheeler. He does it right. You'll notice the pinky swell on most of his models are obviously smaller than the index grip unlike the one in the linked photo. And if they are not they are more dramatically shaped at the rear. Doesn't look as pretty but I feel it's more practical.

Here's a great [example](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXwy6dKFuew/?taken-by=nick_wheeler_knives_and_newfs). It may be hard to tell for some but that extra meat being removed will make a world of difference in the hand.

Quick test for people at home. Hold your hand up. Is your pinky as long as your index? If no then the swell should not be thicker than your index unless your intention is to make a chopper. Equal grip across the boards makes for a more versatile grip but the blades shape truly dictates the knifes usage so plan accordingly.",1506816009

"Whatcouldgowrong","t5_2x2oy","&gt;Elaborate, please. Show me where I said abandon your mortgage, kids and wife.

You stated to leave the premises, by virtue of American law, having left the premises is considered abandonment of the home and the children in the home. This is well proven through the amazingly broken family court system. 

If you leave the home, you can pretty much write off ever seeing your children again unless you are independently wealthy and the wife/girlfriend does not have access to the accounts. 

&gt;I‚Äôve about had my fill of Internet warriors who put words in people‚Äôs mouths, instead of owning their assumptions and having an adult conversion.

I made no assumptions, you said to leave the premises, then you said you didn't mean it, that it was ""figurative"". 

Say what you mean and you won't have all of these ""internet warriors"" putting words in your mouth. In fact, if it happens so often, perhaps you should stop bitching about it, and start asking why it is that your statements are so often incorrectly read differently than you meant them. 

&gt;So, please, fucking show me how I minced words.

OK.

You said. 

&gt;Woman hits you, you leave the premise one way or another.


Then you stated what that meant was:

&gt; I didn‚Äôt mean, ‚Äúleave right now and never look back‚Äù. More like, walk out of the room or building to let things simmer down a bit.


To which I reminded you that in the American legal system, doing so is seen as willful abandonment and will count against you in court the majority of the time. 

So first you said leave the premises, then said you didn't mean to literally leave, just go to another room. Cause women can only hit you standing in one spot, they could never possibly follow you. It's their one weakness right. 

As an aside, you have made the mistake numerous times now, it is ""premises"", not ""premise"". THE MORE YOU KNOW ÂΩ°‚òÜ ",1506816014

"ipad","t5_2rgny","I'm super picky about screens, and I don't think it really matters. There is an office supply store near me that still has 9.7 inch iPad Pros on display as well as the new iPad 2017, and I'm not kidding, I thought they mislabeled the demo units. I was so convinced they had swapped the labels on the demo units that I had to put the serial numbers in a search engine to verify that the iPad 2017 and the iPad Pro 9.7 were properly labeled.

If you know what to look for, it's more clear, but it is hard to tell the units apart if you're doing it for the first time.

Incidentally, the screen on the iPad 2017 is not ""bad"". In fact, if you Google the Notebookcheck measurements of the screen, it's actually quite accurate. (In terms of measured DeltaE within the sRGB gamut, both grey and color, it's actually better than the measurements Notebookcheck got for the 10.5 iPad Pro -- though individual numbers aren't everything and there will obviously be variation between panels.)

Two good things about the iPad 2017 that I've noticed: 

* There is less color variation severely off-angle than both generations of the iPad Pros. I think this is due to the difference in coatings, or perhaps the presence of the sensing layer for the Apple Pencil.

* The anti-fingerprint oleophobic coating on the iPad 2017 is definitely more effective than on the Pros. I think they had to compromise there to support the Apple Pencil.

There is a little more brightness variation on the iPad 2017 in comparison to the Pros, and of course there is no support for an extended gamut or 120 Hz.

"copypasta","t5_2r6z7","I, too, was at Ribfest. A rib cooker singles out some young guy wearing a white ""Where's the beef?"" T-shirt, standing off to the side. He says ""Hey buddy! That T-shirt ain't going to stay white for long"" as he points to his immaculately clean white apron, confusing those watching the exchange. The young guy says ""oh, I won't be *eating* any ribs"", and honestly his emphasis of the word *eating* creeped me out a bit, but whatever. So the cook huddles with associates and seem to come to some type of agreement and calls back over to the young guy ""Hey Buddy! Come here a minute!"" So he walks over and the cook turns on a loud white noise machine and we can't hear what they're saying. After a lot of emphatic hand waving, head nodding &amp; shaking, and some frantic scribbling and erasing on a white board, the young man walks over to the rib line (which is pretty long at this point since no one's been serving ribs). Everyone in line does a triple-take as the man takes his place in line, and the whole line is now murmuring to each other trying to make sense of it all. Someone finally incredulously asks ""What could the cook *possibly* have said to you to convince you to eat after you already declined one single time?!?"" The man smiles and says ""Well you see, I'm a VEGAN and can't eat meat, so the cook had offered to clean off the grill and make me some scrambled eggs instead."" And one of the people in line says ""I didn't know they had scrambled eggs! I want that"". Others joined in ""Me too!"" ""I'll pay double!"" ""Triple!"" ""Money is no object!"" It was pandemonium. Another man stands in line with very puzzled look on his face. The line continues to swell as more people hear the rumor of scramble eggs and eventually all the Vegans at Ribfest make their way to the line. Finally, the puzzled man speaks up, ""Excuse me, I know this is none of my business, but do you mean vegetarian?"" The original white shirt guy gives his own puzzled look in return. So the puzzled man clarifies ""Well it's just that you said you're a vegan but you're about to eat eggs, which are an animal product - plus I think there's probably milk in it too if they're doing it right"" Someone else shouts ""And vanilla extract!"" And the puzzled guy says ""Yeah, maybe. But that's not an animal product. Anyways, I think maybe you meant vegetarian rather than vegan, since it sounds like you don't eat meat rather than all animal products?"" White shirt: ""Vegan, vegetarian, what's the difference?"" Puzzled guy: ""Um, well, I *just* explained the difference. You know what? Never mind; it's none of my business anyway."" Then someone pipes up ""Won't the egg mixture just run through the grill?"" ""Maybe they have a skillet?"" someone replied. 

After all the eggs were handed out everyone held hands and ate their eggs (with their faces pressed into the paper plates since they didn't have their hands free). It was the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed; people of all genders coming together and eating scramble eggs with their faces. I shed a single tear and clapped, a slow non-sarcastic clap.

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","&gt;No, you're playing word games. Either enslavement is the price of being saved, or the act of saving and the act of exploiting are separate. You can't have it both ways.

That's not how you've described the situation. If they offered him safety in exchange for becoming a slave, while he was floating through space, that would be a different issue. This would be the one case where the act of enslaving actually improves the situation.

&gt;Here you are not comparing exploitation with slavery, you are comparing selling with slavery. Selling someone an apple is not exploitation.

OK: You are starving and I sell you an apple for 100 000$. - I still improve your situation. 

&gt;Maintaining slavery requires constantly feeding, clothing and sheltering your slaves, so you are continuously improving their position. These acts are necessary to slavery, but slavery is not necessary to these acts.

Ah, but here's the rub! The only person who can judge the change in quality of the situation is the person themselves. If the upkeep produced an actual net improvement to the slave's situation, they would not need to be a slave - they would work voluntarily! The fact that a threat of violence is necessary to keep the slave working implies that maintaining slavery actually worsens their situation.

For slavery to be slavery (forced actions), a threat of force must be present. And this means that the slaver necessarily worsens the slave's situation to make them choose to work!",1506816016

I left a while ago, but comparing what we got to do, compared to what the militia got to do in the 1980's, it is why no wonder why no one wants to stay in anymore.

Guys I know that were in in the 80's talk about thousands of reservists being on exercises in the summer and thousands on exercise in the winter. M113s, Grizzly, Cougar and Husky armored vehicles, multiple artillery batteries, Air Force helicopters for infantry air assaults, air defense batteries, thousands of mortar rounds, the fucking FN, New MLVW's, Rambo tier amounts of M72's, parade squares that fit 1500 soldiers and full support battalions were normal things. Sometimes Reg force was fully/partially involved, sometimes they weren't.

Compared to now. 
Maybe 300 or 400 reservists will go one exercise if the Land Force Area can afford it that year. No M113's, no LAV's, Shit ass LSVW/Milverado/G-Wagon/MLVW vehicles. No artillery except the 4 forty year old field guns that the artillery platoons have in the whole province. Maybe the Air Force will be able to afford to send out 1 or 2 unarmed helicopters for a day or two. Maybe the medics will set up a tent if they can get enough members to go on exercise. The food will come from the base kitchen or will be MRE's because the service battalions are incapable of getting enough people or equipment to provide those services. Any M72 training will be 35mm training insert on a reused tube. Your unit and the exerciser run out of training rounds so you literally say ""Bang Bang"" when ""shooting"". Soldiers get encouraged to stay home on range qualification days because their units can't afford to qualify everyone on even the C7 let alone the machine guns.

That same parade square has crumbled so much that it could only parade two under strength platoons. The military can't afford to fix it, and there is no point in fixing it really. The reserves totally depend on the Regular force as well.


That and the older aged higher ranking NCO's that are just riding it out to top up their pension.


Reservists are part time. If you are going to attract high quality and talented people to the reserves, it has to be fun.

Rachel's someone I think who enjoys playing with people to a degree and is almost certainly a liar, yet is the thing with Frank because of something that happens, or are the feelings genuine, and what possesses her to betray Chloe? Or was it all misinterpreted by Frank or mis-sold as something more serious than it really was. Hard to say. 
So many questions. Team Chloe all the way though.

Weigl, Pulisic, Dahoud, Toljan, Auba who drew criticism here all get sub par marks from the German press as well as German readers at large.

IDK about that. I was skeptical about them but then a bunch of cucks got all huffy over the merger and left the Conservative parties and that made it all a lot more appealing in my eyes. Butt hurt cucks means there's a good chance of potential there. Of course nothing's certain in politics, there's always a chance of backstabbing kikery but I'm hopeful.

"gardening","t5_2qhkh","What will grow well depends in part on where you live - short season or long, coolish summers or blistering heat, etc. Probably want to factor that in.

Late afternoon sun tends to be strong so shade lovers like ferns might not be the best bet. The upside of afternoon sun is that it will support a wide variety of colorful plants: annuals like fancy trailing geraniums and sun resistant coleus (Trailing Plum is pretty and dependable http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/57816/) in hanging baskets. In pots, you could grow dwarf zinnias, dwarf to mid-height snapdragons, petunias in a zillion colors and patterns, and sun resistant impatience like SunPatiens (http://www.costafarms.com/plants/impatiens-sunpatiens) for color.

Something I tried for the first time this year that was super cute and unusual was dwarf eucomis or pineapple lilies. They grow from spring-planted bulbs in half day sub and look great from June into fall. Very unusual and whimsical.

"LibertarianDebates","t5_2tvku","Prior to IP there were trade secrets that protected innovators from competition. Heck, many candy companies still have trade secrets today rather than patents. The idea isn't that IP protects competition, as competition would be fine without it. The issue is that IP provides other benefits besides rent seeking to innovators, advantages that aren't talked about.

Imagine modern medicine with trade secrets. There's no way for it to work. How would you provide studies if the methodology and composition couldn't be known by third parties? NDAs are a modest solution but everyone has a price. Patents means the mode of action of a medicine is out in the open so it can *immediately* begin benefiting future science.

Trade secrets are also, well, secrets. It incentivizes industrial espionage which is usually damaging and illegal and harmful.

However IP as it currently exists has flaws. Right now the incentive is not to get a patent and get back to inventing because it is more profitable to get a patent and use it as a bludgeon to sue for damages and prevent others from innovating. Inventing and progress must wait on the patent to expire which does more harm to innovation than the patent protects. ",1506816027

Generally any money made on reserve usually stays among the council and their families.  I feel sorry for those people.  I used to live in North Western Ontario and man they got the short end of the stick from both the government and their own people who were supposed to be their ""leaders"".

Many weren't allowed to drink on the res so usually once a month when the cheques came in they'd drive to the nearest town that had an LCBO, Beer Store, and Walmart/major grocery store and just clear the places out.  Two things wouldn't be uncommon to see at the local hotels/motels in town at the end of the month A. Pick up trucks full of food/supplies/etc and drunk/passed out natives everywhere.  

Naturally they couldn't get TOO drunk (many of the young ones would) otherwise they ran the risk of someone nosey person who lived in town (in small towns everyone knew everyone even if they lived on the res) to call the council leaders and rat on some poor drunk native kid.  

Add to the fact that they would jack up the prices on all the food/supplies on the res because a lot of times the council leaders were in league with either the airline that would fly the stuff in or the companies that would truck the stuff in and get a cut of the profit from that.

"mvci","t5_3httl","It's a couple of different things:

I could be mistaken here, but in the traditional fighting game sense:

1. Tech = ""Throw Tech'ing"" or breaking and/or escaping a throw.  You'll usually hear the word ""throw"" closely associated with the word tech to seperate it from the second definition:

2. Tech = short for ""Technology"" or a method, strategy, or technique for dealing with a particular situation.  It's slang and doesn't really mean anything specifically but you'll hear it used in a phrase such as:

""Did you see that new reality stone-Spiderman tech?!  You know, the 'tech' where he can keep looping the freeze into web ball over and over again into massive combo damage.""

Finally, I'm not a Smash/Melee player but I think ""tech"" means something slightly different there where it has more to do with ones ability to do certain (difficult) techniques on the pad.  Usually it follows closely with the second definition above, and contextually it usually make sense, but at times it could mean something slightly different.

Tl;dr -- it's generally the second definition unless the word ""throw"" is used closely to the word ""Tech""",1506816030

It wasn't that I thought hijab is oppressive and backwards. 
It wasn't that I denied that it's an obligation in Islam. 
It wasn't that I wanted to dress in a way that would arouse men. 
It wasn't that I didn't pray and had practically no personal relationship with Allah. 
It wasn't that I had big sins I wasn't ready to let go of yet and felt it would be hypocritical to wear hijab. 
It wasn't that I had no knowledge of Islam. 
It was simply that I was afraid...

Afraid of people's reactions, afraid of being treated differently (I know how they think about Islam and Muslims), afraid of having less chances etc. I *hated* myself for apparently fearing people more than Allah, but it was just extremely difficult for me. I can't really explain how hard it was. It was a form of social anxiety/phobia and it took me years to finally be able to take the step. The tears I dropped in those years could probably fill a pool. The struggle was real, that's all I'm saying. But people don't see that. They just see your public sin and judge you based on that.

This was *my* personal struggle with hijab, but other girls can have different issues with hijab. Or they do wear hijab but have different struggles. Everybody sins, but they sin differently. I know a lot of people struggle with praying on time, porn addiction, masturbation, boyfriends/girlfriends, gambling, drinking, whatever. Some feel guilty about it and others don't.

Consider this code:

If low=0 and high=4 (because there are 5 items in the array), this will set low equal to 1 + whatever **value** is in the middle of the array.  It could be 655, if the input was {0, 11, 655, 765, 888}.  You don't want low=656, you want low=3.

See the difference?

That mistake is in both your recalculation of low and of high.

"AQW","t5_2t0la","Right now you should catch up with the 7 deadly dragons. Get Key of ""insert dragon name here"" from each dragon and finish all story quest in /battleundere. Then do the first quest from a glowing LED dragon and pick up the drop. They would later release items for those who possess the 7 keys and the quest drop. 

If you're looking to farm xp and gold, /battleground is the best place. 

For weapons, get the doomblade of destruction. It's worth getting it considering the dmg and xp, rep, and gold boost it gives you. Probably the only weapon in game with these boosts combined in one weapon.

If you haven't been on for 4-5 years, then I assume you missed finishing 13 lord of chaos. It's an interesting storyline so I would recommend completing it.

Other than that, aqw is packed with adventures and new items, so keep in track with the news, and patch notes. Also use your map to keep track of the storyline. It would help big time. Hope this helps.

"mobilelegends","t5_3gvmo","Haha thanks!Very honoured to have so many questions ahahahaha.

NEVER SOLOQ.The people there are stupid and will waste your time.They don't even know the meta right now which is full of mages,and they keep insisting on playing mm which is just stupid.

Many high elo players play in their teams (say 5 man)but personally I don't.In fact I don't really play with my squad but with other friends from other squads.But in my squad there is a whatsapp group and you can just ask for someone and then play tgt haha.

I don't plan I just play when I feel like playing.

I got it one day before the season ended.Personally i don't recommend gaming so much to 600 because the only good thing u get out of it is ""bragging rights""/""self-fulfilment""but to be honest ..
-Nobody really cares how many stars u have 
-You will never feel happy because there will always be someone higher than you.

I had to spend ALOT of time(luckily it was holidays).I only played hard in the last month of the season.I climbed from 200 to 600 in one month lol.


Advice ermmm....Don't feel nervous if you meet Top squads.Because they are human and they make mistakes in game and can lose sometimes.They have high stars but stars aren't really a good indicator of skill.ive seen 200 star legends beat a 5 man team all above 1k stars so yeah.

Try to go for a trio q with your friends.One of the 3 people must play critical roles in the team like mages or assasin in case pubs can't carry.(most of the time they can't).If you get first pick,do choose what's currently in the meta.When I played trio there was a time I won 30 straight rank games in a row so yea.

Duo is a little more risky in my opinion as there will be 3 heavy people that u have to carry.

5 man is hard since there are a lot of pros who are playing in 5 man teams so personally I stay away from it.But it can be great if your squad has a lot of experience together.

Always try to improve and ask yourself what you could have don't better whenever you die.Maybe your Friend typed ""enemy missing in action""and you thought meh they may be farming but then u get ganked.

This is a little weird but personally i feel if you play in the wee hours of the morning,that is the most optimal time to raise stars because there are many noobs at that time.It sounds funny but without it I wouldn't be at 600 LOL.

And lastl but not least,don't be addicted to the game.I see many of my friends above 400 stars who play overnight until 7am and then have to go to work.You should know your priorities and not waste your life for a number that means shit.

In the next season I will retire as I feel that I'm too addicted and I have better things to focus on.Aft getting 600 stars I'm abit sick of ranked games haha.
I won't go for it because there are a lot of things to sacrifice to gain it so yea

Happy to ans your qns:)

And one day I was done. I didn't want to drug myself to get through life, to even get through a day. Life was more than that. So I quit my job and stopped taking my meds. Found something else I preferred to do and never looked back.

Are you happy with your program that you are in? Are you happy with where you live and the direction your life is heading? Think hard about that. Especially if you can't even study on the weekends. I recall only doing that on weekends because I was so exhausted during the week.

Weekends are supposed to rejuvenate you. Be a time to relax and catch up on 'you time'. Maybe you aren't loving yourself enough?

I still suggest that you get up, shower, and get dressed on the weekends. Perhaps at least go for a walk to get out of the house. And definitely keep your therapy appointment. It always helps to talk to someone else.

And he was featured prominently in a lot of the promotion for the season.

So I think it's more of a backlash because people feel like he's transparently being fed to them as the face of the season. And maybe there's an impression that he's aware of his archetype and he's playing it up to get screen time and become a big character.

In an ideal world you would have a good chunk of change saved up for life after the corps and use that to pay for CC Courses and you would crash at your parents place. Once your done with your Core Classes and begin your transfer to a University and start using your GI bill. If you apply for FAFSA you can also opt to do a work study which gives you a chance to work &lt;20 hours per week at the University as a side job. Being a MCWIS you should be able to land a life guard job no problem. 


Paying for Community College with the GI Bill can seem like a waste if you can pay for it out of pocket. But if you dont have a choice then it can be a lifesaver.

"AsiansGoneWild","t5_2wm0g","So yeah. Late last year I was travelling through Japan with some friends of mine (I tend to goto Japan for a few weeks every year) 

On this occasion I met this lovely 38 year old woman named Hiroko at a cocktail bar in Kyoto. I noticed her looking my way a few times but I couldn't tell if it was good or bad because, well I'm a bigger guy and in Japan it's already a big disadvantage lol 

With the power of a little liquid courage I managed to walk past her as I went to the to the bar and as I walked back I managed to make a little joke about the drink she had (wish I did in English, that could've been a waste of time lol) thankfully she saw the humor to it and asked where I am from 

So we sat and spoke for a bit, found out she actually visited my city with her now ex husband a few years ago. So we already had some common ground. In the middle of chatting causally we were making cheeky jabs at each other too so I could tell there was something there. Her girlfriends arrived and so we exchanged Line IDs and went our seperate ways.

Now I didnt think this would go anywhere, because I was going to Osaka the next day. But we spoke for a couple days on Line before she asked me straight up if I wanted to spend some time with her on the weekend. Of course I jumped at the opportunity and booked us an Airbnb.

She caught the train in from Kyoto and she was wearing this cute little outfit that and a little bow tie lol but she made it look cute. We headed back the Airbnb where wow it had an incredible view of Osaka Castle. 

We sat down on the couch to rest our feet and she didnt waste much time. She told me she was excited because she had never been with a ""western man"" before (whether thats true or not, i dont give a shit) and went straight to unzipping my pants and reaching into grab my cock. With a smile on her face she looked and me and said ""very big"" (now for record, she's clear fan servicing. Im not overly big in that area at all. Probably just abit over average in length, pretty girthy though)

She told me stand up and when i did she ripped my pants down and got to her knees infront of me and started service my cock. Her gorgeous dark eyes staring up at me while she tried her best to deep throat my cock was mind blowing. Not only this, she was very attentive to my sensitive spots and would torture me with them and giggle at the sight of me shaking. 

After I came I was hard again a few minutes later and ready to feel her little Japanese pussy. She layed out on the bed and I got the tip of my cock slightly in before she pushed me back and told me no! No..no? I couldnt understand, she then smirked and stood up and whispered in my earth ""you must wait"" she got dressed and told me to get my clothes on too because she wanted to have dinner.

I stood there with my throbbing cock, confused and aroused haha this woman was teasing the fuck out of me and I loved it. So we went back out for a couple of hours and had dinner before heading back to the airbnb. The whole time all I could think about we fucking her brains out, I think this is exactly what she wanted.

We finally get back. She has a shower straight away and tells me to have one after her. After mine, i come out and see her on the bed wearing thigh highs and nothing else. They were pinching in her skin ever so much that it caused a slight dimple in the skin, so hot!

She sits down on the bed and gestures me over and stops me when im leaning down to kiss her. She puts her hand on my head and pushes me down so i am level with her pussy and demands me to eat it and you bet I did. Her pussy tasted incredible and I could tell from sliding a finger into her pussy that it was gonna be tough when my cock was going to enter.

After willingly complying to her demands and eating her pussy she told me that i had waited long enough and now i was allowed to enter her. We started with her on her back and her holding her legs back. It took abit of work and some lube, but that moment of penetration where her eyes shut tight, mouth gasped, head back and hands gripped the blanket beneath her is an image and feeling i'll never forget.

I had to work her tight pussy slowly to begin with though and as she became more used to my girth she started to push against me and as my cock pushed a little further in each time she would let out a sigh. When we finally worked it in and we could build up a good rhythm it was amazing. This gorgeous Japanese woman taking my cock and shaking and one put she was moaning so hard i could see a vessel form on her forehead before she finally gasped for air and let go of the blankets.

After seeing her let go i decided to lean down and scoop her up. Her legs dangling over my arms and i held onto her cute little ass. She put her arms around my neck and held on while I pounded fuck out of her pussy but she could only handle this for a couple of minutes because it was beginning to hurt.

So I placed her back onto the bed on all fours and teased her pussy and clit from behind with my cock before slowling re-entering her incredible pussy. With her thrust in she would push back. Her ass was the tight little thing but enough meat for me to grab a handful with each hand and pound away her. 

There was a moment I looked up and realised how cool everything was about this too as i looked out the window and saw osaka castle lit up and i stopped for a moment, still inside her and told her to look too. She shared the same enthusiasm of how cool this experience was. We went back to push each others sexual limits and fucking like animals for the rest of night.

We lazed around in bed together the next morning before we had a couple more rounds of sex and then check out. We got brunch. Went to some cool bamboo forest and shrines. We said our goodbyes and that was that. We still keep in touch but we are both busy. Hopefully when I'm in Japan next we'll be able to hook up again :)",1506816050

I cringe that they're drinking while on medication. That's extremely risky behavior with antidepressants because you're giving two types of mood changing drugs.

I don't know anything about stroke meds but I can't see that being a greenlight on consuming ethynol, which is the scientific name of alcohol.

I would bring it up very delicately and with a heaping amount of support. An unexpected job change after 30 years is a very stressful thing to happen. It's right up there with school, marriage, and funerals. Being depressed is hard and requires a lot of unrequited support.  Try doing activities or planned days where you spend most of the day together. 

Even with the best intentions they aren't going to change unless they want to.

"doujinshi","t5_2rmkc","Please I really need to find this.

I'm looking for a doujin where There's a guy that tells his friend he's going to confess to a girl. Then the guy is alone in a coffee shop and the girl is the barista. He orders a coffee and tries to make small talk, from time to time the girl goes to the kitchen were he can't see her.

We see that the girl goes out from the back exit and has sex with the guy's friend. She knows that the guy wants to confess to her and she wants to be with him. The friend comes inside her so he uses an special cork-like thing to close her pussy so the semen doesn't come out, he promises to remove it when the guy confesses.

As time passes, the guy doesn't confess, the girl keeps coming out and the friend fucks her ass.

In the end she can't take it anymore and she leaves the guy hanging asking the friend to remove the cork and fuck her.

The doujin ends with the friend lamenting that the guy never confessed, and that he would definitely enjoy her while the girl is filled with semen on all holes and discarded on the ground.

The doujin also had a mini 2 pages story at the beginning where the girl has sex with the friend in a fitting room at a clothing story.

I'm in engineering, so my use of terminology is definitely different from how scientific fields use it, and there's differences even among fields of science. I was thinking that 'data' is almost like a unit of measurement. How much data supports a proposition/theory is often a measure of its likely accuracy. So in this way I wish it were standardized so we could use data vocabulary to communicate how much confidence we have. Saying ""we have datum supporting it"" should be higher confidence than ""we have data supporting it"". But obviously context would make this apparent most of the time.

People also did interpret Daniel, and Revelation for thinking the end times were in the 70s-80s because of the cold war.

Yet you kinda further compounded the point of my post: you happily embrace things that are fully supportive of your view, and stop caring, or ignore everything you dislike. 


I would seriously suggest recognizing that your side in anything may not be perfect, and that you need to take on challenging views otherwise you risk falling into the same trap that the FSA fell into where they became so full of hatred and willing blindness to the evil that claimed to support their revolution, that they allowed themselves to be so distanced from reality that none saw how the evil had long usurped their cause.

Is it justified for you to be lied to, and to completely believe their lies, then stop caring about this the moment you find out the person who committed this murder was on the side that you support, and to disregard how people exploited your anger for their own gain? ",1506816058

"Empaths","t5_2zhl2","I'm a seamstress, do mostly costuming and reenactment garb. Being an empath in this line of work is incredibly helpful because most people know what they want, but have zero idea how to put words to the vision in their heads. Just through conversation  (in person, of course!), I can get a solid feel for my clients' costuming desires. They seem to think it's magic that I ""just get them."" :)  Oddly enough, I'm certain my empath abilities also translate into an ability to make things that fit perfectly the first time they try them on.

(Just a note: I did *not* go to school for fashion design or tailoring. I'm self-taught.)

Anyway, the point here is that your coworker doesn't necessarily need to go into typical ""healer"" type work. If she enjoys working with her hands and being creative, there are jobs that involve working with the public *and* creative activities. Interior design, home remodeling, custom sewing, commissioned art... heck, even designer cakes. And, if her parents are dead-set on her going to college, these are all things that she can get an Associate or Bachelor degree in.

"OpTicGaming","t5_2xpuo","2) Mechanics is basically reaction time similar to gun skill.  All that you listed is relevant with one additional important note.  In Dota you acquire two resources: gold and experience.  You get these resources in three ways, killing creeps, killing enemy heroes, and killing towers.  In the early game killing creeps is the most important way to get these resources. The mid lane is as close at it gets to a fair fight (its a neutral lane not closer to either teams base and historically was played as a 1v1 contest) so there is a lot of contesting over last hits (also known as CS).  So people that find success in the mid lane tend to have really good reactions to win these 1v1s.  Also a lot of mid heroes are ""flashy"" with fast movement based abilities.  So you usually want your most mechanically talented player located there.

3) The offlaner is probably the most vulnerable (its sometimes called the hard lane) since you are usually playing 1 vs 2 or 3 heroes.  But mid and the mid tower are often a very important early advantage and the focus of a lot of action early on in the game.  Since you can teleport to towers and they give vision the mid tower (with its neutral central location) is a very important objective to open up space on the opponents side of the map.

Recently the ""new meta"" has been the position 4 player sitting mid, turning mid into a duel lane vs its historical 1v1.  The nice thing about Dota is that there aren't really fixed positions for how you set up your lanes.  Every team will send 1 hero to each lane, but what you do with your two supports depends on draft and strategy.  You can go aggro and send them all to the offlane, you can have 1 in the safe lane and 1 roam, etc.  

4) Depends on the team, a lot of times coaches in Dota are picked up right before a LAN since they are often pro players that didn't qualify for the LAN.  For instance Pajkatt was the coach of DC during their TI6 2nd place run (Misery's team) since his team wasn't able to qualify.",1506816061

But seeing how much of a minor player Robbie was in Thanos Imperative I really don't mind that much if all of that was changed, especially considering where I think Duggan is going with Robbie.

That said Duggan mentioned this issue is going to be heartbreaking, and I think we're also suppose to find out who Talonar is in this issue (if not we will know before October ends), coupled with the fact that ot might be the reunion between Rich and Peter, yeah I'm preparing for a tearjerker (and going by his Deadpool run Duggan can do depressing scenes).

It doesn't really come out that much, cause her subtitles normally just drop ""g""s from ""ing"" and turns you/your to ya/yer. She also uses a lot of Yiddish, which is much more common in New York. 

Granted, I've never been to New York, so I was mostly just listening to and miming speakers and stereotypical New Yorker characters. If anybody's got some Brooklynisms, slam them in my inbox. 

I guess I could have her target lines back saying that she doesn't know where this ""America"" city is, but later Marionette calls her a Westerner, which means Aimee can't have already corrected her. I don't mind finding a way to make this dialogue work, but I think we'll need to collaborate a bit.

The only thing mythic only raid rules do is limit the number of people who can do it and the only reason people defend it is because they don't want to lose their epeen when puggers start clearing it faster than guilds do.

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","I was also overweight going into pregnancy, and I lost weight both pregnancies during the first half. I finally stabilized at the same weight as my last visit at my 20 week appointment. I think I followed the same trend last time, but I still only gained a net 7 pounds when my 7 pound baby was delivered. But she was 7 pounds 5 ounces at 38 weeks and perfectly healthy. She always measured on track, and my doctor never said anything negative. I also went on to gain all the baby weight from stress and comfort eating postpartum. :/ Really, if your baby is growing well and your doctor isn't worried, especially if you have fat stored up, weight gain isn't strictly necessary. You and baby both will be fueled off your stored fat (which is the purpose of it). You just really want to make sure you're getting enough calcium (baby will leach it straight out of your bones if you're not getting enough from your diet). And keep up on your prenatal vitamin.

So my appetite is pretty small. I just can't eat much at a sitting and loading up at meals isn't an option for me. Figure out healthy, reasonably energy dense foods you can snack on through the day like nuts and cheese, fruits and veggies. I like to nibble on beef jerky sometimes or peanut butter.

"FireEmblemHeroes","t5_3imv0","It's amazing how TA3 gets so much subjective praise.

But on topic RobinF's defensive stats are better than Indigo due to her physical bulk, Indigo requires lots of work to make work in dealing with the more advanced players with heavy merged BLyn's and Reinhardts, which are really common personally. Compared to RobinF who with a few merges can counter +10 opposition running double goads and hone.

Indigo requires bowbreaker (or lots of spurs) to kill a BLyn that runs Mulagir. Ignoring defensive battles, at neutral atk, a simple +6 atk from any source (Ex. Hone/Ally Support) is enough for Indigo to kill a BLyn running Brave Bow, this of course changes dramatically if they run fortify as well. 

The simplest way for Indigo to deal with Blyn is bow breaker, which comes at an expense for some in the form of WoM or GTB.

Meta Reinhardt's running QP/DB/DB3/Moonbow with 1 hone and goad can still kill a unmerged RES Indigo not running buffs, requiring +3~5 res to handle hone x1goad/x2 goads, which can be simply Fort Res1 Seal+Ally Support+HP/Res Seal on Indigo.

tl;dr unmerged Indigo will help against unmerged opposition like a prince charming. But against more invested teams, not so much without severe buff work, you'll probably sacrifice something to fit him to do his job when he needs to pull the weight of his intended roll.

The blue bouncer murders his first form and with the smoke dash, you can dash through him as he charges so you don't need to worry about the ducks. 

Switch to the shotgun for the second part. That murders the dogs. The key hear is to kill this part right AFTER the second train so you don't have to worry about that when his third form appears. 

For the third you get under him and use the blue lob shot. You can dash through his green horse shoe attacks if you happen to be in front of him. 

For the last form use the blue lobber. Also use your super attack right as the teacups are descending. Stay on the teacup and shoot. Once he spawns those green guys drop to the middle and kill a couple and hop back up to the teacups and let the train kill the other two. ",1506816068

As a coach, I'm not a huge advocate of those kneeling during the anthem, but I also respect their right to do it.  The right to a peaceful protest is what makes this country great.

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","Thanks! I briefly looked into accordion tables earlier, and also noticed that it's possible to insert them in Dreamweaver. Is it a good idea to do that, then modify the code or should I start with some other sample code?

Also - an issue I had when playing around with accordion tables was that I couldn't collapse all panels simultaneously, and was forced to have exactly one expanded at all times. Can this behaviour be changed so that they all start collapsed and only expand/collapse when clicked?

Would it be reasonable to put an accordion table inside another? Cause it seems to me like I'd have to to achieve two levels as intended. While we're at it, would it be possible to dynamically add panels to both levels based on the imported data (mentioned in point 3 in the OP)?

Lastly; how flexible are accordion tables when it comes to styling? I'm a little picky when it comes to design.

"twinpeaks","t5_2rodn","I, too, spent a great deal of time trying to figure out what the Roadhouse characters had to do with the main story. I thought they had to tie into Audrey because of the ""Billy"" and ""Tina"" connections. Alas, we are left with no resolution on this, just like we are left with no resolution on Audrey whatsoever.

I think your instincts are good, but that you are being too specific and literal with these scenes. Someone already posted the Lynch quote saying that the Roadhouse vignettes were never meant to be anything other than ""slice-of-life"" moments in the town of Twin Peaks, with no connection to the larger story. What I do think they connect to are the themes of awakening and duality. The show gives us many clues that we are watching two worlds, and that awakening is the key to crossing from one to the other.

In my opinion, the Roadhouse is a junction point between worlds. Anyone seen in the Roadhouse is not awakened in the beginning of TP, and awakens by the end.

* Audrey is the most obvious
* James was in an accident and is ""quiet"" now
* Shelly is trapped in the same self-destructive cycle of being with terrible men

The random bar conversations are part of this same routine. Whether it's drugs or insanity or infidelity, the people are all trapped in some kind of cage. When they awaken, they will be gone from the Roadhouse forever, just like Audrey.

Richard was probably trapped by his own evil heart, hence his appearance at the Roadhouse. But unlike the others, he didn't get a chance to awaken. He just got killed.",1506816071

Thanks for the reply! 

I think that even in books that feature primarily or solely non-human characters the main scope would still fall under sociology, since it is impossible to be completely divorced from our own humanity. It would then be a view of humanity through an alien lens, but still a human view by necessity. Because if it were to be fully alien then there would be nothing for a human reader to identify themselves with. 

In the seminal ""The Dance of the Changer and Three"" by Terry Carr the only human character is the narrator who tries to explain this fully alien story to a human audience and coming to the conclusion that the story must be taken as is, because they are alien any human interpretation of this story that is so important to this alien culture must always fall flat because we cannot ever completely understand their psychology. 

The Dance of the Changer and Three teaches us that whatever we do, we will always be locked inside our own skulls, viewing the universe through human eyes.

I wanted to give you another site that has been paying me and I was able to withdraw my earnings on a daily basis and the transactions are quick too! The company is called BitPetite and the concept is great! Below are few details of what they have going on and I also received a newsletter from them that they will be expanding their investment options so, I think this site is not a scam but like all HYIP's, withdraw your monies on a daily basis. So far, I have earned over $100 and have only been in it for 2 weeks. I usually test the waters first before I invest a bit more and with that said, I will be investing into LiteCoin. 2 investment options: 147% after 6 weeks and 180% after 9 weeks. Interest: 3.97% on working days and 1.00% on weekends. Minimum deposit: 0.005 BTC. Refund of the principal along with interest payments. Withdrawal minimum: 0.005 BTC or $10. Payment methods: Bitcoin or USD equivalent. Affiliate program: 10%-5%-2%. Here's the link to join this opportunity and like I always say, I am not a financial adviser thus, you are investing into these things at your own risk. But as for me, what is life without taking some small risk? Invest small and see what you think but I honestly can tell you it's worked for me thus far.

But then she'd say Rex Tillerson is a billionaire, blah, blah, blah so Trump can't be trusted to keep his word on that. 

But you're asking them to redefine who they are. They've labelled themselves as liberals, and that comes with all sorts of positive associations for them that proves to themselves that they are a good person. If they let that go, they are now a bad person according to their ideology. So they need to not only see the hypocrisy and lies and failures of progressivism, but they need pointing out, for example, that African American working poor will fare better with less illegal aliens taking jobs for low pay, etc. Or that the welfare state incentivizes fathers not living with their children, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and delinquency.

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

I see a bit more actual substance to some of his claims than you do, clearly.

I agree with you, the hate crime law doesn't seem to me like a slippery slope to anything. I do agree with his proposition that you cannot codify into law preferred pronoun usage. I would never intentionally misgender someone, and I would do my best to use whatever pronoun a person prefers, but I do not want to live in a society where it's a crime if I get that wrong. I think there is reasonable room for discussion about where compassion and function meet on something like that.

I don't agree with his stance on the nuclear family and by association his criticism of other models of being. I think the nuclear family is a model that works for many people, but I know in point of fact that it does not work for many others. I think people should be free to do what they see fit. I know of no evidence that suggests gay adoption is in any way inferior to straight adoption. I wasn't aware he had made statements to that affect, but it doesn't totally surprise me that he did.

I agree that we should encourage people to embrace their gender and sexuality as fluid. More freedom and more ability to be true to one's reality is good. 

But I agree with him that there is an anti-science and anti-discourse bent to some of the present political climate on the left. I'm squarely in the left on the American political spectrum, but I sense more and more that there is a tendency to dismiss anything, whether an idea, a study, or a person, that conflicts with progressive views as so self-evidently wrong, ignorant, and hateful as to not even deserve consideration. I sense that even in myself sometimes, and I don't like it. Some things are self-evidently wrong, ignorant, and hateful. But the vast majority of things about which people disagree are not that way. I don't see a lot of people on either side who seem interested in increasing the level of nuance to their opinions. I also feel that there is a chilling effect in much of public discourse. I don't even like the guy, but by merely talking about him and not just bashing him, I feel like I'm likely to get downvotes. I don't care about internet points, but I do think there's pressure to agree or be silent. That would just be one exceedingly silly example. The left does it to the right. The right does it to the left. That's probably always been so. But I feel increasingly the far left does it to people who basically share their goals.

I studied a fair bit of postmodern philosophy in school, which I admit was several years ago now. I kind of agree with his characterization of its issues and flaws (basically that its claims are true only in the abstract and claims that cannot be functionally applied should be treated as false, even if not logically falsifiable- like, for instance, solipsism). I do not share his opinion that the whole thing has an underlying ulterior motive of destroying Western civilization. I would be interested specifically in your take on where he strays regarding postmodern philosophy, because it's been a while for me.

I think certain academic disciplines are rather corrupt. I'm open to discussion about a lot of things, but it's wild to me that a Yale professor more or less got run out of town for questioning whether cultural appropriation is for real. Cultural appropriation, microaggressions, patriarchy, white privilege, rape culture... I think there's real, honest to God truth in this stuff, but when I really think about the world I live in, I have trouble swallowing some of it whole hog without adding at least a pinch of nuance. And if a professor at an institution can lose their job for trying to do so, how can anyone else? Shouldn't we want to know the truth about those things? Doesn't that require critical reflection?

And, for the Christianity piece, I think he makes an excellent observation (or takes one, anyway, from Dostoevsky and Neitzsche). The erosion of that as a unifying force has increased the chaos in societies. But I don't share his pessimism or resentment about it. Our society is more plural. I think the Christian tradition gave societies a toolkit. I believe that any tools from that kit that still have value will be retained, and to hell with the rest. But I don't disagree with his notion (and this was more or less Neitzsche's take) that you can toss out bad tools from Christianity, and perhaps we must, but that doesn't mean you immediately have replacements that work better. I believe we'll find them, but I do think the twentieth century had it's share of nihilism, and I do think that even today people struggle to find purpose and it can harm them. I don't mourn Christianity, and I assume we'll figure that out, but it's fair to say that, absent an externally imposed value system, people struggle to create an internal one. That's a real phenomenon in my opinion.

This is self-publishing. You literally could self-publish a book on Amazon in ten minutes. And then there are services which you pay to publish your book, like the one OP used. This form of publishing is as open and easy as it gets. If your GF wants to hold her own book in her hand, she could do it, for a price. Traditional publishing is long and hard and discouraging. When I got my first short story published in an anthology you could go to the store and buy, I cried. It was the end result of a long and hard road. I've recently finished my second full-length novel (the first one I'm trying to sell) and it's been two months of mostly rejections. But that's the game. You have to find that right agent. And then they have to find that right publisher, and so on, and three years from now I might be able to walk into a store and buy my book. ",1506816085

If it gets to a point where you don't have at least one of the basic deck archetypes (like no aggro deck) you have a metagame that has warped around that dominant strategy.

There have been many cases of that happening in Vintage over the past 10 years. Legacy too: Mystical Tutor in ANT and Survival of the Fittest are great examples of this happening.",1506816087

A pipe dream but I'd love to see a Provy - Gudas top pair, a Morin - Ghost second pair, and a Manning - Hagg third pair but I also don't think that will happen.

I also extra-agree with getting Sanheim top pairing minutes in the AHL because he should be a top four next year assuming he uses this year to iron out the last of his defensive game. Manning is a UFA next year and I doubt we resign him.",1506816087

My guess is Jews usurped a God from Sumerian mythology to be their patron God like Catholics have patron saints.

Long answer, Norovirus is extremely contagious. Just a few parts per million can make you violently ill. You can also get reinfected over and over. Which is what happened to DS and I. 

DS was ok during the day but in the middle of the night he would wake up sick. He has autism so when he would get sick he would panic and try to out run the projectile vomiting. Every night he would run through the house projectile vomiting at least once. Every room in the house was covered in vomit except my daughter's. My bed, his bed, the couch, the arm chairs, my bookshelf, nothing was left untouched. I would spend hours cleaning every night.

He woke me up one night by puking in my face.

As you can imagine, it took a long time for the kid and I to shake it. Surprisingly, DH and DD never got sick.

EDIT: also he refused to take any meds at this point so I couldn't get anti nausea meds down him. He always ate and drank well, he was pretty much normal all day. He would just wake up every night and spend an hour or 2 puking.",1506816091

"SpaceXLounge","t5_3eye9","I'm hoping that SpaceX makes fuel costs a major capital concern in the development &amp; testing of the BFR.  The only company I've ever heard had that as a major issue was Armadillo Aerospace, where I heard that fuel was about a third of their capital costs in the development of the Mod vehicle that they used in the Lunar Lander Challenge.  That was a whole lot of actual flying time for the vehicle, and it showed in the end with a very sturdy and reliable vehicle.  It is also something pretty common in terms of research teams doing VTOL rocket research to have a whole lot of flights.

That is something you have the luxury to do when you have a reusable vehicle.... which fortunately the BFR is going to be.  It wouldn't surprise me if there were over a thousand flights (perhaps just suborbital) before any passengers ever went on board.

I'm hoping that the constellation will start going up before the BFR is ready for revenue service with satellites, but that certainly is a possibility too.  I really want to see a bunch of videos [just like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXdjxPY2j_0) with the BFR in the meantime.",1506816094

If I could relive just one day, it would be a day in July of last year when after more than 25 years I sat down to have lunch with my best childhood friend. We talked about all that had happened over the many years in-between. He looked so different. If you saw him walking down the street, his old clothes, his long tangled and unwashed hair, nearly all his exposed skin covered in tattoos and a cigarette hanging from his mouth, you'd have wanted to avoid him. He looked like an absolute badass who might just be completely and unpredictably violent. Except that's not who he really was on the inside. He was still the same kind and thoughtful guy I knew from my childhood. He'd had more than his fair share of misfortune. Some of it was his fault and some wasn't but he owned every bit of it. He never blamed anyone but himself. When I asked him how he manages it all he said, ""It's my life. What else can I do?""

Afterwards we said our goodbyes and went our separate ways, back to our families and our lives. I was so happy to have reconnected with him and I thought we'd continue to be a part of each other's lives for many years to come.  A month later, he died unexpectedly and all alone of a heart attack. Oh how I wish I could have spent more time with him. I just didn't know there wasn't any time left.",1506816097

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I was in a relationship with a guy for two years, we lived together and everything. Long story short, he wasn't the guy for me and I broke up with him and moved back in with my parents. I totally didn't expect his reaction, I thought he would shrug and pretend he didn't care. He did care. He cried his eyes out and begged me to stay, asked me over and over to please stay and give him one more chance. Even clung to me and kept saying please please please, I'll do everything different! It was the hardest thing I had to do in my life, walking away and purposely hurting someone to save my own happiness. It was the hardest but also the best decision I have ever made. It has been years since then and I'm sure he had a hard time at first. There was just nothing I could do for him, every conversation we had just gave him hope we would be okay again. I'm glad he could rely on his parents for support. I felt so guilty at first, especially because I started dating someone new a lot earlier than him. However years later we are both in relationships with different people who suit us much better. I honestly think he would agree now that it was for the best. This was my personal anecdote, I hope it gives you hope that down the line everything will be okay üòä the heavy feeling and the guilt will lessen over time, you are not responsible for his happiness. You are not obligated to stay with him so he is comfortable. Sending you strength and happiness and if you want to talk I'm here! ",1506816098

And unfortunately Blizzard has kind of left us hanging in the ""so what the hell is Sylvanas doing now"" category, so as consumers of the story, we are left to make sense of our place in it. (As you can tell, I'm thinking of this in the larger sense of the overall story and how my actions fit into it, not just some dude sitting at a computer). Of all the Horde races, the Tauren have perhaps the least checkered past, in terms of unprovoked violence or delving into black magic fuckery. It just seems... false that my tauren shaman, with his own history and the history of his race, would willingly follow Sylvanas.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Yes, you are an asshole.

You had one job to do.  Feed the dog and cat.

They trusted you with a key to their home to do that job.  Instead of doing just that, you went through all the corners of their home and figuratively rubbed your scent in it.

You showed that you have no consideration or respect for your adult son and his adult wife and their decisions about their life.  Had you been considerate, you would have offered to do a deep cleaning, listing out the things that you could do for their home.  This could have been done through a phone call or a text message and you should wait for an answer before doing anything else.  

I am very leery that you say you organized.  By that, did you straighten up a pile of papers on the table?  Or did you rearrange cupboards and furniture?  If your cleaning included more than squaring away a pile of papers so they are not on the verge of falling off the pile, you overstepped big time.  By the way your son described your actions and called you presumptuous and controlling, I suspect you did a lot more than cleaning surfaces that were dirty, other than doing laundry.

If you wanted to help, you need to ask in what form they would accept your help.  You don't barge in and start doing things without their knowledge and consent.

I have a followup question for you?  Did you keep the key or did you give it back?  If you didn't give it back (why not?), have you USED the key without their prior knowledge?  If you've used the key, you are more than an asshole very much deserving of the cold shoulders thrown your way.",1506816099

Sandmeh is horrible. He had a purpose in the Liberty Way event this past spring. You would catch him and then crank for the Sand Suit to fuse him into Mr. Sandmeh.

Ces ≈ìuvres m'ont permis de r√©fl√©chir plus loin, de mieux comprendre l'immense univers de Tolkien, au-del√† de ce que j'aurais pu m'imaginer. Je n'√©coute pas les paroles, je les vis, je vie les personnages dont ils chantent l'histoire.
Je les chantonne √©galement tr√®s souvent, peut-√™tre un peu trop pour les gens qui m'entourent qui, surtout mes amis, semblent √† mon grand d√©sespoir avoir une aversion pour ce genre musical. Comme si le rap moderne signifiait quelque chose. La musique classique peut atteindre un point de mon c≈ìur qui se trouve intouchable par le pop et les autres genres.
Les membres de Clamavi De Profundis sont divins.

Sorry for that French text, but I wouldn't have made it in English...

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","Does it have a crew which can respond intelligently? Or are they restricted to staying buttoned up inside the vehicle and won't intervene if I, say, get on top of it? If the former, I'm completely dead. If the latter, I might, just might, survive. Unescorted tanks aren't great at urban environments, and it has to find me to kill me.  


I'm on a UK-style housing estate - lots of two-story brick buildings, hedges, fences. Roads aren't in a grid, it's all cul-de-sacs and tight bends. Not much line of sight. Now the Abrams has thermal and night vision kit, but that's mostly directional and generally trained on the forward arc (as are the weapons). It won't be able to see through, say thick hedgerows, walls, buildings, or fences. Obviously if it actually sees me I'm dead. But since I know the estate quite well I can probably evade it reasonably easily, for a small time at least.  
So my plan is to collect some firelighters and kindling materials, and a load of ceramic plant pots. I'm also buying some duct tape, rope, some food and water. And a few of those foil emergency blankets. I'm going to make a bunch of small fires all over the place, and use them to heat the ceramic pots. These are to serve as false heat signatures all over the place.  
Meanwhile, I'll be in an alley across the street, behind a fence, covered in the foil blankets to conceal body heat. The tank will probably use the road to get to my address because my cul-de-sac is relatively inaccessible without driving through other houses. That puts me right behind it, at which point I run and climb right on top of the turret. That'll take like 5 seconds, so hopefully I'm not spotted.  Once on top I lie spread eagled, and securely rope/tape myself to whatever stanchions and protuberances there are on top, in order to avoid exhausting myself or falling off.

Here's the full routine:


AM:


Wash with water&gt; Timeless CE Ferulic&gt; Hydrating Toner&gt; Jojoba/Grapeseed Oil&gt; CeraVe moisturizing lotion&gt;Sunscreen

PM 1:

DIY oil cleanser if I have sunscreen/makeup on&gt; CeraVe hydrating cleanser&gt; Hydrating Toner&gt; Hylamide SubQ serum&gt; TO Lactic Acid 5%/Alpha Skin Care 10% Glycolic gel&gt; Rosehip seed/Passion fruit oil&gt; CeraVe PM/Stratia LG&gt; CeraVe healing ointment

PM2:

Same up to serum, then Oil&gt; TO Advanced Retinoid 2%&gt; Moisturizer&gt; Occlusive


I wait the suggested time between products. With sunscreen it's usually more than 30 mins+ after moisturizer. I work from home, so I have the luxury of stretching out my AM routine. I also don't have to wear sunscreen or makeup every day.


Toners I use: Klairs Supple Preparation, Hada Labo Gokujyun Moist, Kiku Masamune Sake High Moist


Sunscreens: Neogen Day-Light on dry days, Anessa Aqua Booster Mild SPF 50 on humid days

Pre-stage the USNS Comfort prior to the hurricane, just like what was done for hurricane Matthew. 

Dispatch another two LHDs to accompany the Wasp. 

Open transport for power companies and personnel on the SE Atlantic coast as soon as the SJ airport was cleared. 

Issue National Guard mobilization to support the Puerto Rico units (they have a few of their own NG units there, but not enough)

Yeah helicopters would perform supply airdrops of food and water while the USCG performed air medevac to SJ to await the Comfort, however would be in a central triage location with access to supplies as needed.

Luckily for you - or maybe not so much - I read your entire reply. In this comment I will be clearing some things up, setting the records straight, while replying to some of your remarks directly. Therefore I will quote your previous post in order to achieve full transparency. I feel we need this in both of our lives right now. Correct me if I'm being to presumptuous. 

**Honest**
&gt;I thank you for your honest reply

I must confess. I wasn't honest at all, for I have never read the 4th issue of The Thanos Imperative. So I merely guessed that Thanos said ""No"" in this issue. My conclusion - as you have correctly pointed out - is flawed and playfull mockery. 

**Fun**
&gt;As it seems you have not quite understood the latter point, let me put it to you as plainly as I can. This post was made for fun.

While I was teasing you with my clearly false theory - on which I will elaborate later - it wasn't my intention to give you the impression that I took your theory fully serious or that I didn't enjoy myself. Although this section isn't titled **honest**, I still believe I am when I state that my opening sentence was fully sincere. I shall quote myself here - one thing I always enjoy doing - to show you to what sentence I'm referring: ""I intensely enjoyed reading your - how shall I call it? - Theory."" Your writing style, wit and the theory itself are entertaining. I was merely inspired by your post to reply with another theory. And since I do not believe in the meaning you get from those numbers (D23), I decided to exaggerate in an even more far-fetched theory. 

**I told you so**
&gt;your telling me ""I told you so"" has no meaning

In my modest opinion. I told you so always has meaning. If nothing else, it may hint at a character flaw of the one posing this statement. 

**My clearly false theory**
&gt;I can only imagine how long it took you to accomplish this.

It took me 10 minutes. I think. 

&gt; Your theory was built on three numbers which were never shown in the film; to discover them one would have to pay very close attention to the film and, likely as not, watch it multiple times. 

I googled ""Captain America Winter Soldier Numbers"" in order to get some data quickly. I quickly found this picture: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a9/8f/9b/a98f9bce6365417da8056ae3339d8e7c.jpg
I choose three numbers - which only had in common that Captain America himself was involved - and tried googling some dates. Luckily I found that The Thanos Imperative was released on one of the possible dates. As you can see, this is no achievement at all. Of course, while having fun, I was also trying to point out that giving meaning to numbers isn't that difficult. And while I will admit, the numbers in your theory have a clearer connection to each other, I still think it isn't a meaningful one. I cannot disprove this - and since you're not that serious about it, I probably won't have to - but I simply highly, highly doubt a director or marketing team would put in coded messages about trailer drops for a movie that far ahead of time. It is way more likely that this is just coincidence (if the trailer does drop at October 14th). 

**The Trailer**
&gt;As I mentioned in my original post, a quick look through recent activity will reveal that the most popular answer is ""sometime in October""

This is likely. I think the trailer will drop around Thor: Ragnarok. This strategy will remind moviegoers that the Thor film might be worth checking out because he's in Infinity War. And we all want to know which events will lead-up to that movie. But this is merely a prediction of Marvels overall strategy. You probably wouldn't be surprised at this point that I too think the Infinity War trailer will be dropped at the end of October or the beginning of November. ""Around October"" sounds accurate to me. 

u/AdmiralSnackBar69's analysis is therefore much more reliable then your fun-to-read-theory. He doesn't look at a coded message - which we just entertainingly assume it might be a coded message - but he looks at production trends. 

**Closing**

It was never my intend to be hurtful or mock you as an author. I really enjoyed reading your text. So maybe I didn't formulate my reply as carefully as I could have. English isn't my first language, so communicating can be difficult sometimes. That being said, I don't feel you took it the wrong way. Your reply was equally entertaining. This exchange of simple words we've had today was so fun and inspiring, that I think we should become electronic pen pals. 

To summarize: 

- I had fun reading your original post and your reply. 

- I was fully aware you were not entirely serious. 

- My theory was very much incorrect. 

- I think a trailer will drop in October/November.

- While I was mocking, I hope you know by now it wasn't meant to be hurtful, personal or hateful. 


Hopefully, I cleared some things up. If not, if everything I said you already knew or assumed, then consider my post simply as meaningless rambling, attention seeking or a waste of your valuable time. ",1506816109

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","agree with this. i mean right now hes on pace for 2,800 all purpose yards, about 50 receptions, and over 30 tds. This is ridiculous and impossible basically. I think Hunt owners realize that, and are expecting big games from him, but tempering those expectations a little. 

Think i read somewhere that they estimated regression to maybe 1200 yards the rest of the season (which still leaves him with over 1700), and something like 14 td's. those are STILL ridiculous numbers, so even if he comes close to that he is worth holding onto, or trading for someone great.

I may regret it, but im gonna hold onto him. People were saying to trade DJ while his value was up so high after the first few weeks he took over, and now those people look silly. he could fall off, sure. but he could take you to the ship as well.

But the possibility of human immorality is not the only objection to anarchy: even a society whose every member were fully rational and faultlessly moral, could not function in a state of anarchy; it is the need of¬†objectivelaws and of an arbiter for honest disagreements among men that necessitates the establishment of a government.

‚ÄúThe Nature of Government,‚Äù

¬∂

If a society provided no organized protection against force, it would compel every citizen to go about armed, to turn his home into a fortress, to shoot any strangers approaching his door‚Äîor to join a protective gang of citizens who would fight other gangs, formed for the same purpose, and thus bring about the degeneration of that society into the chaos of gang-rule, i.e., rule by brute force, into perpetual tribal warfare of prehistorical savages.

The use of physical force‚Äîeven its retaliatory use‚Äîcannot be left at the discretion of individual citizens. Peaceful coexistence is impossible if a man has to live under the constant threat of force to be unleashed against him by any of his neighbors at any moment. Whether his neighbors‚Äô intentions are good or bad, whether their judgment is rational or irrational, whether they are motivated by a sense of justice or by ignorance or by prejudice or by malice‚Äîthe use of force against one man cannot be left to the arbitrary decision of another.

Two won't play **food chain magnate**. They got absolutely demolished in their first game, to the point where they were ""irrelevant bystanders"" after turn 3. Never again, they said.

One won't play **alchemists** because it reminds him of being in college and he goes to game night to forget school and work.

One won't play **resistance or secret Hitler** because he's a (young) retired Afghanistan war vet with ptsd and those games trigger him too much. He gets way to stressed out.

Two friends won't play **arboretum** , and these are two really good gamers, not snowflakes. But the hand restriction is so stressful that they can't have fun with it. Of those two, one won't play **bazaar** because the thought process required to play optimally is so brain burny that he doesn't think it's worth it. That being said, he'll play fcm and battlecon with me all day, ironically.

Another friend has kids 10, 8, 6, who all like game, but they won't play **escape curse of the temple** again because the last game ended in tears, shouting, and rage. The mom and 10 year old did fine, but the 8&amp;6 struggled, and I split the group up poorly. So idiotic, I should have been with the 8&amp;6, not with the 10.

I almost won't play **splendor** anymore because it removes all socialization and leads to some outburst when someone grabs the card someone else wanted.

One guy won't play **acquire** because he ran out of money real fast, couldn't buy stocks for like 6 turns, didn't have the tiles to force a merger, and walked away feeling like it was a luck fest that punished you too hard for being careless with your money. Dunno, me neither..?

One won't play **Chinatown** because the endgame is too mathy and predictable (easy to solve).

And another won't play **dominion** anymore because it's too themeless and too pure, ie he prefers Clank, where deck building is a means to an end, not an end. By the way, he's never played a dominion expansion.

I won't play any of the **legendary** series games, **monopoly, munchkin, galaxy trucker, mice n mystics, or Robinson Crusoe** because I don't feel I have enough player agency. I feel like the game is playing ME",1506816115

In your example, we'd start with the base sentence:

""I had dinner with my uncle and a madman and an accordion player.""

This obviously isn't proper grammar, so we'd replace the first ""and"" with a comma since we've created a list:

""I had dinner with my uncle, a madman and an accordion player.""

In this case anyone with a grasp on context clues would understand what one was trying to say. If this was being said aloud then it would be the burden of the person pronouncing it to clarify what they were saying.

I will submit that there are situations where an oxford comma is necessary, but they are few and far inbetween. Meanwhile our society expounds into our heads at a young age that we must always use the oxford comma whenever we write regardless of the situation.

I still use them, but only because of I've been oppressed by our society which worships them to the point where that oppression is now internalized in all within. Break the cycle, fight the Punctriarchy.",1506816118

"DenverBroncos","t5_2s51j","Number one. Here's a good way to look at it:

If you were starting a team and could pick any QB that's ever played, there aren't many you could put above him. Elway's combination of mobility, toughness, a rocket arm and fierce competitiveness make him a compelling choice regardless of who he's compared to. Let's give give it a shot:

**Brady**: Simply one of the greatest to ever play the game, period. He's also had the benefit of playing for THE greatest head coach of all time. That has to be factored into this evaluation. Would Brady have been as great under multiple head coaches? Although we'll never know the answer definitively, history shows that it'd be very difficult to replicate Brady's success under different coaches.

Elway however went to five Super Bowls under two different head coaches. Neither of these coaches would even be in the running of GOAT. Also if you compare the QBs head-to-head, Elway is more athletic and mobile than Brady while being just as competitive (Brady's best attribute). Advantage Elway

**Favre**: I never understood why Favre was treated with such reverence when he played. Whenever I think of Favre, I think of back-breaking picks in the playoffs. That alone disqualifies him from consideration. 

**Peyton Manning** : Great QB. Gaudy stats. Four Super Bowl appearances with four different head coaches. I wouldn't start him over Elway though. Elway is more mobile and tougher, but his biggest advantage is that he played his best ball under pressure. That's Peyton's biggest weakness. That's a big weakness of most QBs. 

**Marino**: Well he was a great QB to be sure. I think his stats were better than Elway overall. But Marino had a downside. I read recently he had less than 100 yards rushing for his ENTIRE career. So even if Marino was a better passer than Elway, I'd consider his lack of mobility to be a significant disadvantage. Also--and this probably isn't all his fault necessarily-- he played for two Super Bowl winning coaches and only had one SB appearance.  Elway took three Reeves-coached squads to the Super Bowl that had no business being there. That's how good he was.  Quick who was Elway's top receiver on those teams? Who was his running back? I can't remember and I actually WATCHED those teams! 

**Montana** : Joe Montana was a fucking great QB and arguably is the GOAT. As a fan of both the Broncos and Cowboys (don't ask), I had the pleasure of having my heart ripped out by this muthafucker for over a decade. Accurate, cool under fire with the heart of a champion.  But here's the thing about Montana...dude was fragile by NFL standards. If you put a solid lick on him, he wouldn't get up. That's why he didn't finish his career as a 49er. Toughness is important in this position. Elway was a tough sumamabitch.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Think he's reading into Moreno's comments a bit too much. Anyone who watches us closely will have noticed that we don't press anywhere near as much anymore, and it's a conscious change.

Could be many reasons for it. One is that we have the CL this season so we can't afford to play such a high energy game every week. We don't have that deep of a squad, and Klopp thus far has only really rotated in the full back areas. City/Spurs have rotated far more effectively than us. Also worth remembering we have the CL playoff round which added games for us, while having to deal with the absence of Clyne, Lallana, Coutinho and dealing with bringing back players from injury (Hendo/Mane/Sturridge).

Another is that pressing, while effective, when it isn't working, leaves your midfield and defence exposed. Notably when Lallana is missing, we don't have a natural doggish presser aside from Firmino, so Klopp is being pragmatic in the absence of Lallana in order to protect our already vulnerable defence. I can imagine Klopp remembers playing a high pressing game away at Bournemouth or Leicester and then getting caught by simple long balls into the channels.

I remember when Klopp first arrived, the number of hamstring/calf injuries was ridiculous. These injuries have slowed down somewhat, but a less intensive pressing game will have helped.",1506816120
"ShitPoliticsSays","t5_2vcl0","The Left has leaned right over the years. Both parties have. Obamacare originated with the Heritage Foundation in the 80's. The Left absolutely refused to pass it when Gingrich was pushing it in the '90's. Once Obama was president, the Left loved it and the Right hated it. 

The NSA's domestic spying is literally fascist. Not the Left's new definition which is ""Trump supports it"", but actually fascist. Both the Right and the Left largely support it out of fear, but it's a very far right program. It wouldn't have been allowed before 9/11. 

Trump has changed his position on things over the years. Most people do. There's no shame in that, as long as the changes don't happen from interview to interview. Trump has been consistently leaning farther and farther to the right over the last several decades. 

I have no idea why you think the country has been moving Left. I've been watching politics since the 90's. We've moved to the Right. You'd think people on the Right would consider that a victory, but somehow y'all have twisted it into an imaginary defeat. ",1506816120

"hiphopheads","t5_2rh4c","I have to agree with a lot of the critiques here.  The pilot showed a lot of promise, but the show just went down hill from there.  The show had so much potential to be an accurate portrayal of the origins of hip hop and how the culture of the 70s in NYC really influenced not only a generation but changed the landscape of the music industry in general.  

But sadly they just didn't portray it very realistically and it wasn't, like someone else said, raw or real enough.  And don't get me started on the whole rape scene where Leslie Lesgold forces Jackie Moreno to go down on her because he once coerced her into giving him a blowjob and then fired her way back when she interned for him.  Really?  Such BS and so completely unrealistic.  I lived through that era, women got used and sexually exploited all the time and not just in the music industry.  Back then it was the unofficial and deeply repulsive status quo that in order for a woman to get a ahead, pardon the pun, she had to give head and much more. If she didn't play that game she got black listed and her career was over.  

Once a woman gained stardom then it was different story, but even then the male power players of the day ran the show and their word was law.  Back then no woman would dare pull some revenge crap like Leslie did, because no male power player then would ever allow a woman to have that kind of power.  Sorry ladies but rape revenge like what Leslie did, however empowering and entertaining, was not only not practical but due to the culture of the time would never have happened. So yeah that was the big BS exclamation point on the ending of that show, that and the ridiculous amount of money Netflix spent on it.  The Get Down deserved to get cancelled.  Overall though, with all of Netflix's other hit shows, one miss like the get down shouldn't hurt their overhead much at all.  They are still hitting it out of the park with shows like Luke Cage and Stranger Things, as well as a lot of their other original shows and the ones they currently got in development.  The Get Down will barely end up as a hiccup in what has become Netflix's original show money making machine.

For the SNES Classic mini, I missed out on preorder again, went on eBay and they were selling on preorder for around $40-$50 more than the release price. Which isn't *too* bad, I guess. Maybe no one bought the ridiculously overpriced ones so they had to lower them, who knows.

But that said, I went to the local department store 6 hours after they opened expecting them to have sold out hours earlier, but they still had plenty so I was able to get one (they said they received about 50-60, and they had a line up in the morning but it's a small town. Some major stores got hundreds and hundreds. When the NES was released they got 12. And a lineup of furious people yelling at the employees for not having enough)

Maybe Nintendo learned after the NES fiasco, but it was still cool to get one and not have to pay stupid amounts for it.

I was 6 years old and had family friends over just before Christmas. My mom was single and working a ton to support my sister and I at the time. 

Anyways, we didn't want our friends to leave so we hid in the laundry room.  Low and behold, I stumble across the technodrome hidden behind the furnace. We book it out of there, and agree not to say anything. 

So they leave, and it's just the 3 of us at the kitchen table. I was so excited about it that I kept dropping hints until it was obvious and she just broke down crying. I had never seen her cry before, and granted she was stressed from everything but its probably the worst memory I have with her. She tried so hard to make a perfect Christmas and circumstances (as I know I was a kid and didn't do it on purpose) just took that away from her, as was common in general for her. 

I didn't even ask for that present but she knew I loved TMNT and got me the best present ever. It was my last Christmas with her.

"FireEmblemHeroes","t5_3imv0","You're assuming way too much about the average player here when it's a huge player base, there's no way everyone started when the game started. People still complain about no Camus/Xander repeat because they started after that point. There's no way everyone has the same goal of collecting every unit at 4* level 40 when there's literally no point to that either. The only thing the game actually tracks is 5* level 40s. F2P have limited barrack space and limited supplies of feathers, so there's nothing in game even wanting you to do this. I've upgraded literally 7 total units to 5* with the amount of Feathers I've gathered since I started playing and I don't have enough to upgrade someone to 5* right now. And two of those were 4* s I pulled and wanted to build up, like a ton of other users would want to do with their favorite units, which would be a much more important goal for them than raising their Virion to 4* level 40 using the Feathers and stamina they would've otherwise put into a +10 Selena or something. 
Even if somehow there was several thousand like minded individuals who did that, you'd still not be able to follow a lot of guides because they require 3* s, and throwing off stats even IV wise entirely messes up strategies. Some strategies need people like Arthur or Stahl or Serena there at 3* because they can soak hits, but won't kill a specific unit at a choke point. So bringing your 4* Serena/Arthur/Stahl means you mess up the strategy, the Axe you were stalling dies, and the Lance behind it kills Serena/Stahl instead. 
 
Besides the whole ""yeah but what if this or what if that"", the entire point is ""what if people don't have this"", your argument here is ""well, they should"", my point is ""yeah, but they don't"". How does your argument actually fix the situation those people are in who see that video about the easy 4* Oboro level 40 wall strategy, and then realize they'd have to spend like 150 stamina and 2000 Feathers just for this one orb they're wanting to earn?

Streak: 6W

Pick record: 23-2-16

Bonus Picks record: 17-1-23
***

*Had a decent day yesterday. The POTD pick - Coventry won, and I got 4/6 picks as winners with one other as a push*

**POTD:**

**Double: Torino to Win &amp; Inter Milan to Win - 1.60 (L - 2-2 &amp; 1-2. Torino concede 2 goals in the last 6 minutes to lose the bet, unbelievable!)**

Now I like to stick to singles, especially for POTD but after researching through all the games I like today there's nothing that puts me over the edge for certainly other than these picks. I was thinking of doing the Lazio game O2.5 goals as I can see both teams scoring there or even Lazio scoring 3 just themselves but I'm not 100% confident and a 2-0 win in that game wouldn't surprise me. 

So, into detail about Torino's game. They host Verona today who I've talked about in previous picks about how utterly terrible they are and if reports are to be believed their manager is close to the sack. Verona have looked hopeless through 6 games with a record of 0-2-4, only scoring 1 (from a penalty) and conceding 14. 

Torino have been decent so far this season. They find themselves 7th with a record of 3-2-1, goals 10:9. Attackers Belotti and Ljajic have been in good form with 3 goals each and are very likely to score today, Belotti has scored in the two home games Torino have played so far. With Verona's horrible scoring record I doubt they'll score today but if they do it'll only be 1 and Torino have more than enough quality to get 2+. Defensive mid Baselli will be missing after being sent off last week, Obi &amp; Barreca will also miss out for the hosts but they'll be able to cope without them. 

In the other game, Inter play away to Benevento who are equally as bad as Verona and sit in last place, also just scoring the 1 goal and have conceded 16 goals already after being smashed by Napoli 6-0 and Roma 4-0. It won't get any easier for them here against Inter who have won 5 and drawn once in their games and have the best defensive record in the league. 

Inter were lucky to win last week against Genoa, but they continued their record of scoring in every game. That comes mostly thanks to Icardi who is up to 6 goals already and will like his chances of bagging a couple today, I might put a little on him to even get a hat trick. As far as injuries go Inter are only missing Cancelo who hasn't played in a month anyway. It could be a rout here after some of Benevento's performances but Inter don't tend to be a big scoring team so I'm expecting 2-0/3-0 here. 

***
*Quite a lot of games I like today, so I'll try to whittle them down to just the better looking ones for picks*

**Picks:**

‚Ä¢ **Arsenal v Brighton - Arsenal Clean Sheet YES - 1.80 (W - 2-0)**

Originally this pick was going to be Arsenal to Win to Nil but the odds so similar for just a clean sheet that it seems much more worth it in case Arsenal can't score somehow. 

Arsenal have kept their last 6/8 home matches as clean sheets. They've shown how impressive at home they are winning all their games so far conceding all their only hole goals let in in that early 4-3 thriller against Leicester. 

Brighton have struggled for goals this season, they're scored 5 in 6 (3 goals coming against West Brom) and have only scored 1 away from home so far. To get a better look at how I expect this game to play out I looked at how they faired against their only big team they faced yet Man City and the stats show a 79/21% possession to Man City, showing that Brighton are likely to sit back and try to grind out a draw today against Arsenal. 

‚Ä¢ **Everton v Burnley - Burnley or Draw - 2.25 (W - 0-1)**

I fucked up here, looking at the odds Burnley +1.0AH @1.65 are a much better pick than this so if you're reading this pick late I would take that, I still feel Burnley can draw here and I won't change my pick after the fact so here are the stats. 

Burnley have performed well this season with a record of 2-3-1, goals 6:5. Away from home Burnley have really turned it on after a terrible record last season, this season they won at Chelsea 2-1, as well as getting 1-1 draws at Spurs &amp; Liverpool. If Burnley do lose it tends to be only by a goal, although last season Everton were one of the only teams able to beat by that margin winning 3-1 but this is a different Everton this year. 

Everton have struggled for goals. They've scored 4 in 6, 2 of them coming last game where they were fortunate to get away with a win. Koeman is under pressure at the moment and will want to continue Everton's winning streak. If Burnley are able to get the first goal then the Goodison Park crowd will be booing and they will get on their players backs, that pressure might be too much. 

‚Ä¢ **Atalanta v Juventus -- BTTS - 1.95 (W - 2-2)**

The head to head record here has BTTS in the last 4/6. Atalanta have had 5/6 BTTS too. Both teams have scored in all of their games so far (except for when Juve played Barca). I think both teams will fancy their chances and have inform players on either side in Gomez and Dybala. I like the O2.5 goals here too, it was 2-2 in this game last season and it could be agin today. 

‚Ä¢ **Torino v Verona -- Torino Clean Sheet YES - 2.20 (L - 2-2)**

Explained in POTD. 

‚Ä¢ **Benevento v Inter Milan -- Inter -2.0 Asian Handicap - 2.20 (L - 1-2)**

Explained in POTD. 

‚Ä¢ **Benevento v Inter Milan -- Inter to Win to Nil - 1.95 (L - 0-2)**

Explained in POTD. 

‚Ä¢ **Hertha Berlin v Bayern Munich -- Hertha Berlin to Score 1+ goals - 1.90 (W - 2-2)**

I've explained this pick in a comment below. 

‚Ä¢ **Koln v RB Leipzig -- Leipzig to Win - 2.00 (W - 1-2)**

‚Ä¢ **Nice v Marseille -- Nice Draw No Bet - 1.92 (L - 2-4. Nice we're 2-0 up! That would have paid out with some bookies Ina straight win, how annoying)**

‚Ä¢ **Maritimo v Benfica -- Maritimo +1.0 Asian Handicap - 2.06 (W - 1-1)**

*Lastly, I would not advise putting these all into an acca. As much as I'd like them all to win, it's always unlikely with this many picks so if you do feel you have to combine them in some way please choose a double of your favs or even a treble. Anything more and you're asking for trouble.*

**Bonus Picks: (Odds of Evens or greater)**

‚Ä¢ Everton v Burnley -- Draw - 3.80 (L)

‚Ä¢ Newcastle v Liverpool -- BTTS &amp; O2.5 goals - 2.00 (L)

‚Ä¢ Benevento v Inter Milan -- Inter -3.0 Asian Handicap - 4.40 (L)

The problem with this though, is that since there were balance changes the meta is still changing so if the deck you chose gets countered or if it preyed on a weaker deck that disappears, you might find yourself with a not so great deck so you should wait a bit.

Acknowledging that it can be interesting to see how principles are maintained in conflict is not preferring conflict like Krall.

Perhaps you should take some other lessons from TOS, like tolerance and IDIC. People are entitled to prefer different things and have different impressions than you.

Incidentally, you should watch Errand of Mercy again. People do die in it - namely the crew of a Klingon ship which is blown up by the Enterprise at the beginning. That loss of life doesn't even prompt a mention or a moment's regret.

Also, if you acknowledge that the Federation and Klingons required a lesson from superior beings to not go to war, then surely it stands to reason that conflict is far more likely before that lesson.",1506816135

The whole point of this thread is, should interstate teams have to face these challenges every single year when Melbourne clubs don't.  The question is easily answered.  Where do you think Richmond would have preferred to have played yesterday, and why?  Answer that and you see why it's unfair for interstate clubs to play for a flag against home teams, every damn year.  If playing at the MCG is only a 'challenge' to overcome am sure Richmond would have happily played at the Adelaide Oval, yeah, nah!  

If other finals are determined by ladder position why isn't the Grand Final?  It's a massive advantage for Melbourne clubs.

Get him. 

If Lever wants to go be with family in Melbourne, that's completely understandable. For some people, being near family is important, and unfortunately that means his time in Adelaide is done. No hard feelings. Feel the same about it as Dangerfield leaving. All good. Catchya later Jakey boy. Keath can slot in there nicely for ya. Build up Doedee as well. 

Cameron will stay. Simple.

Of course get Jackson Edwards in. The more Father-son picks the better. Not much risk of them leaving. 

Defense is going to be crippled without Smithers, but Seedsman, with a bit of coaching and a good pre-season, can fill his shoes pretty well. 

Crouch bros are going to go absolutely apeshit next year in the midfield. We'll probably have the best midfield in he comp if we get Gibbs, as well as training up Greenwood some more, and of course we have Sloane and Sauce.

2) Conservatives provincially (they won but it was a girl who cucked out and I regret not voting WR)
3) Libertarian federally because I was butthurt over how shitty the Conservatives were doing in my province, this is the election Trudeau got in and I would definitely just bite my tongue and vote Harper if I could go back
4) Alberta party. Still pissed at our Conservative party and they were doing some random BS so I basically threw away my vote. Should have voted WR again.

I'm pretty happy about where the UCP and federal conservatives are right now, more hopeful than I've ever been for politicians since I've taken the red pill suppository from /pol/ way back when.

"StarWarsBattlefront","t5_2u9wz","What you call judging, I call making an educated guess on modern gaming trends and logic. EA is replacing a 50 dollar season pass with star cards that give you statistical advantages. How do you get people to buy those star cards? By giving them substantial advantages. Which you posted above would indeed allow you to compete, star cards shouldn't be that good that you cannot compete. You're paying money, to be better at a game. That's the exact definition of paytowin. I'm asking EA to remove the statistical advantage from crates and make them strictly unlocks. EA can continue the franchise by making money off of cosmetics. EA has more money than any of us would ever spend in a lifetime. COD games had unlock based progression for a long time before supply drops and no one complains then. You will be just fine earning your progress instead of buying it, you will live. The game won't die because people have to earn their progress. Stop being dramatic. 

And because I'm asking for a game that's fair dosent mean that I'm jealous if someone has a Ferrari and I don't lol. You're being very dramatic and I'm getting vibes that YOU are offended by this conversation, which is pretty immature. I'm asking for a video game to have an even playing field not for EA to build a rocket ship. Cosmetic only microtransactions isn't something crazy to ask for. 

And a few more things, fighting RNG bullshit crates dosent make something challenging, It's completely random and has no pride or reflects hard work. It's all based on how lucky you are or how much money you spend. As someone from the older generation I'd expect you to understand that. Hard work = nice things not throwing money at the screen. If you actually read my posts you would know that I wasn't asking for things to be handed to me. I work, go to school, sleep, repeat. I don't have much time to play either. But that doesn't mean I would rather have the ability to pay to be good at the game. 

And you owning a business shows your bias to shitty business practices. The way you talk it wouldnt suprise me if you told your employees to repair cars and then sell blinker fluid or elbow grease to people that didn't know better.

When the destructive animal industry is reduced and we through political measures reduce (but hopefully fucking **end**) the exploitation of third world countries by the west, these people will over time recover and finally be given the opportunity and *room* to grow.

It's not really proper hard sci-fi, but more space opera that does this.  

I'd love to see a novel that tackles actual space colonization.  It would probably involve very fast spacecraft that use hibernation.  The nearest potentially habitable planets are within a few dozen lightyears away from us, *however*, space travel probably won't be near light speed, so it may take many millennia to travel to the nearest one.  37,000 years to go one light year using a space shuttle.

Far too many adventures are quivering 10 page masses unusable bland elements tied into some would be novelist's derivative fantasy story buttressed by a swarm of cliched NPCs with too much backstory, but a lack of memorable detail or compelling reasons to be of interest to anyone but the writer.  This is usually followed by a hasty, linear, 8 room, all combat, adventure location that pulls an assortment of Monster Manual denizens, book magic items, coin based treasure and featureless grey walls and tosses them together without much sense.

As the victim of the joke, it's good to learn to laugh it off and not take it seriously (Tyrion's quote comes to mind). It's more power to you. But at the same time, the victim of the joke has every right to be upset as well since it *is* a joke at their expense. 

I'm all about being responsible of our emotions and whatever, but people should be responsible of the shit they say to others as well. Don't just blame the small dick person for not handling it well. It's really just victim blaming and that's not fun. It's a low tier of victim blaming but doesn't change the fact that it is.

If she had gone after revenge against the people that mistreated her then we could empathize with her.  However, she chose to brutalize every Doman for what happened to her, probably including those who suffered similar injustices.  There should be no redemption for her.

Everyone likes to discuss Fordola and explain her actions away as well but the crux of the matter is not that she was an Ala Mighan that turned traitor to Ala Migho, but rather that she chose to participate in the atrocities committed by the Garlean Empire.  I have no issue with her seeing herself as a Garlean, I only have issue with what she did as a Garlean.  There is no excuse for the things she was doing to civilians in the name of the Empire.  

Zenos was just too crazy to let live.

All too often people try to empathize with the villain and excuse their actions on the basis of the fact that they suffered in the past. The truth is that there is a lot of suffering going around and yet most people don't decide to murder or abuse others and use their own suffering as an excuse to do so.

 A government that presides over the bulk of a people that have been raised to believe that murder in the streets is perfectly justified.


Look at it from the point of view of the people, its a society where this has never happened, any hint of their origins and the truth of where they are has been long since lost to time. Fact become stories, stories become wives tales, becomes myths and legends, before fading completly from the collective racial history of an entire race. 

Down through the generations it goes, every generation a little more is lost as those who knew the truth are unable to pass on the information to their children because of death/disease etc till nothing is left.


You look up to see the sky, something that has remained fixed point through all of living memory. And all of a sudden its gone. It would be of a scale like us on earth waking up one morning to find something insane like another planet stretching from horizon to horizon above us.
No way in hell an entire people are just gonna go """"meh, nothing to see here"""" 

There is no way in hell that the peoples transition to a space faring race again is gonna be easy or smooth at all. Union is gonna have a really hard time convincing most of the people of the truth, hell. for many it may be that anyone from the Union will be seen as a demon who stole the sky.

It seems like a good buy, but I just don't like certain things about it. Namely, the power supply and RAM speed.

If it normally is $1300, it's a good deal and you should take it. If not, then you should build it on your own and add faster RAM. Ryzen performs significantly better with just the jump to 2666MHz and even better with faster RAM (only without as much of a significant boost). The power supply is also cutting it close. If you plan to overclock at any time in the future and since you are going to be streaming, it's going to be under heavy load for long periods of time.

"BPD","t5_2qqdp","...This is embarrassing to know you came from r/fireemblem, I didn't think people would look through my post history and find me being a simpering fool because my illness got a stranglehold of me last night.

Well, now that you're here and while I debate if I want to keep this up or not... might as well reply.

I get what you're saying and I do agree. It's just that to us Borderlines, having a ""favorite person"" means more than it entails. To us with BPD, having an ""FP"" as we call them is... how do I put this? Basically, the FP is the most important person in our lives. We ignore their shortcomings and we're so starved for attention and affection we don't care if this FP is a bad person at all. Unfortunately, an ex friend of mine was an FP years ago and while they were, I had realized they were bad for me and I had to pull myself away as hard as it was. Till now, they're still angry I did it despite the fact I don't talk to them anymore. Losing an FP is black and white for us: if we lose them, that means they're a shitty person and how dare they fool us? While we're in the ""honeymoon"" phase, we legit think our FPs are capable of doing no wrong.

To put it in simple terms: we put them on a pedestal which proves to be detrimental to both us and our FP. 

Now, I know what you're thinking: if having an FP is so bad, why do we do it anyways? Why do we want to be someone's favorite too, in that case? For that, I have no clear answer. The best I can come up with is that we just want to be as important to someone else too. It isn't fair to us, in our minds, that we have people we idolize and would do anything for only for that person not to feel the same way. It makes us feel attention-starved more and it makes us feel we're not worthy of anyone's time.

It's fucked up thinking, I know, but we're Borderlines after all. Everyone on this sub is a Borderline and we understand each other which is why we all rant to each other here, because even our therapists are sick of our shit.

I went off on a tangent there.

Unfortunately, when we have an ""FP"", we become very clingy, very dependent, and... it's really a toxic relationship. At least for the people who don't want to be our FPs. Some people understand the way our stupid brains work while others are quick to block us or ghost us and call us hideous names for something we cannot control for the life of us.

You have points, you do, and I acknowledge you are right. Buying gifts and such is no way to make friends, and I acknowledge this. You are also right that I do not trust ""Person A"" in this hypothetical situation. To be frank, even though I have friends who care about me, there is always a doubt lurking in the back of my mind that they are actually Person C in this situation. This is because I, like a large majority of this sub, have been abandoned and used like we're nothing.

I apologize for this massive wall of text. There are days I'm better at controlling my BPD, and there are days when I cannot control it no matter how much I try. While I know it's silly to hope I could be someone's ""FP"", a part of me does continue to hope for it. It's just the way my brain is wired, I guess.",1506816164

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","So I have a long term success story. My mother has borderline personality disorder and spent my entire childhood vacillating between the extremes of every emotion, within a short time frame. It was horrible because I never knew what to expect and had to be constantly on guard. She would go from praising my intelligence to telling me I was a desperate whore worth nothing all while making me feel responsible for her emotions. She essentially gaslighted me my entire life and I still struggle with feeling confident in my own memories. There was other stuff too, sexual abuse at home but I have very few memories of that, thankfully, since what I do have is bad enough. Thanks to this I had horrible coping mechanisms. I have no idea how my husband put up with me for the first couple years. Eventually, I managed to escape my childhood horrors and realized I needed help because I wasn't ok and I wanted to be the best version of myself possible for my own daughter. So, I found a therapist I was comfortable with and put in the time and work to learn how to process what I lived through and cultivating positive coping mechanisms in addition to finding a combination of medicines to help me remain stable instead of teetering into depression and the more obsessive, controlling tendencies I get when stressed. It took several years to get to where I am now but I'm finally happy, steady, and comfortable with/proud of who I am. I even managed to forgive my mother for how she treated me. I know she has a problem and is miserable so I can understand WHY she does things but I will never have a relationship with her. I just refused to allow her to have any impact on my life anymore because she stole enough from me already, I'm not going to allow her to do it now that she's out of my life. Being angry and resentful wasn't hurting her at all (in fact, that allows her to be the victim, which she loves) but it was eating me up so I decided to let it go. Now I have a strong, successful marriage (12 years and still going strong), I'm a great mother, and have a career that allows me to support my family.

Can you detail out your experiences with ""publishing?"" I see a lot of comments in awe of this, frankly, trivial thing.

I know of many YA authors who have agents and publishers that will not touch anyone who is self-published, and contractually require them to abstain from doing so. If something was already self-published, it will never be picked up for major publication. Maybe in the early days where that was still an interesting rags to riches story, but I was surprised to find how vilified that process is when to me it sounds like the definition of proactivity.

I am assuming that you've essentially self-published your novel, and did not go through Big Publishing to do it, else you wouldn't be running your own AMA and would be linking to / referring to your publishers as required by contract.

Further, you spoke about carrying the novel ""through editing."" Did you self-edit, or have an editor review? Especially with YA, an editor's role is aligned completely with a publisher because they will edit the story to increase target audience stickiness + product potential, so it isn't merely proofreading.

Any marketing or ad budget (besides word-of-mouth social like this AMA)?

Did you consult anyone regarding these issues? Were you aware of them? 

Or did you simply DIY the whole thing?

I'm interested to know as again the aspiring writers I work with all seem to have the same issue of self-publishing leading to success being a fairy tale pushed by those interested to profit from mass amounts of self-publishing, and for NYT bestseller levels you will either not find or see a cover-up regarding their self-publishing days.

The industry has changed a lot in recent years. Self-publishing is becoming bigger for first time authors as it is becoming harder and harder to traditionally publish with the decline of sales for physical books. I've found through going to conferences and asking publishers and agents specifically about this issue that many are changing their views to pick up authors whose self-published work sells well. All that said, I also may never go traditional. I enjoy having control over my novel and final say on everything regarding it. That's just my opinion. However, I believe that if I chose to go the traditional route with a publishing house that I wouldn't have an issue finding a publisher to pick up my novel if it sells well. 

As for editing I had a professional editor that I worked with for a year and a half on making sure this manuscript was the best it could be. Not all editors are aligned with publishers these days, and the editing the story to cater to a crowd is the opposite of what I wanted. Writing is my passion, I'm not in it for the money, and I'm going to stay true to my writing and my stories.

As for marketing I am fortunate enough to know a world-class marketer who is helping me market my novel. 

I consulted a lot of people and have been to several writing conferences where I have been able to ask the professionals these question so I did not go into this process blind. I was well informed about the flaws and issues that come with this process. 

The world of writing is ever changing and I believe in what I'm doing and how I'm doing it. I'm not in it for the money. I write because it's my passion- everything else is a bonus. ",1506816170

You did well to hire and editor and seek the help of that marketer, but you should definitely be prepared for an uphill battle.  That marketer is going to be your best friend, so definitely seek their advice as this continues.

I just wanted to let you know, from someone who self-published eight books and is currently trying to sneak into traditional publishing, that writing and releasing the book is much, much easier than the rest of the process.  Keep a strong hand on your social media, post every day, but mostly don't assume people will want to read your book or automatically respect you for self-publishing.  

In fact, it's the opposite.  Readers want any chance to be distracted away from your work, and it's up to you to make them care enough about you to read your book.  Writing YA makes that easier because you have a larger base that's easier to manage, but keeping up with your platform is still going to be the toughest part of your job.

That said, this AMA has (relatively) exploded, so I wish you the best of luck and that your head is always full of stories.",1506816172

For shingles: All our crews have trailers, but sometimes on smaller jobs (10 sqs. or less) they will just load all the material into the van itself.

For Field Techs: You can fit in all your repair/estimating equipment easily and still have plenty of room for enough material for a full day of repairs. Also if you are a field tech who also does a lot of your own paperwork, a couple of our guys have desks in the back of their van and will often do estimates, invoices, etc. on site and print them to hand directly to the customer instead of relying on email or USPS.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The whole cast is multiracial. There are very few roles played by clearly white people, King George is an exception. Wiki says this...  
Casting diversity: Miranda said that the portrayal of Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and other white historical figures by black and Hispanic actors should not require any substantial suspension of disbelief by audience members. ""Our cast looks like America looks now, and that's certainly intentional"", he said. ""It's a way of pulling you into the story and allowing you to leave whatever cultural baggage you have about the founding fathers at the door."" He noted ""We're telling the story of old, dead white men but we're using actors of color, and that makes the story more immediate and more accessible to a contemporary audience.""

The pro-immigration message of Hamilton is at the forefront, as the show revolves around the life of one of the Founding Fathers of America, Alexander Hamilton, and how he made his mark in American politics as an immigrant. Instead of being characterized as a white person, Alexander Hamilton's immigrant status would be referenced throughout the whole show, alongside with the virtue and prowess of Hamilton (""by working a lot harder, by being a lot smarter, by being a self-starter,"" described in the show's opening), in order to foster a positive image of immigrants. Alongside this, the casting of Black, Latino, and Asian American leads allowed audiences to literally view America as a nation of immigrants, with the intention of showing how irrelevant the Founding Fathers' whiteness is to their claim on the country. ""Hamilton is a story about America, and the most beautiful thing about it is... it's told by such a diverse cast with a such diverse styles of music,"" according to Renee Elise Goldberry, who played Angelica Schuyler. ""We have the opportunity to reclaim a history that some of us don't necessarily think is our own."" Miranda has stated that he is ""totally open"" to women playing the Founding Fathers. Casting for the British production is expected to feature predominantly black British artists.",1506816180

Like, I consider myself a kinda genderqueer/gender non-conforming male. I like the idea of being able to express myself more femininely though.

I get that burning bridges might need to happen, or at least letting the bridges stop being used. My biggest thing isn't necessarily being able to express myself around people I know right now, it's about how to not drive myself crazy.

Another thing is, how do I manage to balance the desire of being more open with the idea of maintaining some secrecy? Seems like those ideas are opposites and can't coexist in my mind.",1506816180

Also, when Trump says that it ""*should* be a community effort"", that implies that the community is not already putting in effort, that there is no community effort.

My dream I've had for what I want to be remembered for is for writing those strong female characters that girls can identify with. I think YA Sci-fi needs more badass female characters without a plot that predominantly follows a love interest. Girls kick ass without men just fine. I want to write characters that people can identify with and really relate to. 
My storyline was actually inspired by an adventure I had with my friend one day. We were playing make believe when I was younger (it had to do with dragons) and we looked up in the sky and saw this bright ball of light (that wasn't the sun) that dissipated after a minute. So, naturally, we incorporated that into our game as the portal to the dragon world.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","This is a classic case of idolatry. The God you have in your mind is not the God of the Bible.

We tend to box God up by His characteristics. Some people think only on God's love. Others, His wisdom. Even others, His justice. Even others, His benevolence.

This is wrong to do. God is not just a being of infinite love. He is also a being of infinite hate towards evil. He is a being of justice. You can not separate God by one or two of His attributes. Just like you would not like people to misrepresent by only defining you by your hair color. 

So the question is, what is a good and just God supposed to do with an evil people like us?

You will say, ""Yeah, but why hell for ETERNITY? Why not temporal judgement. I am, after all, a finite being.""

This is a question asked only by those with a small view of God and His holiness. An allegory would be to liken your crime of hitting me in public. What would happen to you? You might get arrested for a small bit. You might even get away with it depending on where we were at or who had seen it.

But if you had struck the President of the United States, how much greater would be your crime? How much greater the punishment? Why? Because the position of authority you just offended is much greater than mine.

In the same way, God's justice is infinite because His position of authority is infinite. Our crimes against Him are infinite.

Good news is, He is also a God of infinite love, (remember?) And Jesus substituted/represented on the cross all who would believe in Him and receive grace and forgiveness, for He suffered our judgement on our behalf.

Those who will not receive grace, but in their stubbornness continue to love their life of sin instead of turning to Christ; God is a God of justice.",1506816185

My suggestion:

A. Allow it to attack coastal cities with the garrison, after a victory you can only sack or raze, you can‚Äôt occupy. Keep the recruitment to 1 per turn and add a raiding stance. Take away the replenishment bonus 

B. Take away the garrison but add the ability to garrison a lord and their army, keep the replenishment bonus so that the lords army can function for a long period of time. Make it so that without a army the Arks are sitting ducks.

Whatever CA decides to do I hope a mod can give us options. Or maybe a early tech which helps you decide what kind of ark you can recruit, raiding or support.

Traditional Chinese doctors value the existence of the life essence, which are anti-matter substance in our bodies. They are very,very important, as it is one of the basic components of your life! (It's funnny that Western doctors don't believe those simply because they could not detect it yet. ) 

When you carry out the process of reproduction, you give out your life essence (yin for girls) so it can be matched with the other half (yang for boys) to form a baby, along with sperm and eggs.  The more you do it for purpose outside of having children, the more life essence you waste.

And what happens when you waste too much of it? Well, you will age prematurely! (That's one reason why Western people ages earlier than Eastern people, since the culture in the East are more conservative than the West) And what's more, it will make you feel like a hollow stump without energy, and all problems and weird diseases can occur everywhere in your body, since the immunity system can't get their share of life essence, and therefore unable to make enough white blood cells to fight viruses and other invaders.

Anyway, it's definitely not worth it to do it so many times. And trust me, you will have a far better life quality when you reduce your number of reproduction and masturbation, since you will have more time to help others and the society, which are the reasons why do we even exist",1506816193

Starting off with the most important question: the original because the humour was so on point and the characters felt more real than whatever Teen Titans Go! Has going on right now. I adore the one I grew up with. 

Yes! I've always been a reader. I remember learning to read with my dad specifically when I was younger and his mother was an English teacher so she fostered the love of reading in me as a child. I attribute my love of literature and writing to her. She passed away two years ago this month and I miss her everyday. 

Favorite authors are Ray Bradbury, J.K. Rowling, Jane Austen, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. 

To be honest I adore classics. My dad bought be a bunch for Christmas when I was 12 and I've been hooked ever since. I started writing about intergalactic travels though because I wanted to write worlds where I'm not bound by traditional rules that we have here on Earth. I wanted limitless possibilities and adventure.

&gt;
&gt;TLDR of original post: After our mom died, people from HOA came to me and my sister and told us that we're no longer a single family and one of us needs to leave.
&gt;
&gt;So I first confirmed that they are from the HOA, not just some people harassing us for the fun of it. We also got the CC&amp;R of the HOA, which included a clause about single family and it's weird definition. If included partners, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, step parents, step children, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, children of uncles and aunts, children of nieces and nephews, BUT NO SIBLINGS. It even had a clause that said co-owners are not allowed to live there unless they are a single family based on the definition.
&gt;
&gt;We also received a letter from them telling us of our violation and demanding us to comply.
&gt;
&gt;So my sister and I went around the neighborhood and gave copies of the terms and the letter we received to everyone and told them ""imagine you died tomorrow, do you want them to kick out your kids? Because they're doing it to us. They will do it to your kids as well. Help us stop them.""
&gt;
&gt;We gathered signatures and had almost everyone contact the president and demand that this should stop. Within two weeks, we received a letter that says this has been a mistake with an apology.
&gt;
&gt;We learned that this HOA is horrible to everyone, not just us. So there are now people preparing to run for the HOA board to replace the current members and they're promising to have a referendum about whether the HOA should be dissolved or not, because it really is doing nothing of substance except being a pain in the butt of everyone.
&gt;
&gt;Summary: HOA backed off after we told everyone what they're trying to do. We will vote the board out of office and there will be a referendum about dissolving it altogether as we don't need it.

So even though Shapeshift has very high fees, it would be the easiest option for Dash (FOR THIS GROUP) due to the re-usable addresses.

If you want to know why your post was removed, you should first check all the rules of this subreddit. These rules can generally be found in the sidebar of the subreddit.

In some subreddits, a removal reason will only be left in a flair. This flair is on the right or left of the title of your post. 

If, after reading the rules, you still don't know why your post was removed then you could consider [sending a message to the moderators of the subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Agario&amp;subject=Removed%20post&amp;message=Dear%20moderators,%20I%20just%20noticed%20that%20my%20post%20was%20removed.%20I%20checked%20the%20rules%20and%20I%20am%20not%20sure%20why%20it%20was%20removed.%20Could%20you%20please%20give%20me%20an%20explanation?%20https://www.reddit.com/r/Agario/comments/73eyp2)

also (and this is key), harriers count on dealing their damage as...discreetly as possible.  if you challenge and pursue them directly (unless you're a medic), the fact that they're so woefully outgunned instantly transforms them from predators into prey.  so, yeah, realizing how weak their gun is is significant, because you might find more success challenging them directly rather than trying to flee.

The big thing is that it didn't feel optional because by the time you get to that point you've already played the game three times and the fourth is your final 'finish the game' run.

It even dumps you directly into Inferno when you talk to the characters after killing Diablo the same way that after killing Malachai it would open a portal to Cruel/Merciless. But Inferno was, from the first moment, ludicrously hard to the point where grinding white mobs for trash drops for weeks until you could kill skeleton king, to grind him for weeks to try and get strong enough for the next boss, etc, was completely normal. The final difficulty didn't feel optional any more than Nightmare/Hell did.

"powerlifting","t5_2s4tp","1. I would generally advise against programs like Smolov. While anecdotally a lot of people claim it does them some good you're better off finding something more sustainable. Smolov is more likely to break you than make you stronger in the long run. Maybe try an appropriate Sheiko program.

2. Bench responds well to frequency and GPP, especially for newer lifters. Try to bench 3 days per week and include some variants in there too - dips, push ups, incline, close grip, db press, etc. Even just general bodybuilding work for your upper body will be helpful. Just make sure you're doing enough rowing, curling and rear delt work to keep things like your elbows and shoulders happy.

3. Absolutely compete! If you can lift the bar and the collars to the legal standard of your chosen federation then get on in there. Powerlifters are a very supportive bunch. Don't make the mistake of waiting until you're ""competitive"". Meets are a great way to expose you to the sport, put some external pressure on your training and develop the competition skills required to help you perform when you are competitive. If you can't find any PL clubs in your area try checking online for PL feds in your country. You should be able to sign up there.   ",1506816204
"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","Cube McDravian is a post-human, post-gender, post office clusterfuck situated in the bowels of melkrin's Hell.

Most inhabitants are human, but the post-human Others (a small minority of [hydra-like](http://lifeinfreshwater.net/hydra/) beings) are in control of the somewhat unstable government.  On a good day, the governing body has its shit together enough to project its utopian vision of a world without human forms of identity (race, gender, sexuality, and other things considered to be ""negatory"").

The comic below depicts a typical day in the Cube.  In it, a morality officer dispenses flowers (a rarity) to those humans who obey the strict dress code, and justice to one particular Rich Dude who doesn't.

The claw shown in some of the frames is an implement used by various government entities.  Powered by Isotope-39, a gift from Heaven, it has the power to transform Things into Other Things (it's most commonly used to change humans into Others as a reward for extreme Party loyalty).  It can also do cool stuff like rearrange the city, which is built on a giant Rubik's Cube.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt;Views will go down because nobody will watch bad teams

Actually views have gone down a lot compared to what their previous peaks were.  You have less viewers for a longer amount of time with bo3.  It's not as important that the views might be about the same over time if they are chasing PEAK viewership.

I will watch a game of 2 ""bad"" teams, but I'm not gonna watch a single game in a bo3 with 2 bad teams.  Not everyone has the same viewing habits.  I mean, this gives me time to watch EU now too.

&gt;Cheese strats will hurt good teams

Part of being a good team is being adaptable.  If cheese strats work so well against good teams in bo1, maybe they're not that good?  Imo it's more annoying watching a good team smash a bo3 and helps level the playing field a bit if the ""good teams"" have to also prepare for cheese.

Initiate when:

- enemy team is out of position, ex. Clumped up (easier to be aoed, backline easily deleted since they cant run away fast enough, allows you the tank to cc them)
In low elo, if mage and mm like to be in front/ has shit positioning  attack right away and kill them- easy 5v3
-enemy low health, your team has higher health- usually a good move but must take into factor if your team is bad or good at teamfights because 4 good players can destroy 5 bad teamfighters
- outnumbering, if 2 enemies are at their top and bot lane, gank 5v3 by the time they get there their 3 teammates are dead

- team is higher leveled and more items- good to be agressive here as item/hero stats will give you the advantage 


Also if they are spread out, like 3 at lord and 2 at mid, gank lord side as quickly as possible. By the time their 2 teammates get there, they will suicide and their lord got stolen.

- also make sure if your teammates are following you
If you initiate but your teammates run away (low elo), then you end up dying while teammates call you noob, idiotic tank.

- run away if you feel your team will be wiped out and press retreat

"digimon","t5_2rxw7","1) It is heavily implied that Alphamon is an agent of Yggdrasil rather than Homeostasis. This is why we have seen Alphamon and Jesmon fight a couple times in *tri.* Alphamon was sent in in *Symbiosis* to stop Jesmon from killing Meicoomon, because Yggdrasil *wants* to use Meicoomon to attack the human world. 

2) Yup! That is correct. 

3) Yes, Taichi was simply running away to avoid being swallowed by the emerging fissure. Omegamon only, apparently, had time to save Taichi or Yamato &amp; Meiko. He couldn't save both. Thus Taichi gave a non verbal ""okay"" to go save Yamato &amp; Meiko instead of himself. Omegamon complied and that's why he dashed off away from Taichi.

4) This doesn't have a clear answer. What is *implied* is that in Hikari's despair at seemingly losing her brother, Yggdrasil possessed her and amplified her negative emotions greatly, which then affected Nyaromon severely and gave her enough *dark* power to dark-warp digivolve into Ophanimon Fall Down Mode. That or Homeostasis possessed her or some other unexplained phenomenon. However its highky suggested that it was Yggdrasil at work.

As to why it fused with Meicoomon, that is also currently unclear. Most likely because both Meicoomon and Ophanimon FM were running the same darkness that may have been provided by Yggdrasil (or some other malevolent force). But honestly, I'm still at a loss myself. 

5) Taichi simply empathized with Meiko. He understood that Meicoomon was pretty far gone and at that point had to be stopped completely to avoid more damage to Earth. Her darkness/corruption/virus/Apocalymon/whatever-you-want-to-call-it had accelerated too much and the only way to save her, and by extent the human world, would be to kill her. That's what Meiko, and later the Chosen Children, accepted. Taichi was simply the first one to explicitly agree with her.

Hey all!Today marks the one year anniversary of our initial release on Steam! To celebrate it, we‚Äôve released a brand new interlude - formerly known as ‚Äúshorts‚Äù - for free! Titled Nal Sidian, this five-page story delves into the vortigaunt Dreyfus‚Äô past, and explores his relationship to the nefarious Combine. Our plan is to release a free interlude between every chapter going forward. Now integrated into the app‚Äôs chapter selection menu, these pieces are very much fundamental to the complete story.Speaking of the app, this update also introduces some much needed tweaks and updates! We now have improved language support, and we‚Äôve released Chapter 1 and the first interlude (The Charnel House) for the new languages as well! You can now read through the first section of the comic in Czech, German, Spanish, and Turkish! We will be bringing these languages to Chapters 2, 3, and Nal Sidian in the coming months, as well as continuing to add more languages to our selection. Brazilian Portuguese is next and should be out within a few weeks, with more to come! The translations took us a bit longer to get out the door than we‚Äôd have liked, largely because we no longer had the original files for Chapter 1 and had to reletter it, as well as the looming size of Chapter 2. Our original plan was not to release the language updates incrementally, but we feel it‚Äôs important for our superb team of volunteer translators to see their work on the page! We‚Äôll be forging ahead with the monster that is Chapter 2, and working towards a point where we‚Äôre releasing new chapters simultaneously (or at least nearly simultaneously) across all of our supported languages. The app also now includes integration with our soundtrack, so that you can easily listen to Chris‚Äôs ambient tunes while reading. We have a few other features in the pipeline (including controller support) and there will be more updates to come on the app soon as well! What about Chapter 4?We‚Äôre well over halfway through production on Chapter 4: A Spy in the House of Long, and we could not be more excited about how it‚Äôs coming together. Taking place directly after the Pit debacle, 4 sees Sejal Rajani‚Äôs Opposition, Governor Moore and Major-General Long come head-to-head in a dramatic confrontation on the edge of the city, whilst shedding new light on the Citadel and the mysterious being wrapped around it. We have always suffered from being slow storytellers, and we‚Äôve been very aware of that over the last several months. With that in mind, Chapter 4 really digs deep into New Franklin and applies pressure to the different groups competing for power. It‚Äôs visually stunning, too. The team - which brings back Kristian, Ivan, Ester and Javier - are operating at the top of their game, and between them have created a gorgeous, moody, almost noir-like atmosphere for what‚Äôs shaping up to be the best chapter yet. We‚Äôre super excited about it, and can‚Äôt wait to share it with you all.What else?The first draft of Chapter 5 is complete, and we‚Äôre hoping to push that into production before the end of the year, for an early Spring release. 5 closes the arcs established in Chapter 3, and kicks off a new trajectory for Chapters 6 and 7 in (we think) spectacular fashion! Key word: ‚ÄúMasquerade‚Äù. And of course, you can expect a third interlude between Chapters 4 and 5.As many of you no doubt already know, Marc Laidlaw released a veiled synopsis for Half-Life 2: Episode 3 last month. Ross wrote about it in a blog post titled ""Doctor Breen is Dead"". It was oddly cathartic. Keep an eye out for more blog posts in the future.You might also have noticed that Chapters 2 and 3, as well as the soundtrack, are now on sale! In light of the soundtrack integration, now might be a really good time to pick that up if you haven‚Äôt already.For now, though, please enjoy Nal Sidian and let us know what you think of both it and the app updates. And of course please let us know of any errors you might come across, there are a lot of changes that took place in our app!Until next time!

Muslims refugees will just ruin your country. Ask Australia to use Christmas Island as a relocation program for refugees. They will love it there.

What I meant with weaker grip was just an example of the abstraction of HP. I dunno how to call it, but maybe the *force of will* or even *luck* the target has. Even heard it called *plot armor.*


 **Just mechanically**, someone with 200 hp is not gonna be in a situation where a knife is placed on his neck in a place that would cause lethal damage. Not implying that the attacker is weaker, he might even have higher STR, just that he's not fulfilling all the conditions to be able to down 200 hp in one strike. This might be represented with a weaker grip or any other way.

In contrast, a 10 hp person is someone who easily would be in a position to get a knife to the neck from someone. 

Obviously this is all my opinion. Just trying to keep the mechanical justification of why there would not be instant kills.

"SquaredCircle","t5_2sljg","The reason people don't give WWE any credit is because they make people do a ton of awful shit before they just let them be themselves.

Daniel Bryan was always a nerdy but hardworking guy in the ring, with a violent streak. He never cared what other thought of him, and he was comfortable and confident in himself. But for years they actually hamstrung him by painting those qualities as negative. It was nerd this, dork that, Vegan, goatface, angry troll, all that stuff.

It took them so long to just say, Daniel Bryan is a just Daniel Bryan, he a bit sarcastic, he all business in the ring, and he doesn't like to be told he's not good enough.

How many wrestler had to endure tons of gimmicks that led nowhere, before they were actually given just the freedom to be themselves. The New Day were always funny, they were just seperated and never given the freedom. Same with Breeze and Fandango. Fandango was kind of a creepy idiot way back since the old NXT days. He was gold then, like he's gold now. I always liked Breeze's seriousness in ridiculous situations.

The WWE needs to learn that the best thing to do is just the wrestler work. A gimmick might be done well by a wrestler, but it's the wrestlers that get it over, and are eventually loved by the fans, not the gimmick.

Jericho could show up next week with a gimmick where he's a clown who has explosive diareeha in the ring, and because will probably cheer him on because he's Jericho, they won't sudden love shit clowns.",1506816210

I said it there and I'll say it here, I hope this is open source. If its not... I don't really see the point of having a service such as this. Why would I download your piece of (potentially) mystery software to accomplish something that can already easily be done via PGP + darkweb mail services? There are so many more potential vectors of attack from downloading and running a piece of software as opposed to me visiting a site and using their web application.

I guess I don't exactly understand what the fuck you are trying to accomplish here... Is this a messaging client? Is it meant to be a marketplace eventually? Why would I use your piece of software vs direct email? Is this specifically made for bartards too dumb or fucked up to comprehend PGP and Tor?

Also lol - ""decentralized"" so instead of going to a centralized dark web email server and using opensource PGP tools I compiled on my own machine, I'm now relying on this piece of software centrally developed by some anonymous /r/DNMs poster, and I am to take his word that his sup3r l33t &lt;rypt0 protocol is secure.

"cars","t5_2qhl2","'small frontal offset' is an odd test..  it doesn't quite represent the real world.  Real world heavier cars will do better in crashes.

The test is driving into a wall at 40mph, which essentially represents a head on collision with another equal weight.  So the test is easier for lighter cars.  In real world you won't only have accidents with equal weight cars, on average you'll have a frontal crash with an average weight car.  A lighter-than-avg car will do worse and a heavier-than-avg will do better.

IIHS:
&gt; The forces in the test are similar to those that would result from a frontal offset crash between two vehicles of the same weight, each going just under 40 mph.

Other tests, eg side impact, use a fixed weight for all cars.. so they're all tested equally.

I've often thought Trump's mental decline was from something other than actual dementia. I watched a close family member - over a ten year span - go from forgetting her name to, before her death, being stuck in a fetal position. I saw the Alzheimer's slowly (so terribly slowly) eat away at her mind, bit by bit, for a decade as I was growing up. Sure, her verbal vocabulary shrunk some but she'd say off-the-wall things like she needed to pick up some rainbows at the store because she was almost out or that she needed to get home because some or another long-dead relative was there waiting for her. It was more that than losing the ability to convey complicated thoughts or form coherent sentences. Eventually, she just forgot English and reverted to her native tongue but her talk, before that, was child-like though not necessarily stupid. 

I don't see that type of mental decline in Trump, but it does seem his brain is being affected by *something*. Of course, I could be wrong as dementia and Alzheimer's aren't going to affect everyone identically and I only know the case of my family member directly, but I just get the impression that Trump's mental unfitness is due to something other than age-related dementia. I know people his age that are brilliant and sharp still. Your theory could absolutely explain what's happened to his mind. I hope the media does, indeed, look further into this.",1506816213

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","When it's used in a derogatory manner, it tends to be from a joke of a human being.  I don't think I've ever heard it from anyone I respected or admired so, it tends makes me laugh.  It's funny because when people employ it that way, they think they're actually going to land an insult.   But it is sort of like being called a poopy head by a toddler (it is not unlike the slang ""honkey"" for white people.  It's a spitball at most.)  As an insult, it's weak to the point of being funny.  I  just tend to laugh, then stick a feather in my hat and call it macaroni.  Other Americans unfamiliar with its generic use for ""Americans"" abroad might just be confused by the term.  ""Huh?  Yank?  Yankee doodle?  New York Yankees?  What?""

It's also a fairly misdirected word; you're using a word that whole swaths of the country (southerners) don't recognize as being about themselves (I mean, people familiar with its foreign use do but it still kind of a misnomer).  It would be akin to using some sort of Scottish slur to offend someone from England.  

It's like, ""I see what you tried to do but...that just missed entirely.""  That it has been used by foreigners for Americans generally for a long time is kind of irrelevant to us, I mean, we have a famous revolutionary war song about it, plus a baseball team, and a specific idea of what it means to us.  It's anachronistic.  Olde Timey.  It's somewhat odd to me that people still use it abroad.  It is sort of like if we called the British ""redcoats"" or something.  No one ever uses ""limey"" seriously and it's anachronistic in the same way (scurvy, limes, etc.)

I recognize that it's just used generally as a word for ""Americans"" and by itself, it doesn't bother me, though it is curious that it persists.  I don't think it bothers me when it's used an insult either. 

Yank yourselves happy, whether meant as an insult or otherwise.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Short answer is QA and QC. 

Have at least one person who knows how this shit works and scales in place to help with the design of the server side hardware and software. As components are completed you start to apply tests to them to figure out how and when they will fail and use that, along with some predictions on load, to plan out the launch of the product. 

Between functional and load testing, ideally both driven from somewhere outside of your network (AWS works fairly well) you should have a really good idea of what's going to happen when too many people hop on, and have methods that you've explored to mitigate or at least fail semi-gracefully. 

Add on some network emulation testing to make sure that even people who don't have a good ping will still have a decent user experience. 

Follow that, and unless your launch is wildly more successful than anticipated it should go reasonably well. And for fuck's sake, if you don't know how to do that stuff, hire someone who does. It's not all that hard to do ahead of time, but the further along your product is before you start to worry about it, the more expensive it will be. ",1506816214

"KansasCityChiefs","t5_2s3ft","Welcome to the Chiefs Kingdom!  The most recent generation of Chiefs Teams (Vermeil era, to the Herm Edwards Era, to the Todd Haley era, to the Romeo Crennell era, which brings us to the Andy Reid era) have basically been a middle of the tier or bottom dwelling team, mostly due to terrible defense. We've had a long string of underperforming in the playoffs. Andy Reid has coached the best teams of this group, but he's also had the best players. We've never really drafted a QB high, and we've mostly gone after FA QB's like Joe Montana, Trent Green, Matt Cassel, and Alex Smith. Which is why fans are really excited for Patrick Mahomes, who we traded up to take no.10 overall this year. Most fans expect him to start next year as Alex Smith's replacement. KC teams of basically every era have been known for producing great running-backs, due to a history of having great offensive line play.  At the end of the Vermeil era, we had a potential 4 Hall of Famers along the offensive line (out of 5 lineman) - including Willie Roaf, Bryan Waters, Casey Wieggman (not a HOF'er but could potentially be one), and Will Shields. This offensive line blocked for some of the greatest runners in Chiefs history, including Priest Holmes and Larry Johnson, who were basically money in the bank when it comes to scoring TDs on a weekly basis. KC Chiefs Stadium is known as ""Arrowhead Stadium"" and is a premier tailgating experience, which not all stadiums have. We also have the best mascot ever in KC Wolf. ",1506816214

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Well, there are indicators of an imminent crash, but it's really hard to tell since the main determining factors here are humans, and humans aren't always rational. The policy of subprime mortgages (which was the bad choices that banks made), meant that mortgages were given out to those who shouldn't have recieved them because they don't make enough to pay them off. This was just a very risky move that banks thought would be fine because they can just sell off the house. The problem with that is, when a lot of people default on their mortgage and the banks try to flip a lot of houses, the prices of those houses fall, in the case of the GFC, by a lot. This meant that the banks lost a lot of money. This was an indicator that a crash could happen, along with the increasing house prices that were just too expensive for a large amount of Americans. It's really hard to tell when the crash will happen, because we just can't tell where the tipping point is, but you can predict that a crash will happen although not many actually did predict that a crash would happen so it caught the public by surprise.

As to how we can prevent another crash, crashes happen all the time (usually once every 8 years). We theoretically can stop these crashes by reducing spending in the economy but people make mistakes and mistakes are what cause crashes. The best way to prevent the GFC happening again is to ensure that you bailout all the banks (Lehman Brothers was allowed to collapse which caused the issues for banks in the first place) and that you ensure that they make smart loaning choices. 

I don't actually have first hand experience of the GFC so I'm not 100% sure how bad it was for America (I live in Australia, one of the only English speaking countries who didn't have a large crash so we actually didn't really feel the effects of the GFC). The great depression caused really bad unemployment as in 25% unemployment bad so it was a very damaging and severe economic crash. It lasted from 1930 until WW2 when employment picked up again. WW2 was what got us out of the great depression. 2008 wasn't as bad and I'm fairly sure we won't experience a great depression level crash again since banks are backed now by the fed who wouldn't let a crash of that scale happen (they'd do what they did in 2008 again) and congress would back them too.",1506816215

&gt;
&gt;TLDR of original post: After our mom died, people from HOA came to me and my sister and told us that we're no longer a single family and one of us needs to leave.
&gt;
&gt;So I first confirmed that they are from the HOA, not just some people harassing us for the fun of it. We also got the CC&amp;R of the HOA, which included a clause about single family and it's weird definition. If included partners, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, step parents, step children, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, children of uncles and aunts, children of nieces and nephews, BUT NO SIBLINGS. It even had a clause that said co-owners are not allowed to live there unless they are a single family based on the definition.
&gt;
&gt;We also received a letter from them telling us of our violation and demanding us to comply.
&gt;
&gt;So my sister and I went around the neighborhood and gave copies of the terms and the letter we received to everyone and told them ""imagine you died tomorrow, do you want them to kick out your kids? Because they're doing it to us. They will do it to your kids as well. Help us stop them.""
&gt;
&gt;We gathered signatures and had almost everyone contact the president and demand that this should stop. Within two weeks, we received a letter that says this has been a mistake with an apology.
&gt;
&gt;We learned that this HOA is horrible to everyone, not just us. So there are now people preparing to run for the HOA board to replace the current members and they're promising to have a referendum about whether the HOA should be dissolved or not, because it really is doing nothing of substance except being a pain in the butt of everyone.
&gt;
&gt;Summary: HOA backed off after we told everyone what they're trying to do. We will vote the board out of office and there will be a referendum about dissolving it altogether as we don't need it.

And what about Republic City or Zaofu? They were already stable, and they wanted nothing to do with Kuvira, but she forced them to join anyway. And then there's the fact that she turns every town she helps into a labor camp, and sends the dissenters to prison. At what point do you ask whether or not the price you're paying for stability is worth it?

The would still take almost a week to get ready and they couldn't leave port until the hurricane was a certain distance away. So we're talking about days. The Hurricane swept


Here is the status of the Hurricane a couple days ago:

http://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/tracking-maria-maria-downgraded-to-tropical-storm-with-70-mph-winds/614646434

http://www.express.co.uk/news/weather/855962/Hurricane-Maria-path-map-where-is-now-tracking-maps-models-NOAA-track-Caribbean

So let's see PR was hit around 10 days ago Sept 20th in the morning. You still couldn't said aid there obviously. 

It was still in the path 9 days ago. 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/national/hurricane-maria/?utm_term=.ac9114cef025

In fact it was still in the way and posed a risk to ships traveling from the East Coast even a couple days ago.

Let's just assume they could reasonably leave Saturday. That means if they were 100% ready and optimal conditions with still a risk of the storm affecting movement of the ship. So they get there Sunday/Monday maybe.

All this is a couple of days. Now let's hold the government of PR to the same standard.

They knew the hurricane was coming and failed to provide working generators to all the hospitals. Many are still lacking personal. The ones with generators fail to have enough fuel on hand. Even though they knew this weeks in advance.

PR failed to mobilize all the National Guard. They failed to get the ships out of the harbor. Many still haven't prepared a damage report. PR is unable to distribute supplies due to employees not showing up. One reason they didn't show up is because they told them not to and to call a phone number. Phones are down.

Then you have decades of mismanagement causing the power lines to not be ready, the roads to not be able to withstand it, and not even a good hurricane disaster plan.

Let's be real we're arguing over ifs and buts of the military getting a hospital ship there a couple days in advance with OPTIMAL conditions and great foresight. Yet we keep ignoring the failure on many levels of the local government. Failures on levels for decades.

 I thought my husband was funny looking when I first dated him.

He's a brilliant, hilarious little pint-sized math nerd who is basically the only person in the world who understands me, and the only person who doesn't confuse the hell out of me. 

 IMO people are shallow AS FUCK in how they act like they want a serious relationship but won't pay a moment's notice to someone who's any less than a 7/10. Like I swear to god, those people's supposed longing for commitment and intimacy is literal bullshit. If you grow old with someone, they're not going to look like a model anymore. All you're going to be left with are their morals, values and sense of humor. God knows, so many people marry hot assholes, and their marriage goes South so fast, it's ridiculous. This shit is why like half of all people get divorced. My friends all date these cheating, sometimes abusive rat bastards, and then make fun of my husband for being 5'4"", while simultaneously asking me why their lives can't be happy like mine.

Edit: Played it for about an hour, so here is a mini review.

It actually feels quite polished, from the nice card art and voice lines, to having a fully voiced single player campaign. Gameplay wise, it's very very much a ripoff of Gwent. Three rows, three rounds, one card per turn, factions with special leader cards.

Balance-wise, it feels more like Witcher 3 Gwent. Cards tend to be low value with no ability, or spells that give no points but have an effect (like adding immunity, or moving a unit), so you can get out-tempoed easily using these cards. Also card draw effects are way under-valued. So it feels like the primitive version of Gwent from TW3 rather than a balanced multiplayer game. But I've only played the SP portion.",1506816221

I am a student at the University of Iowa as well (a bit older than you, I'm 21) who just finished the first draft of a novel that looks to be about the same length as yours. Unlike you, I'm nowhere near ready to have it published. First off, congratulations! Secondly, how was the process of self-publishing? It's something I will most likely do when I feel my novel is ready, so I'd like to hear about your journey. Finally, how did you decide when the book was finished? It seems that no matter how many revisions I make, I always think that something is lacking. I might be able to better polish the characters, trim down fluff to better specify motivations, or just make all-around improvements. As a result, it seems like I'm going to be trapped in a never-ending loop of revisions. Any advice would be appreciated. I'll make sure to check out your book when I get through my current reading list. Again, congratulations!",1506816224

2. 90% of the battles are initiated by Jerry. Even if they were initiated by Tom, it's justified because he's pretty much fulfilling one of his purposes as a housecat.¬†

3. Tom has a conscience. In one episode, he threw Jerry and either Nibbles or that little duck outside in a horrible storm, and locked them out of the house. He was so troubled and overcome with guilt from being so cruel, he went out to search for them and bring them back to shelter and safety. Jerry and Nibbles once stole food from a banquet Tom was supposed to be guarding, effectively getting him *executed* at the guillotine. They didn't care either, they just ate their food and sauntered away knowing full well they just got a guard killed. On top of that, Tom has even rescued Jerry from certain doom at the hands of other foreign foes.¬†

4. Jerry has taken advantage of the kindness of Spike, the bulldog that makes appearances occasionally. Spike, based on his own observations, sees Jerry to be an innocent mouse ritualistically tormented by Tom, so he defends him from Tom on some basis. Jerry has hit Spike with a golf club, repeatedly endangered/harmed him and his son, and framed Tom for all those misdeeds. This is how Jerry treats someone who defends him against Tom.¬†

On top of that, you won't have 2 INT Frieza's on rotation constantly lowering SSJ3 Goku's attack. The only sacrifice is Broly starting off on 6 ki.

Even sadder reality is, if you don't already know someone who personally knows the hiring manager and can refer you, you won't get called for that job anyways. It's probably already filled or in the process of being filled. Too many are willing to take that shit support Rep job just to get into Nintendo and work up from within.

"anime","t5_2qh22","Well... It's not my place to judge your taste and I can't say anything at all about the characters or the story (which doesn't make sense until much later), but uhh...

Shaft is my favorite studio for their avant-garde visuals. If you watch any other shaft show (or at least the ones after Akiyuki Shinbo) you will see that monogatari art direction isn't even *that* different. The directing style is of course tailored around the original light novels (which Nisio Isin himself claimed to be ""unadaptable"" until Shinbo/Shaft convinced him otherwise). This story, at least according to the original author, must be told exactly in the way it was. 

If you don't like the characters or the story don't sweat it, but attacking the directing style by claiming it was trying to hard to be avant-garde and original misses the point a bit. 

&gt;this anime tried too much to be original, tried too much to give the impression it was extremely clever *instead of telling a story*

Then they went ahead and buffed SE so now we're back to ""It's only a DPS gain if it gives you a healer GCD"" which is such a dumb mentality to have as a tank.

Someone else also had the interesting idea of making a DA-TBN to give DRK a raid wide mitigation option. You'd only get 100 Blood out of it(minus whatever points you already had), but that's just as much as you'd get from two TBNs for the same cost, so it'd give DRK something to compete with Divine Veil and Shake It Off without crippling its DPS from spending 4800MP.",1506816230

"CCW","t5_2s4mc","A new holster is next. I had purchased that one solely because when I first started open carrying, there was a slight uncertainty. 

Kentucky law explicitly says that if a handgun is stored in an enclosed container in a vehicle that was installed by the original manufactured (glove box, back seat pockets, or center console) it is not considered concealed. It is silent on if it is considered concealed if I am carrying it on body in the car. I was worried about risking a illegal concealment charge. So I put it in the center console when driving. Which, obviously, needed some sort of holster. 

After a while, I just said fuck it and stopped unholstering and reholstering my gun every time I got in and out of my truck. If they're going to hit me with a concealment charge for carrying it on body in my car, they were going to find something to hit me with anyway even if it was in my center console. 

Any holsters you would recommend for an S&amp;W SD9VE?

Didn't realize i had to write a tightly crafted statement really as i didn't plan on seeing anyone here i didn't think it necessary. As for what i'm hoping for i never expected an high response rate, my OP is out of concern for my references.

&gt; You are tone deaf to yourself. We all are to a certain extent, but if you are unwilling to look at the feedback without feeling defensive then you will be stuck there. I am not saying this stuff because I have an ax to grind, I am saying it becasue I actually want to help clients and providers connect in a way that is positive for both of them, and often times it is not as positive as it can be because clients don't understand why they are upsetting or offending the provider, and the provider is either limited in what she can say in response of doesn't have the emotional energy to ""teach"" another tone deaf man.

Lacking affective empathy i will never understand really why people get upset regardless of setting.

&gt; I happen to have that energy, and I have 20 plus years of experience to back up what I am saying. You don't have to listen, just like you don't have to do anything that is good for you, but be aware that this is the core of the problem you complain about in your OP.
&gt; We always have choices and yours lead to unhappy endings for you. You don't want to change. Have fun with that.

Once again I'm able to get responses, i'm not dissatisfied with that.

Some say they aren't taking new clients, some say they're not available and some don't reply at all. Usually those 3 groups make up half of the group emails i send out.

My way is trade off for efficiency to being inconsiderate but i imagine is best to stay in the good graces of your references. So i thought to ask what standard practice and etiquette was to not stand out from other clients.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/a0dc0410107a4df586c34d34191fabdb.png)  

&gt; Deep Purple is an English hard rock band that formed in Hertfordshire in 1968. Together with groups such as  Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, they're considered as heavy metal pioneers. Especially influential to later metal bands were Ian Gillan's powerful screams and Ritchie Blackmore's virtuoso solos. Deep Purple were also very influential to progressive music as well, with their style evolving over the years and incorporating a variety of genres from art rock to blues to psychedelia and more.

&gt; The Early Days:
Deep Purple's early output ranged from energetic rock (such as their cover of Joe South's ""Hush"", which became an iconic radio hit that climbed to #4 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart) to strongly classically influenced pieces (such as ""April"", a fan-loved gem from their third album). Their first few albums contained very long solos, such as those on the band's covers of ""Hey Joe"" and ""I'm So Glad"". The appeal of the more heavy, arena-friendly tracks from the group brought them considerable success in the U.S., setting them apart from many English contemporaries, particularly in their 1968 debut album 'Shades of Deep Purple'.

&gt; After their third album, founding member and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore in particular felt the band should move in a harder direction. He additionally felt that then singer Rod Evans and bassist Nicky Simper were incapable of working in that direction. Both were therefore let go, and Blackmore had them replaced with singer Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover from pop rock group Episode Six. What is now thought of as the classic Deep Purple line-up came to be when keyboardist Jon Lord and drummer Ian Paice came in, this line-up being often labeled as 'MK II' (in contrast to the previous 'MK I' with Evans and Simper). 

&gt; The first output of this revamped group was a mixed electric and orchestral album with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, 'Deep Purple in Concert', with the centrepiece being Lord's ""Concerto for Group and Orchestra"". The 1969 release earned some international commercial success despite (or, prehaps, because of) its novetly, reaching #149 on the Billboard 200 chart. The whole project was reputedly initiated after idle chat with the band's manager about the possibility led to him book the orchestra and give the inexperienced composer a deadline to produce the work of a public concert. 

&gt; Following on from this unusual venture were four very influential studio albums over the next four years: 'Deep Purple in Rock', 'Fireball, Machine Head', and 'Who Do We Think We Are?', and the live album 'Made in Japan'. Aside from earning widespread critical acclaim, the band's influence spread as many new hard rock groups looked to their sound. American audiences ate the English group up, with album after album rising up the Billboard 200 chart.
 
Though this lineup still recorded some songs with a lighter, almost pop-like tone such as ""Strange Kind of Woman"" and ""Black Night"", the influence of their new blood and the impetus this provided to the existing members pushed the band strongly in the direction of heavy rock music. Songs such as ""Speed King"", ""Child in Time"", and the massively popular ""Smoke on the Water"" showed the fiery spirit of the group, with Deep Purple achieving sustained international commercial success.

&gt; In 1973, creative tensions led to Gillan and Glover leaving the band, being replaced by previously unknown singer David Coverdale and ex-Trapeze bassist/singer Glenn Hughes. This new lineup continued the success of their predecessors, recording the albums Burn and Stormbringer, and further successful tours and live albums. However, Blackmore became disenchanted with the increasing funk direction he felt the band was taking and left to form Rainbow (a name inspired by the stage set when they performed at the California Jam music festival) with former members of Elf, who had previously toured with Deep Purple as a support act. 

&gt; The band recruited former James Gang guitarist Tommy Bolin and recording Come Taste the Band. It was on the 75/76 tour that the tensions within the band really came to the surface, finishing with their final performance in Liverpool in March 1976, where Coverdale resigned and the band ceased to exist. Tommy Bolin died of a heroin overdose in December 1976 whilst on tour with his solo band. 

&gt; Coverdale went on to form Whitesnake, with Paice and Lord joining Tony Ashton to form the short-lived Paice, Ashton and Lord before they too joined Coverdale in Whitesnake. Hughes completed a solo album but spent most of the 70s and 80s fighting drug addiction which he finally overcome in the 90s and has since produced a string of solo albums. 

&gt; Back again (MK II the 2nd): 
In 1984, Deep Purple's best-known second lineup (Ian Gillan, Jon Lord, Ian Paice, Roger Glover, and Richie Blackmore) reunited to produce the albums Perfect Strangers and The House of Blue Light. Tensions returned however, and Gillan was fired and replaced by Joe Lynn Turner, formerly of Rainbow. This lineup only lasted for one album, Slaves and Masters, before Ian Gillan returned again for The Battle Rages On. Blackmore subsequently departed the band for good while touring in support of this album, being temporarily replaced by Joe Satriani. During this time, many archival live albums of the original Deep Purple lineup were released, such as Scandinavian Nights (a 1988 release of a 1970 concert) and King Biscuit Flower Hour (a 1995 release of two 1976 concerts) 

&gt; The remaining members recruited Dixie Dregs/Kansas guitarist Steve Morse and, revitalised, produced what many regarded as their best work in many years, Purpendicular, then Abandon before Lord retired and was replaced by former Rainbow and Ozzy Osbourne keyboardist Don Airey. This lineup has since recorded the albums Bananas and Rapture of the Deep. 

&gt; While not as influential or commercially successful as in their original incarnation, the band have remained a successful studio and live act throughout this latest period.

"space","t5_2qh87","I don't think thats really a great counterexample. It can only carry like 230 tons, which (while larger than smallsat-class) still results in an upper limit of probably 6 or 7 tons to LEO, expendable, which is still too small for most payloads. Adding reuse will cut that back down to smallsat scales (and reusability is not an option anymore. Any newly developed launcher which is not reusable will fail). Falcon 9 is probably about the absolute smallest I'd consider ""worthwhile"", in that it can meet a non-negligible number of commercial and non-military government performance requirements (remember, the bulk of the launch market is still GTO missions) while still having margin for at least partial reuse, and its over twice that weight. And there is very, very little useful commonality with the 747, so that adds a shitload of extra costs, as mentioned above.

Probably the only decent-ish air launch concept was Crossbow. Still a custom plane, but far larger than this, to the point of being able to carry an EELV-class launcher (and they planned evolvability to a reusable air-launch SSTO), and they understood the economic issue of an aircraft that only flies a few times a year and planned to remedy that by using it for wide cargo delivery on Earth. But there isn't actually much demand for that service, so it fizzled",1506816239

Congratulations on publishing your book :) My question is about character development. I have an idea for a fiction story that's been brewing and changing for a couple years now. I've got a good enough idea of the world and outline of events where I think I can start scribbling something down, but I'm at a complete loss on developing my main group of characters, even my protagonist. The only character I have any details for I somehow developed in the span of minutes, like a bolt of lightning. 

Should I expect the others to be similar? Should I just force something? I feel like it's the only mental barrier I have left to getting words down.

Thanks!",1506816239

Just admit he's a hypocrite and be honest with yourself. 

All Trump has to do is say that we won't refuel their bombers and the war would end. Simple as that. 

Women and children being killed is totally predictable so he doesn't get credit for not specifically ordering their deaths. 

I know circumstances. It was a raid that the Obama administration wasn't even comfortable with. Trump is so in love with generals and so dumb that he signed off on whatever they put in front of him. Besides the innocents, only a couple of low levels al-Qaeda fighters were killed. A score of innocents and an American operator aren't worth that. Trump rolled the dice with lives and lost a service-member as well as the daughter of an American citizen. Trump couldn't even wait two weeks to commit his first war crime.

Thank you so much! :)
For character development I would suggest writing out the GMC's of each of your characters. Start with the goals- what do they want? Remember to do external goals (getting the treasure) versus external goals (like overcoming past hurts). Then you have motivations- what is driving them to go for their goals? This also has an internal an external factors. Then you have the crisis (also internal and external) from there you'll get a good idea of your characters and what they want and why. I would encourage you to just imagine your characters like they're real people (I treat mine like they are) and explore their personalities. It'll come to you. 
I'd say it all comes in time- as soon as I started writing I knew some of my characters, the others were more shy and I had to learn them slowly, but never force them to tell you who they are. You'll end up not being true to them and the readers will be able to tell. Just start word puking on the page and eventually your brain will uncover what it already knows.

No they don't.

&gt; Progressives feel they've been used for years by the Obamas, Clintons and their minions who demand Progressives' votes, but then move the party further to the right.

This is obviously wrong, though. The party is way to the left of what it was before the Clintons came along.

&gt; When Progressives get uppity and demand a true left-leaning candidate, the middle of the road Dems slap Progressives around and raise the ghost of liberals-past (Dukakis, Gore) to claim Progressives are un-electable. But 2016 proves middle of roaders like Clinton are un-electable.

You described Obama as a middle of the roader and he won twice.

&gt; Middle of the road, status quo, campaigning against a candidate instead of campaigning for the greater good, is not inspiring. Appealing to interest groups, but ignoring issues that appeal to multiple groups, just hands votes to your opponent

A friend of mine were in the middle backseat of a car that went 150/km straight front first into a tree which totaled the entire front of the car all the way in to about half of the two front seats, killing both the driver and the passenger in the front. It left my friend in the backseat clinging on to what little life was left but she died on the spot soon after the ambulance and medics arrived... Really sad story but I think she died fron internal damages from the seatbelt she was wearing, but she most likely didn't stand a chance without it either. 

I've just always been curious about the effect of seatbelts in those kind of situations ever since, and it's not really being discussed publically at all since most times seatbelts saves lives, and when they don't you never really know if the end result would've been any different had the person been thrown out of the car etc.

"PUBATTLEGROUNDS","t5_3fmbm","&gt; Everyone is aware of the problems with PubG, but too many people don't realize that money =/= problem being fixed and it also happens to take time.

That would be accurate if the problems plaguing the game haven't existed for an extended period of time and still aren't fixed.

The issue with the main menu defaulting to Solo TPP has existed since the game came out over six months ago. Steam has this on its page: ""RELEASE DATE: Mar 23, 2017"" 

Not only has that not been fixed, [even though it would take less than an hour](https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/732lf4/im_getting_really_sick_of_the_pubg_communitys/dnneohc/), but a new bug has been introduced where the server defaults to Asia for everyone ***even though it was working fine before that***. 

One guy spending less than an hour fixing something that costs millions of players seconds every time they encounter it (which is every time they interact with the main menu) is worthwhile because it's the GOD DAM UI. You don't make bad UI for software you want people to use. You make it for software you don't want them to use. Because they aren't gonna want to use it if it is irritating to use it. 

This is just one example. Crouch-jumping being broken is inherently related to jumping through windows since they are intangible. They don't make noise. They don't need to be pre-broken. They don't cause damage either. This gives people who do it an unfair advantage. 

It wouldn't take one developer manually fixing every window to be tangible a month to do it. He might miss some, but those would be reported and then he'd fix those. 

There are teams of developers who work on video games in most cases. A UI team. A netcode team. A game asset team. A game balance team. That type of thing.

No progress for some things isn't acceptable. Especially when they're little things that irritate many people because they're constant. 

The black box glitch when Post Processing is turned up on red dots has existed since release as well. It wasn't fixed until literally everyone had it when Post Processing was forced on universally. That shouldn't have been a thing. It should've been fixed in a reasonable time frame after it was first reported. Like every other bug that affects many and occurs often.",1506816248

There are no laws against drinking for minors in almost all places actually. There are only laws against the sale of alcohol to people younger than 16-18 years old.

It's always funny to me that in the USA you can commit a ""crime"" by ingesting a substance by yourself into your own body just because you're young. It's beyond idiotic. (It's the same logic with other drugs, but at least without the age differentiation and the ""official rationale"" is that by doing illicit drugs you're supporting the drug trade and its consequences, which obviously can't in any way or shape apply to alcohol).

"ruby","t5_2qh21","The problem is that real life is messy and ugly. I think too many developers try hard to clean up real life rather than write their apps to function in that messy reality.

Using sinatra, roda etc are great if your app isn't doing much but in real life your app is going to need a ton of stuff like reloading, intricate authentication and authorization, dealing with hostile actors, rate limiting, caching, access to third party APIs and libs, scheduled tasks, background tasks, deployment, clustering, session management, asset management etc.

""simple"" frameworks like roda and sinatra kick the can down the road. Oh look how simple and fast this example code is! Sure it's unsafe to put in production but hey it's fast and only 100 lines long!

By the time you add all the plugins (half of which are unmaintained and undocumented), wrote all the rake tasks, broken up your routes to different files, written all the helpers you need, your new shiny app is as slow as rails and still doesn't do half of what rails does.  You just wasted weeks of work trying to recreate something that has existed under your nose the whole time.

One reason you spent all that time was because the documentation was so weak and you spent hours googling how to do simple stuff.  Some plugins have no place to even ask questions, others send you to vacant slack channels or gitter or who knows what. It's messy and ugly.


What's worse is that rails has a top notch team working on it 24X7 while your pet framework has one or two guys who work on it sporadically.  It will never keep up.

Is rails perfect? Fuck no. It's a memory pig and the team really should spend an entire release doing nothing but memory optimization and speed optimization but the tradeoffs of not using it for production work are too much if you ask me.

I had high hopes for Hanami or another full stack framework to compete with rails but Hanami has another set of dogma it follows and like rails it has found itself intertwined with itself.   I guess that's inevitable. Life is messy solutions that deal with life end up being messy.",1506816256

"Austria","t5_2qo9i","Das ist zwar nicht wirklich eine Antwort auf das, was du gefragt hast, aber hier sind ein paar DInge, die ich in meiner Zeit als Mathematikstudent (Hauptuni, Master) gelernt hab:

1. Mathematik ist vollkommen anders als Schulmathematik. Nicht nur das, die Mathematik, die du sp√§ter machen wirst ist vollkommen anders als die in den ersten Semestern. Gerade deswegen klingen viele Konzepte unmotiviert, wenn du ihnen zum ersten Mal begegnest und erst sp√§ter wird ihre wahre Bedeutung klar. ZUdem stehen die Motivationen f√ºr die Einf√ºhrung einzelner Gebiete oft miteinander in Konflikt. Zum Beispiel ist eines der ersten F√§cher Analysis, die Lehre vom Differenzieren und Integrieren (sehr grob gesagt). Aus abstrakt mathematischer Perspektive sind Diiferentiale und Integrale sehr komplexe Dinge, deren ""algebraische"" Beschreibung (im Sinne von Beschreibung als Rechenoperationen) eine nichttriviale Frage und vielleicht nicht gerade Stoff f√ºrs erste Semester w√§re (oder nur sehr anders, siehe 4.). Aus physikalisch motivierter Sicht ergibt es absolut Sinn, Analysis m√∂glichst fr√ºh einzuf√ºhren, weil zb. quasi alle physikalischen Prozesse Differentialgleichungen involvieren und die L√∂sung derselben ein gigantisches Teilgebiet angewandter Mathematik ist. DIese verschiedenen Herangehensweisen sorgen daf√ºr, dass viele Studierenden recht schnell eine Vorliebe entweder f√ºr Algebra oder Analysis entwickeln. Ich bin tief im algebraischen Teil des Spektrums angesiedelt, aber seitdem ich die ""algebraische Formulierung"" von Analysis kenne, finde ich, dass es mehr die f√ºr mich unmotivierte Einf√ºhrung von Analysis war, die mich abgeschreckt hat als die Analysis selbst. Das bringt mich auch zum zweiten Punkt:

2. Leute entwickeln recht schnell mathematische Geschm√§cker, und das kann dann auch gleich mal mit dem Curriculum clashen, das klarerweise versucht, m√∂glichst ""mainstream zu sein"". Am Anfang des Studiums l√§sst sich nicht wirklich sagen, wo es dich letzten Endes hinverschlagen wird, und du bist selbst daf√ºr verantwortlich, dich m√∂glchst vielen Richtungen auszusetzen, um zu sehen, welche f√ºr dich die Richtige ist. Ich geb dir trotzdem schnell eine sehr unvollst√§ngige Liste von Gebieten, auf die du einen Blick werfen solltest, und die in gewisser Weise Geschmackspole sind. Der n√§chste Absatz ist hoch subjektiv, und nachdem der Post sowieso schon so lang ist, kannst du sonst auch die anderen Punkte vorher lesen.

In Zahlentheorie geht es darum, Gesetze zu finden, die die nat√ºrlichen Zahlen befolgen. Vor allem geht es um Primzahlvermutungen und im weiteren Sinne um die Frage, wie Addition und Multiplikation zusammenh√§ngen. DIe Wahrheit ist n√§mlich,  dass es be√§ngstigend wenig Muster in dem Verh√§ltnis der beiden gibt. Als Beispiel versuch mal, herauszufinden, wiie die Primfaktorzerlergung der Summe zweier Zahlen von der der Summanden abh√§ngt. Generell ist dieses Gebiet gut,wenn du √ºber eine gute Intuition f√ºr Zahlen verf√ºgst, und wahrscheinlich noch dem am n√§chsten, was normale Leute unter Mathematik verstehen. Eine Stufe abstrakter ist Gruppentheorie, die die konkrete Struktur der nat√ºrlichen Zahlen mit dem abstrakteren Begriff der Gruppe ersetzt. Irgendwer bekanntes hat mal sowas gesagt wie ""Gruppentheorie ist abstrahiertes Rechnen"" oder so, was den Nagel auf den Kopf trifft.Sie ist aber eines der wichtigeren Gebiete abstrakter Algebra. Generell ist Zahlentheorie meistens die Disziplin, f√ºr die gewaltige mathematische Theorien geschaffen werden, die aber im Gegenzug kaum etwas verwertbares an den Rest der Mathematik zur√ºckgibt. Die Sachen die sie zur√ºckgibt laufen aber oft √ºber Gruppentheorie, weil sich viele S√§tze √ºber die nat√ºrlichen Zahlen recht einfach auf Gruppen verallgemeinern lassen. Der n√§chste Schritt nach Gruppen sind Ringe, und hier f√§ngt Algebra an, geometrische Bedeutung zu gewinnen, was algebraische Geometrie hervorbringt. Algebraische Geometrie in ihrer heutigen Form ist erst im letzten Jahrhundert entstanden und nimmt eine Art sweet Spot in der Mathematik ein, weil sie geometrisch in ihrer Intuition ist, abstrakt in ihrer Formulierung und hochkomplex in ihrer Theorie. Einer der gro√üen Boni von AlgGeo ist, dass abstrakte algebraische Eigenschaften eine geometrische Entsprechung erhalten und umgekehrt. Eine Maschinerie, die In AlgGeo extrem wichtig ist, zunehmend aber Bedeutung in jedem einzelnen Gebiet der Mathematik erlangt ist Kategorientheorie. Ich kann dir nur raten, einen ernsten Blick auf Kategorientheorie zu werfen (unten Literatur), weil sie f√ºr den richtigen Verstand so etwas wie ein goldener Schl√ºssel zu jedem einzelnen anderen Gebiet sein kann und mehr und mehr zu einer Grundsprache von Mathematik wird. Hier m√∂chte ich kurz das Verh√§ltnis zu Mengenlehre, der anderen Grundstruktur der Mathematik, eingehen. Mengenlehre gibt uns eine Antwort auf die Frage ""K√∂nnen wir eine mathematische Struktur finden, von solcher Gr√∂√üe und Komplexit√§t, dass wir jede andere Struktur darin ausdr√ºcken k√∂nnen?"". Kategorientheorie dagegen versucht die Frage ""Wie k√∂nnen wir eine Sprache schaffen, die es uns erm√∂glicht, die essentiellen Eigenschaften einer Konstruktion herauszukristallisieren, ohne uns mti den Details besch√§ftigen zu m√ºssen?"" zu beantworten. Ein gutes Beispiel ist die Definition eines Vektorraums: Wir k√∂nnten uns ohne Probleme einen Vektorraum in der Sprache der Mengenlehre definieren, der Prozess w√§re nur unheimlich anstrengend und w√ºrde keinen Erkenntnisgewinn hervorbringen. Auf der anderen Seite braucht die Definition eines Vektorraums mit Katgeorientheorie nur einen Satz und ergiebt vollkommenen Sinn, wenn du die allgemeine Theorie dahinter kennst. Deshalb unterstreiche ich die Bedeutung von Kategorientheorie so: sie wirkt in vielen Bereichen wie ein exponentieller Bonus, den du durch einen Haufen initialer Energie erwerben kannst, und je fr√ºher du das tust, desto mehr ""Zinsen"". Aber Mengenlehre und Kategorientheorie stehen in gewisser Weise f√ºr verschiedene Herangehensweisen an Mathematik, und ich bevorzuge die zweitere sehr stark, weil mir vorkommt, dass die erstere in vielen F√§llen einfach aus Sturheit an unintuitiven Herangehensweisen festh√§lt und sich so das Leben selber schwer macht (jeder, der mal ein Lehrbuch axiomatischer Mengenlehre gelesen hat wei√ü wovon ich rede). Dennoch halte ich es f√ºr wichtig zu erw√§hnen, dass es ein Fach gibt, universelle Algebra, das tief in der Mengenlehretradition ist und f√ºr viele Strukturen andere Beschreibungen liefert als Kategorientheorie. Besonders spannend ist Modelltheorie, die Mischung von universeller Algebra mit Logik, die teilweise verbl√ºffende Ergebnisse hervorbringt. Aus kategorientheoretischer Sicht ist Modellthorie eines der wenigen mathematischen Teilgebiete, die noch immer keinen Sinn ergeben.  Auf der exakt gegen√ºberliegenden Seite zu Algebra liegt Topologie: das Studium von Formen, ohne R√ºcksicht auf exakte Messungen. Das bekannte Beispiel ist, dass ein Doughnut topologisch genau gleich aussieht wie eine Tasse mit Griff. W√§hrend es in Algebra um Rechenoperationen geht, geht es in Topologie um abstrakte R√§ume. Umso sch√∂ner ist es zu sehen, dass sie eigentlich (aber nicht wirklich) genau dasselbe sind. Darum geht es in algebraischer Topologie, ein Gebiet, das, √§hnlich wie algebraische Geometrie, an einem sweet Spot von Anschaulichkeit, Abstraktion und Komplexit√§t liegt und tiefe Verbindungen zu Kategorientheorie hat. √úbrigens ist algebraische Topologie ein Gebiet, das unumg√§nglich f√ºr manche Gebiete neuerer Physik ist, insbesondere Quantenfeldtheorie und Stringtheorie.

Das sind die Gebiete der Mathematik, f√ºr die ich mich interessiere. Es gibt dutzende, die ich nicht erw√§hnt habe, und von denen ich keine Ahnung hab, und umgekehrt lernst du die meisten davon im Bachelor nie kennen. Das f√ºhrt mich zum n√§chsten Punkt:

3. Profs&amp;Co k√∂nnen dir nur beschr√§nkt weiterhelfen. Insbesondere haben sie alle ihre eigenen Geschm√§cker, die nicht unbedingt mit deinen √ºbereinstimmen werden. Au√üerdem sind unsere Universit√§ten, und ganz besonders der Bachelorunterricht in vieler Hinsicht ziemlich altmodisch. Wenn du wirklich moderne Mathematik kennenlernen willst, musst du selbst suchen. Das geht auch nahtlos √ºber in meinen n√§chsten Punkt:",1506816257

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","During WWI (and immediately after) Germany was under British naval blockade. This meant not only that German people were under constant threat of starvation (some estimates put the number of deaths caused by starvation in the ballpark of 500000), but also that the whole war industry was having supply problems. Ersatz goods, like synthetic rubber and limited trade for valuable resources (via neighboring neutral countries or with blockade runners) can only get you so far. German troops would often describe abysmal condition of their equipment, with everything from uniform buttons and leather straps to artillery gun barrels being in short supply in addition to ever-present food shortages. 

You also have to keep in mind, that even with Russia out of the war, Germany and Austria-Hungary was still fighting on multiple fronts, with Italian and Balkan theatre still open. With the entry of the US, with its fresh troops and untouched industry, the long term outlook was dire for the Central Powers. Basically, Germany was running out of everything that is needed to fight a war: manpower, money, food and industrial capacity. 

German high command of course realized this, but they also knew that Entente situation wasn't much better at the moment. While supply problem wasn't as bad for Britain and France, both colonial powers with sizable navies and trade capabilities, manpower problem was at least just as bad. French army, with recent mutiny crisis was extremely demoralized, and Americans haven't arrived in sizable numbers yet, not to mention that while fresh, well fed and motivated, US troops were no match for the hardened veterans of the continental warfare, at least for the time being. Russia was tying up bulk of German resources in the East, so after Brest-Litovsk Germany found themselves with around 50 free divisions. 

In March 1918 Germans started their big offensive, known simply as the Spring Offensive, Ludendorff Offensive or Kaiserschlacht. The idea was to gain as much as possible to force armistice, before newly arriving American troops could equalize the temporary disparity. No clear objective of the offensive was established, unlike with previous large scale battles of the western front, with the idea to exploit local tactical situation to gain ground and break through enemy forces. The ideal scenario was a wide breakthrough and outflanking the British forces holding the northern part of the front.

While the offensive itself employed number of revolutionary tactical innovations, such as widespread use of infiltration tactics by German stormtroopers and saw the biggest territorial gains in the West since 1914, it failed to break the French and British. By the April 1918 the danger of a wide breakthrough had passed and Germans used up their strongest troops, especially picked from every unit just to lead the charge in the offensive, enormous amount of materiel set aside for the offensive and were now in possession of vast amounts of relatively low value ground, which was hard to defend with depleted troops. What followed was the Hundred Days Offensive in the West, retaking all the ground lost and braking through the Hindenburg line, with new offensive in the Balkans from the Greek territory, which led Germany to sign the armistice in November 1918.

So long story short, Germany in 1918 was in no position to prolong the war, because of the blockade and the US entry into the war, took the opportunity that arose to finish the war before it became hopeless with the Spring Offensive, but failed win it decisively and force the French to surrender.

And what about Asians (""chinks,"" as you called them) did I ignore?  That the average Asian IQ is three points above that of whites?  3 points is well inside a standard deviation (that's for NE Asians, btw - SE Asians average well below whites), so it's hard to claim that they are ""smarter' than whites.  Do you know what a standard deviation is?  You should, since you claim to have read the Bell Curve.  Further, it's not really an apples-to-apples comparison, as those data were taken largely from Americans of Asian descent, which is a filtered sample.  Or do you disagree? ",1506816257

"europe","t5_2qh4j","&gt; Well the main issue is that White European culture is not under attack in any meaningful way, if anything it's become the de facto worldwide cultural heritage of the entire world with its art, movies, language, philosophical ideals permeating every country worldwide.
&gt; Culture is a very difficult thing to annihilate.

It's actually pretty easy to lose. We lose culture with every generation, it just doesn't seem that way because the current generations consider it oldfashioned or outdated, and the next generations are simply unaware of what it even meant in practice.

So I reckon that many people agreeing with the statement are just disconcerted about the speed of social evolution.

&gt;Another issue I have is with the entire term ""White European Culture"", since that is a rather broad stroke to paint on a super diverse part of the world. The cultural differences between a Belgian, an Italian and Polish person are enormous and the entire concept of ""white culture"" is relatively new.
It's as dismissive and broad as the term ""Asian culture"" (we wouldn't lump in the cultures of Japan, Thailand, India, Mongolia and China afterall)

Kraz thinks he deserves to get the award because being the cool teacher means he's trying to connect with the kids. The vandalism occurred the day before the teacher award party and this was confirmed.

Crista would go to the cops if she went to file an official complaint. She's an activist and is used to using official actions to right wrongs. If she was afraid to report abuse to the cops, she probably wouldn't report it to the school.

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","This should be the top comment IMO.  You cannot code your way around a business model, you can not code your way around expanding your business and growing it into a profitable Org.  You need people that understand business to help you, or as a dev you will need to get outside your comfort zone and learn business.  

In my anecdotal experience success really comes from a few high level key factors:

* You need the right people, they need to believe in what they do and they need to put the business first

* You need capital - VC funding is pretty common, however to negotiate this you will need to know and understand how business works

* You need to provide a good customer experience - the gist of this is that if I download a new app on my phone and the app sucks with in the first ~1 minutes of using it, I uninstall it and find a new one.  This is because Apps are a consumable.  They aren't a long term investment for me, nor are they for anyone else.   Most people treat apps now as a consumable, and there is no investment in it for them at all.  If your app/service gives a bad experience, then people just download the next app that is just like the one you are trying to market.

* You need to have a plan - what happens when you become 15 people?  Then 40 people?   then 100 people?   I worked for a start up before and I was in the early wave of employees (around the 70s) and when I left the company they were over 600 people.   I got in toward the end of the start up phase, but we still had money from VC to invest.   Growing a company is hard, and many companies fail.  Guy Kawaski has wrote a few books on this subject and they are pretty spot on.  My favorite chapter in one of his books is titled:  ""The Bozo Explosion.""   This entire chapter talks about when your company grows and your demand to get people in the Org to fill empty jobs you get desperate and hire anyone you can, and sometimes you hire a bunch of bozos.  Remember the **people make the company**, so if you hire the wrong people you are doing yourself a disservice.   I have witnessed all of these before.  When I got out of the start up Org I went into vendor/consulting space and a lot of my customers were start ups.   I saw the same thing over and over again.   You really need to sit down and plan for every possible outcome you can think of because when these problems hit you and you aren't prepared you are just guessing.   Also, on that note be aware that not everything you plan will ever work out 100%.   So you need to plan for all the things you can, and then find the best solution or coping mechanism to the problem as they arise.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","This is gonna be long. I'm bring this over from the my husband is beating me at magic thread, cause I am not sure if its dead or not.

You should focus on really synergistic cards that help one another and have between 3-4 of each excepted for a few large game endears.

Since you are in black and white you do have some very good options, you have board wipes in both colors and a human tribal is a very cheap and very potent deck.

The ally cards from zendikar and the humans from inistrad are extremely cheap and synergistic. Certain creatures are called lords like the [[Dire Graft Champion]] but your humans can be different kinds of rulers. Some humans have lord like effects that give other humans +1/+1 counters when they enter the battle field. The counters stick around if they die which makes them more like Robbin hoods as they spread around the wealth.

I would keep your angels of glory rise and have of each of the following cards they can be hard to find but are at mostly 0.50 - 1 dollar. These are the base of this tribal in this color and have stronger utility creatures, that can be swapped in to respond to the hubbies future upgrades as he will more than likely respond with new threats. If you shift from black to green a very powerful and explosive deck opens up with the enchantment [[Hardened Scales]] and a card that makes his murdering your dudes into new cards to recover [[Shaper's Sanctuary]] as well as a few different cool humans to help and a lovely angel that protects them [[Sidgarda Herons Grace]].

Here is what i would suggest to start and this model is kind of a mid range style deck. for tribal you usually want 28 - 30 dudes, and then 20-24 lands and the rest as support. This deck as it is now is a casual deck but has the room to grow to be a strong modern deck with upgrades as you learn. For fun I took your husbands resurrection theme and gave it to you! While also giving you a way to shut his down. 

Multiples are very important they give a deck consistency and in this case flexibility too. This deck is also low on a mana curve which is a distribution of the average mana costs of a deck. Most mid range standard decks sit at 3-4 on the curve while modern decks sit at 2-3. If you are interested in deck building I would look at the mythic spoiler database. they kinda have the majorty of all the cards in each set in a nice display you can just read through. It helps you learn what is out there in a easy way to read and path through

This is a budget list and can run between $18-56 depending on where you can get your cards. Cockitrace is also a great tool which lets you play and build decks for free so you can try them out before you get them. Any ways here is a rough list

Creatures 28

4X[[Zullaport Cutthroat]]

4X[[Hada Freeblade]]

4X[[Kazandu Blademaster]]

4X[[Champion of the perish]]

4X[[Thalia's Lieutenant]]

4X[[Bojuka Brigand]]

2X[[Angels of Glory's rise]]

2X[[Lantern Scout]]

Sorc 6

2X[[March From the Tomb]] / [[Rally the Ancestors]]

2X[[Read the Bones]]

2X[[Crux of Fate]] or [[Fumigate]]

Instants 6 &lt; This spot has high upgrade potential these cards tend to be the most expensive besides lands. The int i will recommend here are sub optimal for an all deck ideology but they should be side boarded out in that case

2X[[Ultimate Price]] vs [[Radiant Purge]] &lt;Mono Colored vs Multi Colored or [[Celestial Purge]]

4X[[Unmake]]

Lands 20

4X[[Bojuka Bog]] &lt; Say good by hubby graveyard &gt;:3

4X[[Scoured Barrens]]

2X[[Isolated Chapel]] &lt;if you have the money after all the other cards

4X [[Swamp]]

6X[[Plains]]

Other notable mentions that if you seem to be having an issues with these buggers will help out and either be potent threats on their own, hard to kill or take out annoying threats. They tend to be costly so that is why I did not include in this list.

[[Secure the Wastes]]

[[Fiend Slayer Paladin]]

[[Fiend Hunter]]

[[Kibara Evangel]]

[[Mirrian Crusder]]

[[Always Watching]]

[[Stasis Snare]]

[[oblivion ring]]

[[Mortify]]

[[Disenchant]]

[[Feat of Resistance]] &lt; protection can remove Auras on your guys

[[Brave the elements]]

Good luck ! I hope you and your hubby have fun and he teaches you. If you get to 50-50 win rate for both your decks that's ideal.

"SpaceXLounge","t5_3eye9","Yeah, it was a very good set of predictions. It's clear to me that SpaceX just wants to get the damn thing built soonest, so they have decided to go with whatever can possibly work, not the optimums. So we have a higher mass fraction for the BFS because thats feasible now, 9m diameter because it fits in the current facilities, and using the ""Scaled"" raptor at a lower pressure rather than the original monsters, because they KNOW that works right now since they have been scorching the grass at mcgregor with it.

This seems a very SpaceX type decision, it allows incremental improvement like we saw with F9.  Over time, the scaled raptors pressure and efficiency will climb, and the carbon fibre, once better understood, will allow decreases in mass fraction or increases in safety margins, allowing for optimisation in other areas. 

I think we will see the BFR launch in 2020, or at least prototypes of the booster and spaceship which will enable them to test the current unknowns like the horizontal re-entry, legless landing, carbon fibre tankage performance and orbital refueling, and performance will climb steadily from there.

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","Earlier today I was going to make a post regarding exactly this type of behavior! I don't know whether he is Avoidant or a Narcissist. Up until this week I thought Avoidant, but after our huge fight on Monday, I'm beginning to lean toward Cerebral Narcissist. Either way, it's now extremely clear the path I need to take.

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for posting this. 

&gt;""Some people fear intimacy and struggle with insecure attachments, like **avoidant attachment** for example.  When this is the case, they subconsciously try to get away from the fear that comes up in the relationship by gaining control in the relationship.  They do this by intermittently reinforcing their partner.  They have no idea that they are in fact doing this.  They partner ends up at their mercy, desperate for the occasional closeness they grant.  An example of this is a man who spends a wonderful night with you and you talk and connect on a deep level one day and the next, he doesn‚Äôt return your phone calls and acts like you are strangers and pulls away.  Then, randomly is able to connect again, especially when he senses you pulling away.  The classic hot and cold relationship usually falls into this category.

&gt;For some people however, intermittent reinforcement is much more intentional.  This is especially true for people who fall into what psychologists would label as a personality disorder such as borderline, **narcissism** or sociopathy for example.  They begin a relationship going for control deliberately from the get go.  They are often consciously aware that they are controlling someone in this way. On top of other emotional abuse tactics, like gas lighting, they give or withhold certain needs from their partner, granting them either randomly enough to develop an addiction in their partner or giving them in response to the exact behavior they want to see in their partner.""

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","*Bram Stoker's Dracula* (1992, Francis Ford Coppola) -- I simply love this film's atmosphere. The music, the sets, the costumes, the operatic style of acting, the use of classic in-camera special effects (and intentional lack of CGI)... the movie is absolutely *dripping* with Style, much of it heavily influenced by Symbolist and Surrealist painters. It fully deserved its Academy Awards for best sound editing, best makeup and best costume design, and rightfully deserved its nomination for best art direction/set decoration.

The acting is admittedly hit-and-miss, but if you can get past that particular aspect (consider treating it more like an over-the-top campy stage production), then you will find yourself entering a beautiful fantasy world of gothic romance. I absolutely adore this version of Dracula and I've made it a yearly ritual to host a wine-drinking party and watch it with a group of friends every October -- the experience recently made so much better with the completion of my home theater setup of a HD projector and surround sound system. I wish there were more movies like it, but so far it seems to truly be one of a kind -- and perhaps the last of its type (i.e. big budget Hollywood production that insisted on using classic film effects instead of CGI).",1506816266

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Thank you for your comment and for your advice. 

Yeah, I know that living with my family for the rest of my life isn't feasible, I just thought maybe I could get a few more years in while I had the chance. Now it feels like it's the end forever and I didn't appreciate it while I had it. 

I have definitely been trying to meet new people and get involved, but I don't know that it's filling the hole that I feel from missing home. I will definitely continue to do so and try to immerse myself into life here, hopefully I will start to feel better as time goes on. 

And yeah, I know that attending this school will ultimately probably be better for my future, which is what makes it such a hard thing for me to even consider leaving. If anything, I will probably stick it out until the end of the year and see how I feel then. If I'm still not happy then, I don't know what other choice I could make-- I can't live like this for the next four years. But until then I will try to live like I won't be leaving-- I won't just go through the year waiting for the end of the year to come so I can leave, I will truly try to see if life here will work for me.

4. Der beste Weg, Zeug zu lernen ist nicht unbedingt der, der von der Uni praktiziert wird und es liegt an dir, herauszufinden, welcher Zugang sich am besten f√ºr dich eignet. Zum Beispiel gibt es einen Zugang zu Analysis, genannt  synthetische Differentialgeometrie, der weitaus n√§her an der Intuition ist, die die ersten Analytiker und auch f√ºhrende Differentialgeometer hatten, als der normale Zugang, zu dem Preis, dass du eine logische Regel nicht verwenden kannst. Welcher Zugang letzten Endes besser f√ºr dich ist musst du selbst rausfinden, aber letzten Endes kannst du dir durch ein paar Gedanken √ºber die Art, wie du Zeug lernen willst, viele Gedanken beim Lernen selbst sparen und eine kleine Investition an Freizeit kann sich sp√§ter stark rechnen. A propos:

5. Wie ""anstrengend"" das Mathestudium ist liegt ganz bei dir. Ich zb hab nie viel mit Vortr√§gen anfangen k√∂nnen und eigne mir Wissen viel lieber durch B√ºcher an. √úbungen kannst du ausf√ºhrlich und genau durchdenken, oder schnell am Tag davor abschreiben. Tests kannst du oft durch alte Pr√ºfungsaufgaben lernen. Die Wahrheit ist, dass ein Mathematikstudium, je nachdem, wie du es anlegst, das einfachste der MINT-F√§cher sein k√∂nnte.Aber die heutige mathematische Landschaft ist √ºbers√§t mit Sachen, die extrem interessant zu wissen w√§ren, aber einen enormen Zeitaufwand erfordern. Ab einem gewissen Punkt bist du entweder in einer Position, dass dein Interesse an Mathematik aus sich selbst heraus zu wachsen beginnt und sie anf√§ngt, zu einem wichtigen Teil deines Lebens zu werden, oder du pl√§tscherst motivationslos dahin, bis du einen Abschluss hast.

Ich kann dir ein paar Leseempfehlungen geben:

Einf√ºhrung in das mathematische Arbeiten von Schichl und Steinbauer, zwei Profs an der Hauptuni, ist das Buch zur Steop auf der Hauptuni. Es ist sehr stark in klassischer Mathematik verankert, aber es gibt einen guten Einblick in die mathematische Denkweise und ist ohne Vorkenntnisse lesbar.

Algebra: Chapter 0 von Paolo Aluffi k√∂nnte mich mehr beeinflusst haben als sonst ihrgendein Mathebuch. Es erkl√§rt die gesamte elementare Algebra aus kategorientheoretischer Sicht und macht damit beide einfacher.Es ist ein sehr modernes und noch recht unbekanntes Algebrabuch, aber ein definitiver hidden Gem. Mein gr√∂√üter Kritikpunkt w√§r wohl, dass es nie wirklich die Br√ºcke zu algebraischer Geometrie schl√§gt und deshalb unanschaulicher bleibt als vielleicht notwendig, aber im Vergleich zu anderen Algebrab√ºchern ist es hundertundeins.

How to Bake Pi von Eugenia Cheng. Das hab ich nie pers√∂nlich gelesen, aber die Autorin hat ein echtes H√§ndchen f√ºr die Erkl√§rung von Mathematik, also bin ich sicher, dass es gut ist. Es sollte ohne Vorkenntnisse lesbar sein, und es erkl√§rt gut die Grundidee hinter Kategorientheorie.

Auch extrem wertvoll ist das sogenannte nlab (https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage): ein wiki, das versucht, alle Dinge √ºber Kategorientheorie zu erkl√§ren. F√ºr Fortgeschrittene ist es eine perfekte Art, Kategorientheorie zu lernen und Wikilernen find ich generell um einiges nat√ºrlicher als das lineare Lernen aus B√ºchern, aber grad das nlab braucht gewisse Grundkenntnisse von Mathematik. Ab dann ist es aber wirklich wundervoll: du f√§ngst einfach irgendwo an, indem du dir zb einen Begriff anschaust, von dem du grad gelernt hast, klickst dich durch und durch, verlierst dich und kommst nie wieder zu dem zur√ºck, mit dem du angefangen hast, aber gleichzeitig lernst du unheimlich viel. Es f√ºhlt sich in etwa an wie tvtropes f√ºr mathematik.

Lockharts lament (einfach googlen, is online frei erh√§ltlich). Der Text ist eigentlich nur zur Motivation da, aber er ist extrem gut darin, zu motivieren. Ich hab noch nie jemanden die Sch√∂nheit von Mathematik eloquenter erkl√§ren geh√∂rt. 

6. Moderne mathematische Texte sind meist in einem sogenannten Definition-Satz-Beweis Stil verfasst. Das bedeutet so ziemlich genau das was dasteht. Ich kann dir nur raten, Texte (Kapitel, was auch immer eine gute Portion ist), nochmal zu lesen, nachdem du damit durch bist, dabei aber alle Beweise und sonstigen ""Ablenkungen"" auszulassen und dich nur darauf zu konzentrieren, was dir der Autor in wirklich r√ºberbringen wollte. Umgekehrt k√∂nnte es auch eine gute Idee sein, Beweise nochmal durchzugehen, nachdem du sie gelernt hast, und zu versuchen, die einzelnen Schritte aus dem Ged√§chtnis wiederzugeben.

Das w√§r alles, was mir im Moment einfallen w√ºrd. Mathematik ist ein Studium, in dem du jedes Jahr zur√ºckblickst und verwundert feststellst, dass sich dein gesamtes Bild davon, was Mathematik eigentlich ist gewandelt hat. Es ist unglaublich sch√∂n, aber auf eine Art und Weise, die erst einiges an Einarbeitungszeit erfordert, um wirklich gesch√§tzt werden zu k√∂nnen.",1506816271

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","&gt; So I'm not the guy in question, but my problem is that you make claims that may very well be true, but don't back them with real examples. For example, I take issue with this statement:

&gt;&gt; Security is the goal of every state and individual. Because of this, states are heavily incentivized to be murky in how they communicate with others. You want to exaggerate your strengths sufficiently, but not to the point that they lose credibility. You want to downplay your weaknesses as much as possible.

He literally spent an entire paragraph arguing how the First World War was an example of this. Moreover, I don't really understand how you can say there are no examples when the topic of that very thread was a prime example of what he's talking about.

The United States going back through the 90s, publicly and exhaustively built a case justifying the use of force in Iraq to effect regime change, built primarily upon the fact that the leadership of Iraq was a) Undermining the security of their neighbouring states (by um, invading them), and b) Undermining the security of the region at large by making repeated attempts to procure weapons of mass destruction.

Indeed, the downfall of Saddam Hussain came about because Iraq's strategy throughout the 90s and leading up to the second invasion was based purely on projecting the idea that it was a credible threat (i.e. That Iraq had tons and tons of WMD waiting to be used on anyone that fucked with them), and downplaying their weakness (i.e. Iraq's WMD program was unfit for purpose).

Even today we're seeing the same thing from North Korea, who are even more blatant in their use of the media to disseminate the very idea that they have things that can hurt us, even as the actual evidence of this is meticulously curated.

&gt;I would argue that most states in the modern world make their military power very obvious. We know exactly how much Japan spends, exactly how many people in China are enlisted

Do we? You know how much Japan spends (because they publish an annual report). You do not know anything about why they spend a given portion on a given scheme other than what they tell you. Are you under the impression that Japan is under obligation to let the entire world know what every facet of its military spending is for? Similarly, you've read something somewhere claiming to tell you how many enlisted men China has in it's military - because again, they have told you. Do you know where these men are and what they're being directed to be doing now? A year from now? Five years from now? I doubt it. 

You know that the USA is working on a new super jet fighter, and the UK has a new air carrier and that Russia is refurbishing their nukes. Why? Because like OP says, states want the world to know that they are strong. Indeed, these countries fall over themselves to regularly announce - in public - that these missiles, boats and planes are state of the art, unkillable game changers. Regardless of whether they are or aren't.

Do you have access to Russia's nuclear codes, or the secrets behind the new American plane's state of the art missile systems, or the carrier's electronic warfare suite? No, because that would mean other states can use that to negate them - which is an obvious weakness.

If every state's military prowess is an open book, why does every state have large and widespread security operations, working on protecting their own secrets and finding out those of others?
Nothing you've written refute's OP's comment at all. Indeed, it's quite bizarre that you cannot see how your assertion here bolster's OPs argument pretty comprehensively.

And:

&gt;I would also argue that your whole mindset is rapidly becoming...

...this portion of the comment is just straight up bizarre in that it not only does it appear to not bear any relation to any topic OP was even talking about, but doesn't do anything to refute anything OP has stated: If as you say, more states will attempt to procure weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them, then their neighbouring states/any state that has a problem with them, have a clear and obvious incentive to try and neutralise them... which in turn gives these states a clear and obvious incentive to be very murky in how they conduct themselves on the global stage, knowing as they do at any time any other given country will be engaged in efforts to find out just what the extent of their power is and how to counter that.

And if you feel this is only a concern of third world states, you have failed manifestly to back that up with any actual evidence. Or indeed anything approaching an intelligent view - because I can tell you ""security will become meaningless"" as more and more countries gain access to powerful weapons is just about the most backwards thing I've ever read.

[I am Brianna Goux, a 19 year old redditor who has published her first young adult sci-fi novel, AMA!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ConciseIAmA/comments/73igd9/i_am_brianna_goux_a_19_year_old_redditor_who_has/)

[+BriannaMGoux:](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/737yli/i_am_brianna_goux_a_19_year_old_redditor_who_has/)

Here‚Äôs a bit about me:
My name is Brianna Goux

I have an unhealthy obsession with giraffes 

I‚Äôm graduating from the University of Iowa this May

I own a cat, a dog, a horse, and probably have a future animal hoarding problem.

My proof: besides being the only Brianna Goux alive (and maybe ever), here is some proof that I am who I say I am.

[Proof](https://i.imgur.com/2BsSkBF.jpg), [proof](https://i.imgur.com/YRNVhKz.jpg), [proof](https://i.imgur.com/lRjaDk6.jpg) and my [cat](https://i.imgur.com/qZNTZiq.jpg) (not proof, I just think she's cute). Oh, and [my website](http://www.amarasrose.com/)

Hello! I‚Äôm the author of Amara‚Äôs Rose- a Young Adult Science Fiction/Fantasy novel with kickass female leads. I started writing this novel because when I went to middle school all of my friends when to different schools so Rose, Phoenix, Sylvia, and Derek became my friends. I wrote of their adventures and from that this book came forth. My motivation for carrying this novel through the long, arduous process of taking it from a shitty first draft, through editing, and to publishing is that I wanted to write the characters I wish I had read growing up. This book is groundbreaking for this genre in that four out of my five main characters are female, there are no predominant romantic plots or love triangles; there is only a mission Rose is on to save her people and the determination of my characters to save their world. 

I‚Äôve been writing for as long as I can remember and have gone from writing short stories about a border collie named Millie to writing 400 page novels about Rose and her intergalactic adventures. The first novel, which was published a few days ago, I have been working on for five years. Ask me anything about life, writing, or giraffes- I‚Äôve got answers for you.

EDIT: [Amazon link for those of you asking](https://www.amazon.com/Amaras-Rose-Chronicles-Key-1/dp/1770843310/)

EDIT 2: I've been at this for seven hours- I'm going to take a quick 30 minute break

EDIT 3: It's been 9 1/2 hours- I'll try and answer the remaining questions tomorrow. I'm going to try to get to everyone so don't fear if I haven't answered your questions yet!

FINAL EDIT: I wanted to answer everyone's question, but unfortunately things are going south. I am not perfect, this is my first novel, and I have a lot to learn. I'm happy that many of you seem interested, and I'm happy that many of you gave me feedback. I'm always looking to learn and feel as though this situation has taught me a lot. Cheers!

 9_year_old_redditor_who_has/dnodjog/):  I've often thought that SciFi is at its

 core a sociological genre - put normal human beings in outlandish situations

 and examine what the outcome of that may be.  Do you agree with that and what

 are some of the main themes you adress in this book?

: that. I think that it could be, for certain novels, but I wouldn't put the

: whole genre in there. This is because there are books, like mine, where the

: main characters aren't human and therefore it creates a different balance of

: feature humans in outlandish situations.  My main themes that are addressed

: within this book are ambition, coming of age, courage, discovery, and loss.

:: be completely divorced from our own humanity. It would then be a view of

:: humanity through an alien lens, but still a human view by necessity.

:: Because if it were to be fully alien then there would be nothing for a

:: human reader to identify themselves with.   In the seminal ""The Dance of

:: the Changer and Three"" by Terry Carr the only human character is the

:: narrator who tries to explain this fully alien story to a human audience

:: and coming to the conclusion that the story must be taken as is, because

:: they are alien any human interpretation of this story that is so important

:: to this alien culture must always fall flat because we cannot ever

:: completely understand their psychology.   The Dance of the Changer and

&gt;
&gt;TLDR of original post: After our mom died, people from HOA came to me and my sister and told us that we're no longer a single family and one of us needs to leave.
&gt;
&gt;So I first confirmed that they are from the HOA, not just some people harassing us for the fun of it. We also got the CC&amp;R of the HOA, which included a clause about single family and it's weird definition. If included partners, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, step parents, step children, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, children of uncles and aunts, children of nieces and nephews, BUT NO SIBLINGS. It even had a clause that said co-owners are not allowed to live there unless they are a single family based on the definition.
&gt;
&gt;We also received a letter from them telling us of our violation and demanding us to comply.
&gt;
&gt;So my sister and I went around the neighborhood and gave copies of the terms and the letter we received to everyone and told them ""imagine you died tomorrow, do you want them to kick out your kids? Because they're doing it to us. They will do it to your kids as well. Help us stop them.""
&gt;
&gt;We gathered signatures and had almost everyone contact the president and demand that this should stop. Within two weeks, we received a letter that says this has been a mistake with an apology.
&gt;
&gt;We learned that this HOA is horrible to everyone, not just us. So there are now people preparing to run for the HOA board to replace the current members and they're promising to have a referendum about whether the HOA should be dissolved or not, because it really is doing nothing of substance except being a pain in the butt of everyone.
&gt;
&gt;Summary: HOA backed off after we told everyone what they're trying to do. We will vote the board out of office and there will be a referendum about dissolving it altogether as we don't need it.

It is something I want but sadly im the last survivor out of my family, I was born quite late, my parents were both 49 when I was born and much of their family had already passed, Im 25 now and have no living relatives

True asexuality, it would be easier if I just lacked confidence but its a brick wall when it comes to love, friends would be something im interested in but then it comes down to ""whats the point"", i dont know how to have fun without being good at something and winning, so what would a friend do, you know? i realize this is a bad mindset, but thats half of why im here

The kids thing is just, I looked up what makes people happy and a lot of them said, just living, love, having kids, having family, etc. so I wanted to make it clear here that kids isnt on the menu for me, I love kids but I feel like it would not be fair for me to adopt a child because of my disability / depression

Yeah and this is my problem with video games, I dont know how to have fun if im not the best and winning, I play to win, Ive never known how to play a game for fun, which is really bad, i know. About being the top 0.1% in the game, thats what Im talking about, THAT is my passion, but I feel like its way beyond my reach

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Pinlock anti-fog inserts for motorcycle helmet visors.

Basically, the Pinlock is a sheet of special plastic that sits inside your visor.  Special plastic in that it absorbs water vapor to a point, preventing fogging inside your helmet visor in humid or cold conditions.  Big safety coup, right?  

There's one on my Shoei GT Air.  Came with the helmet.  Never really worked right.  It has to make a perfect seal with the visor surface all the way around, or moist air will get in and fog the visor.  The bottom edge of the Pinlock NEVER sealed for the first year I had the helmet.  Whenever I had the visor closed, I had to put up with a foggy area in the bottom center of my field of view.

The eccentric adjustment pins are a shitshow.  They are supposed to let you adjust the force with which the Pinlock is pressed against the inner visor surface, to ensure a good seal.  The pins are not equipped with any feature to make them easy to turn.  And they are prone to breakage when you do manage to force them to turn.  Made of clear plastic, and did I mention tiny?  Once dropped one on my white tile kitchen floor.  Spent about an hour on the floor looking for it, including with a flashlight, looked under the fridge, range...nada.  It might as well have gone into a black hole.

Wait, it gets better: for a shitton of Shoei helmets at least, you literally cannot buy replacement pins anywhere.  Even from Pinlock themselves.  Even if you buy a ($35) replacement Pinlock insert, it does not come with replacement pins.  The only way I've got new pins is by calling Shoei.  They'll generally take pity and send you one at a time.  They're good about sending them out quickly, and I got each in about 3 business days, but...lose one on a weekend or early in a long trip?  Sucks to be you.  Seemingly NO ONE stocks the pins.  Not Cycle Gear, not the Suzuki dealership, no one.

This is not a new product, either.  My particular helmet and visor design has been around for at least 2 years.

The Pinlock material is so shockingly soft that it scratches if you look at it funny.  If it ever gets dirty, you might as well throw it away and buy a new Pinlock.  If you do clean it, air-drying is the only option.  A microfiber cloth made so many small scratches that I lived with a light haze for the last several months.

Want to be done with the whole mess, and just discard the Pinlock and its pins?  Well, now you have two ~5 mm holes in your visor.  Which let in rain and (more significantly) wind noise at highway speed.  Lovely.  I put clear tape over mine when I was missing a pin for a couple of weeks.  Looked like crap though.

You can leave the pins in without the Pinlock, but they're easy to accidentally knock out.  If one falls on the ground, forget it, you're never finding it.

In the end, I gave in and tried a completely new Pinlock insert.  Bingo, seals perfectly, no scratches (I won't be dumb enough to try cleaning this one!), but of course it was about $35. :/  But I'll have to replace it again in a year or less.  It seems the plastic stretches or sags over time.

I wouldn't *not* buy a different helmet because it has Pinlock, but I definitely will not consider having Pinlock as a reason to pick one helmet over another, when the time comes.",1506816277

Every dog is different, and even within breeds, dogs can act differently.

With that out of the way, I -- who has cared for five different Beagles -- would *never* trust them off-leash not to start tracking. They're just wired that way. They are extremely dedicated to both their nose and their purpose. And once they start tracking, they can't hear you. You could be issuing every ""emergency recall"" command you have, but it won't enter their ears. They become so singularly focused once on a good trail. Plus, they can't hear you over their own ball barking.

Training an emergency recall isn't a bad idea, though. I use ""**CHEESE**"" but I've also heard a great phrase for it -- ""**FREE DONUT**"" (because who can sound unexcited yelling ""free donuts""). If you can catch them unsecured but before they get a trail to track, it can work.

Any advice along the lines of ""try falling down; your dog will come back to check on you"" won't work. I've tried it. My dogs were hilariously unconcerned.",1506816278

The problem is that it's hard to do the things that need to be done to the economy without the government intervening in the free market.  Breaking oligarchies should be a major issue, but it's not discussed by anyone but progressives.  Eliminating tax loopholes for big business would also help as it would level the playing field somewhat between big and small business.

Combat Arms is the simplest to understand.  They are directly engaged in hostile operations.  They demand the greatest degree of support.  All other tiers should be squarely focused on getting these guys what they need to be effective and come back safely.

Combat Support are all functions directly tied to combat operations that don't involve triggering a weapon.  They could be intel, maintenance, weapons trainers, etc.  They demand a great deal of support but are generally further back from the lines so their immediate need is less.  

Combat Service Support is largely infrastructure support.  They do not have a **direct** combat related function but they are necessary to sustain the fight.  Here we are talking personnel, finance, gym, chow hall, lodging, and non-deployed legal teams.  NOTE:  Many of these people take on additional roles as security augmentees when deployed.

Most people (~70%) in the USAF fall into the second tier, Combat Support.

That coupled with the fact that you simply can't go over 300 units/s means that overall your targets are moving a hell of a lot slower which in turn results in easier to hit targets.

That's why CS:GO **benefits** from accurate hitboxes while in QC it *detracts* from the player experience.

Besides. Right now QC is using low-poly models of the characters for hitboxes that animate just as the actual models themselves. In CS:GO they use pill-shaped hitboxes that approximate the model and are a bit generous (!!!) depending on the character (this means that there is a CT hitbox used for all CT models and a T hitbox for all T hitboxes).

Then on top of that CS:GO already has it that the models are static a lot of the times (and thank fuck that it's getting implemented in QC).

I got lucky and the house I found was already renovated but couldn't sell and I found a renter who's family lives behind me making her a consistent renter at competitive rental prices. 

Something similar with a foreclosed duplex or even four plex is always a great option for beginners like ourselves. Also, if you can rent to a responsible renter, they will take care of the place for you and even improve all the little things! Something I didn't know but was gladly surprised about. 

EDIT: Everything I read also said you should make your money going in by buying well under market value (25%) but I wasn't able to do this because I was competing with investors that could buy homes 100% in cash.

I've been doing this for about 17 years, and the longer I'm in, the more it feels like a vicious, unending cycle of futility. 

It's only recently that I've come to the realization that most of my frustration and my habit of taking things so much to heart is because I've defined a lot of myself as a person on the success (or lack of) in my career. My advice as a fellow geezer is more practical than deeply insightful:

Most of us I'd wager work so that we can support ourselves, our families, and lead a generally good life with some semblance of stability. As people who have spent years advancing their trade, we feel compelled to ""engineer"" things toward the way we feel they should be. Right or wrong, it takes a very conscious effort and a lot of emotional discipline to be able to let go of that idea of perfection (as we see it) and ""do good where we can"", while being satisfied with just controlling the things we can control.

Work so you can find the balance for yourself and your coworkers. If you find that, over time, despite your efforts you can't achieve that balance, be mindful not to take it personally and move on.

Then apply! Each university has different document requirements. Depending on your course choice you might also have to supply personal statements.
Offers typically take a few days to be issued if you are eligible. Once you have received an offer you will need to accept so that you can get the document (CoE) required to lodge a student visa application. Visas take between 2-6 weeks to be issued however this can blow out if youre applying during peak times (January and June). All the best!!",1506816286

Its an important distinction.

Of course your income tax is not 100% medical, its covers lots of stuff. But, all those govt services are also funded by HST / GST, home taxes and things like fuel tariffs.  
.  
What Im saying is for people in high income bands ... they would get better service paying private insurance, especially for 20K a year or even 5K a year. In Canada, they subsidize the rest of the population's medical costs.

Em-drive doesn't exist in an empty universe.

Like a simple electromagnet-powered ""craft"" would easily (and efficiently) pull itself towards your block of steel, so could em-drive pull itself towards (or away from) distant objects in the universe using some form of energy field.

As I suggested earlier, it probably is some form of gravity.

Alternatively, it could be some other, unknown quantum-mechanical effect, that works on physical vacuum (and somehow transfers momentum to it). Firstly, I am skeptical of that happening at such a low energy limit, secondly, I am not sure it would be distinguishable from gravity.

A briefly mentioned [here: wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White%E2%80%93Juday_warp-field_interferometer#Interferometer_experiment_with_a_resonant_cavity) interferometer experiment also hints at gravity-like effects occurring within the cavity (unless something else can slow light).

If I were working on an em-drive model experiment, I'd certainly place a few accelerometers around the device to try and demonstrate some form of directed ""gravity beam"" or some other evidence of warp field presence (like... interferometers?)",1506816289

There is no ""truth"" or ""meaning"" or ""individuality"". But because we are the inputs and outputs of our brain and body we have to be human and assign value to things and people depending on our preference. And we have to pretend that our actions come from an innate ability to choose different futures when really free will is only possible because our brains are not large or smart or objective enough to process all of existence at once. So we have to use abstract concepts that we can never fully define to each other since every person thinks differently to explain an existence that is fundamentally one but viewed from multiple, relative perspectives. Basically everyone who spends more than 10 minutes doing any thinking will realise that nihilism is the only philosophy that can be used as the foundation of the self. The only philosophy that allows us to be and do anything we want. Not because things are ""meaningless"" but because anything we do or are is neither wrong nor right. Only knowing that you can build an identity that is truly your own. And you can change that identity whenever you choose so you can be more comfortable with your ignorant, irrelevant, and non existent ""individual"" reality. You don't need to grow a brain or a pair of balls to stop being nihilistic. You only need to have a wrong idea of what nihilism is.",1506816291

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","In the OP's case virginity means there is an underlying problem which is why I said he and not another pronoun. 

Very religious people and asexuals are not ashamed of being virgins. 

outside of those and other very small niche groups, everyone wants to have sex with someone else. 

&gt; even if that is the reason, that doesn't necessarily cross over into any other social experience.

To a small extent it does. Selling yourself, building rapport, finding common ground, showing your strengths, getting over anxiety, persistence, presenting yourself well, basic grooming, apply to both interviews and dating. 

&gt; I am kinda concerned about how much attention you're paying to how often other people are having sex that you think you can categorically say, based only on your own perception, that socially awkward people don't have sex. I think you have your own narrative about what it means to be a virgin, and you're supporting it with assumptions.

This makes you sound like a but hurt virgin. Especially since I actually said plenty of awkward guys find girlfriends and have sex. There's a difference between a 21 year old virgin and a 30 year old virgin.

"Forgotten_Realms","t5_31rpx","My reading of the legal system for Waterdeep through 1st - 3rd edition is that it's an [inquisitorial system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisitorial_system) rather than the adversarial system most of us are used to, based off of English common law. This has the Magisters (Black Robes) of the Common Court or the masked Lords of the Lord's Court fulfilling the function of prosecution, defense, judge and jury, meaning that there are no professional defense or prosecuting attorneys. Waterdeep's system doesn't need them or really allow for them. Magisters are empowered to interrogate anyone and everyone and there is no right to remain silent.

But litigators aren't the only kind of lawyers. What does Waterdeep do in place of the myriad other functions performed by real world lawyers?

&gt;34. The Scriveners,
Scribes, &amp; Clerks Guild

&gt;This guild is a highly educated, professional group of men and
women who letter signs, draw pictures (sometimes in front of a
party audience, upon a noble's hiring), compose and write letters,
take dictation, design ornamental scripts, draw up legal
tallies, and set down records, contracts, and accounts. Many
guild members will even forge or counterfeit documents; these
cost some very stiff fees hundreds of gold pieces per document
 since the penalties are so severe: Expulsion from Guild
and city for very serious cases, with amputation of fingers and
thumbs added if the forgery is treasonous or inflammatory, in a
manner that threatens the peace of the area.
**The Palace retains a dozen guild members at all times to
transcribe a record of all said before it, and retains one
scribe for each Magister (for the same task).** The watch also
employs guild members to draw likenesses of fugitives
described by witnesses, so that watch officers can carry
these sketches when on patrol.

Under the list of services provided by this guild you have: accounting, art, bookkeeping, clerks, counterfeiting, **court records**, dictation, documents, letters (written), portraits, record-keeping, scribes, scriveners, ""wanted"" likenesses.

I interpret that to mean the law in Waterdeep has always been systematized, it's just maintained without what we would understand as professional attorneys. I'm less familiar with 4e-5e.",1506816294

"awakened","t5_2ubdb","&gt; Awakening is something that is difficult to define because it‚Äôs characterized more by what is missing rather than what is gained. One might say that it describes a realization of Truth recognized beyond the need for belief.

&gt; While there are as many descriptions as there are perspectives, most agree that they fall short of the realization itself‚Äîa recognition so profound that it shakes the very bedrock of one‚Äôs understanding of the world and oneself.

From the sidebar. I'd also recommend reading the FAQ. 

For me, awakening is an ever-deepening realization into the fundamental nature of our being and of reality itself. It's commonly used to show that someone has 'woken up' to the realization that the person they previously took themselves to be (the individual sense of self) is without actual substance or reality (no self) and yet is connected to and in fact one with the world around it (unity). 

It can come in glimpses (non-abiding awakening) or as a permanent shift in one's sense of identity (abiding awakening). 

That said, any descriptions will always be incomplete, because it is not something that can be understood by the mind. It must be experienced.

Symbolic systems in mathematics are socially constructed.

And most people are platonists (with a lowercase 'p'), also known as 'mathematical realists' (very generally speaking), who want to preserve the intuition that mathematical entities (like numbers) are mind-independent.

One way of fleshing out an intuition about mind-independence is by saying that if everyone on Earth were to be obliterated in a nuclear holocaust, then it would still be true that 1+1=2.

It's likely been sitting a long time, and the seller just said it worked because ""it worked last time I used it 15 years ago"", but once you started playing with it, the belt started stretching and loosening up. It's likely got a lot of slack in it now or has broken in half. 

SMC Electronics doesn't appear to have a belt but you can contact them and ask if they know what kind of generic belt you need.  http://smcelectronics.com/index.shtml

This doesn't challenge my original point as much as providing context on why I am right. In fact, I believe one of the reason mangas tend to be inferior to, say, books, is that there are many writers which are okay to spend two hours a day for ten years alone in their room to write their masterpiece while the same just isn't true for mangakas, who want instead to make a career out of it (I am not judging their choice, be clear).

"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","Yay, I'm so glad Victoria went to a happy home and that she's comfy. 

You're right about the gore on that one. I think I've only ever had one other bra from Comexim without the overlap that I requested. Weird. But all the ones I have that are overlapping are technically to varying degrees if you look close. I look that closely because my boobs are super picky little divas.

Oh, the cup side-dents. I am sad that this happens for you, but I admit that it does make me feel a little less crazy since I feel like no one else ever reports it. I wish I had a real answer to why this happens. I thought the issue was behind me when I gave up on the 3HC (after three strikes with Victoria). I have a bunch of 60HH plunges from Comexim that show absolutely zero signs of this anomaly, and yet my 4(!) most recent 60HH reduced cup plunges have those side dents. And you describe it exactly right, they don't go away with loosening unless there's no tension at all. Normal wear even with the straps as loose as possible doesn't fix it. I probably keep my straps looser than ideal to try to mitigate it and that's annoying.

I have a fit photo somewhere of my new Florence plunge where I drop the strap off my shoulder and just gently lift the cup up as if it were containing my boob and *still* there's that weird indent. First I thought it indicated a cup that was too big, but Florence is at least a cup too small on my larger side and I quad out of it and still, dents in my boob. I have been putting it down to my boob tissue being too soft to offer any resistance. I wrote to Anna about it in exasperation, but she was on summer vacation and I never heard back. I've been a little behind and I need to follow up with her. 

I agree with the widening and minimizing appearance. I don't know if it's just Victoria in the 3HC, but my 65HH was the closest to fitting and it did the same, as did the 65J. TBH, I want to try an Ewa CHP because I think it would give more of the shape I prefer, except I may be too FoB for those now. Even my Freya half cups definitely minimize me less and that's saying something.

Regarding the band, I ordered the 70HH after the 65HH had a band that barely stretched past 25"". I wrote to Anna/Joanna at Comexim and explained that I had (at the time) a 27"" ribcage so *the 65 should work, but it is so tight and is that normal*? Joanna suggested the 70HH and I listened, but that band ran much bigger (i.e. more TTS). So I went back for a 65J. And yes, the band was finally right! But the 65J had a different cup shape entirely - it was taller and more open on top and gaped more, while the 70HH tapers nicely to the bust on top.  Comparison: [1](https://letstalkbras.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/comexim-victoria-comparison-65j-70hh-front.jpg), [2](https://letstalkbras.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/comexim-victoria-comparison-65j-70hh-front.jpg).

I've come to terms with the fact that I'd rather a tight band than a loose band from Comexim so I keep ordering 60s and what I get is always a surprise - somewhere along the continuum of ""perfectly comfortable"" to ""I need two extenders to breath"". I still love Comexim and I try to make peace with the margin of error in handmade goods. Perhaps each of my Victoria's was made by someone else, hence the wide variations?

If you have the patience and money, of course try for a 65J, or maybe even 2 with different alteration combinations. I just went for a 65J with the same alterations and I got pouchier side dents and cups that gaped in a weird way. But the gore was overlapping, lol.

I moved on to Victoria plunges next and finally got a great fit. I think I ordered 7 or 8 Victorias in total, including a bonus 2HC, which made no sense by fitting better than the 3HC which was too shallow for me. Perhaps I'm just cursed - everything seems to happen the opposite way to the norm with me when I order from Comexim.

FYI every fit characteristic you describe for yourself in terms of shape, soft tissue, etc, is exactly the same as me. I'm especially happy that Victoria fits you and it makes me want to try a 3HC in my new size. Glutton for punishment...

But I am moderately certain that no matter how much he is informed, he simply wouldn't care. 

That is my biggest gripe with Trump. He is a petty apathetic narcissist. He looks at things happening around him and concludes ""acting in this situation cannot benefit me so why should I give a fuck?"" The information that Puerto Ricans are US citizens means nothing to him because it would mean it would be his duty to take some level of responsibility and action, which he does not want to do. I assume he is aware that even before this natural disaster he was not particularly popular in Puerto Rico. So now this is his ""revenge"" - ""oh, you didn't like my Facebook post or retweet my tweet? Then I will not let you have any of the food I brought for the whole class.""

An inquisitorial system is a legal system where the court or a part of the court is actively involved in investigating the facts of the case, as opposed to an adversarial system where the role of the court is primarily that of an impartial referee between the prosecution and the defense. Inquisitorial systems are used primarily in countries with civil legal systems as opposed to common law systems. Countries using common law, including the United States, may use an inquisitorial system for summary hearings in the case of misdemeanors such as minor traffic violations. The distinction between an adversarial and inquisitorial system is theoretically unrelated to the distinction between a civil legal and common law system.

Yeah players have to perform, but it's the managers literal job to put the players that give his team the best chance to win out on the field. Joe just hasn't always done that consistently.

Would you be saying that it's up to ""the players not executing"" when you have a franchise so badly run as the #LolPadres, or the Fish, the Mets, or any other number of shit teams? 

What if Cash &amp; Girardi decided we're gonna field a Low A Ball team out there next year? Do the players really need to perform or is the management failing at their jobs?


Lastly I'm not assuming that a different move would have definitively worked every single time, I literally said that if a different move worked even 25% of the time we'd be in the ALDS already.  (and that's being generous! 10% would probably have us in the DS)

Do you think Girardi gave us the best chance to win when he got Holder to relieve Gray on Thursday night? All because he didn't want Khanle to get 4 outs instead of 3? Sure Holder ideally doesn't suck a chode in that situation, but putting him in that situation instead of almost anyone else in the pen is basically 100% never even close to being ""the right move"".

"ImperialAssaultTMG","t5_332u9","I think you can make 4 balanced teams with a single core box (although you'll be missing out on command cards).

[Imperial Army](http://tabletopadmiral.com/imperialassault/061a191f7b21000000000000000000) - AT-ST, eOfficer, eProbe, Stormtroopers, and eStormtroopers.  The AT-ST can synergize with the eOfficer, but the list should be a relatively straightforward shooty army.

[Lord Vader's Command](http://tabletopadmiral.com/imperialassault/131a1a7d2200000000000000000000) - Vader, 2xOfficer, eRoyal Guard, and Stormtroopers.  A nice melee focused list to play opposite of the shooty ones.  Has a little skill cap with officers and eRoyal Guard adjacency.  

[Scum trandocats](http://tabletopadmiral.com/imperialassault/642c1e1d2423000000000000000000) - IG88(token), Nexu, eNexu, Trandoshans, eTrandoshans. Even using a token for IG88, this is literally the only way to get 40 pts for scum without temp alliance. 

[Rebels](http://tabletopadmiral.com/imperialassault/05021b011c66400000000000000000) - Han, Luke, Jyn, Gideon, Mak, rSabs, and High Command.  May be a little technical to play well, but it has great offense in dual 3-dice attacks + focus.  Normally I'd consider it weak, but since it has great access to stun it should fare fine vs Vader/IG88/AT-ST.

For balance, I think all 4 are relatively even.  With a veteran group I'd say that the Imperial Army or Rebels takes it no question, but I assume you're running with people unfamiliar with the game.  In that case, high likelyhood Vader just runs up and stabs everyone to death or the trandocats run the board with their close range attacks.",1506816300

&gt; A new report by the Columbia Law School Human Rights Clinic and the Sana‚Äôa Center for Strategic Studies found that since President Donald Trump took office, the monthly rate of U.S. drone strikes has increased by almost four times former President Barack Obama‚Äôs average.

https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Monthly-US-Drone-Strikes-Quadrupled-Under-Trump-Report-20170613-0034.html

&gt; Since the inauguration of Donald J. Trump, drone strikes have increased over 400 percent.

&gt; As reported by Micah Zenko:

&gt;During President Obama‚Äôs two terms in office, he approved 542 such targeted strikes in 2,920 days ‚Äî one every 5.4 days. From his inauguration through today, President Trump had approved at least 36 drone strikes or raids in 45 days ‚Äî one every 1.25 days.

&gt;Do the maudlin math: despite his promises to reduce American intervention in foreign affairs and despite his oath to ‚Äúpreserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States,‚Äù under President Trump, these deadly drone strikes have increased 432 percent over the reprehensible pace set by his predecessor.

&gt;It‚Äôs not just the drones, though. President Trump is unhinged in his unleashing of U.S. airstrikes on ‚Äúenemy‚Äù targets.

https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/foreign-policy/item/25604-drone-strikes-up-432-percent-under-donald-trump

Zenkos report: https://www.cfr.org/blog/not-so-peaceful-transition-power-trumps-drone-strikes-outpace-obama

&gt; Now, the Trump administration is contemplating additional policy changes that will further expand the CIA's authority to conduct drone strikes in a number of countries, both in and out of war zones. Such a move would reverse years of effort by President Barack Obama to reduce the CIA's role in targeted killing and shift that responsibility to the military. It could also mean more civilian casualties in CIA drone strikes.

Wednesday, January 22, 2014
On January 22 (local time), Prime Minister Shinzo Abe attended the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Annual Meeting (Davos Meeting).
Upon arriving at Davos in the Swiss Confederation, the Prime Minister attended a lunch reception hosted by Professor Klaus Schwab, Executive Chairman of the WEF, in the Congress Centre.
In the afternoon, the Prime Minister held talks with Mr. George Soros, and then held an exchange of views with the International Business Council. Subsequently, the Prime Minister conversed with the Hon. Mr. Tony Abbott, Prime Minister of Australia, and then delivered a keynote speech. In the evening, the Prime Minister attended a dinner banquet with women leaders.

I was lucky enough to have a baby who has slept solid nights since 3 months. But if she was still getting up in the night you'd bet your ass my husband would be helping in the evenings after work so I could get some rest.   It is not always possible to nap while the child naps, some kids just don't nap longer than 45 minutes, sometimes you have housework, sometimes you need to shower and eat and do other things that make you feel normal.

Leaving that by virtue of the definition, as I have stated, is seen by the American family courts, as abandonment. ""How could you leave your children in the care of her if she was so abusive!?"" is the argument. 

&gt;And your version of your wife hitting you repeatedly is rather calm. Have you ever been in a fist fight? I‚Äôve not been in many, nor am I claiming to be a badass, but I can assure you that good choices and logic have very little to do with an actual fist fight.

I have been in many fist fights, I am a former Marine, I have had to literally fight for my life, and it is precisely during a fight when losing control of your faculties or going purely on emotion will get you killed. 

Shake, cry, scream, flail, do what you need to after the fight is over. During the fight, you either calculate and keep your head, or you lose the fight before it starts. 

&gt;Come on, I‚Äôm being civil.

I appreciate that. 

&gt;Admit that you read into it for the sake of having an argument, please.

I cannot do that, as I did not do that and it would be a lie to say so. Sorry man, I called it as I saw it.

"Shoplifting","t5_2qyxh","All the judge will have in front of them is papers pertaining to this instance only. There will be 1 cop in there just to make sure nothing bad goes down and 1-2 secretaries to help with paperwork. The first court date is almost certainly just a plea hearing. It gives you the opportunity to say whether you believe you are guilty or innocent. 

&amp;nbsp;

Show up to court a little bit early (20-30 minutes) and there should be somewhere for you to talk to the prosecutor. The prosecutor will be able to work with you. They may work out a deal where you plead guilty and do probation. They may work out that you pay a fine and the charges get dropped. It all depends. Again, no big deal. They deal with much worse crimes than petty theft. Just be honest with them, say you want to take care of your charges, that you'll never steal again, you learned your lesson, etc. They are humans just like you and are more than willing to help out. They would rather work with you and have much worse shit to deal with than petty theft. If you work something out with the prosecutor, when the judge calls you up, the prosecutor will tell the judge what you worked out, the judge will make sure you agree to it, and that's it. You won't spend more than 5 minutes standing in front of the judge. It's not some trial or anything.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","Once again, you are running into the same mistake. You assume that the mathematical average is the same as the actual outcome. I wouldnt notice that the deck was shuffled because I didnt see the decks order. But it would make a difference. To illustrate this ,take a regular deck of 52 playing cards, and put a straight as the top 5 cards. Then draw 5 cards. You may notice, you drew a straight. Now put them back on top, and shuffle them. Draw again. Most likely what you drew now is considerably worse. Now, imagine you were playing high-stakes poker, and bet good money on your hand. Would you still say that shuffling the deck made no difference?

Of course not. It made a noticable difference in that how the deck was made up before ,and how it was made up afterwards was different. The result you got, was different. The amount you won, or lost, was different. Everything changed. So if a card shuffles the deck, then yes it makes a huge impact.

But just to once again make clear why your logic is faulty at best, and absolute nonsense at worst, what you are saying is that every time someone won the lottery and got a few million dollars richer .... they actually didnt. Because those numbers couldve just been any other numbers. That is your logic, after all. Still stand by it?",1506816308

&gt;The number of counter demonstrators far outweighed the amount of NMR supporters, and violent elements of these attacked police on several occasions, including by throwing stones, reports TT.
&gt;
Counter-protestors rushed at police near the Liseberg Amusement Park, with horses deployed to keep them under control. According to a statement on the police website, stones were thrown during that flashpoint with a number of people held by police near the main entrance to the amusement park.

&gt;‚ÄúIn connection with the disturbances at Liseberg, where we moved away counter-demonstrators, stones were thrown, resulting in injury to one civilian. The person was hit by an object and has been taken to hospital by ambulance,‚Äù police press spokesperson Peter Adlersson said.

&gt;A police officer was also taken to hospital with minor injuries earlier in the day.

&gt;NMR leader Simon Lindberg has been arrested on suspicion of assault, reports newspaper Expressen.

&gt;‚ÄúSimon Lindberg participated at the beginning of the unrest and is suspected of violent unrest and assaulting a police officer,‚Äù police press spokesperson Hans Lippens told the newspaper.

&gt;Several people, including foreign citizens, were detained prior to the demonstration by police in Gothenburg and other parts of Sweden on suspicion of intending to carry out assault.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/Snapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSnapChat).

Messages for every individual property change the other hand sound like a lot of overhead, and something that just wouldn't have much of a way to fine-tune things for a specific game, or in fact even handle interpolation/prediction.

Regardless, if you want to have something that won't need a whole lot of manual setup, I'd say go for a language with powerful code generation/macro features(like Rust), since that can save a lot of boilerplate with stuff like this in an efficient manner.

We get an absolute ton of questions asked on this subreddit, and the result is that it is highly likely that any user's individual question will have been asked before, and likely answered.

The result is that people get tired of repeating themselves and having to browse past the same questions every day, so the community decided to have these resources like the Q&amp;A thread so people can ask any type of question without a negative response, and the people that actively want to answer simple questions can look for them in one place.

I would always recommend you do a quick search, then ask a question in the Q&amp;A sticky, and wait for a response there. Mentioning that you couldn't find anything through searching sometimes helps. If you don't get an adequate response in the Q&amp;A sticky within a day or so, I'd only post a new thread with a question with the clear notice that you searched for answers and have already asked in the Q&amp;A sticky.

You have a basis in your shakes of no more than $6,500. I would say you can deduct the fair market value of whatever you've donated in a year, until you reach that total. In years after that you can keep donating of course but will not get to take any more deductions.",1506816320

* The Jaapur (cat people) and the Kayon (winged people) both worship Lavina, the Goddess of the Plains and have a thing for freedom. However, they both interpret it differently. The Jaapur think freedom means responsibility, while the Kayon believe freedom means people not telling you what to do. As a result, neither group likes the other.

* The Athar (statue people) and the Korrgan (minotaurs) are very similar to each other. Both loathe war and embrace pacifism, both love scholarly pursuits, both could probably conquer a lot of territory if they tried.

**Both Worlds**

* If the Joloans (merfolk) and the Draiche (dragontaurs) ever met, they would immediately go to war with each other.

As well-constructed and convincing as some revisionist arguments are, I think we'd do well to ignore the whole thing to the greatest possible extent. Certainly, we should never be bringing it up. It muddies the waters unnecessarily.

I've found it rather easy to avoid taking a stance in most cases. To leave aside Holocaust-based justification of present actions, I simply ask whether two wrongs make a right. Holocaust-derived logic is inherently fallacious so there's no reason to engage it on a historical level.

Like you say, it's just too much. We have to accept certain things about normies in order to make progress. One of these things is that most of them will *never* be open to a debate on the veracity of the Holocaust story.",1506816320

While in a show like DS9, the guest actors were usually as good as, if not better than, the main actors, they may not have taken the same approach in DIS. These throwaway characters may have been played by the second-best actors, the also-rans.

I'm waiting for the actual series to start, with the actual main cast. I'm hoping things will improve then.

I am more than happy to engage in a discussion with you.  I encourage it because its extremely important that there is dialogue these days.  

As far as animal abuse or whatever you are referring to it really does not make any sense to me.  And I am a huge animal lover.  I even am a member of Sea Shepherd and have been on a campaign in Taiji protesting the dolphin slaughter.  So I'm all about it.  

But to say that because he cannot consent is abuse and its our fault if he gets hurt or killed is really just plain silly. Look at what you are doing.  You are blaming the good guys here for criminals behavior.  You are blaming police because of the actions of a criminal.  Plus as I said the dogs love it and live for it.  When I left the K9 unit my K9 was depressed and cried for months when I didnt take him to work.  

We keep the K9s.  If you leave the unit you just keep the dog as a pet and everything is your responsibly from there.  Most of us up our homeowners insurance and put of ""Beware of Dog"" signs.  If a burglar goes into the yard its on him.  

I keep thinking about how you say its 100% our fault as a handler if the dog is shot.  Thats just insanity.  I dont want to sound disrespectful but I really cannot believe that there are people out there who think like that.  Many times when K9s are killed those are bullets meant for the police officer with a family.  There is no comparison.  

I love animals as much as anyone.  Shit I am no longer allowed to ever go back to Japan because of it.  But I'm sorry no animals life is worth more than a humans and its just crazy to say what you said.  I really think you need to step back and re evaluate your whole thinking there.  

If we had your way K9s would be eliminated and the amount of dead cops would likely go up 25% or so.  So I want you to think about going to a house.  Knocking on the door and sitting a family down.  I want you to think about looking in a childs eyes and tell them that thier daddy was just ambushed and killed looking in a dark backyard for a known armed suspect.  That you would not allow a K9 to be sent back there because the K9 cannot speak in english and tell you he consents to this.

"LessCredibleDefence","t5_2yyyd","&gt;It just strikes me as completely insane that in 2017, countries like Germany are looking to buy F-15s to be the future backbones of their fleet.

In fairness, if you're a rational entity (in this case, a country) and you're looking to spend several tens of billions of dollars on a product that is intended to form the cornerstone of your (national) defense for the next 10-40 years, it seems reasonable to collect as much data as you can on the purchases that you might make. 

Germany has already received a classified briefing about the F-35, and (as the article notes) has requested classified briefings from Boeing about the FA-18 E/F, the F-15, and briefings from Airbus. 

Maybe I'm being a bit of a square, but to me it seems perfectly reasonable to research a purchase before you make it.

Edit: and sure, to us as outside observers it might seem painfully obvious that the F-35 is the aircraft to commit to. But we don't have access to the classified information, and we may not be aware of what other factors there are to take under consideration (especially pertaining to defense budgets, national politics, and concerns with domestic manufacturing bases (which may be an important factor in Germany's case, in particular)).

I'm playing around 4k mmr (which is a little bit above average today I think) and it's pretty good. I barely ever get really toxic players. 
Starting the game can give you a different experience though, I found that when I tried to play with newcomer friends we ended up playing with a shit ton of toxic players. It does still vary though.

If you still wanna try the game out I suggest going into Bot games (even without other players at first) and just trying out different heroes, looking around the map, trying out different items and last hitting.
Then pick a hero, try a few games and after you've done that look up a video of someone playing that hero(Purge on youtube is very good overall and very thorough).

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","I'm not ""holding you"" to my definition.  I'm telling you I'm not going to read what you write again if you keep trying to hold ME to YOUR definition.  When I state I am an agnostic atheist, and you state ""so you're an agnostic, not an atheist,"" I am not insisting you identify in accordance with my schema, while you are insisting I identify in accordance with yours. 

I don't doubt different groups disagree with each other re: who is the ""real Scotsman.""  I'll re-post my previous comment where I addressed this point: 

&gt;It's as disrespectful as if a Catholic were to insist that every protestant were not Christian, because Jesus said that Peter is the rock upon which he will build his church, and therefore deviation from that church is not Christian.  It's fine as a debate topic to understand positions, but at some point it becomes absurd. 

See?  I already mentioned and addressed the point you've raised; some level of discussion on this point is definitely acceptable.  But I've entertained this enough.  It has become absurd.  You are trying to hold me to your definition of a word, and I'm done with it.  

For what it's worth, I also DO NOT CARE about what is ""embedded in Philosophy.""  This is a Debate forum, where philosophy is welcome--but Rhetoric is key.  Religion does not require philosophical consistency or precision.  This isn't Debate Philosophy. 

Stop insisting my beliefs and my identity conforms to Philosophical jargon.  In your own words:  Since when do groups (philosophers in this case) get to make up their own definitions of words and hold others to them?  Notice what I'm not doing?  I'm not saying the philosophers who define Atheism in one way are ""wrong.""  I am not holding Philosophers to the (one of two) commonly accepted definitions/uses of the word Atheist.  You are coming into a religious debate forum, and insisting I adhere to Philosophical jargon. 

No thank you.  I will use the rhetorically acceptable sources to convey my meaning, to describe my identity, and remain intelligible to non-philosophers, as is my prerogative.  ",1506816326

There is a reason why I didn't mention him among the Rationalists. I primarily see Kierkegaard as a Christian Existential Philosopher but I see some of his descriptions of God as problematic in virtue of the Analogia Entis. Of course we must take into the convertibility of transcendentals and other various principles but I find when we talk about God he is very permissive. It would also be different if he was about Catholic Mysticism. However if his descriptions are taken as the Human Experience of God(such as in the Thomistic phenomenological tradition like Karol Wojty≈Ça) then I can see it as more permissible.

Then again, I see theistic personalism at it's core, heretical. Or at the very least very heterodox. It seems to invalidate many teachings of the Church. In fact I have heard many argue that it results in denial of the Trinity in one form or the other.",1506816326

In the same position, but with his lead, he starts on 10 Ki max, which puts you in a much better position to launch SAs, plus you have 2 of him, one active each turn",1506816330

"infj","t5_2r39a","Hey girl, I don't have too many original thoughts to add, but I am just one more person that absolutely relates to how you feel, almost to a tee. 

I've had those moments of wishing I were more extroverted, less emotional. I've had those moments of feeling too uptight around my friends, afraid to be my real self, because I felt like I was too intense, too much. I've felt very picky about guys, and when I do find one that fits my standards, I get excited and usually end up disappointed. I think in endless circles, and I've definitely had those moments of breaking down countless times. And I still feel all these things.

I'm still working on it, but I think one of the things that has helped me the most is practicing acceptance. So, so many times I have tried fighting my nature and attempting aggressive self-improvement. It sounds counter-intuitive, but sometimes saying ""I accept that I'm not happy with myself right now/where i want to be. I accept that I'm feeling stressed. I accept that I am uptight."" is what is the most freeing. It seems unbearable-- why would I want to ACCEPT that I'm anxious, upset, uptight, overemotional? I want to fight it and get rid of it! But, at least for me, when I accept that this is where I'm at right now, THAT is when I am most able to work past it.

Some tools that have been helpful with that for me is mindfulness and meditation. Valuing myself and doing things I want to do. I highly recommend seeing a counselor because I would have NEVER come to these conclusions without it, or it would have at least taken me a lot longer and been more painful. Try to be aware of your thoughts and feelings, but also not bask in them-- I'm a ruminator, but I think realizing that your thoughts are just THOUGHTS and not yourself is helpful.

I'm still working on the whole high expectations/disappointment thing. I think it's part of being an INFJ, but I see the potential in people easily, whether they're friends or romantic interests. I get mad that this causes me a lot of unnecessary strife, but it's a part of who I am. I know for me what's helpful is getting closure. Unfortunately, you often can't get that from people, but try to somehow create closure for yourself. Generally, if someone doesn't seem to care, that is your answer. They aren't worth your time.

Also, I highly suggest writing. As someone who feels a lot, I feel the NEED to express how I'm feeling to process emotions, and it sounds like you may be similar. I really like writing out my thoughts to process them, and talking it out with people is super helpful. I know that you said you have some trouble connecting with your roommates, but if you feel comfortable, maybe try opening up to one of them sometime and you may be surprised. Also, continue to use your parents as support.

Finally (this has turned into a novel lol), one of the things that has helped me is laughing at the embarrassing things that happen to me. Taking things less seriously isn't easy, but sometimes it can be kind of fun to try out, almost like an experiment. I tell myself ""let's see what I can get away with,"" or laugh at how life works. I've been trying to force myself to be in situations outside of my comfort zone, and it's been increasing my confidence while simultaneously helping me learn and have fun.

"IncelTears","t5_3kvtt","I suppose sexual frustration could have an effect on someone's mood (not really something I would know about, I've never been sexually frustrated). But my current theory regarding incels is that society gives off a series of toxic messages that corner the men who try to live by them, such as: ""Real men don't show their feelings,"" ""Real men have lots of sex,"" ""Real men aren't virgins,"" ""Real men are leaders,"" and other shit that's hard to live up to and occasionally contradictory. 

So, my theory is that a depressed dude who buys into society's messages is gonna end up hating himself, because he won't be able to forgive himself for being depressed and ""weak,"" or for not having friends, or for being a virgin. And it's an incredibly unfair burden to bear, and society doesn't give a shit about the people that can't measure up. 

That's the sort of frustration that I think *really* drives their behavior, and sexual frustration just makes it worse.",1506816334

"LetsTalkMusic","t5_2t4it","This has been a very important topic for me ever since my mid-teens. Music has been one of the most therapeutic/least consequence-laden things to alleviate negative moods for me, and I think it works for many people in the same way it works for others clinically diagnosed with disorders in a traditional and studied ""music therapy"" context, and as deeply, although the effects are  only super easy to see for those who need it most.

I get feelings and motivation, like real neurotransmitter-affecting objective purpose, from music, that couldn't be had anywhere else, and I'm a pretty normal dude without too much to complain about health and mood-wise. But it just brings me so much *further* and to a better place. Certain rhythms, complex harmonies, chords, and consonance/dissonances, along with timbre and textures, done well, serve as therapy and meaning for me. It drives me, fills my lungs with breath, fires up my bones, and spirals me off into modes of thought, perspective and consideration that I could never conceive of elsewhere, *literally*, almost like a drug.

I haven't had to be committed to an institution for a burnout or breakdown, etc yet, but who knows how much emptier my life would be without it, or how content or balanced I would be. I used to abuse cigarettes, alcohol, and weed, and none of those brought me to the same place or motivated me in comparable ways.

"Occupycolumbus","t5_2sz2a","I was there with the black hat shading my face from the sun, yet two people said to me: ‚ÄúYou have beautiful eyes.‚Äù Witchcraft. We were in a row at city hall plaza in the shadow of the JFK building.

The women in witch costumes had signs: ‚ÄòProtect the Dreamers,‚Äô ‚ÄòImmigration is a Human Right,‚Äô ‚ÄòSupport Immigrants ‚Äì Deport Racists,‚Äô ‚ÄòWelcome Immigrants Their Children‚Äô A lot of people gathered to take pictures as the witches sat on a cement wall in a row on City Hall Plaza. I was standing up to the side holding Workers Vanguard on a clipboard and in my hand hawking to the crowd.

Earlier, just after noon, a large table laden with food was set out to feed the arriving protest organizers and rally supporters for immigrant rights. Next to the Massachusetts 54th Memorial, at the top of the stone steps, a sound system was set up and some music was playing. At the foot of the steps, up against a wrought iron gate, there were many signs supporting immigrants and calling for the re-installment of the Dreamers ‚Äì DACA act.

As the rally‚Äôs official starting time of one o‚Äôclock approached more people assembled at the foot of the stairs and around a nearby drink vendor with a pushcart. People were sitting on the park benches chatting and eating food with their protest signs by their side. A group of young women gathered closely together as someone took a ‚Äòselfie‚Äô with their phone. The grey skies of the early morning where clearing up and the temperature was a summery seventy degrees.

While there was a good twenty percent or more of the crowd who were older, most of the people look to be in their twenties. There were lots of white people and Latinos along with a smaller number of black and Asian people. Some people had kids in strollers or by the hand. The rally had a festive atmosphere with food and music and conversations and people greeting friends warmly.

Various groups set up tables with books and newspapers like the Socialist Workers Party, and Socialist Alternative. People circulated through the crowd selling Workers World newspaper, and Workers Vanguard. Some had leaflets to hand out. There were passionate political discussions among the many clots of people gathered around before the speeches.

A large group of about a hundred chanting youth marched up the pathway from Commonwealth Avenue with a large banner chanting ‚ÄúNo Trump, No KKK, No Fascist USA!‚Äù to applause from the crowd which parted so the militant contingent could march to the front.

The crowd had swelled to about four hundred people as the first speaker began to address the crowd. On Beacon Street at the top of the stairs one police SUV with blue lights flashing blocked off one lane of travel, but the tourist double-decker buses and regular traffic still went by ‚Äì some one on the tour bus might be able to get a picture that included the Robert Gould Shaw memorial and the assembled crowd rallying for freedom and compassion right nest to the statue. A dozen cops were near by some of them with bicycles. The police seemed relaxed and the rally and march had a permit with no seeming threat of violence.

A Boston Teachers Union member spoke, someone from the Chelsea Teachers Association also called for tolerance for immigrants whatever their status. Boston mayoral candidate Tito Jackson spoke to the crowd. Some of the speakers addressed the crowd in Spanish. People were steadily coming up the hill from Park Street Station. A brass band was playing near the fountain near the station, and the sounds drifted up and mingled with the chants.

One sign handed out read: ‚ÄúTrump: Tool of the Rich ‚Äì Enemy of All Working People‚Äù

Another sign: ‚ÄúJustice for Immigrants #DefendDACA‚Äù

As the march was to begin the rally marshals lined one of the paths through the common and the speaker at the podium assured people that this was a completely legal march and that there was a permit and the police were in cooperation. The march headed down the slope towards Park Street and crossed Tremont Street as people watched and cheered or jeered from the sidelines. The common was full of people on a beautiful September summer day. Over at the bandstand the Cannabis ‚ÄòFreedom‚Äô Rally was taking place. The marchers went down Winter Street as shopkeepers stepped outside to applaud the defense of immigrant rights.

The march turned north on Washington Street which was full of shoppers as the rally moved down the pedestrian mall. As the march stretched out there looked to be about 2,000 people walking and chanting and carrying signs. At the front of the march there were horn players and drummers making some noise and attracting attention. On the sidewalk people raised their cell phones to take pictures or videos of the protest. Many people applauded. In Boston immigrants have support.

Down Washington Street, past the Irish Famine memorial on School Street, past the Old Globe Bookstore now a food joint, past the Old South Church, and then left at the Old Statehouse where all of New England was once governed from by the Colonial Governor sent by the King.

Up Court Street past the back of the Old City Hall and onto City Hall Plaza and over to the steps at the foot of the JFK Federal Building. The crowd filed in and lined up on the stairs facing a podium and listened to speeches. A little after three o‚Äôclock the last speaker urged the crowd to continue the campaign to show support for Dreamers and other immigrants who need support from the community they are in, and from all decent people. The radical booksellers folded up their tables and some people left signs behind as the sound system was dismantled and some core planners gathered under the trees near City Hall to plan the next steps.

I was drawing on the train home and sketched on the back of a protest poster I picked up as I was leaving city hall plaza. I had a Workers Vanguard newspaper on my clip board and unrolled the sign on top as best I could on my knees. The front of the poster featured a picture of Trump with a diagonal red line across his face with a DANGER logo underneath and a yellow banner reading ‚Äì ‚ÄòRacist Poison.‚Äô Next to the graphic was the slogan: Trump Tool of the Rich ‚Äì Enemy of All Working People. I turned over to the empty white back of the poster board and got a pencil out of my backpack. I looked up and saw a man‚Äôs tee-shirt facing me with an intricate Celtic weave pattern that I copied onto the back of the poster. In a trance I produced a wavy set of grey lines ‚Äì what to put in the middle? I drew a cube head in isometric with Easter Island Eyes. You have beautiful eyes.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Bear in mind, I'm not a historian by trade.

The pre-WW2 import and export sectors were dominated by the [Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley_Tariff_Act) and associated protectionist responses from other nations.  Per the wiki, import and export were about 5% of GNP respectively for the US economy in 1929.

The post-WW2 export sector is rather a different story, though.  America enacted the [Marshall Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan) in 1948, and eventually provided ~$128B in today's dollars of direct aid, which led to an extremely rapid economic reexpansion of Western Europe.  On the other front, [Operation Blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Japan) was successful beyond America's wildest dreams, creating a pacifist, capitalist powerhouse state that remains among America's strongest allies today.  In both Europe and Asia, American factories found ready markets for export of finished goods and it would be decades before domestic suppliers could reasonably compete with American imported goods.

Overall, international trade rapidly expanded in the postwar era.  World Bank has worldwide exports as a share of GDP [tripling since 1960](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS), and 1960 was already a doubling as a share of GDP over 1930.

"synology","t5_2s4co","So it depends on your usage. I've got multiple units and I've done it both ways. Specifically, one of my units is setup for backups and surveillance footage storage. On that one, I have three volumes, one for Time Machine backups, one for every other backup, and one for surveillance footage. I did this because I wanted a hard limit for each of those types.

In the case of the Time Machine backups, I could have controlled the usage via quotas, but if the Mac sees free space, it assumes it can use it, and as such, won't start removing and consolidating backups if I just limit it with a quota. 

In the case of the Surveillance footage, likewise, I can control that via Surveillance Station either by setting a hard storage limit or number of days for camera video retention, but since I was already chopping the volume up, it was just easier from a visibility standpoint to tell how much data was being used for Surveillance and how much was being used for backups. It also allowed me to fine tune the retention policies so that I was using all the space allocated to it. For example, I allocated 2TB. The way I originally had retention setup, it used no more than 1.4TB, so i was able to tweak the individual retention settings so that it got up near 2TB (1.96 actually) without actually going over. That would have been a little more difficult to do if it was on the same volume as the rest of the stuff.

All the other space is in one volume and functions as the local backup storage for everything else on the network.

In contrast, my other two units export storage to my ESXi hosts and function as file/media storage for the rest of the network. Those two units have all their storage in a single volume, and the file/media storage is joined to my active directory domain and I control my users usage via AD permissions and quotas.

So the short answer is, it depends on your storage needs. In the case of Photo Station, you have two options - either a general Photo Station install, where you'll need to control each users permissions within the app itself, or personal Photo Station, where each user gets their own 'version'. You can actually do both. In the case of general Photo Station, you can make it work with folders on other volumes as far as ingesting the photos, but access control will still need to be done within the app, so it's largely pointless. In the case of personal Photo Station, that requires user home directories to be active and each users photos will be stored in their home folders. Home folders can't be split across multiple volumes, so using multiple volumes in that instance is also pointless. Cloud Station only deals with folders, not volumes, so you can make that work.

My advice in general is that, unless you know you need a hard limit on storage space for something, don't carve up the space up into multiple volumes. If you underestimate your needs, then getting more space to the volume will require either deleting and recreating 2 or more volumes, or the addition of another disk (assuming you have bays free). Allocate too much and it might go unused. The access controls are pretty rich, so it's much more flexible to make one volume and control access to the folders within it.

The one exception to that is if you're using expansion units. Never, ever span a volume across multiple units. You're using a DS918+, so lets say you fill all 4 bays and then add a DX517 to get 5 more bays. You set the DS918+ up as SHR, and then you add the 5 drives from the expansion unit to that SHR. Well what happens if your expansion unit goes offline? Maybe it fails, maybe you unplug it by accident, maybe your cats are chasing each other around and one of them yanks it out.... well from a volume perspective, you just lost 5 drives of a 9 drive array thats setup to handle one disk failure at a time. You just lost all of your data. Long story short, each unit, whether main or expansion, should be limited to the physical chassis that contains its drives and no more.

Anyway, kind of long winded, hope that helped.",1506816336

Cuphead is up there, but I can't imagine claiming it's harder than any of the aforementioned games.",1506816337

Also I don't see how an opposite notion would be racist, since I always thought that not being racist and discriminatory in general is about treating people as individuals and not judging them based on whatever group they belong to, not refraining from making any unfavourable statistical observations about that group, but what do I know.

"bipolar","t5_2qnv4","1) A formal diagnosis by a board-certified psychiatrist (an MD) is *strongly* suggested. Bipolar spectrum disorders almost always have considerable genetic components requiring medicinal interventions.

2) That said, most people with BSDs need to make substantial lifestyle changes, and that very often requires work with a psychotherapist who understand what the BSDs are, as well as the specific functions impulsivity may have as defense mechanisms for any given patient. Many MFTs do; many do not and see almost all behavior as near-totally influenced by environmental rather than genetic factors. (""Nurture"" vs. ""nature,"" respectively.) 

My own *substantial* improvement has required continuing attention to both medication and better behavioral choice-making.

The Tariff Act of 1930 (codified at 19 U.S.C. ch. 4), otherwise known as the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff or Hawley‚ÄìSmoot Tariff, was an act implementing protectionist trade policies sponsored by Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis C. Hawley and signed into law on June 17, 1930. The act raised U.S. tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods.

The tariffs (this does not include duty-free imports ‚Äì see Tariff levels below) under the act were the second-highest in the U.S. in 100 years, exceeded by a small margin by the Tariff of 1828.

**Marshall Plan**

The Marshall Plan (officially the European Recovery Program, ERP) was an American initiative to aid Western Europe, in which the United States gave over $13 billion (approximately $132 billion in current dollar value as of September 2017) in economic support to help rebuild Western European economies after the end of World War II. The plan was in operation for four years beginning on April 8, 1948. The goals of the United States were to rebuild war-devastated regions, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, make Europe prosperous once more, and prevent the spread of communism. The Marshall Plan required a lessening of interstate barriers, a dropping of many regulations, and encouraged an increase in productivity, labour union membership, as well as the adoption of modern business procedures.

The Marshall Plan aid was divided amongst the participant states roughly on a per capita basis.

***

**Occupation of Japan**

The Allied occupation of Japan at the end of World War II was led by General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, with support from the British Commonwealth. Unlike in the occupation of Germany, the Soviet Union was allowed little to no influence over Japan. This foreign presence marked the only time in Japan's history that it had been occupied by a foreign power. The country became a parliamentary democracy that recalled ""New Deal"" priorities of the 1930s by Roosevelt.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Greetings from Germany,

it's a wide subject, so I cannot tell it all in a few lines. (Also have to get to sleep soon :) Ok, I guess you know the very basics. I believe that God is one and that He is holy. I believe that we (all man) are sinners and that therefore no one can come to Him. So, whatever you or I could put in those scales, it won't be enough. Then again, I believe that God so loved us all, that He came on earth in the form of His son Jesus to fulfill everything that needs to be done to redeem the shame we brought on Him with our sins and restore us as His creation, chosen to spend eternity with Him. I believe, that He showed us all of this, of how He is, through His Spirit and in His Word, the Bible. Now there is a lot more to say, but a full description of the christian faith is a mighty volume of a book and not just a paragraph here. Please ask any detail, if you want to know more.",1506816341

"giantbomb","t5_2rlj3","they made a bunch of mistakes and got frustrated because they are trying to do the raid blind(ish), but not listen to experts more experienced than brad (who isn't that experienced in terms of this raid) and also doing it in 1 sitting (in this case, 2 long ass sittings). 

it's not meant to go like this. The pro teams that do world's first finished it blind in 6 hours after having tons of experience with previous destiny raids and clan members crunching probilities. Clans that enter blind also grind the SHIT out of the game to ensure high level entry. My own clan grinded to 280+ average in the first week on multiple characters when bungie tweeted that raid entry was 260. DID NOT REGRET IT. why? because overleveling means small mistakes don't cause a wipe like the GB crew faced. It also allowed us things like ""it seems like we need 2 warlocks and 1 hunter"" and we can easily switch and get the right composition in. I watched Abby's Stream mostly, and her lack of sniper rifles, shotguns, and unfamiliarity with her PVE lightning titan tree (because she liked her fire titan loadout) did not help - because every small mistake she made killed her. And equivalent player who had those additional equipment would have survived. 

They did the raid in the most stressful conditions: time limited, underleveled, underequipped, underexperienced (With previous raid conventions), and lacking lore knowledge. Fixing one of those things would have really improved their experience.

in part 2, they ventured 20 minutes into the 'underbelly' shortcut - the reason that's there is pretty great and it does serve as a palette cleanser. But brad led them into the maze without knowing the path OR how to command them to get the chest... of course it's frustrating. 

the raid is solid, but it's like any other MMO-ish game. You come into the raid to finish, you come in with good friends, you are NOT guaranteed to finish. ",1506816342

There's a sort of haunted graveyard show, with moving gravestones, ghostly monks, creepy gargoyles, and so on. The show is pretty well done, but what makes it is the music - Danse Macabre. I go to there purely for the music. That piece is absolutely beautiful. ",1506816342

I'll speak to this, NO! ATP has moved on from offering a large amount of tracks/programs and only offers 4 right now (not counting CTP, Type ratings, etc)

* Zero time 40hr multi engine
* Zero time 100hr multi engine
* PPL 40hr multi engine
* PPL 100hr multi engine

Because you already have your PPL and IR you wouldn't fall into one of those 4 tracks and if they did accept you they'd make you go through IR training again.  ATP has a very specific market they go after and if you don't fit it they are not going to create a custom program for your needs.


Talking more about getting your CPL; the hardest part about getting your CPL is getting the required flight time.  At 200 hrs you are already pretty close.

This question is a little tricky because of the fact that a focus for Epic is to standardize practices across an enterprise, yet at the same time allow for customization from the out of the box version. Basically, a lot depends on the work of the analysts in the IS dept of your organization. Befriending an analyst with a clinical background on any of your IS department's Epic teams (ie Willow for pharmacy, Orders for CPOE) at your site will go a long way. Also, being a superuser requires helping out more up front, but really does help your comfort with the system most times. So some of below is kind of general/basic, but thought I'd put it out there.

The simplest tip I have is for people who like keyboard shortcuts and hate their mouse. If you look closely to clickable buttons, you'll see usually one of the letters of the title is underlined. That means if you type alt + that underlined letter (i.e. the a in accept is usually underlined, so type alt + a) you will select that button without having to click it.

The checkbox to see if a note was copied or created new by that user is awesome and wasn't always around. This (http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2629493) is a neat piece in JAMA about UCSF (an Epic shop) trying to try and explore the extent of copying and pasting that occurs. 

If you work with certain specialties often and want to look at their specific encounters often, checking out creating and saving a filter. Same with in the meds activity - if you need to do some daily or regular checking about certain meds and want to filter to those meds quickly. Basically filters for any of the tabs in chart review or the medication activity. 

Don't be afraid to check out different reports that are available (click the magnifying glass to explore the whole list). And the list of reports may not be the same at the different spots in a patient encounter, so worth exploring the various lists. If you like something better you can hit the wrench button next to the magnifying glass and make it a button so it's more accessible. If you're working onc and want to get to the springboard report and/or treatment plan manager of an active treatment plan, a round about way to get there if you're in a weird department/encounter or simply in an area where it's not easy to get to - go to the Episode tabs of chart review (an active treatment plan is considered an episode for that patient, and is usually stored there).

Check out my reports/reporting workbench. Some places are more robust with this, but if setup and established, can really let you search for a lot of things. Also check if different synopsis views are built to review labs/meds... sometimes they're kept general or built specific to a therapeutic area.

Sorry that was probably all basic stuff, but hey you'd be surprised what some people never get shown. If anything the keyboard shortcut keeps me sane. 

Lastly, when the time comes, please report issues! And be adamant, persist, and almost redundant about it. Sometimes half the battle us getting the appropriate problem reported to the right person who can actually fix it. I've worked clinical and got Epic certified. Then I went back to clinical and was shocked by some things people just put up with and did work arounds when they could have been fixed, but the IS team never knew. A big part of that is IS management and process, which may not be that great...

Good luck. It is better than paper for the sake of the healthcare continuum. Charting requirements and stubborn closed tech minded (ie Epic) make it not as great as it should be. And as others said, it's definitely not a bad EMR relative to other products.

And it'll be a long while before the install is complete, so bookmark this for later. And you can bet it'll be more expensive than the contract for installing costs, consultants, etc.",1506816345

Their expansion is actually focused on their unimatrix, which can be upgraded and expanded. I believe you can make additional space stations as well, but I don't know the specifics.

As for your fleet shooting and ships but not planets, that sounds like it might be a bug. Maybe your version hasn't been updated yet? I'm not sure if the Star Trek mod has been updated to 1.8.

I assume that you are aware of this already, but there is a difference between fleets and troops. Fleets attack ships and stations, then you drop ground troops to occupy one. The army screen can be hard to miss if your new, so I just thought I would point it out just in case.

The Borg are probably not the easiest species to start out with. They have a lot of power, but they also have some very specific features which are very different from the way the base game - and the rest of the races in the Star Trek mod.

Additionally, your example gives a beer with a higher starting grav ending lower, and a lower starting grav ending higher. Why would that be, or was this just an off the cuff example? I would imagine a higher gravity to end higher? I'm used to making wine where most things feement to dry, so I'm in new territory with beer yeasts.

As for striking temp, I shot for 170¬∞ on this brew, and 169¬∞ on the brew I literally have boiling as I type this. I was under the impression the actual temp of the grain and water mix in the lauter tun was most important for the process. I'd love to know more about this honestly. You can see what I did in the post for this beer, but the American Pale Ale I'm brewing now called for a 148¬∞ lauter tun temp for 75 minutes which I thought interesting. For this I had to throw the ratio out the window to meet temp (adding cool water), so I see what you mean there with striking volume. Why the difference in lauter temp though? What does this affect? I'm full of questions! 

I definitely understand sacrificing volume for the good of the brew, but I don't completely grasp exactly why you would do so etc. Also I am reading up on BU:GU now and honestly hadn't even heard of it until you brought it up! So much to learn!",1506816347

"Fantasy_Football","t5_2qxqc","Palmer and Siemien are good options but I feel Cousins has better fantasy potential. Not a whole world better, but better. I feel Cousins is better motivated. The Redskins have been franchise tagging him for years but I feel he wants out and if the 'Skins cut him loose the Kirk Cousins sweepstakes will be the biggest offseason story not involving the national anthem. He will get a huge contract, probably become the highest paid player in the NFL. Does he deserve it? No. But you don't get what you deserve, you get what you negotiate, so I feel it's keeping him extra motivated to perform. And he's had back-to-back seasons of at least 4,000 yards (last year he was scratching 5,000). So I see him having a high floor, like, dare I say...Drew Brees?

He's coming off a 365 yard-3 TD game. I don't see him selling you short. The Cards are missing a step without DJ and Palmer is old, and the Broncos aren't the Manning MVP Broncos, they look more like the Retiring Manning Broncos, and I feel Siemien is more of a game manager than a gamebreaker.

And he missed practice for family reasons. He and his wife just had a baby. Maybe he had to go to hospital. Nothing to fret about.",1506816350

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","For years religion has been used to manipulate people to do the right thing. They say if you are bad then you are going to hell. They say that god legitimately decides that if he doesn‚Äôt think you are good enough that you are going to hell. This is not the case at all.

First of all I need to point out what heaven and hell really are. Heaven is simply being in the presence of God and hell is not being in the presence of God. The way the Bible portrays hell is poetic and people for years took it literal and pretty much perverted it. 

There is no evil in heaven and there is no good in hell. It is physically impossible for there to be an exception. This is because morality becomes objective instead of subjective. Good and evil are split into two different realities. They both cannot exist in both heaven in hell. 

Where your soul goes after completely depends on if your soul is ‚Äúclean‚Äù. It has nothing to do with how bad or good you are.

If you ‚Äúaccept Jesus into your heart‚Äù then your soul becomes clean because he was innocent. Then after that sin cannot enter back into our souls because god can‚Äôt be touched by sin and Jesus is God. 

My God loves everybody and he doesn‚Äôt care if you are Jeffery Dahmer. He wants us all to go to heaven. It comes down to subjective physics. If we are ‚Äúclean‚Äù then we can be in Gods kingdom. If we are ‚Äúdirty‚Äù then we can not. ",1506816351

You the founders of the country were immigrants and were bolstered by many more immigrants over many years but they formed a single cohesive identity. Sure theres different flavours of it state by state, county by count and city/town by city/town but theres still a single unifying identity behind it. 

People can immigrate into the country and stay outside it and they will always be an immigrant with their kids being left somewhere on the fringes of society without a real understanding of where they belong. Then again an immigrant can wholeheartedly accept the countries identity and try to emulate it or at least show it a certain modicum of respect. They would invariably gain citizenship (Its the goal of basically every legit immigrant) and their kids would be raised within that american cultural identity with some smatterings of the culture the family had come from as a garnish, something on the side. Those kids are not immigrants. Not by any stretch. Saying ""We are all immigrants"" is saying that you dont agree with the american cultural identity and you dont want yourself or anyone really to conform to it.

"LisfrancClub","t5_3ebl3","Hey man I just wanted to share my experience with ORIF. I had my surgery roughly about 6 weeks post injury due to a misdiagnose. I had no fractures or broken bones, but the some ligaments were torn completely that I needed surgery after an MRI. The doctor explained my options including both ORIF and Fusion and he still recommended ORIF due to fact that I'm still young and had a decent chance of recovery(27y.o. at the time of the injury). He also said that fusion was a backup option if ORIF was not successful and I had the choice of doing another surgery. I had screws in to pin the bones and removed after 3-4 months. The recovery process has been very slow and will plateau at times. There are days when it feels like it's not getting better or getting worse and it's painful to be walking around at all. I was pessimistic about my recovery and had accepted that I'll have to live in constant pain from walking. Like other posts have mentioned everyone is different and I'm not sure about the severity of your injury, but it's been about a year and I'm happy to say that it's recovered much better than I had originally anticipated. At the very least I have no issues doing day to day activities or sports(nothing high impact, but I have no issues playing raquet sports and jogging), there is the occasional stiffness and odd discomfort and a bit of numbing within the foot, but nothing to severely decrease my quality of life like I was expecting.

3 months ago, I was chosen to perform guard duty for my camp and luckily(,I thought), I was expected to prowl. I honestly thought it was goingto be a breeze walk but it wasn't. On that fateful night, up on a hill where we were supposed to patrol, I heard a group of people climbing up the cliff. Honestly, I was shocked because I didn't expect anyone to infiltrate here, since it's a paramedical school..but they did. In an instant, we took cover behind a tree 40m away from the commotion. My buddy was on high kneel position while I was proning. We waited and listened and found out that they were Japanese. My heart started racing because my bunkmates always mentioned about dead Japanese soldiers from WW2 during their guard duty and I thought it was a hoax. They even told me to ignore them and continue prowling but I thought it was off protocol. I began to call back the coms and tell them about the commotion and I told them I'm engaging. So I said sir stop sir  and all of them looked towards my direction. I told them to walk to the direction of my voice. And then this happened.... I'm not going to lie to you guys. At that point of time, I felt like my balls dropped and I was praying to whatever god was out there to save me. My buddy fainted and I was left alone. With their rifles above their heads, I pointed my torch at them to see them clearly here's the thing guys. I did not expect this shit tbh...their faces look straight out of some zombie movie. You can really see their heads with bruises and scars and some with worms sticking in and out of their ears and eyes.. Their bodies were soaked in blood, some of their flesh torn apart and their guns were outdated. I stood there close to 10s and I did not know what to do. I couldn't comprehend what just happened and I quickly firemanlifted my buddy, called the coms, asked for backup and ran as fast as I could. As I turn back, I saw the soldiers standing there still with their rifles abovd their heads staring at us.

TLDR;
didn't believe in the stories shared about WW2 japanese soldiers ghosts until I saw them during guard duty",1506816358

He doesn't have the lateral quickness to stay in front of elite guards which is why guys like Westbrook cook him every time they match up. In terms of advanced states, you can't take some of it (like DRPM or D+/-) into account because of the elite defenders he shares the court with but more individual states like PnR defense rank him pretty poorly because he doesn't fight through contact. Ultimately, though, the best way to gauge defense is the eye test. He is a poor iso defender, gets lazy off-ball at times and loses his man and has a bad ball watching issue. Even his own coach admits it. You remember that game last year when Kerr benched Curry at the end of the game in favor of a defensive lineup and he was pouting on the bench?

&gt; I have a very minor version of what I think you‚Äôre talking about.  Over the course of these crazy past five or six years, I have become rather jaded in the public sphere and the political deliberations that take place in it. Xorgials aren‚Äôt xorgial, anti-blerpians are pretty blerpian themselves, Doingians don‚Äôt care about doinginity, etc. etc. My political tribe has betrayed every single moral principle that made me support them in the first place, and the outgroup is as terrible as ever.

&gt; So, I extended the tools I was taught to apply to the claims of the outgroup to my ingroup‚Äôs sacred beliefs, and voil√†, turns out everybody lies. Hardly anyone is interested in the truth for truth‚Äôs sake, hardly anyone is interested in moral principles for the principle‚Äôs sake. Everything anybody tells you is probably based on motivated reasoning and I‚Äôm better off distrusting it.

&gt; But that‚Äôs a terrible world to live in! How do I escape?

"arabs","t5_2qt0d","&gt; This isn't correct, it's a common myth. Arabs were not limited to the peninsula until Islam and then they all burst out conquering everybody. Arabs settled the Levant millennia before Islam. Ghassanid Christian Arabs, for example, ruled areas of the Levant before Islam

I actually knew about this (this sounds super patronising but I'm not intending it to sound like that), and I should've expressed it differently. What I rather meant is that islamisation went hand-in-hand with people adapting Arab Muslim identity, rather than Assyrian Muslim identity. Thank you for this addition!!

&gt; Finally, Arab is an ethnic identity for most Arabs. Some view themselves as being Arab only linguistically, but I would say the majority of Arabic speakers would say that they are at least partially descended from peninsular Arabs, and this makes them Arab. 

I don't know if that can be said for the majority of Arabic speakers. Like there are Arabic speakers such as Syrian Turkmen for example who definitely don't ID as Arab. But I don't want to go into detail too much on this. Personally I identify as Arab as an ethnic identity because to me, it's not relevant whether I've got ancestry from the peninsula or not, or whether all of my ancestors were assimilated into Arab identity. I see being culturally Arab as what makes me ethnically Arab; and I generally don't think it's genetics what's the most important when it comes to determining ethnicity, but I'm trying to keep this as short as possible, so I won't elaborate.

&gt; Also, Iraqis were not ""more or less forced to convert to Islam"". This is some sort of simplistic anti Islam trope that's common these days.

I mean, I'm Muslim myself. Not devout or anything, and I don't consider my personal religious beliefs to be the most important anyway when it comes to me being Muslim ‚Äî not sure how to express this best, but I hope the idea came across; I'll try and word it differently if it didn't. So basically, I don't have an interest in using simplistic anti-Islam tropes alt-right idiots use. It makes my eyes roll when the same alt-righters who will talk about how Islam was spread by the sword then act like Western imperialism and forced conversions by the Catholic Church in Latin America were inherently different, by virtue of being Western. 

&gt; As if no one ever chose to convert but were all forced into it. The Rashidun and Umayyads did not force conversion on populations as a policy,

See, just because I'm Muslim myself doesn't mean I'll have to believe that my all of my ancestors adapted Islam entirely willingly, **when chances are they didn't**. Islam spread by the sword, but it also spread simply because some people couldn't afford to pay jizya. Later in history, it also spread because Christians started converting to Islam to prove that their loyalty wasn't with the European crusaders. Yes, the Rashidun and the Umayyads didn't force conversion, but that doesn't mean the entire Middle East just voluntarily adapted Islam.

&gt;  and many populations converted quickly out of choice, such as Egyptians and Berber groups across North Africa.

Aside from the fact that this isn't historically true (the people of modern day east Tunisia alone left Islam **several** times and were ordered to convert back each time, and speaking of North Africa, let's not call the Imazighen ""Berber""!) and there are sources that contradict your statement ‚Äî it's also not realistic, at all. What should make anyone just *quickly out of choice* convert to a new religion?

See I get where you're coming from, although I can't agree with you. It's disingenuous when Western historians imply the Islamic conquest was, by virtue of being Muslim, inherently different from the imperialism of Western Christianity. 

But you're not going to effectively rebuke this by turning around and claiming that the Middle East became voluntarily Muslim.",1506816361

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"ArtCrit","t5_2qoaq","I think the one thing that stands out the most of me is the asymmetry of the face. It's generally a nice painting, but it's a bit janky since the right [my right] eye is positioned improperly. The corners of the eyes should be on the same wavelength and the right eye is up higher than the left. This is why mirroring the canvas as often as you can is so important!  The nose is okay, but the left side of the upper lip has the same problem as the eyes, it looks really good proportion-wise but the right side sort of shifts inwards, again- why it's so important to mirror the canvas! 

I totally understand this is a huge pain in the butt, as I too have a hard time remembering to flip my canvas as often as I should. 

I also feel like you jumped into the fine details wayy too soon, which is why the errors of this painting are so apparent. The skin texture is lovely, things are blended really nicely, he has a skin texture, he has freckles, beautiful eyes and great eyebrows, but the funky asymmetry easily tanks out the entire illustration to look [odd] to a normal viewer. 

I've personally learned that it's important when you finish a painting to let it lie for a while, so you can analyze it with a fresh eye when you come back to it [another great tip is taking breaks every so often and do something completely different for a while] so that you can have that fresh eye and self-analyze to see if there are any glaring mistakes that you have to fix before putting in the 'fun stuff' i.e - fine details. Like the hair- it's generally not a good thing to make strands of the hair so individualized, which I've heard from multiple professional artists tanks a drawing because you notice the intense detail of the hair and it becomes distracting.

Otherwise, I can tell from the amount of time you put into this, that you worked really hard on it. You have a LOT of good points, and the image could be easily reworked to look right with a bit of liquifying in Photoshop. Otherwise, it's a very nice painting generally!

Islamic law allows any male or female Christian, Muslim or Jew to sacrifice as long as that person follows the proper procedure of slaughtering. Therefore, it is primarily for this reason that a dhabƒ´·∏•a animal can never be kosher for observant Jews because the slaughter would be performed by a Muslim.

"NewSkaters","t5_2tqri","That's a little hard to explain. Think about it like an ollie for a minute. When you do an ollie, obviously you get to a point where you're in the air and your feet level out, and that is more or less the highest point of your ollie. When you are working on kickflips, ideally the board does its full rotation and hits your feet when they are at the highest level point. So in other words the board has done a full kickflip while you were jumping up and you are stomping it before either you or the board are going downwards. If you look at dudes doing big kickflips over stuff (not necessarily down stairs I mean more like kick flipping rails or garbage cans), you'll see what I mean. 

In terms of the HOW, I think it comes down to perfecting the flick of the front foot so the board snaps around fast and crisp, but most importantly FAST lol. And as your flip speed gets faster, you can start mashing your tail harder and voila, you are doing higher and more useful kickflips. 

Flip speed and height helps with everything as you build on the trick. Like if you want to to a backside kickflip boardslide or noseslide, which are the easiest slides to kickflip into, you need that rotation to happen fast and also high so you can catch the flip over the ledge or whatever and stomp down into the slide.

Edit: Obsidian is like glass and shatters easily, making it pretty bad for kitchen applications. Steel can be made similarly sharp, but as you use it, the edge dulls as more and more molecules at the edge get bent out of shape, making the wedge tip wider (and duller). Steel is also very cheap to make sharp compared to obsidian, which is why even hospitals don't generally use obsidian blades (although they are available to those rare hospitals with lots of money).",1506816366

  When the second kidal charged at them, Petra loosened their body so that the blade would merely pass through them. Petra barely reacted at all as Churdu hacked and slashed at Petra's gaseous upper body; they just coldly stared into his eyes. Petra was feeling shocked and surprised inside, but none of that was reflected on their face. 

  After a good while of time passed and Churdu's movements became sloppier and more tired, Petra decided they had had enough and would start making threats of their own. Petra returned to their gaseous state and slammed into Churdu's body, lifting them up into the air and knocking them back into the sand. Petra, the large four armed cloud that they currently were, rushed Churdu while he still had the breath knocked out of him, sucked in his knife, and sifted through his body for any more sharp object. Anything that felt like a weapon was pulled out and tossed aside into the sand. Once finished, Petra reformed into their kidal-like body, though once again pitch black and with a smooth, nondescript face shape, and floated cross-legged in the air between the two kidal. 

  /""Can we just stop making threats?!""/ they said to Churdu forcefully. Petra formed a second face on the back of their head to look at Shadha and spoke again, this time softer.

  /""Let's start over. I'm *Petra*. And you're not going to stab me or shit yourselves. And *you*""/ they looked sternly at Shadha,

"podcasting","t5_2s41r","If quality is your main concern, then the Blue Spark digital is an awesome iOS friendly option.  It doesn't require separate power, and it comes bundled with a lightening cable.

However, it's a very sensitive condenser mic, which might not be ideal for your needs.  It works best in a quiet environment that is free of echo and reflected sounds.  The reason is, because it captures all the subtlety of the sound in front of it, which is great for pristine vocals, but tricky to clean up if you have high ambient noise levels.

The other big advantage of this mic, is that it also comes with a solid stand with a built in shock mount, which makes it an awesome option for portable recording sessions on a table-top.

Last month, I used mine in my car outside a coffee shop to record a podcast while on vacation and it was awesome, and the results were fantastic.

If you want to hear what it sounds like, listen to [this episode of my cast](http://www.snlafterparty.fm/episodes/2017/9/6/weekend-update-summer-edition-3).

FYI... I also use it mounted on a boom in my regular home podcast recording space, so the last 10 or so episodes of my cast are all recorded using it.

If you want a more straightforward mic, that is more forgiving of noisy environment, try looking for a dynamic mic, paired with an inline XLR to USB+pre-amp solution.  I'm a fan of the Blue Encore 100 paired with a blue icicle for this sort of setup.  Keep in mind though, that you'll need the iOS camera adaptor kit to connect the USB output of the icicle.

I think Sweetwater has a good bundle for that sorta setup that also includes a tabletop stand and cabling for the mic.

Walk-On Role

Daniel, you're clearly one of the most underrated players in this recruiting class. Here at UConn, we haven't let you go unnoticed. You have the 3 point shot of a young Steph Curry, or maybe, UConn legend Ray Allen. We'd love to have you one day have a similar game to Ray's. We here at UConn appreciate your sacrifice by wanting to take a Walk-On. That's beneficial because we are trying to fill our scholarships with talented players to put around you Daniel. We went 25-5 last year, and we're 5th in returning talent. I was a COTY candidate as well, leading my team farther than Notre Dame. That combination means we're going to be very great this year. We can make the leap to be the top team in the NCBCA if we can add you too. With you on this team, we will win the Big North and be able to make a real run at the national title.

Interestingly, UConn has great programs for learning Arabic, or for studying Middle Eastern history!

You're going to be a huge off-the-bench spark for this Connecticut team with your great passing, great shooting, and good defensive ability.

So, Daniel, ready to be one of the best shooters in UConn history, following in the footsteps of the great Ray Allen? I think you're going to be a huge off the bench stud for, as you call us, UCoon.

Go Huskies!",1506816370

Add the PS2 dpad on top of that and it just seems hopeless. It looks nice, though. I have a PS2 with FMCB/OPL and you can set DaiOuJou to 480p output, looks really sharp over component cables.

I heard the DonPachi port for Saturn was bad, that's why I went straight for DDP. Guess I'll have to check out the PS1 version!

btw, I noticed there's also this pad for PS2:

https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/usedphotosna/51016276_614.jpg

They're supposed to be quite good. Might be a cheaper alternative to the Saturn pads.

One thing that could make the &gt;100USD asking price for the PS2 Saturn pad more reasonable is the availability of PS2 controller adapters. I did some research and the PS2 Saturn pad apparently works with quite a few of them. I could possible use that pad on DC, Classic Xbox and PS3 as well.

You mentioned that the shoulder buttons on the Playstation Saturn pad are different from the normal Saturn controller. Are they not clicky or what changed?",1506816371

Did anyone honestly make mixed sets in Low rank? Thats 2/3rds of your game where a huge part of gameplay is just not worth making. Say you do farm up Double Gore (a popular set with good bonuses). You no longer can experiment with making a new piece of armor without making every other piece you wear obsolete. So what do most people do? Ignore every armor set until they get the one they want.


Full sets are just alternatives, more choices that can compete. You can still make mixed sets, probably better than full, but at least set bonuses are necessary as to make full sets viable.",1506816371

I would recommend doing this after a shower, or after putting a hot pack on your face to soften the pimple and bring it closer to a head. Sterilize the area, the lancet is already sterile, once you have lanced the cystic acne, use q tips to gently pop the pimple. Q tips are much more hygienic than fingernails and also will not cause as much damage after that sanitize again then put a hydrocolloid bandage on it. You can find these at most drugstores like CVS or walgreens, they sometimes are called blister covers, here is a link for them. Good luck, just don't obsessively pick at it, you will regret it :(

Many of us apostates were raised in good faithful families, believing fully the doctrine we were taught.   I certainly was, right up until the business about the curse of Cain, dark skin, and the potential lightening of it due to righteousness.  Eventually I realized it was all far more statistically unlikely to have happened at all, but I was way above the ""age of reason"" when I figured that out.

And to say apostates are not framed as worse than murder, murder is a sin that sends someone to the lowest level of heaven (which they can escape if they are unawRe of the gospel and babtised posthumously), vs apostasy sending someone to outer darkness (a worse fate) for eternity.  One is clearly worse than the other.

"OverwatchUniversity","t5_3ejpe","Some feedback on the Winston half, will look at Rein tomorrow:

As is common with Winstons, you aren't using jump as an offensive tool enough. Jump/Melee cuts your TTK in half on squishies. Honestly, mid fight you should be using it on CD to keep consistently high damage, and reloading mid jump.

Your target priority is also a bit off, and you spend way too much time focusing tanks down very slowly and having all your work undone by Mercy. Not enough time going after killable squishies or Mercy herself. 

From 1:30 to 2:30 literally all the work you do is undone by their Mercy. Jumping on her once may have won your team that fight.

Ult use is questionable too. You ult to prolong your life in a lost fight a couple times. That's just 1000 points worth of ult charge for the enemy team, and all the damage you did for their healers.

Ammo awareness not great. You spend a lot of time on 10ish ammo, waiting for something to do and then finding you can't do it because you're reloading. This stops you from getting quite a few kills. 

There are a few moments where you're looking for something to do and just kind of wonder about. Jump straight up. Either you distract their DPS and leave them as easy targets for your team, or they ignore you and you get a great aerial view of the battle, and can pick a nice juicy target to land on.

I do understand you are trying to play more defensively, but Winston is a dive tank. You need to dive. Spot a target, call them out on voice, dive on them. Alternatively have your Zen call his discords and dive those. You are playing *very* passively and not using your jump pack to get back from spawn, to claim high ground, to scout ahead, or to chase down and clean up fleeing enemies. ",1506816377

Sorta like how I was briefly impressed when a friend came back from Italy with a ""I survived Etna!"" shirt thinking ""what are the odds that he'd both visit during an eruption, *and* find some entrepreneur quick thinking enough to print shirts for tourists"", until I did some research and realized that particular volcano is one of a few classified as being in a state of ""continuous eruptions"", and ""surviving"" it is more of a matter of just planning a way to be there during the right conditions.

"ActLikeYouBelong","t5_374au","Not really dude. When it comes down to it, this is basically what happened.

The school has full authority to manage their bulletin boards. If they don't like what is there, for any reason whatsoever, they can remove it. And that's what they did. You seem to miss the fact that they are not depriving you of your free speech, they are simply not obligated to provide a platform on which to do so. You keep getting caught up on the fact that your speech was religious in nature and therefore you believe it is your right to post those things. But here's the important part. It's not if they tell you to stop. They might have even agreed with what you were saying but didn't think it was an appropriate forum or media to have that conversation. They didn't silence you, they just didn't want their boards used for that conversation. 

As far as the posters being your ""property"", I'm pretty sure everyone but you agrees that when you post stuff on a bulletin board it no longer has the kind of legal protections that your property does. In fact it becomes the purview of the facility to do what they want with your posters. And again, that's what they did.

You responded by following the administrators around, and eventually threatening them with force, which could easily be considered an illegal threat and a crime. You recorded them despite them demanding that you stop, which isn't a crime, but I guarantee violates your student code of conduct.

Now all this so far isn't why you were kicked out. You were kicked out because of how you proceeded from here. It's hardly uncommon for a student to cause an incident like you did, what's uncommon is the way you refused to swallow your pride and apologize. In fact, you tried to get the school to send you copies of things in what sounds like some sort of a Dropbox where the password was always things like ""gayunionsarewrong"" and ""carroluniversityiswrong"". Doing that isn't a sign of trying to reconcile. It's not the action of a person who is being mature. It's one of the most immature, petty things I can possibly think of, and it certainly doesn't fall under the kind of behavior God would condone.

When they sent you a copy of the allegations made against you, you sent back an annotated copy, utterly missing the point of the first. When they gave you three very reasonable options on how to proceed, you responded with ""counter offers"" while having absolutely nothing to offer them.

Of course you got kicked out. You refused to abide by the schools policy regarding posters. When confronted by the administration you were comparative and threatening. In the proceeding events, you used every opportunity to jab at and disrespect the school. 

And you occasionally mention trying to sue the school for ""a lot of money"". That just makes you look worse.

Theres a reason you got kicked out. You broke the rules and were rude and belligerent about it. There's a reason that 50 lawyers didn't get back to you. You don't have a case. There's a reason you have the entire internet responding disapprovingly. You acted like a dick.

"PlanetCoaster","t5_38eet","It has a good layout! However, the shaping of the elements is not good, and it is very unsmooth. Id suggest to watch some coaster PoVs to see how they do their trackshaping to get more natural feeling elements. When you also keep your g forces at acceptable levels your coasters will drastically improve. Some basic limits to start with are vertical g between -2 and +4 and laterals under 2. 

For smoothing, due to how the game handles rolling (track banking) you can never get coasters as smooth as they should be, and it is a huge flaw of the coaster builder, but there are some tricks that will give at least somewhat decent results. Try the 4m smoothing trick by Silvarret, except use 5-6m track pieces and only smooth forward, not backwards. Also watch the vid about the auto-complete trick, which can work in some cases.

The original comment's content was as follows:

---

&gt; Thx, your statement in another reply about hard drive space is realistic, it's not a valid concern. Segwit2x is not bad, I'm just not convinced if it's a good timing to deploy it now, as a hard fork should never be taken lightly. But let's face it, we know it's not a very big deal technically  bitcoin is not in danger because of doubling the size of the blocks. (bandwidth and stuff are not reasonable arguments).
&gt; 
&gt; What really concerns me is the way it was decided. Under closed doors. With really few actors (in decentralised networks your financial wealth should not be taken account of). Without asking or inviting core devs!. OK they're not Gods, I don't want them to take full control of bitcoin even if they are among the persons I will put my trust on blindly but here the thing. Bitcoin should be trustless!!!
&gt; 
&gt; But still, not inviting them as they are among the few that really understand bitcoin, as technical advisors at least,( again they're not master of bitcoin, consensus is the ruler) . It just puts red flags in my mind. 
&gt; 
&gt; Miners wants it? OK it's their choice. But I'm not sure other nodes accept it (charts show the contrary). If majority of actors wants segwit2x, I think it's OK, there is consensus, if I'm not personally happy with that I could switch to another coin or start coding my own. 
&gt; 
&gt; But if few nodes(miners in our case) can influence the whole network by taking in hostage everyone with the hashing difficulty retargeting mess that will occur if they all fork, I'll be very concern about the future of bitcoin in long terms. 
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, not very interesting cause not backed by solid arguments. But my personal feeling about it is that I think this is an attempt to some powerful actors to take control of bitcoin and make it ineficient as a global public censorship borderless immutable efficient way to give back to people control of their money (Andrea leaves that body :D). A bit complotist, exagerated but my point of view. ",1506816393

The second case would be Chroma; the way we encounter the WarFrame during ""The New Strange"" and the blueprints required to craft Chroma ourselves leads me to believe that the design was created as a stop-gap from salvaged parts of other WarFrames during a prolonged mission against the Sentients, and so would not have seen an Orokin prototype from which a Primed variant would originate.

That aside, [DE] will likely provide a Prime for the greater majority of WarFrames, regardless of quest availability or other methods of procurement. The Prime Vault and various other systems surrounding the release of Prime WarFrames is generally beneficial for business (both financially and by stimulating player activity).",1506816395

Contrary to some belief, George didn't make him up during the writing of ADWD, he was there and foreshadowed as early as Book 1 (to the point where GRRM is laying it on a bit thick with how many times he mentions Aegon's corpse being unrecognisable in AGoT).

Originally he was supposed to show up to complicate Daenerys' invasion of Westeros in the second book (back when ASoIaF was a trilogy). I think that a key concern is that, unless there has been a significant restructuring of the narrative, (F)Aegon's arrival could indicate there are more than two more books to come. It also doesn't invalidate the point that George could have eliminated the character and storyline at any point up to starting to write Tyrion's chapters for ADWD back in 2001/02 (and of course before ADWD was published in 2011), and come up with other explanations for the House of the Undying vision.",1506816396
"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","""Animal"" presupposes that the creature shares part of its family tree with terrestrial animals, like humans and fruit bats and ball pythons and so forth. So let's say it's just some arbitrary creature. Maybe it looks kind of like a scaly cat.

It would be stupendously improbable, but there might actually be only one general way for life to evolve. But let's use that improbability.

We could easily say whether it's likely or overwhelmingly improbable that it's from Earth. We'd check its microscopic composition. If it's not composed of cells, well, that's unlike anything we've found on Earth, so it's almost certainly not from Earth. If it's composed of cells but the materials composing the cells are wildly unlike anything we've observed before, it's almost certainly not from Earth. We check for DNA. If it doesn't have DNA, it's almost certainly not from Earth.

If it has DNA, we can do a comparative analysis of its DNA with Earth animals. If we get a 25% match between humans and this creature, it's not an animal (not a member of kingdom Animalia) but is almost certainly of terrestrial origin. If we get like a 0.5% match, that's probably just coincidence, and it's a freak example of convergent evolution.",1506816396

We get an absolute ton of questions asked on this subreddit, and the result is that it is highly likely that any user's individual question will have been asked before, and likely answered.

The result is that people get tired of repeating themselves and having to browse past the same questions every day, so the community decided to have these resources like the Q&amp;A thread so people can ask any type of question without a negative response, and the people that actively want to answer simple questions can look for them in one place.

I would always recommend you do a quick search, then ask a question in the Q&amp;A sticky, and wait for a response there. Mentioning that you couldn't find anything through searching sometimes helps. If you don't get an adequate response in the Q&amp;A sticky within a day or so, I'd only post a new thread with a question with the clear notice that you searched for answers and have already asked in the Q&amp;A sticky.

&gt;What Can I Experience Now?  
Star Citizen is currently in Alpha which means that the technology and designs that bring the game to life are still in development. To help us refine and improve as we continue development, we have divided the game into several modules that are available now for early testing. With your Star Citizen game package, you can start playing all of these modules today and help provide us with much needed insight and feedback.  
Currently Available Modules:  
Arena Commander: An arcade-style dogfighting and racing mode that allows us to test our ships and physics-based flight model as players battle alongside and against their friends in multiple arenas and game.  
Star Marine: A fast-paced battleground where players put our unique FPS gameplay through its paces, testing the seamless third and first person unified animations, zero-G combat, and a variety of high-tech weapons.  
Area18: Originally designed as a test for planetside interactions, Area18 is an ultra-detailed cityscape for you and your friends to explore, go shopping, or just see the sights.  
Hangar: Your own personal space to look at your ships up close, edit your loadouts, and see your special reward flair and decorations.  
Persistent Universe: Commonly known as the PU, this mode combines all the other modes and allows players to explore a small section of one of our solar systems. Here you and your friends can do missions, engage in ship or FPS combat, or explore asteroid fields for long forgotten wrecks. This has all been built on our 64-bit game engine that provides seamless travel from inside a space station, to a spaceship so large that you and your friends can walk around inside while flying thousands of kilometers through space. All in real time. All without load screens. It‚Äôs here in the PU that you begin to see the real promise of Star Citizen.  

And in the next patch:

Some games are rated M and probably fine for an 11 year old (your judgement might differ from mine) while others are definitely not. Also a game costs 60 when new and less as it gets older. Another controller to play locally might be wanted too which is another 60. One piece of advise based on something that happened to a family i knew: set up password controls for credit card stuff.

Next time you wanna try and battle wits, do your homework, milkdrinker.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Elder Scrolls. The knowledge is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics and/or canon most of the lore will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also The Scroll's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their characterisation - their personal philosophy draws heavily from the MacGuffin principle, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this lore, to realize that they're not just fluff pieces- they say something deep about LIFE (and death, too!). As a consequence people who doubt the power of The Elder Scrolls truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the importance of Urag gro-Shub's existencial catchphrase ""It's all true. Even the falsehoods. *Especially the falsehoods*."" which itself is a cryptic reference to dank ass lore being spat out like fire my n'wah. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as MK's genius unfolds itself on their ocular lenses.

I think you assume that if people have a decent bloodline then they must have good character.

this is false.
also the implication that these people with absolute european heritage will be welcomed back like old friends or long lost family memebers is also false.
they would get the same treatment as any other immigrant that is just another competitor in the job market, relationship market, and housing/amenities market.

people hate immigrants mainly becuase they occupy a space and opportunity that could've been some other persons

the fact that people hate these muslim immigrants becuase they are violent, uneducated etc... is really a tactic by the racist powers and establishments doing a self-fullfilling prophecy thing for them.

Their finest stonework (beautiful, unnecessarily laboriously shaped mortars) came well before they became fully dependant on agriculture.

I find Psychology errs by emphasizing the individual and his problems, without thinking about how an individual fits into a larger social network. Now my bro is connecting his thoughts in a normal fashion and people are loving being around him. An individual is nothing if he's not part of a group, and I think more groups -- not neo-nazis, of course -- could do more to accommodate people on the spectrum.

"Naruto","t5_2quts","So we're just gonna act like Naruto WASN'T a GENIN for like 600 episodes/700 chapters???

Honestly, I'm sure Naruto could've defeated Kaguya by himself but Kishimoto didn't want Naruto to kill anyone. I don't remember Naruto killing ANYONE. In fact, Boruto the movie proves that Kaguya could be killed. Momoshiki was stronger than Kaguya.

Konohamaru was trained by Naruto (apparently offscreen) are you implying that they couldn't just say, ""along with the rasengan, toad summoning, and more than likely shadow clone jutsu, Naruto taught Konohamaru about diplomacy""?

Also, ""Just a Jounin"" makes no sense as a statement. It's not like Konohamaru will somehow be declared a 4th sannin or something. He literally has nowhere else to go in rank (ANBU isn't a rank). I don't see why Naruto could become hokage through study AS A GENIN. Yet somehow, Konohamaru (someone who already has knowledge about the hokage position and what it intels) just isn't ready. He wants to become hokage, why wouldn't he get himself ready for it?

As for Sasuke, what information do you have that says Sasuke isn't good at organizing the village life and ninja system? Dude is a ninja so he could easily handle the ninja system. Considering Naruto would be dead in this scenerio, I'm sure Sasuke would just follow Naruto's example in terms of how village life should be. Long story short, as for Sasuke being Hokage, things would just be business as usual accept there would be a far more active Hokage. Based on how highly Sasuke is favored in the village (according to the Boruto manga) he'd be voted for BEFORE Kakashi or Konohamaru. 

After Naruto's death, strength will be the leaf villages main priority just to make sure that no one tries anything. Sasuke would make the most sense only because of the fear that he, being Hokage would bring into anyone with ill intentions. Kakashi could easily be Sasuke's right hand being his mentor and all.",1506816403

2) Basically don't have relations with someone who is a child or committed, whether married, engaged, celibate, etc. In general, relations between two free consenting adults who are not in a relationship are ok, and use your judgement beyond that.

3) Talk to your preceptor about the actual precept as it's given. This one is probably the most contentious, but at the very least, try to avoid becoming heedless, also known as [pramada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pram%C4%81da).

I did say that. but that's not what you claimed I said earlier. In the world of the English language, ""sensitive"" and ""oversensitive"" are two distinctly different words. I'm sorry you can't see the difference.

It might appear that way to someone who is looking for things that aren't there, yes. Or perhaps to someone who has text comprehension problems.

"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","&gt;PEOPLE FORCIBLY BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY AS SLAVES

The people who were forcibly brought here as slaves are dead. Their children are dead. Their children's children are dead. Odds are, most black people in America aren't related at all to people who were enslaved in America two hundred years ago. And even if they are, what does it matter? Slavery was two centuries ago, it has nothing to do with the position they're in now. Blaming slavery for your present condition is just you trying to blame someone else for your own failures.

&gt;should have the power inequality fixed.

Alright. Boom. The power inequality in America is fixed and has been for a century.

&gt;Shits not equal yet

Yeah it is. In America, if you're in the bottom 1%, no matter what your color is, you *can* reach the top 1%. Is it going to be easy? No. Is it possible? Fuck yeah it is.

Is there equality of outcome? Fuck no, and there never should be equality of outcome anywhere. But you know what America *does* have? Equality of *opportunity*. No matter who you are, no matter where you're born, you can do *anything the fuck you want* in America. 

The problem isn't that the system is rigged against you. It's not, and pretending it is is just paranoia, and blaming someone else for your own failings as a person. The system is *not* rigged. There is *no* systemic discrimination in the western world. That doesn't mean that people won't be racist or sexist - they always will be - but the system doesn't acknowledge color or sex or anything else. We've fixed the system a long time ago. Anyone who wants to pretend we haven't is just looking to blame someone else for the fact that they can't accomplish anything in life.

You're not rich? That's your own problem, go work. You're not educated? That's your own problem, go to a library.

Bottom line is: it's easy to blame the system for your life being bad. It's a lot harder to realize that you've made bad decisions, and as a result your life ended up in a bad place.",1506816408

Potentially you could drop the police budget (and/or invest in heavier anti-corruption measures if that's an issue) and use that budget on outreach programs; education, counselling, domestic violence etc. In the hopes that A.) You get people already addicted to quit. B.) You stop people using in the first place. 

Policing is most often a reactionary measure (especially nowadays which is what the scene was about), whilst it's definitely necessary you're likely going to achieve better outcomes by stopping issues before they happen.

You need to connect people to where they live and incentivise them wanting to clean it up. 

The war on drugs will never be won by 'eliminating drugs' because that will never happen it's won by getting people to not feel isolated and to give them a sense of purpose, community and opportunity. A heavy police presence doesn't really achieve that goal and if the police are seen as being violent, reactionary and scary it has the opposite effect.",1506816410

I have been following the Natalee Holloway case since she went missing. Dave and Beth have been to hell and back. Appearances can be deceiving.  Dave received a phone call before the series even was in motion. The call was from an undercover agent, who had befriended a friend of Joran's who was involved in disposing of Natalee's body. This guy is a total freak job, and he told the informant so many lies until it led to the recovery of some bone fragments the friend of Joran's kept as a trophy. These are the bones being tested, and it appears they very well may be Natalee's. The story of how Natalee was killed and then her corpse desecrated is beyond anything most humans can imagine.  Dave never even conceived of the series until he and his detective had to make the decision to actually pursue the lead the informant had given them.  After they decided to investigate in Aruba, it is then that the series began.  I do not think Dave will be able to withstand the pain when the DNA comes back positive, and I think it is going to be positive.",1506816410

"liberalgunowners","t5_2vjre","&gt;I thought the topic at hand was the effectiveness, benefits, and harm from banning other objects like alcohol or drugs as a larger framework for the human spirit to get access to what they want?

The original topic was whether a ban on guns could be effective.  Effective in the sense that it reduced the availability of guns.  

&gt;Personally I don't think we will benefit from a gun ban or tighter restrictions. I think the most effective way to reduce gun violence and death is to legalize and tax drugs (it doesn't increase usage, typically reduces it actually), increase mental healthcare coverage and therapy options, lead a meaningful economic recovery effort that focuses on increasing the minimum wage dramatically and though helping small businesses through simplification of the tax code (even if it raises taxes), and teach kids the basics of gun safety better than we teach sex ed.

I don't think a gun ban is the right move, even if it were politically feasible.  However, I have not heard a sound refutation to the idea that increasing the difficulty of getting guns would result in less people having guns, and less people using them, either accidentally, due to an escalated fight, or with an unpremeditated crime of passion.  A lot of gun related injuries (maybe most, but I'm too lazy to look up the stats) are not caused by the hardened criminal who has the means, motive and will to surpass any gun control law.  I would certainly support some added restrictions, such as universal background checks, if not a requirement to attend a safety class before use, just like we do with hunting.   The ideas you have listed are great, I may not agree with the gun safety teaching being greater than sex ed, but that's splitting hairs.

"marvelstudios","t5_2uii8","I'm sorry, but this is the single most entitled thing I've seen on this sub.

Inhumans, Defenders, and Iron Fist were all disappointing, sure. But look at the bigger picture: they all had tight deadlines, and Marvel TV definitely screwed up by waiting til the last minute to even start production, but if they were to delay them, the fans would have freaked out and the expectations would have been raised exponentially.

Inhumans was kind of destined to fail. They announced it as a movie, so people were expecting movie quality production standards. They announced it as being filmed in IMAX. Now everyone expects epic cinematography and high caliber camera work.

Do we have a right to be mad, upset, disappointed, whatever else? Of course. To say that it's ""unacceptable, and doesn't deserve love/recognition"" is just entitled, childish, and absurd.

Inhumans does deserve recognition for its successes. The efforts of the cast at bringing these characters to life (especially Black Bolt and Medusa, those two went the extra mile) is commendable.

I would have loved to see Inhumans as a film as much as the rest of us. The way movie-TV crossover is working out, we may not get a (mostly) faithful Illuminati in the MCU, and that really does sting. But to freak out this much over a couple of bad productions is just making all of us look like we can't take a flop. 

If you really don't like it or want to give it a second chance down the line, that's perfectly acceptable. You're your own person, you can make your own decisions. But to tell the rest of us to completely avoid it like it's some untouchable atrocity, that's just absurd. I actually enjoyed watching Inhumans, as well as Iron Fist. I'm just happy we're getting these characters in the MCU at all. 

So let's all relax, and wait. Inhumans could turn out like Agents of SHIELD did. To completely write it off after the premiere is a bit much.

TL;DR - Yeah, it wasn't what any of us really wanted, but let's all just relax and wait it out. It could turn out like AoS and become a great show.",1506816415

If they play and lose then they will have to play more games and invest more unnecessary time to get back because the system thinks they dont deserve to climb and therefore they gain little to no lp

RFA

Re-education camps in two counties in northwest China‚Äôs Xinjiang region, where mostly Muslim ethnic Uyghurs have protested Beijing‚Äôs rule, house thousands of ‚Äúpolitically incorrect‚Äù inmates who are rarely freed despite undergoing months of ‚Äútraining,‚Äù according to sources.

The camps in Ghulja (in Chinese, Yining) county, in Ili Kazakh (Yili Hasake) Autonomous Prefecture, and Korla (Kuerle) city, in neighboring Bayin‚Äôgholin Mongol (Bayinguoleng Menggu) Autonomous Prefecture hold at least 3,600 inmates, local officials told RFA‚Äôs Uyghur Service, and are labeled ‚Äúcareer development centers‚Äù in a bid to mask their true nature, they said.

Minewer Ablet, a middle school teacher in Ghulja‚Äôs Turpanyuz township who was assigned to work as an assistant cadre and a Chinese instructor at Camp No. 4‚Äîone of the county‚Äôs five re-education camps‚Äîsaid it was unclear exactly how many people were detained in the county camp system.

‚ÄúI am responsible for teaching class No. 33, and I have seen on the teacher‚Äôs notice board that the last class number is 44,‚Äù she said of the county camps, where other courses include ‚Äúlaw, regulations, and career training.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are 30 to 50 students in each class, so I estimate the total number of people who are undertaking the re-education program [across the county] to be at least 1,500.‚Äù

Assistant cadre Tursun Qadir, who teaches at the same camp, told RFA that of the 45 people in his class, the majority are ‚Äúformer criminals or suspects,‚Äù including a number of Uyghurs who had served time in prison following an uprising against Chinese rule in Ghulja 20 years ago.

‚ÄúAmong them are a number of former prisoners who served 10-15 years in prison after being accused of involvement in the Feb. 5, 1997 Ghulja Incident,‚Äù Qadir said, referring to protests sparked by reports of the execution of 30 Uyghur independence activists that were violently suppressed by authorities, leaving nine dead, according to official media, though exile groups put the number at as many as 167.

‚ÄúThe most common reason that people are brought here is that they attended [or overheard] illegal [religious] teachings,‚Äù he said, adding that other detainees included ‚Äúmen who grew beards 10 years ago‚Äù and ‚Äúparents who sent their children to underground religious schools.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe oldest student is 66 years old and the youngest is 19. The group also includes a number of illiterate people.‚Äù

‚ÄòTraining center‚Äô

None of the four instructors RFA contacted at Camp No. 4 could recall the official name of the facility, but one, who spoke on condition of anonymity, agreed during a phone interview to walk out to the courtyard to read the name of the camp‚Äôs sign.

‚ÄúThe name of our camp is ‚ÄòThe Center for Developing Skills for a Professional Career,‚Äô‚Äù the instructor said, adding that the reason he hadn‚Äôt been able to remember the name was because it was ‚Äúchanged four times in the past eight months.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt first, it was called ‚ÄòThe Law and Regulation Training Center For Citizens‚Äô and then it was renamed ‚ÄòThe Career Training Center For The Unemployed‚Äô for a while, but now it is called ‚ÄòThe Center For Developing Skills For a Professional Career,‚Äô‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúObviously, the reason for changing the name is to avoid giving others a bad impression.‚Äù

According to the instructor, staff live inside the camp and share the same courtyard with detainees. The center‚Äôs main gate is guarded 24 hours a day and instructors are required to obtain permission if they need to leave the facility.

‚ÄúStudents are not allowed to leave the camp until they have completed the full program, but the length of the training is unclear‚Äîthe rules only say that the program is complete once a ‚Äòsatisfactory level has been achieved,‚Äô‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI have been teaching for the last six months, but there is no one in my class who has completed the course and no one knows when the training will end.‚Äù

Detainees

The same instructor passed his phone to a detainee who told RFA that he had been detained at Camp No. 4 after helping his brother send money to his son, who was studying in Turkey.

‚ÄúBecause my ‚Äòcrime‚Äô was not deemed serious, I was placed here, but my brother, Abdurshit, is in prison [facing charges for] sending his son abroad without governmental permission,‚Äù the detainee said.

‚ÄúI know this camp is called ‚ÄòThe Center For Developing Skills For a Professional Career,‚Äô but I was brought here in handcuffs with a black hood over my head. It was only after I passed through the security gate that the handcuffs and hood were removed.‚Äù

Another detainee named Osman Tursun, who spoke to RFA on a phone handed to him by an instructor, said he had been placed in the camp after he and several of his fellow residents from Yengitam village overheard religious teachings at a wedding ceremony in 2012.

‚ÄúFive years ago, I went to a wedding in my neighborhood where a man discussed teachings from the Quran, though I don't remember the exact information,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThere are 22 of us here from my village because we were at the same wedding and listened to the discussion. Apart from us, there are seven others from my village here who are former prisoners.‚Äù

Korla city

Sources in Bayin‚Äôgholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture‚Äôs Korla city, where Uyghurs have protested house-to-house raids on their homes during ‚Äústrike hard‚Äù anti-terrorism campaigns in recent years, told RFA that the municipality houses three re-education camps with at least 2,100 detainees, as well as a ‚ÄúSocialism Institute,‚Äù where more than 40 religious figures are being held.

Rehim Yasin, the Communist Party secretary of Korla‚Äôs Qara Yulghun village, said that 86 of his village‚Äôs 1,678 residents are currently being held in the city‚Äôs three re-education camps, which are known as ‚ÄúProfessional Career Improvement Centers.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey are all designed to re-educate people who are deemed politically incorrect,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúEach camp holds at least 700 people, so in the three re-education camps there are at least 2,100 people.‚Äù

Mutellep Esset, the party secretary for the Saybagh Street office in Korla, told RFA it was unclear how many people from his district had been detained at the city‚Äôs re-education centers, but said many of those held had overseas connections.

‚ÄúI learned through my work that among the detainees [from my district] are 13 people held for traveling abroad with a tourist company, one person who had been on a hajj [Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca] two years ago, and two people who studied in Turkey for a short time before returning home,‚Äù he said.

Vast network

Investigations by RFA suggest there is a vast network of re-education camps throughout the Xinjiang region.

Sources indicate that there are almost no majority ethnic Han Chinese held in the Xinjiang camps, and that the number of detainees in the region‚Äôs south‚Äîwhere the highest concentration of Uyghurs are based‚Äîfar surpasses that in the north.

Earlier this month, local officials in Xinjiang told RFA that thousands of Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities‚Äîincluding Kyrgyz and Kazakh‚Äîare being held in re-education camps without contact with their families under a policy designed to counter ""extremism"" in the region.

New York-based advocacy group Human Rights Watch has called on the Chinese government to free the thousands of Xinjiang people placed in re-education camps since April 2017 and close them down.

China‚Äôs ruling Communist Party blames some Uyghurs for a string of violent attacks and clashes in China in recent years, but critics say the government has exaggerated the threat from the ethnic group, and that repressive domestic policies are responsible for violence that has left hundreds dead since 2009.

China regularly conducts ‚Äústrike hard‚Äù campaigns in Xinjiang, including police raids on Uyghur households, restrictions on Islamic practices, and curbs on the culture and language of the Uyghur people, including videos and other material.

I feel like we'd be able to do that with this roster. 

Irving, Smart, Hayward, Morris, Horford, Brown, Tatum, Baynes, Yabu, Rozier, Theis, Larkin, Ojeleye. 

Of course it all hinges on how fast the young guys can learn. This would be easier if we had someone like Gerald Green on the roster.

It's common for films that are setting themselves up to be ""gritty"" or ""realistic"" about the Middle Ages to dress everyone in shades of mud to show that the production understands how poor people were and how expensive dyes were. Highly-detailed and realistic illustrations from Books of Hours (religious texts for lay readers, which sometimes included sections for calendars with full-page artwork showing what noble and peasant individuals would be doing during each month) do show laboring peasants in greys and browns, but also in blues, pinks, greens, yellows, and other colors. Madder (for reds, oranges, pinks, and browns), dyer's weld (for yellow), and woad (for blue) grew natively in England, although for dyeing on a commercial scale woad and madder were typically imported from the continent.

So I'm not saying, ""sure, just take all pictures you see at face value!"" But you may (*may*) be coming across images of clothing made by artisans who really know what they're doing - the SCA gets a bad rap, but some SCAdians do incredible jobs replicating period fabric and clothing, [e.g.](http://matsukazesewing.blogspot.com/) - and I'd hate to think they were being dismissed automatically because they don't conform to the pop cultural ideal of the medieval peasant outfit.

&gt;But what if I'm a peasant in 14th century England during the winter? What materials would I be wearing? Fur, leather, etc? A hat? A hood?

So, some of the best sources for this kind of thing are books of hours that hew to some degree of realism. One such is very early 15th century *Les Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry*, illuminated by the Limbourg Brothers, which has beautiful pages for each month, most of which show the activities of the peasantry as they work the land, even in the winter (apart from January). [November](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Les_Tr%C3%A8s_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_novembre.jpg) has pig-tending in the woods, [December](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Les_Tr%C3%A8s_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_d%C3%A9cembre.jpg) has hunting, [January](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Les_Tr%C3%A8s_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_Janvier.jpg) a great feast, [February](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Les_Tr%C3%A8s_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_f%C3%A9vrier.jpg) chopping wood, and [March](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Les_Tr%C3%A8s_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_mars.jpg) tilling the dry fields.

For your 14th century English peasant, the name of the game is wool. Wool was a major industry in England and the Low Countries, and while today we think of it as an inherently heavy, dense fabric, it could be made in a huge variety of weights - so it was worn through the year. It could still be made as a heavy, dense fabric, though, and in fact it was often fulled (slightly felted) to the extent that the raw edges didn't have to be protected to keep from unraveling the way that we treat hems and seams now. A peasant would wear wool of the lowest grades, made of the fleece from lower parts of the sheep; in the cheapest cases, the wool would be an unbleached/undyed grey like that of the winter-est peasants in the *Tr√®s Riches Heures* (another reason why mud-brown tunics are not authentic). This means a wool tunic/cote, wool supertunic/surcoat, and wool stockings. These stockings would be cut out of fabric, rather than knitted - although knitting was known at the time, stockings were typically cut out of cloth on the bias (diagonally across the weave) in order to have some stretch and sewn to fit close to the leg. A cloak or just a blanket wrapped around the body, made of a wool too dense to wear, could also be used for more protection.

A hood would definitely have been worn, as hoods were a very common accessory in the 14th century. There's a great image of the pattern shape of an ordinary hood in *Textiles and Clothing, 1150-1450*: straight front, loose-ish neck and cowl (which you'd certainly want to protect you against the winter winds), and long liripipe (the thin tube that hangs off the back of a stereotypical hood, [as seen on the woman in blue here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Les_Tr%C3%A8s_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_juillet.jpg)).

Fur was unlikely. Since it doesn't survive the way wool, linen, and silk do, we have much less information about it than we do textiles, and we're left with textual sources. These mainly discuss the expensive furs that would be used to line outer garments for the wealthy, like squirrel, sable, and ermine. Rabbit may have been the cheapest source of fur, and for use as a lining you'd have to a) get a lot of rabbits and b) put a lot of effort into sewing their skins together, which is part of why fur in general was expensive. I'm not going to rule it out because, like I said, I don't know as much about fur, but it seems unlikely. Lining boots and gloves, though, where a single skin would be enough for each, is more plausible.",1506816421

When Cena started putting on great matches a year or two ago, this whole sub suddenly loved Cena, where previously he was viewed much like Roman is viewed now. People here aren't going to hold a grudge because of one PPV event. It's been almost 3 or 4 years of Roman being pushed, and, in my opinion, almost every storyline that Roman is in is bad. Even when it starts out good, it eventually becomes bad because the overall goal is to make Roman look strong. This makes every Roman match become less interesting, since you know it's all just going in one direction. I also think Roman has put on some of the most boring main events in the last few years.

But the main point is, I haven't heard anyone legitimately complain about that Royal Rumble in a while, I highly doubt THAT is the reason why people still don't like him.",1506816421

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Don't pull that sarcastic argument out. The Irish at one point had a spine. They were willing to stick up for themselves and fight for their country. 

What I'm saying is that NOW they are complete and total pussies. It really started after the IRA and the Troubles ended. Now whether or not the IRA were a group that you support; the point is that Ireland became a country led and supported by spineless cowards just like the rest of Western Europe. 

I'm absolutely positive that there are people who would want their government to grow some balls but they aren't in charge and they don't enjoy popular support. 

I'm not supporting warmongering either, sometimes you have to take a hard line. Like for example when another country that is run by a manifestly corrupt government imprisons one of your citizens quite possibly on spurious charges. 

I didn't say that the Irish never fought anyone. I'm saying that today they are like any Western European  country where they think everything can be settled by an exceedingly polite conversation between reasonable people.

If you make it clear that no matter what you're unwilling to hardline the other side in negotiations and are absolutely never going to resort to force you make yourself look pathetic and weak. Not every country and it's leaders will be nice, polite, reasonable,  and share in your values. 

This is why the Russians can get away with brazenly bullying Eastern Europe. Putin knows he can do pretty much anything short of waging an overt war of conquest and the other major power bloc on the continent, Western Europe and the EU will only send a strongly worded letter and maybe some toothless sanctions.

Look at how Western Europe has been dealing with North Korea openly developing and threatening to use nuclear weapons on non-nuclear states. What does Europe do? Protest at the UN and slap some more sanctions on them. They've made it clear that they won't take harsher measures or use military force. They are weak and there are plenty of countries that will exploit that to the hilt. Like Russia and North Korea. ",1506816423

Personally I think this content should actually be allowed. The daily question threads are bad places to get good responses, this is the only way you will get actual answers. 

My personal opinion on your question though is to worry less about your deck and more on your own play. 

Think of hearthstone as a multiple choice exam. You have like 6-10 turns and on each turn you have like 2-4 viable options. Focus on getting that 100% above all else. Midrange Hunter is a good enough deck to get to rank 5 with only like an 85% on the exam. Legend will take close to a 100% though. 

I like this metaphor because on a lot of turns, you can demonstratably argue that one choice is objectively better than another by enumerating different board states after your turn after your opponents turn, factoring in odds of then having specific responses. 

Take time on your turns and aim for at least 90% every game before you focus on getting a new deck. As long as you have a t1, t2, or t3 deck that you are comfortable with, focus on improvement. ",1506816424

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master(3) and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.

In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.

The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.

Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other ‚Äî Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.

From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns. From these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed.

The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development.

The feudal system of industry, in which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds, now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its place. The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class; division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop.

Meantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even manufacturer no longer sufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production. The place of manufacture was taken by the giant, Modern Industry; the place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires, the leaders of the whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois.

Modern industry has established the world market, for which the discovery of America paved the way. This market has given an immense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication by land. This development has, in its turn, reacted on the extension of industry; and in proportion as industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages.

We see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development, of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange.

Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class. An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and self-governing association in the medieval commune(4): here independent urban republic (as in Italy and Germany); there taxable ‚Äúthird estate‚Äù of the monarchy (as in France); afterwards, in the period of manufacturing proper, serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, cornerstone of the great monarchies in general, the bourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market, conquered for itself, in the modern representative State, exclusive political sway. The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.

The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part.

The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his ‚Äúnatural superiors‚Äù, and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous ‚Äúcash payment‚Äù. It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom ‚Äî Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.

The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers.

The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.

The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages, which reactionaries so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence. It has been the first to show what man‚Äôs activity can bring about. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and crusades.

He never asked you *why* you decided to keep your name. He never asked how your husband feels about it. It's about Husband's family and their public perception.

You said that they are Mormon. The Mormon community puts incredible emphasis on how the public sees them. To their community, it looks like they either instilled bad values in DH since he is living in sin,or his wife is ashamed to join their family, despite the actual truth of you being proud of your family name. Does this info really make you feel better? No. But it frames it in their context.

The best answer I have is to address it with their family, and then bring up that maybe this is a discussion that everyone needs to have with the clergy present for more guidance. Maybe some of the other local church leadership should be brought in to discuss if their harassment and alienation of you is really in line with the teachings of the Church.

The risk of public shame, and involving the church hierarchy, tend to be the best methods of dealing with asshole Mormons from my experience. Nice Mormons tend to just be reasonable and not need such measures.",1506816428

Otherwise, I would also say you just stay out of this. I think you should drop him as a friend, because friends don't threat you to expose you secrets to people, no matter what. If you don't want to do this, ask him to keep such information for himself in the future so that you are not put in similar situation again. 

Furthermore, as weird as it sounds and many people would probably disagree, for me there are levels of cheating. 

It is one thing if he had a one night stand (as it looks like) with some stranger that he and his girlfriend would never meet again. It's another thing if he cheated with someone who they both know. And a third thing if he keeps a secret side relation with someone. 

I have experience with being good friends to both partners in a relationship and it didn't end up well for anyone and especially for me trying to be good friend and take care of both of them. Basically, the best thing you can do for your own sake is to explain them that you don't want to be involved in their relationship issues in any way and kindly ask them both to keep you out of it.

"writing","t5_2qh2n","I have a few books that may be helpful. 

First are these two ""How to..."" books. *How to Write Tales of Horror, Fantasy, &amp; Science Fiction* edited by J.N. Williamson. This one is full of essays from major writers in those respective genres. Ray Bradbury, Dean Koontz, Robert Bloch, and many other are in this book. I suggest it because the essays cover a variety of different topics. 

Next is *How to Write Horror Fiction* by William F. Nolan. This is a pretty standard writing guide that focuses on horror fiction. You can get it pretty cheap on Amazon, so I'd say give it a look. 

This last book is *Philosophy of Horror, or, Paradoxes of the Heart* by Noel Carroll. It's an academic book, but it isn't as dense as most books that come from academia. If you're not interested in the philosophical and metaphysical aspects of horror, I'd skip most of the book (it is terribly interesting, though). For you, the most important part I'd recommend would be a segment in chapter one titled ""Fantastic Biologies and the Structures of Horrific Imagery"" and then all of chapter three, ""Plotting Horror."" Chapter three is interesting because Carroll outlines a few different narrative types and structures that horror fiction tends to rely on. Carroll also has a published article similar to the segment I mentioned from chapter one under a title like ""The Symbolic Biology of Horrific Images"" or something like that. 

I hope these help.             ",1506816429

A good adventure _as-prepped_ / on paper-- should include as many opportunities for something to turn into a good _session_ as possible. 

I think these include:

More than one possible ending, based on player choices.

An idea that would be interesting/compelling/evocative even if it wasn't an RPG you were about to play.

Rabbit hole: Something the PCs can do/discover/get interested in that will completely change what the whole session is about and force you to improvise everything.

Tactically complicated set-piece fight: An area to fight in where something fucks with normal combat considerations--teleporter, random moving magma pit, etc.

Some completely weird element you're inordinately proud of. Note: like the girl whose whole body was full of tiny spiders who the driders use as a living trap and whose head explodes when you come near her, covering you in spiders.

A ""toy"": Some almost-as-fucked weird element which is designed specifically so the PCs can interact with it and therefore make the whole situation more weird in their own way if they choose to. Like a vial of water that makes a reflective puddle and that puddle is actually a portal to a mirror-universe full of exact duplicates of whoever's in this universe who want to kill their analogues a la a clone spell.

A new monster that hasn't been seen before.

Weird details to attach to every stock monster used. Manticores like poetry. Did you know that? They do. They will obey the best poet on the battlefield. On a 1 or a 2 they're ok with poetry that doesn't rhyme.

Outside-of-standard-game-rules 4th-wall breaking gimmick--i.e. a 3d visual aid that you can do something to or a concrete real-world puzzle to solve or cued-up sound effect or bizarre piece of terrain made from some obviously-not-made-as-DnD-terrain thing like a taxidermied animal.

"Maher","t5_38r3o","As a non American I found the discussion about American exceptionalism interesting.

Growing up in Australia we absorb a lot of American culture, so much so that we feel very close to America but there are still fundamental differences. 

American exceptionalism is a weird one, and yes I think he may be on to something that it has roots in religious fervour. 

In the 90s I remember there being very strong anti American sentiment and I think it had a lot to do with this idea of exceptionalism. It smacks the Australian sensibility as extreme arrogance and naivety. The Aussie version is that we are ""the lucky country"". We know we have it pretty great but not that it's some God given right because of manifest destiny, rather it's more ""crap, we lucked out guys!""

The issue is special snowflakes. Everyone's kid is a special snowflake.  
If Johnny is a scumbag and you want to make him wear a shirt that says ""I'm the scumbag"" and stand in a corner for 10 minutes, you'll have armies of ""children are beautiful"" drones down your back, and not just the parents either.  
Have you seen how much 60% of Reddit give or take is defensive of offenders?  
If you're a dog, a cat, a child or a gay/minority, you're immediately immune from being shitty.  
I was a bad kid. I'm 34. When I was a bad kid, people called me out on it. It was either my mom whispering in my ear, ""We're in a store and I can't do anything now but if you don't behave, when we get home I'm gonna fuck you up"" or kids laughing at me for being stupid, or a kid I bullied's older brother finding me after school and beating the shit out of me, but no matter what, when I acted up, I had some kind of feedback that led me to believe ""Hey not doing that thing is a good idea"".  
Now? If I were to be the same way growing up now, people would be like, ""Oh, it's because he has ADHD, it must be his diet! He's so wonderful, why are you yelling at him!?"" The kid I beat up, his older brother would be tried as an adult and sent to prison, my teacher would have been fired for harassment/bullying/child abuse, my mom would've been arrested and I would've went on to be a complete scumbag until I'm 18 and all of a sudden I'm an adult and all these REAL repercussions come in.

So there is this story about 3 explorers who were captured by the king of a pacific island. One explorer was from Paris, one explorer was from London, and one explorer was from New York. The Island king told them that they were all going to be killed, and that their skins would be used to make canoes. The king gave them a choice as to how they would die. 

The explorer from Paris chose to be killed by a guillotine, and they cut off his head. The explorer from London chose to be killed by a gun, and they shot him in the head. The explorer from New York chose to be killed by a fork. 

The island kind was confused. He didn't know what to do with the fork, so he gave it to the explorer from New York. The guy immediately starts stabbing himself all over with the fork. There is blood everywhere and it's a horrific scene. The dismayed Island king asks the explorer from New York what the hell he's doing, and the New Yorker replies -

Sure, they were big, but they're not around anymore to be the current biggest boy band. Personally, I never listened to boy bands prior to being introduced to k-pop. Boy bands, in the Western sense, only offer pop love songs which I generally hate. Many k-pop boy groups have a more varied sound. For instance BTS has its love songs (I need U), but they also have hip hop songs (Cypher pt4, Bulletproof) which is what I prefer. I think a K-pop boy group could potentially have a bigger fanbase than a typical Western boy band because they don't just offer up love songs. ",1506816436

Then the next day we drilled and the day after that we had class again and I'd say it's healed beautifully. 

However it's so small it took the guy 10-15 minutes to draw up the design and like 1 maybe 2 full songs played while he was working on me so I'd say I only spent like 6-10 minutes on the table max... I'm sure if you got a multiple hour piece with shading and everything you'd probably want to take at least a week or 2 off . 
Just for reference the longest a piece has taken to heal for me is 3 weeks but I think that's because the design wraps around my shin, ankle and top of my foot which is a very mobile area that gets a ton of use cause I walk a lot. 

There's a few factors to consider here.

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","A language is a tool. If you can get the job done with that tool, then mission accomplished. Kudos!
But of course there exist some tools better suited to some tasks...
And if nobody uses your tool, good luck finding help when you need it.

Speaking from my recent professional experience with the language though, I'm not sure why anyone who knows a more popular language would bother with it. I am a French speaker but I don't give a shit about developing in my native language since I master English. There are *so many more* resources in English... Why limit myself. 
Same with Pascal. The language itself is fine, its verbosity can be mitigated with a modern IDE, but I'm not sure why I should bother if given a choice.
And everything it fixes from C has been then done even better in C# or some other more recent language.

I think Pascal devs at this point are people who don't know any better (like my French only speaking colleagues). It doesn't make them any more stupid or inept. They can achieve everything than other languages can, just they'll have less choice in APIs and tools, less help, less... everything.
And the ones stuck with an ancient codebase and unable to move forward, again like my colleagues. Working in Delphi 7 in 2017...
Nobody deserves this shit, man. I did it a few months and I wanted to kill people. I've seen some shit in my career, but a project that ships to actual production sites that can't compile when taken from the subversion stack? That was a first.
And whoever developed RemObjects can go die in a fire with this piece of shit of a software.

InnoSetup is alright tough. Such a pleasure to use compared to the bloated piece of crap that's InstallShield. You need a MSc on InstallShield before you can do anything with that monster. I got InnoSetup jumping through hoops in an afternoon, in comparison.
But that had *nothing to do with dev language* and more to do with good devs.

"dataisbeautiful","t5_2tk95","I know that Greece (since it has so many Islands with people on them) has a lot of them that connect islands close to the mainland with power cables . It is really expensive to run , maintain and supply power stations on islands (especially smaller ones , because of the low profits and ESPECIALLY at winter times when it is hard to ship oil to those islands). A lot of big islands , like Create , are using wind and solar energy but they can't depend 100% on that (and they probably need to supply smaller islands around them with power). 
Edit 
My source is that I am Greek and I have heard stories of people who work/live on islands about all that.",1506816438

"Etizolam","t5_2zqb7","It's all good, chemistry is an extremely deep and broad field, so if you are in the beginning stages of learning, it's best to just keep your mouth shut and listen (with all due respect). For perspective, an average PhD will take you about 5-6 years if you get a bachelors' in chemistry and decide to go to graduate school. Most of your time in graduate school is spent working on projects that your boss (professor) thinks will result in patents or publications in scientific journals. They will tell you, ""I want you to make a molecule that does ____ and it also must have x,y,z properties."" As a PhD student you typically get paid about $30,000 a year, with full tuition and health insurance, because the government funds most academic research (NIH, NSF, etc). If you are serious about chemistry then you must talk to some professors who run research labs at your school and ask if you can do undergraduate research. Usually you won't get paid, but the purpose is to learn synthesis and characterization techniques and get a good letter of recommendation so you can join a good graduate school. If you're interested in medicinal chemistry you should skim the abstracts for [J Med Chem](http://pubs.acs.org/journal/jmcmar), [JOC](http://pubs.acs.org/journal/joceah), [OPRD](http://pubs.acs.org/journal/oprdfk), and a many other journals. A lot of the papers are free too if you search them on Google Scholar, although your college should give you free access to most major journals. Here's a [free full text](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4314394/) of a study that I published. It's more nanomedicine oriented, but if you check out the [supporting info](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4314394/bin/NIHMS647025-supplement-Supporting_Information.pdf) you can see how the chemicals are synthesized and characterized.",1506816440

"gay","t5_2qhef","Demand creates value no matter what commodity you use to test the theory. That demand can be artificial or scarcity can be managed regardless of supply. Any website you visit when researching investing into cryptocurrencies tells you to be aware of the sudden and extreme shifts in valuation that can occur. Many websites that give advice on investing in stocks give the same warning. Ditto forex and commodities markets. ALL INVESTMENT comes with risk. We hope to mitigate that by ensuring market and retail volume, increasing merchant adoption on an ongoing basis. Cryptocurrency such as GAY Money is backed by its market value at the time, and by the volume of the currency that is held, unspent, to provide network progression and security. What gives it that value? Presently, only what the market allows. With increased opportunity for usage, the more places you can spend it, the value goes up. We have two businesses (one in England, one in the Netherlands) already accepting GAY Money, and as we progress with our gaymoney.market website, we have received interest of two score more to participate. What gives the US dollar its value? Seriously. The U.S. dollar has value because the government levies $3 trillion in tax liabilities against its citizens annually and accepts only U.S. dollars in payment ‚Äî which only it issues. Legal tender laws are the only thing requiring someone to accept those green slips of paper as being worth their face value. Nothing stops the central issuer from flooding the market with more printed currency (its been almost 50 years since fiat was backed literally with precious metals) to cover its debts. Cryptocurrency has inflation controls built in to the protocols. We have a limit to the funds allowable to be withdrawn against the Foundation wallet, all of which will be fully transparent, with every step of those operations available online and publicly accessible. Theres nothing to stop GAY Money from becoming worthless within a few hours, but market propulsion creates new orders, and the economy continues. Theres also nothing to stop GAY Money from exploding in value by several factors over the course of a few hours, either.

We are hosting it on ESPN. It is worth noting this will be a free league year one as it is in it's infancy, but we're open to changing that rule the following season. We want GMs to be involved and help make the rules/vote on new ones. The league is H2H Points.

League Rules: -No Pun names, must be a current or former NHL team (Blackhawks, Blues, Devils, Canucks, Thrashers taken)

-H2H points

-Active in GroupMe chat

-Competitive

-League hosted on ESPN

From u/Aozz09 we have determined how we will prevent tanking (https://www.reddit.com/r/DynastyFF/comments/6lg84p/alternative_way_to_determine_rookie_draft_order/) Tanking will be prevented by at the end of the regular season we look back to see when each team was eliminated from the playoffs. We then tally up all of the points scored by the non-playoff teams from that point forward. The team that scores the most points from the point they were individually eliminated is awarded the 1st pick, 2nd goes to the 2nd most points, etc.",1506816443

But playing with a group of friends or making new friends, building bonds with them within the environment - that's the ticket. Of course a 3rd party voice chat program of your choice can help greatly. 

I've met some incredibly nice, helpful, and cool people who I play with just about every night. The game without them, meh. I could get burned out going it alone and relying on text chat that the game provides. Doing pve and especially pvp(for me) content with them makes it such a better experience every time I log on.

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","It's a bit strange how it relates to physical copyright. If you buy a book, you can do whatever the hell you want with it, as long as it doesn't involve copying. It includes selling it if you no longer want it, it includes derivatives, hell, there are even businesses based on customizing and decorating books. All they have to do is to buy the book itself from the original publisher, and that's it. After that, it's just an item, a piece of property.

However, as soon as it goes digital, you lost the ownership. You'll own a license instead, like you were permanently renting the piece of media. You cannot legally touch it, modify, resell, or share any of it, and this is a huge problem. If you have a book, you can just lend it to one of your friends without a problem. If you have a digitally purchased game, that's impossible. Actually, the more games you buy on Steam, the less they're worth, because only one of them can be played at once. (Not sure if this limitation exists on one machine or across multiple PCs, but family sharing does work this way, and account sharing is technically illegal.) They use these licenses to lock you into their platform, to force you to follow their business agenda (Windows Store for example), and they can revoke the license anytime if they feel like it.

At this point, it's time to raise the question, do you really own what you bought? Did you ever own it?",1506816445

"EuropePlaysParadox","t5_3ewoy","Malaya had a goal this session: regain the prestigious ''A'' position on the tier list. First up was the long planned partition of Ming, which I followed up with taking the South-East Asian tributary nations, now that their emperor could no longer protect them, thus we reformed our state into an empire, and raised our development to become firmly placed in the #2 GP spot that was obtained last time. 

After that the crisis of Madagascar took place. Betsimasaraka had been colonising perilously close to the Malayan heartlands, and this was already to be rectified this session, but instead Betsimasaraka pleaded for protection against the British. Knowing that Malaya would be bogged down in China, and that Madagascar was difficult to protect either way, Malaya declined. Then, shortly after the Ming wars, the expansionist British did indeed attack Betsimaraka, helping them was out of the question, and suddenly the threat arose of the British getting a foothold, quite close to the Indonesian heartlands. Thus war was declared, and originally only 2 provinces were demanded, those close to Malaya, Betsimasaraka refused. Then a realisation that whatever was left of Betsimasaraka would go to the British regardless, and that they would be able to colonize a base of operations near Malaya regardless made Malaya decided to take as much of Madagascar as possible. As Britain took the South, Malaya took the north. In many ways the two nations that occupy both sides of the island are alike, both are coastal based navy powers. Great powers of the world with strong trade income. We even have the exact same idea groups. Except Great Britain is obviously and evil imperialist and Malaya is only attempting to unify their territories in order to stave of external aggression and promote prosperity and stuff.

Some troops were left on Madagascar and a naval build-up began, significantly increasing both the force limit and heavies that Malaya could call upon. Then Malaya's loyal ally Japan informed Malaya that Great Britain was trying to make them dishonour their alliance, though of course this was unsuccessful. So Malaya mustered as much of their army as possible to the island, 30.000 troops were left in the Americas, and built some extra mercenaries as well. The British likewise brought their entire army to the south. and the entire Malayan navy docked in madagascar. 

Then the British hordes were upon them, the British foolishly attacked all at once, the Malayans stayed calm, collected and only added to the battle as much as was needed. It was close, but the battle was won, the British armies scattered, the Malayan armies  ran them down, defeating them again and again, with the British fleeing ever futher, until finally their entire army dissipated. All of Britain's finest were gone, and Malaya had won Madagascar. Meanwhile it turned out that Britain American colonies were far less loyal than Checkico is, and they were soon peaced out of the war. 

Unfortunately, the naval side of the war went far less great. Hindustan was ruled by an AI, and couldn't be coordinated to help, and although the combined Japanese-Malayan navy could hold the line, they eventually got slowly weathered down by the English navy, likely in large part due to the British ideas helping them. 
As such a stalemate was reached. Britain lacked the military to take the land, and would be unable to control the wargoal, Malaya would have trouble moving their troops around and could only siege down Madagscar and hold the wargoal, which would never give them the required 50% warscore to force a peace. Thus a white peace was signed, and the conflict was postponed to a later time, as there is no doubt on either side that this remains a strongly contested area, the British have a new 100k troops in South Africa, and have built up to their force limit, plus they're making even more heavies, and are making the ungodly amount of 340 ducats a month in income, Malaya on the other side has stronger support from their allies, as they fear that if one falls the British will not simply stop there, but will eventually turn on them all.

After that the Russians declared a war on Qing, despite earlier agreements not to take any further land. Malaya supported them to seek a white peace, largely due to the threat of British and/or Prussian intervention. Later though, Russia turned on Prussia, giving them precious few allies on the Northern front....

In short this was a session of war and threat for Malaya, but it seems that we made it out alright, being up to tech, filled out 4 idea groups, making significant income and with large armies and navies, plus they retained their #2 GP status. Still conflict looms for the next session, it will be interesting to see whether Malaya will manage to win this Madagscar stand-off, or whether Britain might overpower them still",1506816449

As for school and aviation stuff - it is a tough road.  You've chosen a challenge, for sure.  Good job, and I say keep persuing it.  Persistence is everything.  I had to retake classes, re-fly checkrides, study-study-study, miss holidays and family events, and I barely made it through flight school, but now I've been a pilot for 10 years.  

Lastly, there are many many roads into aviation careers, not all in the ""program"".  If school+aviation+whatever else is too much right now, it doesn't mean you're not ever going to get there.  It doesn't mean you're too stupid to fly!  It just means, heck, chemistry is hard, flying is hard, and you're doing it all at once.  

Talk to your instructors, talk to your teachers, talk to your academic advisors.  They may be able to help with your program, let you retake a class or two.  If absolutely nothing works and you still go home without completing, remember there are other ways to be a pilot.  Finish school first, then reapply to an aviation program.  Or, if you're not opposed to service, the military has some great opportunities, check out the US Army's programs for warrant officer pilots.

"wownoob","t5_35idp","&gt; I believe that I have reached a point the only way to improve my gear is Heroic Raiding (with weekly chests as well) right?

Heroic ToS gives 915-925 gear, so while you might get some warforges and an upgrade here and there, it won't be very often either. That said, no reason to not run it, and at 930 it shouldn't be too difficult to find a pug or guild.

Mythic ToS provides 930-940 but the chances that you will find a guild recruiting people with no experience for Mythic ToS *now* with Antorus looming is extremely slim.

&gt;Do I really have to switch to DPS in order to start Heroic Raiding?

No. Heroic raids require two tanks just like Normal raids do. Not sure what makes  you think otherwise.

That said, it *is* fairly hard to find a raid group as a tank, because they are so little in demand. You might find it *easier* to get groups as DPS, but it by no means is *required*.

&gt;If I do need to switch should I go boomy or feral?

Totally personal preference. Ranged DPS is *in general* more in demand but overall it isn't that big of a deal.

&gt;Whats the fastest way to get good at dps switching from tank?

Same way you got good at tanking: practice. There's no secret trick to suddenly being great at DPS; it's just all about practice.",1506816450

As for hate, it's good for some men to be angry. The mental models that would help them achieve sexual success are obscured by persistent and pervasive propaganda. Love as depicted in popular media is a lie.

You know, it was just so *soooo* upsetting that he has an average penis because, as everyone knows, a hot man really *ought* to have a penis which is way lengthier and girthier than anyone else's and it's a slap to the face when he *merely* has an average penis.

I do have plans to monetize it (mainly focussed around in-app purchases of additional features). I'm not kidding myself that it will make a lot of money, though.

The apps I've built are my portfolio, and in that regard they are valuable to me as I can bring them into conversations and interviews for contract work.

It's hurtful that you family seemingly rejected you in life, and that even after they died you don't get the recognised that you want fromt them. But there are ways for the child that were close to their parent and responsible for their care to ensure the majority of the inheritance without it being illegal. You seem to be focusing so much on how it's so clearly unfair that it has to be illegal that you forget that it's actually mostly about how you feel unfairly done treated your family. That's a hurt that's valid and should be adressed. But it's not a hurt that the law cares about. If you focus to much on getting recognision by the law that you've been hurt you might get distracted from actually dealing with your hurt.

It's honestly not uncommon that people focus on a ""official"" recognision of their feelings or a seemingly logical adress of their hurt.

"Falcom","t5_32vt5","I wouldn't say so... Actually the world building aspect and complex politics are Cold Steel's strongest point, while Trails in the Sky games have arguably better characters and drama.

The entire cast of Cold Steel actually serves as a vehicle to convey Erebonia's culture, the region's different ideologies and paradigms as well as reflecting the different viewpoints on the struggle between nobles and commoners, which is actually portrayed much more diverse than in any other JRPG i've ever played.

I did an entire analysis on this subject at gamefaqs.

With Sen 1 Falcom went all out on world building, especially the social and political elements and with this game they really tied that world building to their cast of characters.

There's just such an overwhelming amount of political figures, companies, factions and institutions in the Erebonian arc that i can get quite overwhelming. While Liberl is quite the homogeneous and united country, Erebonia is much more diverse anything but united. Also next to high amounts of national politics (i loved to read every issue of the Imperial Chronical even if it could get quite ""dry""), there's just much more foreign affairs in Sen 1 and 2 (Calvard, Crossbell) and how those tie into the balance of power in Erebonia. It also helps that Osborne is one of the more complex political leaders of the franchise.

But what made this game stand out so much in terms of world building even compared to Sora no Kiseki is how everything tied to its central theme:

It's basically all about how upbringing and heritage form people and how everyone tries to overcome this inherited path. This is true to EVERY character of the main cast. We even visit their homes and see directly how they became the people they are through their families, their culture or their inherited social rank/class.

Let me take Laura for instance, since i had a long discussion on gamefaqs recently how she in fact is a very well written character: Remember how she acts when a conflict between her sense of duty and the ideals and goals of others arises. In the first chapter she has a very interesting scene with Rean in Celdic, where she is shocked how less he values or rather respects his Eight Leaves One Blade School of sword fighting. She doesn't back down, which gives her a somewhat imposing first impression. This sense of duty or rather chivalry is very specific to her upbringing in Legram. From her childhood on she was raised to uphold these ideals, especially as a descendant of St. Lianne Sandlot. If she was raised, lets say in Heimdallr or Celdic, she would be completely different. Why do i mention this? Because Falcom put a huge deal of effort into the theme of how upbringing and heritage form people. Throughout these two games we see alot of facets of her ideals and cultural paradigms, especially in her bonding events. She learns to accept other values, her accepting her feminin side may come off as humorous, but in that regard it was really important character developement. That's why her conflict with Fie was extremely well handeled. Fie as a former Jaeger is in total opposition to her ideals and how she grew up. But eventually she accepts her, she learns to compromise to get along with her.

These characters aren't just mirrors of Erebonian society, but we see their inner conflicts and struggles with the expectations, their own upbringing and heritage put on them. Jusis being a ""bastard"" son, Machias being connected to the reformist faction and his hatered against the nobles and aristocrats for their unchanging traditions, Emma fighting her guilt over remaining secretive to Class VII in regards to her duty as a witch of the Hexen Clan, Alisa and her fear of alienation of others (and family) through her potentially inheriting the Reinford group, Eliliot and his path as a musician against the will of his father... Even Millium plays a role in that sociological and psychological study as being bound by her mission as an Ironblood... And not to forget Sara and her past as a Jaeger which still binds her. Hell, even the NPCs deal with that theme... Interesting enough Gaius is a totally different case in that regard. Not only serves his nomadic cultural heritage as a direct antithesis, but in the same way he serves as a mirror for the characters and their ideals and world views (remember the scene where he is shocked how much Erebonians value their class system and how he directly asks Rean about it?).

And then we have Rean. He is struggling with the exactly same problems, but he actually tried to cut off the chains of his heritage (even though he is adopted... or rather because of that), by coming to Thors of his own will unlike the other members of Class 7, that were send there by their families. Him being adopted makes him restless, he simply cant ""grow roots"", remember his scene with Elise at Thors where we learn that him enlisting at Thors was actually a way of escaping from the expectations or rather ""lables"" that are being put on him as a member of his adoptive family? Hell he couldn't even master his swordsmanship, he describes himself as ""a dropout who's never been able to progress past beginner level"".

While Rean simply can't grow roots, the others don't know how to overcome them. Even though both standpoints seem to be the exact opposites, they are actually two sides of the same coin.

The ultimate goal for both sides is to find their own paths outside the expectations of society and heritage but at the same time accepting these as parts of themselves.

Trails of Cold Steel doesn't just want to be another Legend of Heroes trilogy, but it aimed for a much bigger goal in telling its story as a sociological study of Erebonia and its various contradictions and it totally nailed it if you ask me (Sen 1 more so than Sen 2 sadly). This kind of storytelling is not everyones cup of tea and some may prefer the traditional storytelling of Sora no Kiseki and i also love the Sora games as much, but i personally found this approach in Sen no Kiseki absolutely fascinating unlike anything else i've played in a long time.",1506816458

Establishing a relationship is understandably tough, but will go a long way.

I do agree with you on Yeti.  That is a pretty big step up in difficulty from last week for a U++.  Since most people only have 2 Stop resistance accessories, don't forget that you can also bring your own Stop spell on a character with extremely low MND to overwrite Umaro's Stop.  Edea or Kefka are great for this!  It will have a muuuuch shorter duration than Umaro's!

The Goddess is really spot on.  Multiple stacking breaks made her hits tickle.  The only thing to worry about it Sleep.  Bringing Affliction Break just makes it even easier.  If you have Astra it will act as a third line of defense and you shouldn't have any issue with this boss as long as you can output enough damage.

We know different cultural backgrounds breed different stereotypical behaviors, but to say it's ""black people"" who act this way is what makes it totally unfair. ",1506816462

More than it is already? Farming Massilia in Septem is already preferable to the current NA dailies if you're just farming void dust according to the [drop spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_SlTjrVRTgHgfS7sRqx4CeJMqlz687HdSlYqiW-JvQA/htmlview?sle=true#). 

Unless you mean as a nice bonus then sure but there's probably an argument to be made in farming them separately to still be more optimal. For example, say you needed 1 zerker monument and 6 dust, this would take you ~369 ap. As opposed to 71 ap (zerker class daily using JP rates) + 275 ap (6 * 45.8 ap, NA drop rate for Septem) = 346 ap. This would still make it more optimal to farm them separately. ",1506816468

Best money spent is without a doubt the Welcome Bundle.  Following that, assuming you can get 1 meta deck right now, it will probably be the pre-order of the new xpac in ~December.

Following that, you want to look at set rotations for the future.  Best value set is Classic, as unless they change something, any cards you get are permanently in Standard.  After that comes sets released this year (Un'Goro and Frozen Throne) and following that comes sets released in 2016 (Old Gods, Karazhan, Gadgetzan).  Note that the 2016 sets will rotate out in ~March next year, and really that is when you will see your biggest boost in competitive playing.  Between now and then, I'd be hesitant at crafting any cards in 2016 sets, yet you'll be stuck playing against said cards.

Depression often seems to strike for no reason. People with outwardly 'good' lives struggle to comprehend why they feel hollow and empty inside. You've got reason enough for all of us put together.

I can't even begin to imagine what you're are going through. I've lost family to cancer, and that in itself is a horrific ordeal, but to have also lost a young child is beyond compare. I'm truly sorry. No parent should have to bury their child; it's not surprising you can't recognise yourself, it must have torn you apart.

I can only imagine that in much the same way as when the body is badly injured and the system is then flooded with chemicals to anaesthetise the pain and stop it from being overwhelmed and shutting down, something similar is occurring emotionally for you, to try and cope with such a tremendous shock. No doubt it will be processing for a very long time.

They say time is the great healer, but of course, even if it heals, it does not change. I hope that in time, things can get somewhat better for you, and that this living hell that you must be experiencing will eventually abate a little.

I'm not sure you *should* try - or at least *feel* like you should try - to break out of this apathy - if that is what you need to cope with everything you're going through, if that numbness is there as a protective measure to ward off the excruciating pain, then who is to say that it's wrong? That absence of feeling might be the only thing that's stopping you from ripping your heart out, such is the magnitude of your loss.

I know these words, like everything else, will seem utterly meaningless, but I hope that in time you can find some peace",1506816470

A person just today told me they just left a house when they found some ODing there. 

One of my closest friends (who has since passed away) was clean the whole time I knew her. But she told me stories of all kinds of horrible things she did when she was using. The disease can lead people to be under the influence during a crisis and react in a way totally out of character for them. She was a wonderful loving woman who would give you everything she had. But once when she was using, she left someone for dead. Luckily, someone else came along. But she shared that story to show me how out of character someone can act while in the throws of active addiction. 

I hope that all the missing women are found alive, and are safe and able to heal from anything tgat may have happened: kidnapper, drug abuse, or any other possible situation. I'm sure we can all agree on that!

The 698 (gold) is smooth as well, both the 3008 and 698 are ""Fine"" yet the 698 is finer. Then again it just might be because it's not a very wet writer. The piston mechanism is better on this pen. 
The green 3003 is the least favorite of the three. It's a bit scratchy and quite dry. I'll definitely check with a loupe, when it arrives.

Overall I paid ~ $24 USD shipped. (I needed all to come in one package so I didn't check for different sellers with cheaper prices)
The items were well packaged and arrived in ~9 days. I am satisfied, planning to purchase a 4 pack of the 3008 for $14 :D

Sure, he's binary, he's a bad champion and is overflowed with counterplay, but what's important for me is, that he still feels like Fizz.  
All the major reworks removed the feeling of the champion completely, because they changed the gameplay of the champion entirely. Almost all of them could just have been new champions instead, because that's what they are, just that they removed the old champions in the meantime.  
Permanently reworking champions just for the sake of reworking champions is annoying. And as a Fizz main, the day that Fizz will get a major rework, I might quit the game for good.  

edit: I'm not just completely against change. I understand minor reworks, alone for balancing aspects. It's just that I'm not okey with deleting old champions to make a new one with a similar concept.

"conspiracyundone","t5_3neie","I have been thinking about doing a flat-earth post, but I need to figure out how to do it in a way that doesn't alienate some of the FE advocates whom I like and respect.

What I would like the post to be about is how FE is a focused study on epistemology.  How do we know what we think we know? FE forces you to look at that question.  I.e., do I believe the earth is spherical only because I have been told that by authorities of one sort or another, or have I done some of the calculations myself (or have they been done by people I trust)?  

In point of fact, I do accept that the earth is spherical.  This is based on an understanding of the mathematics, but I haven't conducted any elaborate geo-surveys myself.  It is also based on the travel times to various locales on different continents, experienced by either myself or by people I trust (collective distance measures do provide evidence for topology).  

On the other hand, if you look at something like the moon landing, all of the presumed evidence *for* a moon landing comes from government sources, especially NASA, which is especially untrustworthy.  This is a very narrow stream of data controlled by relatively few people, all of whom have suspect agendas.  Consequently, I view it as much more reasonable to doubt that humans ever landed on the moon.

This isn't to argue for or against FE, or for or against a moon landing.  This is about examining our sources of data, where they come from, and how they are put together.",1506816482

If we do harm or bring dysfunction the Universe will bring order upon ourselves. When we take away another's freedom of choice, we take away our own freedom of choice.

I feel personally that God is logically incoherent but I am unable to argue the truth of it. I am not well versed in philosophical schools of learning and debate. Take Will aim Craig for example, watching his debates I feel that he uses a lot of presumption and some fallicy in his ""it logically follows that..."" arguments, but I could not debate him and hope to prevail because of my lack of education in both fallicy and philosophical communication.

That being said, it just doesn‚Äôt replace traditional gaming for me, and unfortunately graphical fidelity plays a part in that.

My advice would probably be to wait for the next generation of PSVR when it will be even better, and hope that these experiences will still be available to play on the new hardware.

"DivinityOriginalSin","t5_2x1t5","In the late game you're not worried about getting hit so much. That is rarely going to happen with the amount of resets you have: invis, play dead, uncanny evasion, tactical retreat, cloak and dagger, and skin graft to just straight up never be touched again.

With play dead you can do things like Play dead and immediately spam attack for a turn reset and a free attack.

The reason your Fane is getting hit by heals is I assume he doesn't go first and if he does, he doesn't go invis when his turn is over or immediately find a way to not get hit because that's not how full party games should go.

There are enemies on tactician that explode Deathfog when they die. Being undead solves this problem as well. If I were going to play Elf I would be playing a ranged character for sure. Flesh Sacrifice is a great ability.

Undead also allows you to use mask to transform into other races for their racials. So, I can use elf loremaster +1 to identify items and what not.",1506816487

Tips: 

Most of this you should be able to get from walking into a GOOD vape shop (as in not one that just wants to make the most $ fast by selling you something you don't need and are instead more concerned with you quitting you smoking). I used to work in a good one so...

Depending on how much you smoke at the moment, you might need a high nic strength. The most common strength to start out at now would probably be a 6 but they do get higher. The next thing is getting a juice that's flavored to mimic your favorite cigarette. Ejuice comes in all flavors imaginable but includes those that replicate your favorite brand of cigarette which makes it easier to switch to. 

Next thing would be a strong enough device. I'm not sure what the current starter kits are like but they're WAY advanced now compared to the junk I started with so a good vape store should be able to recommend something that isn't expensive but still functions well and is easy to maintain. 

Lastly, if you feel the urge to smoke an actual cigarette - vape ten times first and then smoke. There will come day where that puff of your actual cigarette will taste disgusting and it gets much, much easier to quit from the point on.",1506816487

That's the sort of archaic religious thinking that introduced eternal damnation which didn't help anybody.  Now we have secular morality that uses reason and rationality to determine these things.  If they can be reformed, they don't need to be punished because 1. They are not going to commit the same crimes and 2. I don't think you're right that they know the difference.  If people do bad things they usually don't consider it bad, they see it as either good or necessary.  Punishment isn't going to change how they view it; rehabilitation will.

Ultimately it comes down to what your goal is.  If we're working towards a goal of a society virtually without crime in a world where rehabilitation is possible, then why punish criminals just to inflict unnecessary pain; seems pretty unethical.  Even if rehabilitation isn't possible, then why do we still need punishment? All we really need for them is to be isolated from society.  It just doesn't appear to be rational to punish them in some other way.",1506816494

&gt; Shinedown is a Hard Rock band that originated in Jacksonville, Florida. Shinedown was formed in early 2002 by Brent Smith, Jasin Todd, Brad Stewart, and Barry Kerch. They were signed by Atlantic Records.

&gt; On July 13, 2003, the band released their debut album Leave A Whisper. The album sold the popular singles ""Fly From The Inside"" and ""45"". Leave A Whisper was re-released on June 15, 2004, to capitalize on the strength of a new single: A cover of Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Simple Man"". This song is often dedicated to their friend Dimebag Darrell who died in 2004. The re-release also featured an acoustic version of ""45"", and a new mix of ""Burning Bright"", which was to be the fourth single from the album. During 2004, the band notably opened for Van Halen. On September 21, 2005, Leave A Whisper was certified as gold. On August 23, 2005, the band released a live DVD called Live From The Inside that contained a full-length Shinedown concert held at the House Of Blues in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

&gt; On October 4, 2005, the band released their second album called Us And Them, backed by the single ""Save Me"". Save Me maintained a #1 position on active rock charts for twelve weeks. The song became the theme song for WWE No Mercy 2005. The follow-up single, ""I Dare You"", also did respectably, and became one of the theme songs of WWE's WrestleMania 22 and was also performed on American Idol by Chris Daughtry. There are currently three versions of Us And Them: the regular thirteen-track version, a limited edition with three bonus acoustic tracks, and a store-specific edition with two bonus tracks: ""Break"" and ""Carried Away"". In 2006, the band co-headlined the SnoCore Tour with Seether, Flyleaf, and Halestorm, which was followed by the Equinox Tour in which Shinedown co-headlined with Trapt. Shinedown played their first overseas concert at the London Astoria on June 6, 2006, supporting Alter Bridge. In the late summer of 2006, the band opened for Godsmack and Rob Zombie on their North American Tour.

&gt; On December 12, 2006, Shinedown played in Knoxville, Tennessee at The Tennessee Theatre which was filmed for an upcoming DVD the band was expected to be releasing later this year (2007). However, after a recent show, Waukesha, WI, July 21, 2007, the band made it known that the DVD was scrapped by Atlantic Records.

&gt; The band began recording their new album in Los Angeles on September 20, 2007. Their first single, Devour, was released on May 20, 2008, and has proven a successful single, with it charting in the Top 10. The video for the song was released on June 25, 2008. On June 17, 2008, the album in it's entirety was put up on their MySpace page for listening. Shinedown's third album, The Sound of Madness, was released on June 24, 2008. The band is currently playing various festivals across North America before embarking on a tour in support of the new album.

&gt; Regarding the upcoming album, lead singer Brent Smith was quoted in an interview with Billboard.com as saying; ""It's time to just go over the top, literally go above and beyond what a human being thinks they're capable of recording. We want to do a huge hard rock record that has a lot of crossover potential, but also some of the most insanely intense and heavy material that this band has ever tried - and see if we can pull it off."" Smith noted that the group had more than forty songs to consider after writing sessions in Atlanta, Nashville and Los Angeles, but this was narrowed down to eleven songs for the standard album, and 14 songs for the deluxe edition.

&gt; In 2007 and 2008, Shinedown had some lineup changes with Brad Stewart and Jasin Todd leaving the band and Zach Myers*, Nick Perry, and Eric Bass joining the band.

&gt; *Zach Myers was touring guitarist from 2005-2007 and performed as bass guitarist during the recording of The Sound of Madness.

&gt; Shinedown performed free concerts at numerous state fairs across the US between June and September of 2009.

&gt; According to the Bully Songfacts, the lead single from Shinedown's fourth studio album,  Amaryllis, is titled ""Bully."" It is the first new music to be heard from the Florida-based hard rockers since all six singles from The Sound Of Madness topped the rock radio chart. The song was released on January 3, 2012.

The only problem is that if you go through a portal, the only way to get your ship to the other side of the portal is to lose your current base. Running into someone out there in space is HIGHLY unlikely (I can't emphasize that enough) unless you're actively searching for people using their coordinates and portal systems. There's like 18 quintillion planets spread across 257 galaxies, so each Galaxy has several quadrillions of planets. Portals are the easiest way to move huge distances at once, but you'll have to ditch your old base to bring your ship ""through the portal"" with you. Just keep that in mind",1506816502

"Impeach_Trump","t5_3hkeq","Because he has stated that the Puerto Rican ‚Äúworkers‚Äù haven‚Äôt been helping with the rescue (what workers haven‚Äôt been impacted by the storm, and unable to even get out of their area?) and that they expect everything to be done for them.  You can find these tweets easily. 

These are things he didn‚Äôt say about Houston or Florida, and are fairly suspicious ‚Äúdog -whistles‚Äù straight out of white supremacist dogma. You don‚Äôt have to add ‚Äúbrown people‚Äù to see his point. His intelligence is limited, so his ability to imply anything is always heavy-handed.  It‚Äôs disingenuous to obfuscate his personal history. 

Another burgeoning issue is our desensitization to his now overt insanity. This has progressed beyond narcissism, or even sociopathy. Think about this‚Äîif you personally knew a person who consistently verbally denigrated a group, and then *actively tried to cause them harm*, then consistently lied about it, what would you think of their behavior?  How far out of the boundaries of normalcy is that?  What if those actions caused deaths? Would that person be criminally responsible? 

We‚Äôre not far from that point now. People in Puerto Rico are going to die‚Äîit‚Äôs too late to stop that from happening. We‚Äôll be very lucky to avoid a cholera outbreak.  They are a protectorate of the United States. We are responsible for them in an emergency.  This is non-negotiable, and not dependent on their behavior, however reported. They are outraged‚Äîno, despairing, I don‚Äôt blame them. This is not entitlement, this is the succor expected to lend to people in need in the most basic way‚Äîfor survival. 

I think history is going to reveal even worse behavior from Trump when we have gotten through this.  But for now, his pathological lack of empathy has gone from sociopathic to psychotic. We have a bias of thinking of the psychotic person as being completely unhinged, and easily identified. They are very good at presenting as fairly normal, until the facade falls away. The facade has fallen away. This is very, very sick behavior.  ",1506816502

"C_S_T","t5_37lis","&gt;The tarot's aspect as fortune telling is mostly used by charlatans.

Well that is definitely not true (then again, it is still likely the majority of people practising psychic tarot are not as capable as they should be - calling them charlatans is quite a stretch though). It is however possible I am misunderstanding what you are trying to convey.

Many people use tarot to ascertain a vibrational pattern in the future of a person. I have used tarot to ""tell"" the future for myself in the past, with significant success.

What you say about tarot is of course true (that the archetypes in the cards resonate with one's subconscious, thus producing insight), but one must note that the archetypes interact not only with one's subconscious mind, but with one's intuitive sense. Thus the tarot can be used in any way pure intuition/psychic insight can be used. For example I can psychically ascertain something about a certain person by connecting with them with my intention (I can do this pretty easily in person, especially with people I know - but it's something anyone can learn really, you are stepping into the other person's karmic field and can thus read it, methods of healing like [karmic diagnostics](https://www.amazon.com/Karmic-Diagnostics-Awareness-Healing-Paperback/dp/B00FGVOVIK) (which have been used on me by various therapists, with great success) are used in this manner for example).

Thus in the same way you can read another person's energy field and their subconscious mind, you can also read the future. The future isn't determined, so what you are reading is the underlying matrix of possibility - in other words, what kind of future the now is heading towards. You are observing the future and are thus ""collapsing"" it (in particle physics terms), based on the current energy and intent of all beings.

 Reading the future from a purely intuitive position is very difficult. Why? Mainly because one's personal hopes and expectations interfere with what one sees as the collapsed future, the mind is also restless, pictures and sensations may come and go and it can be difficult to discern truth from falsehood. And of course the future is always liable to change. There are karmic ""train-tracks"" if you will, points where we are heading towards and one could thus even argue that major events in one's life are almost unavoidable due to their strong karmic imprints, which would be very difficult to undo and dissolve. One can predict things like this, if the mind is clear, but frequently it is not.

Here, tarot can come into play. You can give the intention to predict the future through the cards and unveil them. Not only is it important to intuitively uncover the correct cards, it is also of course important how to read them. The unveiled cards will be a great aid to your subconscious mind and in this case your intuitive sense, they will help you discern information and clarify visions as well as any other forms of perception (emotional, physical....) that may come to one intuitively. The will serve as the archetypes as well as the physical ""rock"" through which you can channel your scattered intuitive perceptions.

All in all, tarot is brilliant for a great variety of things. Anything that relates to reading one's subconscious (getting a clearer picture about yourself...), to clarifying one's intuitive sense (gaining insight into people, events, the future, past,....) can be greatly aided through tarot cards.",1506816509

Simply put, setting the price at 15 gold will make all passengers board your train as long as there is space, 35 gold will drop the rate of passengers boarding to about 85% [\(Data\)](https://imgur.com/piVyq9s). The average upgraded station has 22,3 passengers. 

If we set the price at 15 gold, we make 335 gold for the first 100km from the average station.

If we set the price at 35 gold, we make 663 gold for the first 100km from the average.

As shown in the original post, everything after the first 100km doesn't depend on ticket prices. The accountant and happiness just increase the gap as they multiply the base fare...

So, the difference in base fare for the average station is 328 gold. How far do the 3.35 extra passengers we get from a low ticket price have to travel to come out ahead? 1961km. 

So, in essence, set your prices to max, unless you're going to cross the Atlantic or travelling Winnipeg - Toronto and have the space (maybe some routes in Russia East as long enough?). In those cases, use the lowest possible fare. But just keeping your ticket prices a max will not hurt you by much, even in those cases. Personally, I won't bother with optimizing that part for every single journey. 

EDIT: I seems that I made a mistake by just looking at the extremes and assuming linearity between them. See the comment made by /u/ethanator2008 for more information.",1506816513

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","Don't know how that became ""my side"" regardless of my opinions on any of them.  Also don't know where talking about history forgetting the bad parts of various cultures is suddenly a discussion of current events.  The takeaway that ""perceptions change"" is, in case you missed it, talking about over many years.  How current events will be viewed will not be answered input lifetimes or our grandchildren's lifetimes.  Was that part unclear?  (I apologize if the GWB example confused you, I only brought it up because the popular opinion of him now is already different from what it was in 2007.  As for myself, I disliked him then and I dislike him now, in fact, my dislike for him was so strong that it was the primary reason I voted for Obama.)

I am curious, since you mentioned it, what your take is on our best way to deal with North Korea.  Should we just allow them to improve their nuclear capacity?  In this case the weapons are not imaginary.  I don't have an answer for this one, I don't really think the president's response is wholly wrong, but fanning the flames on twitter is not to our best interest, obviously.

Edit:  Part of the treason I often post on T_D is that it is one of the few places on Reddit where intellectual freedom still exists.  I am sure you have not, and even reading this, will not actually look there beyond scanning for the first racist headline you see and coming away feeling vindicated.  I make no lie of shiposting there, but if you were to delve further into my post history, you would see I often argue points there that contradict the prevailing ideology.  The difference between ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" subs lately is that the conservative ones will look at an opinion for its own merit rather than shouting it down if it violates the prevailing ones.  I used to be more of a liberal before the left consolidated into ""accepted ideas"" and the right opened up to transgressive ones.   My switch coincides with the switch in that exact factor.  The left no longer accepts ideas that challenge the ""prime directive.""",1506816514

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","I'm of the opinion that since humans are the reason that there are such large feral populations of companion animals like dogs and cats, that we have a moral obligation to do what we can to alleviate their suffering and the suffering that they cause to other animals. Domestic cats specifically do a massive amount of damage to local ecosystems. They kill tons of birds and rodents, which disrupts the balance that would otherwise exist. 

And these cats that are born to feral parents are for the most part going to have really rough lives themselves. They generally won't have any medical care, may struggle with finding food, may be abused by some humans because there's no one to protect them from that. 

We're presented with the choice to take action to help reduce that suffering, or to let it continue on indefinitely without intervention. And since I'm of the opinion that standing by and allowing human-generated suffering to happen isn't a neutral stance, I think we have a duty to do what we can to mitigate the growth of those populations. 

It's not a simple situation, of course. But my feelings on the matter lead me to believe that spaying and neutering programs are just a responsible thing for us to do. ",1506816518

We should have been prepare before it got this bad. Aid should have already been ready to go  This is not just on the President; this is reflection on the poor state of the entire government. 

Edit: I'll admit I was too uninformed to make most of the claims I made, but I still angry that the government did not spent a bit more time and money on preparing for disasters like this. On an island hit by a hurricane shouldn't it be considered what should be done if the ports are rendered unusable?  You know the Pentagon had a plan to invade every nation from Iran to Switzerland ready to go.  It's infuriating to me that us doesn't have a similar level of preparation for any event that might hit US territory especially a vunderable island like Peurto Rico. 

Moreover what did the President do?  Tweet about the NFL during this. Even though it would be obvious that the President isn't spending every moment working on the recovery, it is a necessary fiction. What does it say to the people affected when they learn the president was picking petty beef with the NFL while they are suffering? Imagine you were them. Even if you know he wasn't spending every moment working to help you, isn't it better than knowing he was spending time tweeting BS over BS. 

There is a story from ancient China. A comet passed through the sky which was meant to be a great portent from heaven say they were displeased with the current emporer. The emperor greatly disturbed gathered together all his counselors and officials to discuss that matter and had each one tell them his honest appraisal of the current state of the nation. Though there was nothing the emperor could do about the sign from heaven, his efforts to work tirelessly when the such a distater occurred and listen to the honest critisim of his officials inspired real faith in his government. 

Now is this entirely true. No but that this story exists says something about the way a country needs to address disaters.  It illustrates a necessary fiction that the government needs to be viewed as ever diligently responsible for the well being and protection of it's citizens, especially those affected by natural disasters. To break that fiction by tweeting about meaningless bull or going to golf (even if you could do work from where ever), is dangerous to the people's faith in the government, which is dangerous to the integrity of the nation as whole in real terms.

Arguing with victims of a disaster when your job is to help them is dumb. But they are brown and they aren't an actual state so I don't think Trump cares the slightest, he knows he can shit talk them and his base won't care. He will do anything as long as it doesn't alienate his base. ",1506816520

2. Imagine IOTA network becoming huge. Now, you would need to broadcast your transactions to the entire network, wouldn't you? Or, am I missing something? Broadcasting to a huge network takes time and hence will affect the transaction rate. This is what I meant by broadcast issue with indefinite scaling.

3. The video at some point said IOTA currently processes 182 transactions/s. For some reasons, it did not mention the number of nodes in the IOTA network. So, as you may have read, Zilliqa currently stands on 1389 transactions/s for 2400 nodes. ",1506816520

Also, be sure to get your NEC in writing. As we all know, recruiters can be less than honest sometimes and make promises that they can't keep. Mine gave me my NEC in writing and off-handedly mentioned there was a tiny (~5%) chance that I might get stationed with an infantry unit. Turns out, something like 70% of Corpsmen are assigned to Marine Corps units. Something else to be prepared for. In my 5 years of service I only spent 11 days on a boat, while it carried my Battalion for an amphibious assault. LOL

"AceAttorney","t5_2so0n","Much as I loved Mia, like others have already said, Phoenix is supposed to be able to stand on his own now. I would really dislike it if they brought her back to help him again, it'd be erasing all of the progress he made in the trilogy. They already make him act stupid enough and give people the impression that he's dumb and bullshits his way through every trial. Bringing Mia back to help him would just make it even worse. He's the mentor now. He's taken over her role for Athena and Apollo. He doesn't need her help anymore. The same goes for Maya. By the end of SOJ, she's finished her training, she's officially the Master of Kurain, and she doesn't need her sister's help anymore.

The only two ways I'd want to see Mia again would be, first, if they ever decided to make a prequel game solely about her, which I obviously don't think will ever happen. And second, if Ace Attorney ever goes the romance route and Phoenix and Maya end up together. Maybe they'd want Mia's approval or something, I don't know, lmao.

I don't see any other reasons Mia should come back again. And I'm not making this into a shipping thing here, just saying that that's one of the ONLY scenarios I could see her actually having a reason to come back.

She was a great character but sadly T&amp;T was about ending her story and leaving Phoenix able to do things without her.",1506816522

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt; Dogs don't get genetic problems simply from selective breeding. They got them during the Victorian Era because of selective inbreeding.

Wrong, shows require certain sthetical aspects, the GSD didn't get those hips because of inbreeding, the pug didn't come into existece for inbreeding either.

&gt; There is nothing inherently wrong with selectively breeding animals.

When it's done for the health of the animal, but when it's done for profit, then everything goes.

&gt; It's also not possible for many animals to even comprehend the concept of manipulation, so it would be pretty hard for them to be upset by it.

I never said they understood being manipulated, but suffered the consequences of such manipulation, moral patients don't understand much, but we do know animals have mental capacities of infant human children, you get it?

It explains why the emperor couldn‚Äôt just squash Horus during their fight; angron, Curze or hell maybe even the Angel, he could stop them. Horus though? He can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs actually a traitor.",1506816526

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt; intent to send his loved creations there for **eternal torment**.

You should know that there are at least these three views about hell that Christians hold:  

* (1) [Universal reconciliation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_reconciliation) - A person who was not saved during life is in hell for some time, but can wise up and accept Christ as Lord.  Eventually, everyone will be reconciled to God.  

* (2) [Conditional immortality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_immortality) - A person is normally mortal, but Jesus gives eternal life to some (those who accept Him).   Therefore, those in hell have a finite period of punishment, followed by [annihilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilationism).  

* (3) Eternal suffering (of some type) - this has been traditionally taught among some Catholics and Protestants ([see link about views](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_in_Christian_beliefs#Roman_Catholicism)).

See [this image](http://www.rethinkinghell.com/assets/img/triangle/helltriangle_med_detail.png) which depicts attributes of the three views about hell.

*Each* of the three views has some verses to support it.  
See [this book](http://www.amazon.com/All-Want-Know-About-Hell/dp/1401678300/) for a discussion of the arguments for/against each view.  
While (3) has been taught for such a long time, (1) and (2) are gaining popularity these days.

My own position is 'annihilationist' - that people in hell have a finite proportional punishment and are then annihilated.  I also hold to 'conditional immortality' - that people's existence is by default finite, and that God gives a gift of eternal life only to some people.  

[This article by Greg Boyd](http://reknew.org/2008/01/are-you-an-annihilationist-and-if-so-why/) explains his reasons toward annihilationism.  I recommend reading it.

-------------------------------------

&gt; why did he create a place like that in the first place?


Some views on why God created hell:

* (A) to do justice for each person's moral wrongdoing.  
He ""does not let the guilty go unpunished.""
* (B) as a place to punish the devil and demons in the long run, for *their* wrongdoing  
(Note, they do not rule there; they are punished there).
* (C) People choose to reject God, so they are separated from Him.  
* (D) Heaven only contains God, the angels, and the people made holy.  
Only the sanctified can be there with God.  So there is a place for others.

Realism like that makes for a shitty game though (or at least a game completely different from the 4X genre as we know it) so this space EU4 system is fine.

"tf2","t5_2qka0","I quit overwatch about a month ago. Not really 'quit' since most of my friends whom i met on overwatch still play and they sometimes invite me to play. But for the last week now I havent even touched the game. After I reached diamond in S5 and did my placement matches in S6 (diamond again) I just stopped giving a fuck about the game. It just stopped being fun. QP was a mess and so was comp mode. Everytime I got on after a point I was just ""why am i still playing this, this is not fun,"". Arcade was boring and Deathmatch became stale after a few rounds. The custom games, without scripting/custom maps, were just either ""Shoot/kill people but in a different way"" or ""RP COOL HANGOUT"". There were some unique gamemodes people managed to make such as Simon Says but without the aforementioned scripts/custom maps it was very limiting. I have some more reasons for why I left (the main game play/ combat is one of them) but I won't be going into them.

When I reinstalled TF2, it was a huge breath of fresh air. YES matchmaking has issues, but I managed to find ways to go around them. If I get tired of try-harding as soldier, maybe I can go Fat scout, FoS+Steak heavy, Trolldier, Demopan, or even more tryhard soldier. The weapon unlocks open a plethora of different playstyles (ways to fuck around) which keep me from getting bored. I can do what I want in casual and 12v12 is a fun mess. When I get tired of dealing with objectives I can just get on a CTF or Hightower game and fuck around even more. When I get bored of Casual there are so many custom game modes available with active communities. Deathrun, TF2ware, Saxton Hale, and x10/100/1000 are just a few to name. To sum it up, TF2 keeps finding ways to keep me interested. 

TL;DR I quit tf2 for overwatch, played overwatch for nearly a year, and then came back.

My ex and i split recently and sometime after decided to only see each other explicitly until we were back together or decided it was over. I found out through a friend she was trying to sleep with him, as well as sleeping with another guy i know and shake hands with when we cross paths, through that entire period. She was a bad person. 

If your ex cared about you she wouldn't have done this. Fuck her and fuck your ""best friend"". Good people don't do this to others. Selfish people do. That's the only thing either of them were thinking about when they slept together, themselves. 

The part of you that still wants to be with her is how you remember your relationship, and who you thought she was. She isn't that person. It's a hard to pill to swallow, but you need to let go of her. It's going to be really hard for a while but it will fade with time.

Street Fighter 5 was such a step back from older fighting games in terms of complexity.  And we're not even talking about combos.  The neutral is so dumbed down, and everyone has so many fewer viable options that it makes it way less interesting to play.  

I'm a little worried about the new ArcSys tag game because they've said they're removing walking completely and only keeping the run/dash mechanic.  That's going to affect precise positioning in some situations, and it may point to an attempt to make the games even more beginner friendly than P4A, which only had basically 2 buttons (and 2 persona attack buttons that were more situational).

Also, from Kantar website that I shared before:
&gt;This information is based on the research extracted from the Kantar Worldpanel ComTech global consumer panel and refers in all cases to 3 months periods ending the stated month.
ComTech is the largest continuous research consumer mobile phone tracking panel of its kind in the world, conducting over one million interviews per year in Europe alone.
ComTech tracks mobile phone behaviour, including purchasing of phones, mobile phone bills/airtime, source of purchase and phone usage and delivers beyond market share tracking to understand drivers of share changes, market dynamics through consumer insight - the data included in this release is excluding enterprise sales.

I can assume that they are fairly accurate data. But even assuming that I could be 100% wrong and it's as you say, it would still apply to all the OSes that then should still be in proportion, and the numbers hardly change as a result.

There are infinite plays throughout the game. It's constantly dynamic. If you're just running into combat without a simple route/plan, then your not using your brain. Have a backup route, one or two escapes in your mind. You keep track of so much.. 

My friend for example, thinks a lot like you.
""I don't want to try hard, I just want to enjoy the game.""

This statement blows my mind. The game is an interactive learning machine, you can use the controls, and kill people. But there is more than moving and shooting. Couterstrike as well, and FPS has a huge dynamic set of moves and couter-moves.

My point wasn't whether it's ridiculous to compare them, because even though I don't think any comparisons make much sense given how different the games are, I understand that people will still do them. I should have said I don't think you should compare them, but I'll leave it as the original. Regardless, my point was with your language.

This is actually my area of expertise, I work in chemistry doing pharmaceutical research and also I have been taking Topamax 100mg for ~ 7 years now (I took a break because I got pregnant while NOT on BC and then got back on after I finished breastfeeding) and I have taken multiple OCBs and currently have an IUD (Mirena).

So, the issue with the interaction between Topamax and oral contraceptives is not actually related to efficacy. Anticonvulsants from several classes have been shown to effect BC efficacy and so Topamax was studied for this same potential, however it was shown to only lower serum levels of estradiol (which is related closely to estrogen) which in turn can cause breakthrough bleeding for women on BC. It was **not** shown to have any effects on actual efficacy. (Women who were bothered by breakthrough bleeding were suggested to take estradiol supplements prescribed by their gynecologists.) Also worth noting, this isn't actually an issue with all birth controls either, only certain hormonal types.

There was a published paper on this study, I'm sure I can find it if you'd like to read it for peace of mind! Otherwise, you are fine to continue taking both medications.",1506816554

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I'm trying to understand how anyone has made the assumption that Bo3s hasn't improved NA LCS region.  I don't think there's any clear analysis on this matter and that statement seems to be jumping the gun. 

2016 Spring split was double RR, and Summer split was the 1st time we saw Bo3s.  One split doesn't make any conclusive evidence.  In Bo3s, IMT, who had the best record of NA with Bo1s, ended up 2nd place in Summer, lost in playoffs, and lost to C9 in Regionals.  Additionally, C9 was able to get out of group stage, and the overall performance from all 3 seeds was better than anything that happened at 2015 Worlds.  

For comparisons sake, the records for all 3 seeds of NA in Group Stage Worlds were: 2013=5:11; 2014=10:8[with an all CN roster of LMQ prior to residence ruleset for players, and this was most likely the reason]; 2015=6:13; 2016=9:9.  So, there was clearly a marked improvement from purely NA teams from Season 3 Worlds, to Season 6 Worlds, and I don't see how you don't claim Bo3s were a factor.

This will be the first season where NA LCS has playe Bo3s entirely, and yet, even though the final **results** are not out, there is this underlining view that NA as a region is no different than previous years, discounting that a **new** team has entered the mix, in IMT, and that C9 are not the premiere team they've been before, and because of **new** changes, had to do the play-in, and looked to be the most dominant team of the group, including over the **premiere* Chinese team WE.

So, I don't know how the jury came in with the results before all the evidence was even submitted.  So, there's a lot of assuming going on around here.",1506816554

back in 2005 till 210... heck..maybe even up till 2014 and 15 the macbook air was considered one of the best windows laptops and macboom pros were really meant for pros... but what apple is doing with their current lineup does not justify the price... and the touchbar? a joke for everyone that has use a conputer for more than a year

as long as there are xps13 and 15 out there that have same if not better quality , there is no reason to buy apple hardware (software is opinion though)

about the software thing... since win 10 included the gesture stuff with multiple desktop support  and the ""finder"" feature even that has vanished

also as far as i saw with loads of customers... it doesn't matter which os   especially not tech savvy people use because they know/use less than half of the features

and regarding the build quality of macs... you should check out louis rossmans's youtube channel where he reviews older models and talks about how apple handels issues ... not so customer friendly after all.. but efficient if the company wants to make customers believe that there are no issues

"Anxiety","t5_2qmij","We don't even know for sure how SSRIs work in general, and why they work (or don't) for specific people, so anecdotal experiences are not very helpful. Lexapro might work very well for you, without any side effects whatsoever, or it might make you feel even worse. No way to tell.

Just treat it as an experiment since that's what it is. Note any changes in mood and symptoms, note side effects, ask people close to you if your behavior has changed, and report back to your doctor at your next appointment.

I find that people who have anxiety tend to have a pretty high tolerance for nasty side effects, but if a drug is making you feel noticeably worse for several weeks, it's not working properly. There are plenty of options, so don't try to brave it out.",1506816555

You could also probably tell by the tone of his voice when he uses your male pronouns/name if he actually sees you as male or just does it to be nice. Idk how to describe it but i can always feel when people just do it to make me feel good (my teachers and parents) or when they really see me as a guy (1 classmate, an internet friend who knew me pre coming out, and obviously ppl i am stealth to, on the internet). 
I don't know how to explain it but you'd feel weird-ish if he called you male pronouns in this situation and you could tell he feels weird too.

It's hard to get more straightforward than fighter, and if she likes using a bow as her primary weapon then DEX fighters are totally legit, and if she wants a bit of spellcasting at some point then eldritch knight works pretty well for that.

Ranger also works I guess but isn't as straightforward, especially if you opt to use the UA revised ranger so that it's not as weak.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;No I didn't mean white privilege. I was talking about job privileged. While I may be wrong, generally speaking people who imply it's easy to get a job you actually like or who ask why someone would bother applying for a job they might not like...they're often people who are in a stable position that they enjoy. Not everyone find it that easy.

I actually laughed out loud at this. I worked at Walmart for 5 years, in addition to a smattering of food service jobs.

I'm in a stable position that I enjoy *now*, in part because I applied for jobs that I could answer why I wanted to work there. There were times I was wrong about a job that I thought I'd like, but I didn't know that til I'd done it. It wasn't necessarily ""easy"" to get to where I am, though there's always some degree of luck/right timing involved, but it also involves doing what you think you're going to like to do, learning about your job desires, and adjusting. 

The job I have now I got as a result of freelancing for the company, which I was doing on nights/weekends because my day job wasn't particularly using my brain or my writing skills. 

It's in an industry I knew nothing about at the time (credit card processing), and would have thought was boring. But it had some broad appeal to me as a chance to do some writing and get paid for it. A ""why I want to work there"" isn't because I'm passionate about credit card processing, but it is that I want to have a job where I write for a living. But there are jobs where I can write elsewhere.. why this one? It's also a tiny company, and the thought of being able to help shape the company's direction and be involved in its growth was appealing. 

Once you're out of entry-level situations, the ""why this job"" is a lot more relevant. Employees who don't think about it seriously are setting themselves up for continual dislike of their jobs.",1506816556

&gt; Baby is a young and partially hearing impaired getaway driver who can make any wild move while in motion with the right track playing. It's a critical talent he needs to survive his indentured servitude to the crime boss, Doc, who values his role in his meticulously planned robberies. However, just when Baby thinks he is finally free and clear to have his own life with his new girlfriend, Deborah, Doc coerces him back for another job. Now saddled with a crew of thugs too violently unstable to keep to Doc's plans, Baby finds himself and everything he cares for in terrible danger. To survive and escape the coming maelstrom, it will take all of Baby's skill, wits and daring, but even on the best track, can he make it when life is forcing him to face the music?

So for me it was stuff like
Not very excitable - I don‚Äôt scream and yell
Not child friendly - just language wise
Dumb jokes - I make a lot of stupid jokes
Dry - I‚Äôm pretty dry as far as humor goes
(Some of these are redundant but you get the point)

Most of these traits aren‚Äôt really unique they‚Äôre just broad things that viewers can expect to find by watching you or any number of other people for that matter. However, when you factor in your personality by just being yourself these broad traits end up being unique in that the way they apply to you and your channel can only be found in one place.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","I am not in the ""I built D2 up as something it's not boat"", and for the most part I am pretty satisfied with the game. And you are 100% factually correct that a studio has no legal requirement to communicate with their customers. My argument is simply that there is an understood requirement to address the concerns of a customer if they intend to stay in business. And let me just make this clear, I am not a ""bungo plz"" gamer. I play something for as long as I enjoy it, then move on. I understand sunk cost fallacy and I have had my fair share of duds. 

My argument is simply the studio makes a product for the customer, and it is smart business to keep the customer happy. Bungie succeeded with D2 because the vast majority of people are happy (as evidenced by the reviews). Now for the rest of the players who somehow feel slighted that they didn't get the game they thought they were getting, it's in Bungie's interest to address, or at least acknowledge that concerns exist.  Sure it may be uncomfortable, but they will lose money (read the plenty of posts and comments all over Reddit and other places where people have cancelled PC preorders, decided not to get the season pass, etc.). Devs, while it may not be contractual, are now expected to interface with the community in some way. Sure, it's not official, but there is a budding call from gamers that they want to talk to Devs. Companies will begin to give in, because they want money, and they can no longer hide behind this ""toxic community"" defense. 

Again, I am not one to get upset about a game not going my way. I have played fantastic games this year, and I am gonna play more fantastic games next year. But I do find it interesting to watch this Devs VS toxic gamer debate go down. And personally, I think that if a company going forward wants to stay in the green, Devs (or whatever mouthpiece they use as proxy) are going to have to become more involved. Bungie does a decent job with bringing on a dev for the TWAB, and I think that could be a good vehicle to foster two way communication on a bigger scale. ",1506816564

I guess I was hoping there was something someone could point out that made me think there is something wrong with it, but it seems pretty robust. It explains a lot of known behaviour, and none of the objections really seem dangerous, let alone fatal, for the idea.

Now....If I had a billion dollars I might like to do a study to find out. But this is looking like a solid explanation of observed behaviour, offers a plan of action to get out of the downward spiral, and explains a lot of otherwise strange data points (like household chore time has not gone down since the 60s, that women don't seem to be any happier, and that men are doing more housework but thats not easing the housework burden on the women).

It's a bit like lead and crime. (but with no data backup :)) An interestesting unifying theory of some stuff, that explains otherwise odd results that seem inexplicable without the underlying rationale.

"RandomActsOfGaming","t5_2t5mo","Never played before so i dont know what weapons are in there.

Favourite idea: A Riot shield type weapon that you can plant down and shoot flame through. You would be immobile and only covered from the front but the amount of damage you could do going forwards would be awesome.

least favourite weapon would be a copy of PUBG (assuming i could get a disc). I mean... I could throw it at the enemies. maybe. But it'd be a pretty overall stupid weapon to have.

Strategy? lol who needs one of those. So if i had the shield i would use it to move safely around in the open, and try to get to enclosed spaces. If i have a partner they can help cover me from behind while i bust into a building with a flamethrower. if not i would have to find an empty house/building/safe space and try to get close enough to the door to be safe. Of course i couldn't go upstairs or id end up burning myself inside the house, i'd have to stay somewhere downstairs where i could get out if it goes wrong.

If i had a copy of PUBG as my weapon i guess i'd use the disc as a makeshift knife? I would focus on unarmed combat as a surprise and try get better gear fast. But who knows, maybe i can use the disc to cut through a rope or something sometime. who knows...

Unfortunately, by divorcing yourself from the conventional meanings of good and evil, you make your points irrelevant. You say God is Good, and therefore genocide and cancer are Good, because God sanctioned them and He is Good. Well, now I'm afraid I don't want anything to do with your concept of good, and the being you have tried to portray as benevolent is very clearly evil and malevolent by my own standards.

As for that bit about man bringing on evil consequences to himself, now that's even worse.

They should be talking about testes rather than the penis, if that argument is to be made.

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","Personally I would love it if passives had drawbacks, I hate it in any game when you can get something with absolutely no opportunity cost- as an easy example, how many people reading this can name the first passive of the storm-calling sorcerer tree and it's benefits without skipping down to the next paragraph?

I'd imagine the number of people who know what the actual name and benefit of the ability is quite a bit below the number that have played with that tree. That's because every sorcerer build is going to take the ability, no questions asked, because the ability gives a flat benefit. Even on a stamsorc, the only cost to take the passive is 2 skill points, which you can easily acquire, and then you have a decent increase to any magicka skills you use to supplement your build, such as streak/bolt escape.

Now, I also like the other posters suggestion for morphs, so I think a combination of the two ideas would work very well actually. For example, lets look at another passive ability.

(Dark Magic, Sorcerer) Unholy Knowledge: Reduces Stamina and Magicka costs of abilities by 3/5%.

I don't believe, from a straight power/build effectiveness viewpoint, anyone can seriously argue that this isn't a benefit for literally every build. It's a flat out increase, and unless you for some reason have no possible way to afford this which seems doubtful, any sorcerer will have this ability. That leads to the passive being quite boring. For further confirmation, look at any build on AlcastHQ. Gear? Decent in-depth of why to use it. Actives? Same thing, explanation of why to have what where. Passives? ""Just take them all"", literally for pretty much every build. Were I supreme eso development ruler, I would change the ability to something like this.

(Unmorphed) Unholy Knowledge: Add 3/5% cost reduction to all magicka/stamina abilities. Lose 375/750 physical/spell resistance.

(Morph One) Unholy Prowess: Add 5% cost reduction to all magicka/stamina abilities. 

(Morph Two) Unholy Acumen: Add 9% cost reduction to all magicka/stamina abilities. Lose 1050 physical/spell resistance.

All passive abilities would be morphed according to the same basic formula. A few take aways from eyat that formula would be:

1. As you can see, the base ability is not buffed, but actually reduced in effectiveness, meaning if all passives were changed according to this formula then a character who currently has all passive abilities would see themselves actually lose power on their unmorphed passives as a result of this alteration.

2. Clear in Morph One, one of the morphs serves to negate the added drawbacks of the change. So, a build that got nerfed in the change would be able to just morph all the abilities to morph one and have the same exact build as before.

3. As evidenced in Morph Two, the second morph focuses on amplifying both the positive and negative effects of the base passive. So for passives that synergize well with your build goal, such as a DPS sorcerer with shields that cares more about increasing sustain than survivability for this ability, you would want to take the second line, while for passives that don't synergize well with your build you take the safer but weaker option. The base scaling I came up with is for the positive to be scaled up by 80% and the drawback by 40%, but that wouldn't necessarily have to be the modifier.

4. Overall the system doesn't actually add any significant power creep- players can stay at their same current power level, or potential increase one aspect of their build while losing part of another. Furthermore, this adds additional depth to the passive selection process without dramatically increasing character power or dramatically decreasing it. If you aren't sure on an ability, you can simply go with the first morph and gain a no drawback benefit like there is currently. If you decide an ability synergizes particularly well with your build, you can instead choose to go with the second morph. 

5. If increased skillpoint cost is a complaint against a change like this, then all passives could be reduced to one rank that is leveled and then morphed like active abilities. So, in the case of the above ability, perhaps:

(One Skillpoint) Unholy Knowledge: Gain 2/3/4/5% magicka/stamina cost reduction as this ability levels up, up to level 4 at which point it can be morphed. Lose a static 750 physical/spell resistance.

(Morph One): Unholy Prowess: Gain 5% magicka/stamina cost reduction. Lose 750/500/250/0 physical and spell resistance.

(Morph Two): Unholy Acumen: Gain 6/7/8/9% magicka/stamina cost reduction. Lose 1050 physical/spell resistance.

This would enable passives to be leveled just like active abilities, the average skyshard cost would be similar (Passives that currently take 2 points to max out would cost the same to take and morph, passives with 3 such as some armor abilities would take less, passives with 1 such as some guild/alliance war skills would take more). Some passives wouldn't be morphable, in particular pretty much all of alchemy, but it would still make choosing passives a lot more of an actual choosing process.

With that all said, a large part of the Elder Scrolls style games is that every character has the potential to become the vampire lord archmage thief assassin dragonborn companion demi-god type character, so associated drawbacks aren't really the games strong suit. However, I do think it would be an interesting concept, although the chances of it entering the game are nil. Thank you to anyone who read this far.

Anderson's style is very different, the framing and set up are beautiful, but he doesn't do many wide landscape shots or dramatic pauses. The closest I can think of his that would match *Assassination of Jesse James... * (their #1) is *Darjeeling... * (sp), which is a beautiful movie, even in its cinematography, though not his most popular.

You are not entitled to any part of the game if that's true. Chinese players may contribute significantly to concurrent players and have an impact on how PUBG is portraited. However, nobody forced, paid you to play the game and become one of the statistics. It was your decision to buy and play the game individually, through VPN and that being said, you completely knew what repercussions might follow. I also fail to understand how you think that, just because many play the game in your country, suddenly you are entitled to proper publisher and support. No, no, no.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; it presents an idea that people who go to TRP are hopeless, would always gravitate towards such rhetoric

Not those that go to TRP, really, but those who *stay*. I get that some guy with bad luck may get desperate and try it out once, but eventually his luck will return and he'll see that these tactics are unnecessary for him.

But those that are hopelessly unadjusted? Yes.

&gt; focus on teaching women how to deal with shittiness because it's inevitable

Well, right now it's inevitable. Unless you find a way to get rid of those social outcasts, or to limit their participation in society, or tame them or something, this is the best thing you can do.

&gt; That implies you do believe it's possible to reach out and teach respect and boundaries to somebody. 

Certainly. And for the most part, it works: most men *do* respect women. It's those who don't see results and get bitter and resented that eventually don't. Those are the guys that go to TRP.

&gt; but to present people who might buy into TRP myths or are on the edge of that worldview that it's not OK, and that there's another way

Unless the other way is ""leave women alone"", I doubt that you can convince them of that. If we talk about those social outcasts, *there is no other way* than manipulation. And even then, like I said in the OP, it seems the general consensus is the success rate is pretty bad.

&gt; it's difficult to imagine those philosophies can't result in abusive relationships or predatory actions.

It's pretty simple: these guys aren't the kind of people women like to date to begin with. The traits that make them undateable aren't fixable, as much as they like to say they are, and nowadays we have many more avenues of information available to figure them out. So they really aren't at any risk from them. It's other kind of abusive and predatory men that I'd be concerned with.

&gt; surely letting TRP grow without a competing narrative would lead to a society that at least thinks of women as inferior prey and sees everything from a sex-based, transactional perspective.

It doesn't really grow. It's limited to these loser men. And the bitter and resentful have always been more or less a constant percentage of the population. They won't grow *because* of TRP",1506816581

And in capitalism, you can't really change that upgrade cycle ‚Äî in 3 years, if you don't sell a new phone, someone else will.

Then there are other practical concerns ‚Äî batteries have a chemically limited lifetime, and making them replaceable turns out to be more likely to cause problems than be actually helpful. This is, again, unfortunate for outliers ‚Äî certain use patterns shorten battery life significantly (and you can't really help living in places that have harsh winters) ‚Äî but we're kinda unusual.

Tl;dr: no phone making company can unilaterally change this.

Find A way to sell locally. Facebook probably. 

Whatever would work where you're at. Example: People around me love stupid wood porch decorations. I find scrap wood for free via Facebook or newspaper, repurpose it, paint, make stuff like ""love lives here"" signs or pumpkin faces. Sell it at flea markets and Facebook for like $20 a pop. My investment is usually under $20 total, and I can typically get 5-10 pieces sold from a batch of wood. So for $20 -&gt; make $100 profit. 

Sell some stuff, have them come pickup since you can't deliver. Offer $5 off for their hassle. Build that discount into your top price. 

Save enough money to open a checking account, lot of them have minimum limits you have to be above so investigate first. 

Hitch a ride from a friend into town, open account with what you made. 

Open PayPal account using new checking account. 

Expand what you sell and how you sell it into things like eBay, etsy, Facebook, etc.

Use new money to buy supplies, reinvest into what you're doing, repeat until you can buy mode of transportation.

At the time, I was coming off a summer that included the end of my first serious after high school relationship (year and a half long) and the rebound fling with an out of town summer girl, the combination of which nearly killed me. My best friend (now wife) had just moved three hours away for her freshman year, and I was suddenly alone. Brand New Eyes is, and was, a reminder of just how much music can smooth out rough edges in life. I remember driving down the highway, all four windows down, absolutely BLASTING this record. That memory has stuck, and to this day, I can still feel the wind on my face when 'Careful' starts.

Two months later, I finally worked up the courage to ask my best friend out, and we have been together ever since, and married for two and a half years.


The other two albums I'll include from that time period are **The Fall - Norah Jones** and **Battle Studies - John Mayer**, both released on **November 17, 2009.**

That marked a change in my listening habits, to appreciating softer, more scaled down music. Both albums changed so much about me, as well as the memories I have associated. 


So glad i finally get to see Paramore tonight!!",1506816584

Don't let the car overheat. Ever. If it does, try and stop asap. You don't want a warped head and block. Usually it's just as simple as an old leaky radiator or thermostat gone bad. 

Check your fluids AS OFTEN AS YOU STOP FOR GAS. Honestly, it's the simplest thing to do, but I've told too many friends they need another car all because they didn't pay attention to the oil/coolant levels.

Than double check that with the amount of ethane and your ration and you get 0.1667*3.5 is .583. Close enough, for the rough % we are using.

The mass of N2 still needs to be taken into account even though it isn't apart of the rxn because the question ask for the amount of air needed for the combustion, not the amount of pure O2.

There was a case back in 2009 where a mother raped two of her sons (aged 11 and 8), and her crime was ""indecent acts with a minor"". Parliament responded by drafting new legislation that would reform rape law to make it gender neutral, but women's rights groups lobbied against such reform, insisting that it would discourage female victims from coming forward (because the accused men could countersue and claim they were the victim). They even opposed changing the law to consider underaged boys as possible victims. The proposed legislation was dropped like a hot potato.

Personally I think that Shinji is like that for 3 reasons:

1) Anno has a similar character

2) A sensible main character is needed for a story about depression and overcoming obstacles

3) Anno maybe wanted to prove that you can be a wonderful person even if you aren't what stereotypes wants you to be

I'm really glad that Anno made such a fragile male character the protagonist and that the climax of the story is about him accepting himself as he is instead of going with the ""man the fuck up"" route. ",1506816593

"tf2","t5_2qka0","&gt;The weapons in the Uber update was not game breaking at all

Oh really? Let's take a look:

* Tomislav was released with 75% faster spinup and was completely overpowered

* The Vita Saw to this day is Medic's most overpowered melee weapon

* The Mantreads and Booties are still useless

* The Splendid Screen was sort of okay, but Targe was usually better at the time.

* Eviction Notice and Shahansha were trash.

* The Enforcer was broken and had to be nerfed.

* Family Business and Big Earner were meh weapons.

* Quick Fix was pretty meh, but it ended up getting buffed into an overpowered state at some point afterwards and is still in need of a nerf

* Soda Popper and Atomizer to this day are considered Scout's most overpowered items. The Soda Popper in particular was even more OP on release than it is now!

* The Winger was pretty meh, because it didn't have the extra jump height.

* Liberty Launcher was a complete crutch. Extra projectile speed for less clip size. That was the entire stats back then.

* Disciplinary Action was overpowered in 6v6 formats and has barely been nerfed since release.

Nearly all of these weapons were either OP or useless. A lot of these (Mantreads, Booties, Soda Popper, Enforcer etc.) may as well have not been added in the first place.

&gt;I haven't said a single thing about changing weapons being a bad thing.

I never claimed that. I stated that there should not be new weapons because rebalancing weapons does the exact same thing but in a better way. By making a weak weapon into a balanced one, you create a new weapon without actually adding a new model or whatever. Hence why I would prefer to see more updates like Gun Mettle and less updates that include new weapons.

We've already reached the point where some would argue that there are too many weapons in TF2. There's like 150 unlocks, and that's not including the 30 or so stock weapons. We honestly do not need more weapons added to the game. We should be happy with the 180 we have.",1506816593

&gt;Is this classified as abuse?

Im not going to bother to even break down your post. The entire thing is a catalog of emotional, sexual (taking nude pictures which may even be child porn) and physical abuse. Extreme. And very very dangerous. Shes competing with you. And punishing you. I recommend you check out /r/raisedbyborderlines and /r/raisedbynarcissists. You are very much in danger and have been traumatized.  I recommend you speak to your guidance counselor at school or a trusted teacher. Print this out, see if it helps. Check out RAINN.org. None of this has anything to do with you at all, really. Its all about her. She is broken. She is incapable of being the Mother you deserve. It has nothing to do with your weight, or your being good enough, or unworthy of her love. She is never going to be the Mother you should have had. You will never get the love, safety, security, and affection you deserve from her. She doesnt have it to give. She never will. You are far to young to hear these things, but unfortunately you need to understand the truth. You need help. Resources. So please reach out. Is your Father in the picture? 

Im so sorry you are going through this. You are far from alone. Check out those other subs I listed. See all the people going through this like you are. So many. They are a really good resource for you going forward. They focus on the parent child relationship more then we do. You deserve respect, dignity and kindness from your parents. Know you deserve better then her. And remember, none of this is because you deserve it or did something to earn it. Abusers tell you those things to make you feel guilty and responsible for their abuse. Its never ever true. Never. Its how they keep you quiet. Please reach out carefully. And be safe. ",1506816594

Everyone wants all this fan services bullshit, they hear something in the trailer and extrapolate it to be some character from RDR, even if it doesn't make sense. Accept the fact that this is a new story featuring Dutchs gang, and that it doesn't make a lick of sense for Edgar Ross to show up several years before the Bureau he works for in RDR was even established.

2.  Of course it makes a difference, I speak from experience(having handled/supervised tens of thousands of claims and handled ARB).  There are details from the accident that you might be able to provide that will help prove your case and get them to pay your claim.  Tons and tons of ARB cases end up being word v word that wouldn't have to be if people would just cooperate with the investigations.  Also remember that not every claim has an associated police report to work as a ""tie breaker"".

3.  Not denying that, but once again see #1.  Not everyone can afford the higher rates premier insurance charge, and not everyone qualifies for them.  Keep in mind, I placed the caveat in my original response that I would call my insurance company as soon as I experienced issues, but there is definitely less variance involved with trying to file through the other company first.

Grab 2h or weapon/shield (for shield throw) and go with in in act two. Grab polymorph 1 point for Tentacle and Chameleon. 

In act 2 as fast as you will get your Graft Skin and Vampirism you can respect to INT:WITS and start to try pure caster Necro.

"BigBrother","t5_2r4zz","He didn't just take credit for everything, he DID everything. Compare this to Luke, who was saved by production twists twice, (Henry getting swapped while Henry had COMPLETE CONTROL of the tribe) and then the mutiny when he tried to get out Sarah (when his 3-2-1 vote plan flopped) When Luke got out Jacqui, he was only able to do it because of twists, when Luke got out AK, he was only able to do it because of a very, very lucky swap, if it isn't for the mtuiny in Episode 14 Luke almost certainly goes. Almost every time he tried to make a strategic move without twists to help him, it absolutely flopped. His move to usurp power from Henry and save Mark in episode 7 flopped, his attempted 3-2-1 to get out Sarah in episode 14 flopped, the only reason he stayed in episode 16 is because he got lucky as hell Jarrad went on a crusade against Henry and so Henry had to get Jarrad out first. Him getting Tessa out was also a shitty move. The only really good move he made that wasn't handed to him by production was pinning the Tessa vote on Sarah to get her out in episode 20, and that still only saved him for one vote. ",1506816601

"marvelstudios","t5_2uii8","I set aside all my concerns for it as an adaptation, and I still cannot claim it has many redeeming qualities.

The dialogue is absolutely terrible, the actors are almost universally checked out (compare Iwan's work in GoT to this, it's very half-hearted) or simply untalented, and it completely lacks internal consistency. Not to mention some blatant cost-cutting moves like shaving Medusa's head in THE FIRST EPISODE and the generally cheap look despite a decently large budget that seems to be the hallmark of Scott Buck, it just falls flat to me. Also I mean, not to be an SJW, but the specific character choices for the only minority actors seem...a little problematic...

Then you add on the adaptation issues and you have yourself a real mess of a show, especially when you take into account the fact they basically hijacked Agents of Shield for a season and a half just to lay the groundwork for this show, and then they basically ignore all of that and go a completely different way.",1506816602

A while back, a user who I won't name (you can find it elsewhere, but I don't want to bring more grief their way) made a post stating their belief that the Sox would end up third in the division, behind the Rays and the ( gulp) Yankees. Bear in mind, the Sox were either leading or within a couple games of the division lead at the time, it wasn't the period before the Sox got hot and made their climb up the standings.

It's become a several-times-daily ritual since then to post the copypasta, or at least its now-iconic first line, with replies typically referencing the ""( gulp)"".

No no, you attempted to draw *a conclusion* based on your *prediction*, and now you're *pretending* it's a fact. The prediction is possible, maybe even likely, but it still won't prove your conclusion. 
  

&gt; This will be the lowest rated week since they started the idea of ""ratings"".   
  
That's possible.  
  
&gt;(keep telling yourself there is no correlation though)   
   
I never said there was no correlation (God, you love your strawmen. Stop it with the strawmen, it's a fire hazard). What I said was that no matter which side the NFL took, they would piss the ""other side off"". Ratings would suffer no matter what they did.   
  
&gt;Yes, the majority of football fans do NOT agree with this.   

The majority of fans don't give a shit, and (like Myk), would rather the anthem not even be televised. They think the media is annoying and just wanna watch football. If you think 51% (majority) of the fans won't watch and the ratings will fall by 51%, then you are drunker than usual :D
  
&gt; You are conflating what all the assholes in this country have to say on the issue, and looking at THAT poll, instead of a poll of actual football fans.   
  
Since I don't even know what poll you're going on about...I'm just gonna assume this is another strawman. Stop it!  
  
&gt;I would say it's at LEAST 70/30, and I am being generous.   
  
You fail at math. I mean, c'mon man ...you seriously think ratings will fall by 70% ? You know 'Merica is infested with liberals, right? That's why you have to steal elections:P You're outnumbered!!!! ...seriously, 51% is unrealistic, 70% is just crazy talk.   
  
&gt; This is going to be a very costly miscalculation on their part.  
  
The NFL is fucked, no matter what they do ...if you can really call biilionaires fucked. I mean, they'll still wake up billionaires next week. I think they'll be alright.

Yeah it would be great if we got paid to 'engineer' software and not just throw a bunch of code in a bag and shake it until the pieces stick together.  I'll say too that, as much as I like open source philosophy and projects, so many times I've seen projects inhale massive amounts of code no one understands instead of just sitting down and writing a simple component to do the actual thing they're after.  The recent projects I've been on are 95+% open source code and no one puts in any time to, say, monitor the bug reports, update versions, patch security flaws, etc.  I've even seen that on 'mission critical' projects.  It's scary but it's ""what we do"" nowadays I guess...

State machines are awesome and more people should use them.  I suspect 'declarative' approaches will find more and more applications and result in much better code in the long term.  Besides that... well.. computers are hard.  Encoding all the behavioral rules for a complex system is hard.  Doing it in such a way that there are no corner cases or unstable states is really hard.  It's why we still don't have widespread 'visual programming' and why the product and marketing guys haven't taken our jobs yet.  We've been trying for decades.

There were four groups: no exercise/no testosterone, no exercise/yes testosterone, yes exercise/no testosterone, yes exercise/yes testosterone. No surprise, the group that took testosterone and lifted saw some sick gains. The depressing part? The group that took testosterone and didn't lift *saw more gains than the group that lifted without testosterone*.

The overall most important finding was for change in fat-free mass (in Kg) over 10 weeks (I'm not sure how best to reproduce the table without a screenshot)...

&gt; no exercise/no testosterone: 65.1 +/- 2.5 --&gt; 65.9 +/- 2.7 (change = 0.8)

&gt; no exercise/yes testosterone: 69.9 +/- 1.4 --&gt; 73.1 +/- 2.2 (change = 3.2)

&gt; yes exercise/no testosterone: 72.1 +/- 2.3 --&gt; 74.1 +/- 2.2 (change = 2.0)

&gt; yes exercise/yes testosterone: 65.3 +/- 1.8 --&gt; 71.4 +/-1 1.8 (change = 6.1)

Obviously exercising makes a huge difference, but testosterone is fucking magic. The only reason I don't use testosterone is because my understanding is that it can mess with your natural testosterone production if you do it wrong. Without a doctor supervising me and providing me with a prescription for stuff from an actual pharmacy it's just too risky for my liking.",1506816606

I was basically my Nstepdad's prostitute. Anytime I wanted something, like a ride somewhere, or to borrow the car, or lunch money, I had to let him put his hands on me. He has also tackled me to the ground and refused to let go, and hurt me. He also hit on me daily, and all of my girl friends too.

So now, it's too hard to make love. I dissociate during sex a lot. Rough sex has terrified me to the point where I get claustrophobic (is that the right word?) and start crying and panicking. I often have told my boyfriend to talk to me during sex, so I know it's him and so I don't space out. I often either space out or start thinking of terrible things.

I do have a problem lately where my boyfriend unintentionally triggers my PTSD by hugging me too hard and things like that. This causes me to pull away and desire too much alone time. I'm sad about it because he doesn't mean to, and I don't want to hurt him.

In the past when I've been single and dating around, I am highly suspicious of men and what they want. I'm socially awkward so it's hard for me to tell what they want, whether it's sex or friendship or whatever. I need a guy to tell me exactly what he wants, or else I'm left in the dark like an idiot.

I do have the ability to spot red flags early on, though. So many people have rose-colored glasses on and don't notice them. So it's a bad thing and good thing for me. I notice quickly whether or not I like someone, and if they're full of shit when they try to sweet talk me. But that kind of kills the fun of dating a bit. At least I don't get hurt often like some girls do.",1506816607

Here is a comment I found explaining all the aid that has goine to Puerto Rico: 

worldnews banned for this post.

I'll start off with the most credible source of this information; the Governor of Puerto Rico who served as a Hillary delegate at one point and is a Democrat. The Governor has been fighting back against this myth that Puerto Rico has been abandoned by the Federal government and praising Trump's support for the territory. https://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/09/25/puerto-ricos-governor-dismantles-media-attacks-trumps-response-hurricane-irma/

Trump was on Twitter as recently as yesterday trying to bring more attention to the fact that Puerto Rico, despite being a US territory, is way behind US states in forms of infrastructure and finances. They simply have too much debt to deal with to financially handle a disaster of this scale on their own. (For those that didn't know, this is one of the chief reasons they are not a State.) https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/912478274508423168

FEMA has been operating on a 24 hour schedule in Puerto Rico and the USVI since at least 23 September. They have successfully reopened five airports in Puerto Rico and two airports in the USVI airports deliver supplies and aid. FEMA is being supported by the Defense Logistics Agency, USNORTHCOM, US Navy, and USCG. Two USCG cutters are conducting port assessments of St. John and St. Thomas. The port of San Juan was reopened by 23 September.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an order on September 24 authorizing FEMA and DoD to install and operate temporary water treatment units to provide clean water in the U.S. Virgin Islands to address concerns about a lack of clean alternative water supplies.

Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the DoD conducted medical evacuations for more than 150 patients from the islands to the continental United States. Medical evacuations from the islands will continue. A U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) mobile communications team arrived in Puerto Rico to help improve communications across the storm-impacted area.

Thanks to the Coast Guard's efforts, the mission-critical port of San Juan has reopened (with restrictions and for daylight transit only). The port is a crucial lifeline for Puerto Rico, which gets most of its supplies from the U.S. mainland. Early reports indicate that about 80 percent of the island's agriculture was wiped out in the storm, which will raise the importance of food aid and commercial food shipments. In the USVI, most ports on St. Thomas and St. Croix have reopened with restrictions, along with Cruz Bay on St. John. http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/recovery-effort-ramps-up-in-puerto-rico

Before Maria USCG assets and personnel were strategically positioned with relief supplies, including water, in areas near the USVI and Puerto Rico.

USCG said the crew of the Coast Guard Cutter Donald Horsley are en route from Cura√ßao to Puerto Rico and USVI with more than 800 gallons of bottled wa

We only had 3 DT's on the roster to start the season. They brought Garrison Smith back last week, so hopefully that helps going forward (obviously didn't help against the Titans).

""Shut up ken--What's this? I think that's our banners!   Have we already taken over the castle?"" The knight let out a laugh.

""I suppose so, Sir. ""

""We found this man sneaking about after the feast, and we heard that you had already taken happsburg, so we wanted to bring him to you as a castle-warming gift.""

""Yes my queen."" He said as he lifted the sack from the prisoners head.

Furthermore, when you are dead, you have no say in who may or may not possess it.

The fat orange ape is golfing at his private resort while hundreds of thousands of people are in peril. It took him DAYS to even acknowledge what is happening in Puerto Rico, and he only did it after the rest of the world was outraged that he was doing nothing. Most probably because he didn't realize Puerto Ricans were American citizens. Though we shouldn't be surprised about that, I'd be amazed if he could even locate the ocean that Puerto Rico is in. All he knew was some non-white people were dying, and didn't bother to do anything.

But then once people thought negatively of him for it, oh no, he's gotta respond now!

Yet, Many things enables us to become plat

1. Communication before death: people tend to only start communicating after they die. Try to watch what your teammates are doing to do them callouts while you can do something

2. Valorise the role of anchors on your team. Most of your team should stay near the objective. The anchor is always the last one alive tho. Don't blame everything on him when he dies. Oh and when you die, don't talk too much

3.don't rush people you downed. I used to do that a lot, but I realized you die when you do that 90% of the time

"NotMyJob","t5_2y1ei","One time some years ago, on a day he was told to expect a visit from the gas man to check his metre, my dad heard a faint knock on the front door (of his 1bed apartment). He got up and walked straight to the door, opened it and the guy was already halfway down the corridor on his way out. I guess he was running behind that day!",1506816629

"TeenMomOGandTeenMom2","t5_3nsi0","I still feel like this was sort of unfair to her. I think I would have put different rules on a 16 year old mom. Such as, you must stay in school, you may not go out and party and stick me with a kid, you must help with chores around the house. I don't think no dating while my son is free to do what he wants seems fair. Ultimately, it was their house and their rules, but I would have wanted out too.",1506816630
"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","It's a generalized view here. My personal view is way more extreme. I think that someone who is religious is either a retard or wants to screw you over and uses religion to not feel guilty, the ""only God can judge me"" crowd. 

I also judge actions, not words. All politicians do is talk and talk and nothing ever changes. Words get you nowhere. I see actions, like him shoving his religion in my face by dressing up in it. I also see actions, like the NDP kicking out an elected MP for not voting like the dear leader told him. So much for representing his constituents. Worthless fascists, they can stay home.",1506816630

"tgrp","t5_3a7k7","Akihiko chuckled from his hidden position, the laugh bouncing back and forth. His ears noticed the investigator pause before continuing. Even if the man hadn‚Äôt replied, the answer was obvious in his new gait. 

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he called out. ‚ÄúI want you to focus on that feeling. Truly indulge in it. Let it consume you.‚Äù He quietly shuffled forward through the tunnels as he taunted the investigator. He approached a grate in the wall, peeking slightly to find himself just a few feet from the human. Across the hall was another small opening.

‚ÄúHere, *allow me to help you.*‚Äù

With barely a verbal warning, the grate smashed outward, flying through the air as Akihiko lept out from the wall. He swiftly kicked the investigator‚Äôs wounded shield arm to the side before punching the man in the face. He was pulling his punches for now, striking to daze rather than kill; if the investigator died too early, *what was the point?* 

Taking advantage of his disorienting strike, he disappeared into the other hole once more. Safely in place again, he strained his ears to listen for the investigator‚Äôs response.

‚ÄúI quite like this reversal of roles, don‚Äôt you? *The hunter is now the hunted,*‚Äù Akihiko gleefully taunted.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It has become a fairly niche market. Nothing to it really. Either the game is specifically marketed as all around co-op game or it has online multiplayer. Nothing inbetween is really beneficial to the developers in terms of profit. 

For example one of the biggest shortcomings of a game called Enter the Dungeon is that it only has Local Co-op and no Online Co-op. I've wanted to play it in Co-op but never got around to it for I am not going to arrange a get together just to try it out and see if I like it in Co-op. Also Local Co-op games on PC are not very comfortable as both players can't use mouse and keyboard. Many people don't have time to put aside just to play some fairly obscure game locally when it's usually way easier to just boot it and play online when it's possible. 

And it's a straight up lie that ""there isn't Local Co-op games out there anymore"" when Nintendo exists and older games are just as good and enjoyable if the main criterion is that the game has to have Local Co-op. Some genres such as fighters are completely overlooked as well.",1506816630
