I say I ""know"" that there are no gods with the same degree of certainty and for all the same reasons that I saw I ""know"" there are no goblins, pixies, elves or giants. And I doubt anyone would fault me for saying that I ""know"" none of those things exist.


God claims are indistinguishable from these claims in every meaningful aspect. The only reason we try and brand gnostic atheism as an untenable position is because of the cultural conditioning attached to religious beliefs, and the undeserved pedestal that religion gets; often, even from believers.



Neither religion, nor religious thought, involves any deeper thinking or more justification than the belief in hobgoblins, once you peel away all the woo and deepisms. Why, then, is it somehow wrong for me to say that I ""know"" no gods exist?



&gt;it doesn't make sense to claim god doesn't exist when we have no real evidence against god either.

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","I feel like Deshaan is underrated, the main questline in Deshaan is very well structured and engaging, and has a satisfying length to it with an epic showdown with the antagonist of the zone. 


I find that the Ebonheart pact has some of the best and worst zones in the game. Best being (in my opinion): Stonefalls and Deshaan, but also the worst in (in my opinion): Eastmarch and The Rift. The Dunmer pact zones are absolutely stunning visual wise and The Rift as lackluster as it is has a beautiful autumn theme. Shadowfen is a swamp and is ""meh"" visual wise, the Argonian architecture however does provide a unique flavor. 

The Dominion is very floral and elegant when it comes to the cherry blossom covered Auridon and Altmer architecture adds loads of character to its settlements. Grahtwood is captivating with its sprawling gigantic trees, and there is tons to do in the zone, but the mystical ""big trees everywhere"" motif wore off in a hasty fashion, and I just got sick off it. Greenshade is very savanna like and offers a slightly modified flavor, and has much better quests than Grahtwood, but still similar enough to Grahtwood to leave me yearning for differents visuals. Malabal Tor just made me sick to my stomach, it's a swampy Grahtwood essentially and I was just ready to vomit at the sight of another fucking tree, the quests are good, but the visuals are the damned same, leaving this zone wanting. Reaper's March was a breath of fresh air where we finally get some Khajiit flavor (this was great especially when we had 3 Bosmer zones in a row). Reaper's March had great quests and the previously mentioned Khajiit flavor was refreshing.


The Daggerfall Covenant is a mixed bag, Glenumbra is painfully bland, unimaginative, and generic, and the lackluster quests didn't help one bit. Stormhaven was okay, a step above Glenumbra, and Wayrest is beautiful, but still no where near the best, quests didn't feel that engaging. Rivenspire is amazing. The withered crag visual was executed very well, and the quests are okay as well. The Alik'r Desert is nice Redguard flavor, and the Yokudan structures are majestic to say the least, quests were nice. Bangkorai is an interesting combination of Breton and Redguard geography, nice area. 

Overall, I feel like Ebonheart Pact is the strongest, followed by The Covenant, then the Dominion (the Dominion would definitely stomp the covenant if it wasn't for the fact that the zones would have you believe the Dominion is a Bosmer only organization)

"Dublin","t5_2r1hz","Hi! The only trustworthy way to secure a place to stay from your country (or even from here, why not?) is to do it through online housing agencies. They cost you a fee, but considering the the living costs of the city you save up money in the long run. 

Hostingpower and spotahome are two examples. They are both legit. However, the former only offers accomodation solutions in houses that owner occupied, the latter instead has both owner and non-owner occupied houses (mostly the second). 

Hostingpower is great for students as most of the houses are around the universities, but, again, you would need to be OK with not living in a students house where you party and stuff like that. I am actually living in a house booked through this service right now, and I am liking it. I pay 480 for a single room with double bed, and I am 40 mins walk from the center. (they offer only single rooms and an all inclusive formula with expenses and wifi, and bed linen included).

Seems like an advertisement, but I feel you and it's really not worth it to get involved in the crazyness of househunting in dublin! it is not worth it and plus you waste a lot of money in hostels. I heard you could go on for months.

Just so you know, you only have to give one week notice with hostingpower, so if at some point you find your dreamhouse you can always leave. No deposit and payments are on a weekly basis.

We were on a detour through a small town, and we were going the speed limit, following about a length and a half behind. My brother starts to say something, and I glance over, like you do, and somehow in that half a second the woman in front of me manages to slam on her brakes (with no turn signal) to turn into her driveway. I look up and slam on the brakes, but it was too late, and the next thing I knew my head hit the airbag. (For those of you who haven't been airbagged, it's like getting punched by a bag of air that feels like a bag of concrete going 35 MPH.) 

I totaled my car, and even though she's the one who caused the accident, I got the ticket because I hit her. I couldn't drive for weeks afterward, and when I did it was so so so scary. But in a way, I'm glad it happened the way it did, because we only lost the car. If we hadn't been wearing seatbelts, we would have lost our lives.

**Preparing for Citation to Discover Assets (Creditor)**
&gt;My parents received a small claims judgement against a wedding caterer who failed to refund a deposit for cancelled services. The caterer has not paid the judgement yet (it's been about 2 years).
&gt; 
&gt; Now my parents are trying to collect the judgement, starting with a citation to discover assets. He has been served by the sheriff and we have a court date set for the citation.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't have a legal background but I've been able to help my parents fill out all the paperwork pro se up to this point.
&gt; 
&gt; How should we prepare for the citation? What materials should we bring? Does the judge asks questions to debtor about his assets or do we need to prepare a set of questions to ask him about where his money is?",1498867204

"firefox","t5_2qh4p","&gt;  you cannot argue that it's not holding Firefox back

Let's try ;)

Mozilla *chooses* to let add-ons hold them back. Lots of large add-on developers have to deal with breakage all the time, and do so just fine. Add-ons like Tab Groups, Tab Mix Plus, Classic Theme Restorer and others succeed in staying up-to-date with Nightly even. My guess is that for most add-ons that are not huge (so I'm not talking about something like Pentadactyl), developers are able to keep up with at least the beta release, even *without* Mozilla trying not to break them. If at some point a developer decides that he doesn't want to deal with it anymore, he can port his add-on to WebExtensions. If this is not possible, the add-on would be lost anyway. The status quo of this is losing fewer add-ons than what will happen now in Fx 57, and giving other developers who aim to port to WEs, but might not make it, more time to do so.

Sure, this might be a little annoying for people who are using unmaintained add-ons already, if they're only working because Mozilla puts effort in not breaking compatibility. But losing some of your legacy add-ons still seems better to me than losing all of them.",1498867205

 Fast forward to last Monday.. he shows up just before 7:00am, and is trying to find a place to park in the neighborhood (we live in a small square block - think houses around the square's perimeter and houses on the inside, with a single street), so he had to circle through the neighborhood a couple of times. He finally decided to park a house down from us at the curb. As he is unloading his truck a cop shows up. Said a neighbor called them about a suspicious person ""casing"" the neighborhood.

"gifs","t5_2qt55","Pickup trucks pretty much HAVE to be rear wheel drive. There's very little weight in the back of an empty pickup, even with rear-wheel drive. So if you removed the (heavy) drive shaft and rear differential required for rear wheel drive, you'd be left with pretty much no weight whatsoever back there. So when the pickup bed is empty, there would be no weight to keep the rear wheels pushed down to the ground. All the weight would be in the front of the truck from the engine. So when you drove, the slightest bump would cause the rear of the truck to bounce all over the road and you'd have very little control over the vehicle. 

The other problem is that when you load up the truck bed with heavy stuff (think construction materials) you weigh down the rear axle and ""lift weight"" off the front axle. So, if you had a heavy load in a front-wheel-drive pickup truck, you could find yourself in a situation where you'd have a tough time getting traction from the front wheels.

Later on I did get to see it as it was repeated endlessly. It wasn't that funny but some of the characters like Fonzie, Ritchie, Joanie, Chachi were considered cute or cool so the show had its fans. There was an episode where Fonzie did water-ski over a shark. It was a silliest scene in a show where there were many silly scenes, but being one scene didn't affect the series long term (after that story was over the show continued just as it had before.)

What really did weaken the show was the cast departures. The loss of Ritchie was the worst, and the season without Chachi and Joanie was particularly thin.",1498867208

We have no business!' and the Nazi's took her away the next night for having spoken out against them. She never came back. I guess what I'm saying is that I'd be inclined to go easier on people that made bad decisons back then. Especially if they were young, I'm still pretty shocked though.

They are just reacting to their breeder programming. Because without that programming, most babies and children wouldn't survive to adulthood. There is even a study that proves that the few babies who are unlucky enough to be born extremely ugly instead of cute, end up being abandoned or treated like shit by their parents(often not surviving to adulthood) yet these same parents would have treated a cute baby like gold.

"de","t5_22i0","&gt; Wir sind zu lieb

und - schande - wir (als eltern) sind es wohl ""schuld"". wenn man als kind zur ""gepr√ºgelten generation"" geh√∂rt, will man nicht, da√ü die eigenen kids das auch noch erleben - und √ºbertreibt es ein bi√üchen mit der nettigkeit.

&gt; Erfolg wird gro√ü geschrieben.

aus der nummer bin ich jetzt dummerweise in vielerlei hinsicht komplett raus. ich bin ja nun wirklich der besagte ""[60 years old hippie](https://imgur.com/a/uzggu)"", f√ºr uns galt karriere als der personifizierte satan, was die gesellschaft von uns dachte, war uns ziemlich egal, wir haben unser eigenes ding gemacht, peace &amp; love, a punky reggae party ... scheiss auf die gesellschaft. ich kann also nicht wirklich die m√ºhle verstehen, in der du steckst. ich bin aber nicht so anma√üend zu sagen: ""steig aus!"" ([‚ÄûTurn on, Tune in, Drop out!‚Äú](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary)), wie frei oder unfrei du dein leben f√ºhrst, liegt in deiner verantwortung - von mir nur der hinweis, da√ü es alternativen gibt und man sich einer gesellschaft nicht anpassen muss. 

das kann, wie in unserem falle, dazu f√ºhren, da√ü man der welt so etwas wie das internet und computer hinterl√§√üt, weil man frei genug im kopf war. die angepassten benutzen den kram heute ohne ihn zu verstehen.

da gilt auch f√ºr meine kids: ich erwarte nicht von ihnen, da√ü sie einen weg gehen, den ich mir f√ºr sie vorstelle und lasse die das mal selbst entscheiden. du hast da wahrscheinlich andere erfahrungen gemacht und ich erz√§hle dir dies nur, damit du wei√üt: es geht auch ohne dieses √ºberfordern der kinder, weil man sie als die fortsetzung der eigenen existenz unter dem motto ""es soll den kindern mal besser"" mi√übraucht. ja will ich auch, aber was das ist, sollten sie besser slbst wissen - ich habe keinen plan oder rat.

&gt; geh studieren

meine drei t√∂chter tun das. alles m√∂gliche zwischen arch√§ologie, philosophie, kunstgeschichte. sie verstehen das als die zeit, die sie sich nehmen, bevor das leben sie zermalmt. ich verstehe es als die zeit, in der man die hingabe an ein thema lernt und wie man in die tiefe geht.

wenn man es macht, weil man karriere machen will, muss man mit den resultaten, die dieser wunsch erzeugt, leben.

&gt; In der muslimische Kultur finde ich ist es vor allem die fehlende Wissenschaftlichkeit oder der glaube an Wissenschaft

also, der gebildetste, liebensw√ºrdigste und sanfteste mensch in meinem leben war muslim. arbeitet heute als sterbebegleitender psychologe. muslim sein und gleichzeitig nach bildung und wissen zu streben, scheint sich nicht auszuschlie√üen ;)

&gt; Aber gut , dass sind jetzt meine Beobachtungen. 

ich weiss nicht, ob meine anmerkungen hilfreich waren, oder verwirrend. vielleicht am besten so zusammengefasst: gib einen verdammten scheiss drauf, was andere von dir erwarten, es ist **dein leben**. mach, wonach dir der sinn steht und was dich mit sinn und gl√ºck erf√ºllt. lass die anderen reden, die m√ºssen dein leben nicht leben. h√∂r auf deine eigene innere stimme und geh ein wagnis ein.

oder pass dich an und bedauere am ende deiner tage, da√ü du es nicht getan hast. ich gucke auf meines, es ist einiges schiefgegangen, aber ... ich hatte mindestens vier oder f√ºnf leben und jedes einzelne macht mich zufrieden. es waren **meine** und ich habe nur mir selbst geh√∂rt.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","TL;DR: Because your body can no longer lose heat.

Heat moves from hot to cold. Heat is when molecules ""vibrate"" faster than others - the hotter molecules bang into colder ones and transfer some of their energy, just like smashing a cue ball into other balls on a pool table. Energy gets transferred and taken away from the cueball, just like energy from the warm molecules in your body gets taken away when you radiate heat.

Your body regulates its temperature by using sweat or radiating heat into colder air... but can't do either when it's too humid for sweat to evaporate, or when the air is as hot as your body. There's no slower molecules in the air for your body to lose the energy in its faster molecules.

So you can't automatically regulate the temperature of your body and your body knows this by letting you know ""its really hot and unhealthy here, do something different, ok?"" so it can restore its ability to regulate its temperature.",1498867214

First of all reflect on yourself - have you had any desire for another girl at all, even jokingly? Have you ever felt attracted sexually to another girl? If no - your personalities, ideas of a relationship, are different. The future at this point is quite uncertain. People can't change who they really are down to the core, but a lot of outside factors can change how we behave including fear, sadness, opinions of other people, doubt, insecurity and so on. If yes - you can relate on why she did what she did.

As we grow up we certainly feel the need to explore and experience. I understand you might not feel the need to, already having everything you want, but a lot of other people out there need to go through this phase. Essentially it's a phase of discovering one self. It's a tough choice that only you can make no matter what your parents say. It's something you need to ask your inner self to answer. How hurt were you by what she did? Would you be ready to go through the same? Do you genuinely believe she regrets what she did? Just how much exactly do you love her? If you accept her back, would evetything be the same, can you forgive it? Is she really sorry, what keeps her from doing all this again? Answer yourself those questions, and answer them honestly. And remember when you do to actually listen to you. No fear or doubt, no effect of others opinions - just you. I think you might have a clearer view on things after. Good luck pal",1498867216

I know waking up early those days sounds impractical but it's much easier when you know you're only going to watch TV for a couple hours.

Doing that makes me look like a human being on the outside, which I've found is enough to get through work despite no feelings on the inside.  I've managed to do those 3 things just about every morning for at least a year now, despite brain fog days.  I think because I've told myself for so long that I'll manage as long as I do those three things, it works.  Maybe find a few things that make you feel human, tell yourself they will make you feel human, and after doing them for a while it might work!

Critical thinking is described by Richard Paul as a movement in two waves (1994). The ""first wave"" of critical thinking is often referred to as a 'critical analysis' that is clear, rational thinking involving critique. Its details vary amongst those who define it. According to Barry K. Beyer (1995), critical thinking means making clear, reasoned judgments. During the process of critical thinking, ideas should be reasoned, well thought out, and judged.

"Accordion","t5_2s4ll","Plenty of comments here hitting the mark, so just some notes on terminology:

* ""Bass side"" or ""bass buttons"" refers to the left hand side of the accordion.  Some sets of reeds on the bass side are often tuned higher than those on the ""treble"" side.

* ""Bass"" when used on a treble side register switch, as in your photograph, refers to the lowest-sounding reed block on the treble side.  Sometimes also called the ""Bassoon"" setting.  I would not personally refer to this as a ""bass"" set of reeds, to avoid confusion -- maybe just call it your lowest set of reeds on the treble side.  Wordy but accurate.

* Your accordion has two individual sets of reeds (each set in its own reed block) on the treble side.  You haven't shown any info on the bass side, but I would guess that it has four sets of reeds (set in two reed blocks).  If so, this would be referred to in shorthand as a 2/4 LM accordion.

* Bass reed blocks usually have two different sets of reeds per block, unlike treble reed blocks.  Each set of 12 reeds is a different voice.  Each treble reed blocks has just one set of reeds, but spanning 2+ octaves.

* Fun aside: your accordion's register switch symbols are upside-down.  ",1498867224

In time (different for everyone) you'll move on and you'll be a stronger and more independent person, and as a result you'll be more of your ""true self"" so the right person will find you. The heartbreak you feel now might stick with you but it kind of evolves into a different kind of hurt - and you might even be grateful that it happened, even if it still kinda stings a little. That heartbreak will go from sobbing and fatigue and feeling hopeless to the same pain you now feel when you remember that time your brother ruined your favorite toy when you were 6, but you grew up and got over it, lol

I have two alt accounts that are F2P with some of my best pulls over the past year.  I casually run raids with them, do dailies when I can.  If I am TMRing almost 24/7 with my main, the alt accounts give me something to do while in the bathroom, etc.

The other accounts are there when free tickets come out, compensation lapis, the free 10+1 ticket, simply there to pull units and enjoy a little gambling.  Those accounts don't really do much, but if I have the time to start them all up, I will do the free pulls this month.

And ethics matter because a society operates better when there isn't massive inequality and resentment by a large group within the population. Labour disputes used to often get violent and fatal 100 years ago. Workers need legal protection.

Also its not worth a persons time in a developed country to do a simple manufacturing job that can be done where the cost of living and cost manufacturing is low. 
 
Also I don't see McDonalds moving to Poland and shipping burgers. We need to rely on advanced industries, not simple unskilled labour.

&gt;So you think it's actually more ethical to be forced to exist in a way that will most likely be agonizing, than not to exist at all?

&gt;You seem to be arguing from the position that non-existence is a negative state, when it's as neutral as possible. Ethical concerns cannot apply to something that does not exist.

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","&gt; First of all comparing racism to other forms of discrimination is nonsense; they don't have a common root and don't have similar expression.

Race is just one of the many metrics by which people discriminate against others. Ethnicity, sex, age, social class, general appearance are the other ones. In short, people discriminate against those who are in some way different from themselves, deeming this difference to be an inferiority.

&gt; But actually for most of history racism didn't exist because no one has ever seen a person of another race. 

If not race, then ethnicity, or simply a different social group.

&gt; I think the idea that people in the past were backwards savages is enticing because it makes us superior by comparison. That's just not the case, people have always been the same, only their information has changed.

Maybe you should find out more how life was back then. Distinct social hierarchy was one of the main features in most complex agricultural societies.

The only thing that hasn't changes is people's tendency for tribalism, but the expression of it has severely diminished due to laws and socialisation. People today simply find other, more minor ways to separate themselves from others.

"criticalrole","t5_385bw","&gt;Resurrection is divine magic, even with druids channeling it through some sort of primal force of nature, it works by grace of higher power. In particular this is Raven Queen, keeping souls where they belong is the core of her portfolio. Vax's soul might not even be within his body anymore, remotely controlling his mortal coil from the afterlife like a puppet.

his soul is very much into his body because he would not be able to act where the raven queen do not see if it wasnt.

arcane and divine magic is just a term dnd use, a cleric ask his god to bend the magic, a druid use the natural force and elemental plane to do his, an arcane caster access the magic and shape it... in the end they can do those effect, trapping soul is not essentially only something arcane caster do, cleric have been know to do it

I would also add this is not trapping a soul:

&gt;If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. **You can remain in the ring or depart for the afterlife**. As long as your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can't prevent this telepathic Communication.

the soul is free to continue to the after life,

essentially in this case it only serve as focus to hold the soul in the material plane where the raven queen has no hold on it...

&gt;Most likely answer is: because gods say no.

and this is where the 9th lvl spell true resurection come in effect,

the limitation of such of spell is the soul has to be free and willing, it is not trap in the ring, and it is not yet in the hand of the raven queen,

is it willing? it depends entirely on vax.

if there is such a magic that can superseed a god will, it is a 9th lvl spell.",1498867234

hyphenation, theres far too much of it which makes reading a nightmare.

Lowry is a lock to go the Raps or Wolves at this point.

To even have space for *a chance* at Teague (edit: He just committed to Minnesota it seems) / Hill, we'd have to stretch Asik, dump Ajinca with some 2nd rd picks presumably, renounce Dante and our full MLE + BAE.

I consider them both better than Jrue right now, especially Hill, but with Jrue we don't have to give up everything I listed above this season. But both are also older. Hill is 31 and he's looking for the longest contract possible. His contract is going to look the worst out of the trio down the line.

Lin would fit well with us but Kenny Atkinson really loves him there.

For me it took a long time, lots of crying and lots of skiing until my legs burnt so badly that in the evening all I wanted was a shower a beer and go to sleep, which I did. 

That being said all is not lost for this cycle for you. your first scan was very early still and some people are just late bloomers and it takes time. Also upping the doses means they are thinking things might change. Also when they were so small, it could be there were a few more small ones that were too small to measure but since then have grown all nice and plumb. I would say that if by day 10 you are not 'showing' any more follicles that's probably a better gauge of where you are, until then you just have to wait and see (well even after that you just have to wait it out and see).

"The_Donald","t5_38unr","Tucker does one thing AMAZINGLY WELL. That is bringing on leftists and MAKING them defend / explain their particular toxic belief system. 

They don't get to run down the talking points and talk over the opposing talking head.

Then, when he's had enough, he picks them apart, using logic and fact. Its a powerful thing and beautiful to see because it isn't idiots talking over Each other which turns off normies.

He is great because he demonstrates the lunacy of the left by making them respond to reason. No leftist is turned sane, but casually viewing normies are turned off of leftism because its insanity, hatred, and hypocrisy is displayed by THEM, not opposition.",1498867237

These shitposts of peoples staging screenshots is leaving a negative impression on the game for any visitors and/or potential buyers who might use this sub as a reference to wether it is worth their investment. (I for one do this when considering the purchase of any big game)

These screenshots not only undersell the game as a military screenshot simulator, but devalue the core values as the Arma series as a franchise. 
Users should have a little more pride and show the game off for what it's worth rather than shamelessly begging for updates with faked screenshots 

To emphasise. Despite however many down votes this OP may get or the subsequent comments, I will stand by the fact that as a true fan of the franchise, I will not allow people to devalue the franchise for shameless karma begging.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","So apparently surveys with participants self-reporting are now considered 'studies'? Reminds me of the 'study' comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated children.

Obviously I am for legalization as well as legitimate medical usage (with real evidence to back it), but this 93% stat is total BS. Marijuana is not a miracle painkiller in any form or dosage, nothing is, really. These kinds of claims do more harm than good for legalization, IMO.

People who need opioids to function halfway decently in life catch enough flack as it is. Very, very few patients taking their narcotics as prescribed overdose; nearly all opiate overdoses are in heroin users, recreational painkiller users, people mixing them with alcohol or other drugs against their doctor's advice (those that don't fit in the above two categories), and those committing suicide. I don't say this to criticize addicts, but acting like giving patients are in pain appropriate painkillers directly leads to their demise is bullshit.",1498867241

They said each brownie / krispie square was for 2-3 people.   So, looking forward to my experience - I opened the vaccum sealed bag and took out a square.

The square was about 2 inches by 2 inches.   I cut it into quarters.   I then ate 1 quarter.  It tasted like a rice krispie pine scented air freshener - it was definitely not delicious.   After about an hour, nothing was happening so I ate another quarter.   after about 2 to 2.5 hours I couldn't move.  I crawled to my bed, and was paranoid that I was going to stay like this forever.  It wasn't pleasant at all, and I wanted it to stop, but I knew it wouldn't.

Mormons were persecuted right as they arrived in Missouri.  The attack of Mormon vigilantes on the non-Mormon towns was in response to rumors that anti-Mormon mobs were forming in the towns.  Not to justify the burning of the towns, but you can't tell me that the Mormons acted violently without fear of being attacked by anti-Mormon mobs and that their fears weren't legitimate due to years of persecution at the hands of anti-Mormon mobs.

Apparently you haven't read the order.  Allow me to show you the relevant passage:

&gt;The Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the state if necessary for the public peace

I am astounded at how unwilling you are to change your perspective over sheer facts of history that come as an inconvenience to you.  You're sort of like a TBM.  I would advise you to take a pause at this point, go back and read some US history (readily available online), and particularly Mormon history.

I finished the last mission of it on a friends PS4 slim where it had none of those issues, and started a new game plus on my pro with boost mode off-- seems better but I haven't played nearly enough to give you a definitive answer whether or not boost mode messes it up-- however it certainly doesn't seem to hurt turning it off.

I enjoyed the game, however i don't think i enjoyed it for 60 dollars and a permanent download haha. The story isn't great but the gameplay is fun as hell. Frame rate isn't steady, but it's tolerable. Enjoy ",1498867243

-naruto forgave obito for killing his parents he even called him cool

-everybody forgave Kabuto pretty quickly they even let him be the head of the orphanage of the same village he tried to destroy 

-sasuke tried to kill naruto a couple of times too and he still forgave him,

-karin forgave sasuke for stabbing her immediately after she saw him again 


-orochimaru is a free man, even though he killed the 3rd and the other kage (gaara's dad?)

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","I don't think there's any basis to the idea that the Three-Eyed Crow isn't Bloodraven but for anyone who does, there's similarities between Bloodraven and the Lovecraft story ""The Whisperer in Darkness,"" which can be read [here](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/wid.aspx).  I am fairly sure it's a deliberate reference as GRRM uses it verbatim to describe Bloodraven. ASOIAF is full of Lovecraft references.            

&gt;After the bone-grinding cold of the lands beyond the Wall, the caves were blessedly warm, and when the chill crept out of the rock the singers would light fires to drive it off again. Down here there was no wind, no snow, no ice, no dead things reaching out to grab you, only dreams and rushlight and the kisses of the ravens. And **the whisperer in darkness**.       

Summary:    
A sceptic is lured to the countryside by the letters of an old professor, who claims there is a race of ancient non-humans living in the hills. They are harassing him and killing his guard dogs, using human agents. The professor and the sceptic exchange letters.  

&gt; I think they mean to get rid of me because of what I have discovered. There is **a great black stone** with unknown hieroglyphics half worn away which I found in the woods on Round Hill, east of here; and after I took it home everything became different. If they think I suspect too much they will either kill me or take me off the earth to where they come from. They like to take away men of learning once in a while, to keep informed on the state of things in the human world.     

The weird black stones in ASOIAF are also references to Lovecraft.    

The professor has a change of heart and invites the sceptic to his home, and to bring all the evidence with them (he's not very bright.) ""He writes that he has met with the extraterrestrial beings and has learned that they are peaceful. Furthermore, they have taught him of marvels beyond all imagination""     

&gt;Wilmarth arrives to find Akeley in a pitiful physical condition, immobilized in a chair in darkness. Akeley tells Wilmarth about the extraterrestrial race and the wonders they have revealed to him. He also says that the beings can surgically extract a human brain and place it into a canister wherein it can live indefinitely and withstand the rigors of outer space travel and shows proof to Wilmarth. Akeley says he has agreed to undertake such a journey and points to a cylinder bearing his name. ... Wilmarth feels a vague sense of unease, especially from Akeley's odd manner of buzzing whispering.    

&gt;During the night, a sleepless Wilmarth overhears a disturbing conversation with several voices, some of which are distinctly bizarre. Once all is silent, he creeps downstairs to investigate. He finds that Akeley is no longer present, but the robe he was wearing is discarded in the chair. Upon a closer look, he makes a horrifying discovery amid the folds of the robe which sends him fleeing      

It is revealed that the titular whisperer in the darkness was not who he claimed to be --his consciousness had already been transferred-- but an ancient unfathomable entity, Nyarlathotep.    

There are parallels to be made between the creatures' use of consciousness transferral and interplanetary flight and the Childrens' skinchanging and Bloodraven's talk of flying.

What's helped my skin the most is the addition of hydrating toners, Benton's Snail Bee Essence (this shit can cure redness practically overnight, I swear!) and gentle cleansers. Having healthy skin is imperative to control acne. So many treatments I've used damaged my moisture barrier...

I recently posted a B&amp;A to r/AsianBeauty if you're curious, but my skin has really transformed. Having acne is more embarrassing with the severe redness/scabbing than with healthy, plump skin and some bumps. My fine lines have reduced as well!!",1498867250

De g√•r ganske langt i √• antyde at det var et bestillingsverk, men har politiet i Oslo hatt tradisjon for √• dysse ned ting? Selv i den fam√∏se reportasjen til Anders Magnus satt jo politiinsperkt√∏ren nesten og jatta med p√• de h√•rreisende p√•standene til Magnus. Politiet har jo ofte en interesse av √• sette fokus p√• problemer s√• de kan f√• de midlene de trenger.

N√• skal ikke jeg si at politiet pleier √• overdrive ting. Tvert imot, syns jeg spesielt politiet her p√• Stovner er flinke til √• si ting som det er uten √• la seg rive med av medienes mas om ""svenske tilstander"". Og den politirapporten om parallellsamfunn har jeg lest, og den stemmer godt med mitt inntrykk av situasjonen her innerst i Groruddalen. Det betyr ikke at det som st√•r i notatet til HRS ikke ogs√• stemmer. Jeg kjenner ikke like godt til milj√∏et p√• Gr√∏nland, men det kan godt v√¶re milj√∏er der nede som oppf√∏rer seg s√•nn uten at det betyr at vi har parallellsamfunn i Oslo og s√•kalte ""svenske tilstander"". 

Til slutt vil jeg bare si at man ikke m√• la seg forlede til √• tro at HRS er en seri√∏s akt√∏r bare fordi de har et fjongt navn og skriver edruelig. De er konspiratorisk anlagte og har en ensidig agenda. Det er ikke l√∏gn, men veldig tydelig spinn, s√• ta alt de skriver med en solid dose salt.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Ok, I'll bite. In reverse order: 

1. 'Powerful'. Define 'power'. If you mean it to be the ability to end life on earth with nuclear weapons the US is merely co-equal with Russia. If you mean conventional military power the US, in the past 50 years, has managed to have its arse basically handed to it by those titans of conflict, Afghanistan, Iraq and Vietnam. You appear to be a rank above Grenada and Haiti, granted. If you mean diplomatic power I'm afraid the civilised world is growing to loathe you, and withdrawal from the Paris accords has actually made you an international pariah. The US is a paper tiger. 

2. 'Liberal'. The US incarcerates more people on any other country on earth, by a large factor, even though it has 1/5 of the population of China, or India, and half that of Brazil. Those incarcerated are disproportionately from ethnic minorities. This is done to disenfranchise the populace and to make private corporations money. The US is also virtually unique amongst western nations in refusing to see healthcare as a human right. The US runs a massive spying operation on its own populace. In virtually every facet of governance the US is by far the most authoritarian and right wing of the developed nations. The idea that the US is a well-spring of liberty is, on its face, a hollow, disgusting joke. 

3. 'Democracy'. The US is not a democracy. Two of your past thee presidents failed to secure a majority of votes cast in their first election. In addition, in the former case the election was effectively stolen when a right wing media organisation falsely called an outcome early on the instruction of the candidate's team, who then went on to obstruct recounts; in the latter case the candidate colluded with a foreign power to influence opinion and, possibly, voter rolls and, possibly, votes. Your representatives are a joke, voting how their _donors_ wish them to 95% of the time whilst failing to implement policies they not only campaign on but that also have broad support in the country, where rational gun control (for instance) has an approval rating of 80%+. Corporate lobbying aided by Citizens United has left the US awash in corruption and bribery, and to top it all off your congressional districts are grotesquely gerrymandered, producing bizarre, anomalous borders in an effort to ensure the continued over-representation of a party, the GOP, who have long since stopped even pretending to serve the people and are flagrantly there purely to serve the power of money. 

And to top it all off, because in general you pay virtually no attention to, or travel to, the rest of the world, you have no idea how anomalous this all is, or how shocking it is to people from Candada, France, Germany, the UK etc. You're a frog in boiling water, blindfolded, with it's fingers jammed in it's ears, screaming 'USA, USA, USA...' 

The rest of the developed world can see this clear. as. day.

After that I followed a post on Alan Zucconi's blog ""A gentle introduction to shaders in Unity3D"" which was really helpful to learn about vertex and fragment shaders, next it's just following Unity &amp; Nvidia's documentation on the  CG Library. As mentioned below catlikecoding also has some good tutorials on a lot of topics, but I mainly used Alan's tutorials to jump right in. Might revisit catlikecoding's tutorials in the future.

 | TV standard |PC standard

color saturation range| 16 - 235 | 0 - 255

"nintendo","t5_2qhnk","Would be great. I read the european version uses the US 60Hz NTSC ROMs, too. That's great because the PAL versions of the games did run slower and some were poorly adjusted to the 50Hz PAL TV mode.

Even on PS2 there were many games that did run too slower (there was one game where one time trial couldn't be beaten) and were poorly adjusted. Final Fantasy X PAL was horrible! I chipped my PS2 and bought almost only US versions of PS2 games (also, the backs of the cases looked better, on PAL versions they used the same font black on white for every games). 

And my SNES got a 60Hz switch so the games did run better and uses the whole screen. But when they really used the US roms, then wouldn't the games be in english only? Only the PAL roms had multi language, I think.

Games like FF6 (3) and Super Mario RPG were never released in europe on the SNES. Mario RPG got a VC release, bt I don't know if it was localized. But Nintendo translated FFVI vor the GBA and could use these texts.

I laid out a fairly lengthy post of things I thought were both right and wrong with the game. The fact that Stormblood has as much wrong with it as it does (still a great game, but certainly has shortcomings) and still receives a 9.2 inherently detracts from the coherence of any ranking scale of that website.

The 7.5 number is a more realistic estimate based on the fact that a 10/10 would be a perfect game, a 9.2/10 would be a nearly perfect game, and Stormblood simply is NOT a nearly perfect game. Still very above average (5/10 = average)

You are experiencing outrage and frustration and a wish to just *do something*, which is completely understandable and admirable. But what you may not realize is that all the women you know experience this and just don't talk about it. 

She is sharing her feelings about it with you, so your first priority is to validate her feelings and help her process them as best you can. Ask her how it made her feel, express how it makes you feel to hear about it. Reinforce for her that you think those behaviors are wrong. 

Yes, if you think something should be done, you can say so. But don't expect that just because you think something should be done she's going to agree with you. She's the one with the vagina, let her lead on deciding what's an appropriate response for her to take. Just be there and support what she decides. 

I was in my 30s before I really learned what women experience in their ""normal"" day to day life. Truly, some men are pigs. It was really upsetting for me, and I wanted to *do something*. The best thing you can do is be an ally, go walk when there's a women's march, and if you catch your buddy doing something rude to a woman then say something. ",1498867265

"occult","t5_2qhmc","&gt;An article from this sub said that evil spirits hang out over bars and wait for people to drink enough to scare off their souls, also know as black out

This is similar to what I believe, but what I believe is slightly different.

Alcohol (and certain other drugs) attracts a lot of negative entities. I wouldn't call them evil spirits, negative entities is a better term for it.

I believe that if a person has a serious addiction at the time that they die, like an addiction to alcohol, their spirit has trouble passing on and they hang around this plane looking for drunk people to latch onto. They don't cause the blackout drunkness, the alcohol does that, and they don't scare off your soul or ""possess"" you like in the movies but they do latch on to you and feed of your drunk energy. Other, non human entities also like to latch onto drunk people. The same goes for drugs like meth.

I am using alcohol and meth as examples because these are substances that I see being used a lot in my community and have had my own experiences with, weed is another substance that is used a lot in my community but doesn't seem to have the same negative entities attached to it. I have actually experienced very loving, positive entities on weed. I have experienced negative entities on weed, but they don't seem to be attached to the drug itself. It seems that they were already attached to me and the weed just opened my mind up enough for me to notice them.

Alcohol isn't always bad, but you need to be careful. There have been times when I have had a few drinks while in a positive mind-state, and had conversations with myself. I will ask myself questions and immediately the answers come to me. Whether these answers come from my subconscious, my higher self or somewhere else, I don't know. What I do know is that my mind is opened up in a way that it usually isn't when I am sober and I am able to see things from another perspective or find answers to questions that wouldn't usually occur to me.

I haven't really had any bad experiences with meth personally because I never really got into it. Just tried it recreationally in my younger years but not enough for any entities to latch on. However, people close to me have had issues with meth and they have some very dark entities attached to them. The dark entities want them to keep using. It's really sad because these dark entities are quite strong, just like the addiction, and I feel that I can't help the people that are effected.",1498867266

I was in the same boat as you, I had similar fetishes from over consumption of pornographic material - yeah i had the tentacle one, and a fetish for monsters raping women and shit. Absolutely awful stuff.


I decided like you that I wanted to make a change. So 35 days ago, I quit porn cold-turkey. That's it, I'm completely /r/pornfree. Slowly but surely, I feel my lewd fetishes disappearing. I'm now turned on by the slightest shit, even seeing promiscuously dressed women (read: pretty much 90% of women in the west in summer) sets me off now.


Porn desensitizes you, staying away from it brings back your arousal sensitivity. It resets your biological arousal so to speak. Just quit it, and you'll get better.


Once you're porn free for longer than you can remember, you won't even remember how or why you were attracted to that shit in the first place.",1498867269

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

&gt; ...you have to spend a lot of time reading wiki pages, forums, guides etc.

Exactly. It takes effort. If you don't want to put in the effort then you won't come up with a build. Maybe that's lazy, maybe it's not. Either way it's something you have to do if you want to make a that you think is successful.

Also, in reality POE has very strong language describing it's different interactions. These can be easy to miss if you are inexperienced at build design. E.g ""Increased damage"" vs. ""More damage"". If you mouse over any active skill gem you can see exactly which mechanics affect it. If you go to the wiki article for any given unique item or skill gem 9 times out of 10 any special interactions are listed there.

&gt; In my view, there are so many unnecessary noob traps and trash tier gems that I really do not blame people for giving up on build experimentation. E.g whats up with Ice spear? Incinerate? Elemental hit etc.

You can make viable builds with all of those skills. Seriously. Probably for close to nothing too. Will they 1 shot shaper? No. But that's okay.",1498867272

"wow","t5_2qio8","Let's see how well my memory holds up over 12 years.

**Burning Crusade:**

* Introduced Flying

* A new way to make quests with Daily Quests and daily hubs.
* Karazhan was a good introduction to raiding for a lot of people and got them interested in perusing more.
* Formatted the raid size
* Changed how Combat stats worked.
* Hard end game 5 man content with the heroic dungeon. (WTF you mean I have to cc 5 mobs to kill one at a time?)
* Nagrand.
* Arena system and seasons .
* Revamped of the honor system with new BG.
* Isle of Quel 
* 2 new races and 1 new class per faction.
* [Very fulfilling Attunement](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CA3MPMvUYAAJ34z.png) - Know a lot of people hated this and should of been account wide for alts but, I used to play EQ PoP and loved it.
* First attempt at intended World PvP area's and outdoor Battleground with Halaa.
* Day one trying to get through the damn portal!
* Last but not least Jewel Crafting.

BC will always be the Hardcore players dream expansion. Challenging content with skill and knowledge checks abound but, like in vanilla the mass majority of the players didn't see the end content. BC let us soar through the skies only for us to land at those damn daily quest hubs.


**Wrath of the Lich King:**

* Brought raiding to the masses and opened the content up to everyone. 
* Introduced the Phasing mechanic allowing the world to evolve as we progress.
* Achievements!
* Removal of Weapon specializations 
* Continued on and ended the story-line from Warcraft 3 and allowed us to fulfill our dreams as RPing as Arthas.
* Hero system added to allow us to skip the leveling process.
* Ulduar still stands to this day as being the best raid made. Allowing guilds to increase the difficulty of various bosses to increase the loot and also, to unlock the first ""Hidden final"" boss. 
* Progress with in game cinematics allowed us to see more of the story unfold in-game with quest's such as the Wrath-gate.
* Looking for Group function added to allow players to seamlessly click a button and instantly(if you were a tank) enter a dungeon only to either A) rage quit out because of your groups wipes B) Spend 30 minutes longer than needed to clear it with a repair bill or C) Instantly leave and get deserter if it was Occulus or Halls.
* Attempted very hard to add Vehicle combat to the game and make it a staple.
* Multi-person mounts.
* Dual Specialization
* Level skills on level up instead of a Trainer.
* Revamped old Raids Naxx and Ony.
* Armor Pen
* Wintergrasp
* And who could forget inscription.

* And Gearscore cause fuck Gearscore.

Wrath of the Lich King was never more popular and will never be as popular as it was then. Literally, everyone you knew and their mother played the game. For the first time with all the new added features; All players of various skill levels had access to content if they wanted to peruse it. All raids could be completed with just a handful of friends and guildies. With solo content also being fleshed out with Phasing system and new in-game cinematic it's no shock as why so many look back on it as their favorite expansion. Though I think it's best we don't take the glasses off so we won't have to  remember the year of no content drought, Gearscore, etc. lol

**Cataclysm:**

* Revamp of the entire Azeroth updating every nook and cranny got a fresh new coat of paint and a redesigned quest to go with it.
* Class redesigns as well as a Stat redesigns.
* Normalized the Raiding structors allowing for 25 man and 10man (with the same mechanics with 1/2 the cd's as 25man)
* Flying in Azeroth.
* Return of Challenging 5 man content (Least for a few days)
* Guild system redesigned allowing progression and rewards in your guild.
* Have group will Travel and Mass Rez.
* 2 new classes.
* Reforging
* Rated BG systems
* Added new style of Raiding - LFR aka, Afking while 20 other people kill the boss simulator!
* 4 revamped Dungeons/Raids - (Deadmines, Shadowfang Keep, Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman)
* Having the ability to switch between 10 and 25 man content in raid.
* Lot's of new Race/Class combinations
* World PvP hub of Tol Barad and associated World PvP.
* Who could forget Archaeology

Cataclysm did what the expansion needed to do. Azeroth was 6 or 7 years old and it was showing. Cataclysm was an entire MMO face lift with content added on it. While I love Cataclysm for what it was and what it did, I always think about all the Original content cut from Cata. Because it was such a demanding task and needed to be done we lost some major story-lines.

"Screenwriting","t5_2qupf","the credit/karma system was tried (triggerstreet before it shut down) and I just don't think it works well enough, like you said the feedback becomes biased or tit-for-tat. You'll have to come up with a new system people haven't tried yet.

Also the issue of people's feelings, and rating the script based on the writers effort and good intentions (hey pretty good for a newbie! versus how far from professional quality). Maybe we need a more structured way of responding than just free form notes. 

I also am not a big fan of full script reading, if the readers in production companies seem to know in 15 pages, and Scriptnotes gets a good sense of flaws/strengths in 3 page challenge.... I think the slog of an entire script is just unnecessary. Makes people (rightfully) skim and half-ass it, because honestly no one should be reading a random strangers 90 pages for free. 

I think it's right and fair for blacklist to pay their employees good wage for two hours of focused brain time. I'd never ask a programmer to fix my laptop for free or a med student for free medical care, I think writers in training should start seeing themselves with the same professionalism. 

Perhaps it should be a cumulative cycle, where all new writers begin with writing and critiquing scenes, then sequences, etc until the very end you can swap a full script of work with a peer? 

Also, on the reading side, if there could be a button you press as you read to show how attentive you feel (cool versus chore) as you scroll pages, to create a sort of 'heat map' of which areas are losing people. I don't know if this is hard to implement. 

Perhaps lurkers who aren't part of the writing/credit system can partake in reading any public pages and thereby give 'feedback' with their eyeballs and time. 

At the very least, an ""I Just Don't care anymore"" button so in aggregate the writer knows when people stopped reading. If you realize 15 lurkers all seem to lose interest in your second act, that may be way more convincing than the most polite 'notes' from any one person.

Quantitative feedback needs to be a strength here, not just a medium for connecting human labor and attention. Hard to get defensive with aggregate numbers....

 Hmm, I'm trying to think up what structures could work, but unfortunately I lack the scope of what's trivial and what's too complex to program. I mean, this project is just you working in your spare time, right?

"Aquariums","t5_2rc6i","Nice! Trick it out with some RGB LEDs and you've some drool worthy life support for the YouTube folks. ;) Really glad active media beds are finally getting manufactured for high volume hobbyist applications. 

Just as an aside: What are you using for mechanical filtration? ""Not-Kaldnes"" is great stuff for simple high-load applications to straight sludge but if you've fine enough mechanical fluidized sand is significantly more efficient in standard commercial applications, you'll end up with a higher surface area thus filtration capacity and it's cheaper to replace. Same frictional forces work to prevent biofouling plus mild Van der Waals force will help with fine particulate matter(not to the degree of activated carbon but it makes a visible impact). 

Only tricky thing can be balancing your system to get a stable flowrate through the vessel but build a system with this in mind and you should be golden. With that in mind, even industry professionals will sometimes avoid using super-fine aggregate in fluidized beds due to the risk of blowing out your media into the system(no risk in your filter).

Excited to see this build come together!",1498867275

It was tried in bf4 and bf3 in leagues such as ESL, yet 10v10 and especially 8v8 had more traction. I think 5v5 is too few to work well and 8v8 and 10v10 could more effectively utilize the base battlefield has set for itself. Although gun balance and game modes don't really work well at the moment, frontlines has some potential as a competitive game mode imo if tweaked specifically for competitive. Although the battlefield franchise in itself has never really been ""competitive"" and at the very least, special balance and game mode tweaks would be needed to make it work decently.",1498867275

This is a quote from /u/AviatorMoser 

""iFly 737 NG was the first to implement an Active Sky Next radar. It was first to implement fail-operational autoland autopilot for catIIIb approaches. It also has windows that open in the cockpit for nice days on the tarmac.

It supports multiple types of legs including Arc to Fix which is required in some approaches and arrivals. It also includes full models of the:

 - 600
 - 700
 - 700ER (for transoceanic flights)
 - 800
 - 900
 - 900ER
 - BBJ
 - BBJ2
 - BBJ3

These models can be customized as well. Different panels. EFIS/ND or PDF/ND. Honeywell or Collins MCP. HUD or NO HUD. Short field performance package or not. You want winglets or no winglets. Which CFM56-7B engines do you want installed? Classic CRT MFDs or LCD? Automatic reduced thrust after takeoff? Integrated or standard standby flight displays? Takeoff bump thrust or no? 

And it's cheaper. VC is fantastic too. http://i.imgur.com/7Fu0w1k.png

That is what I know that separates the two.

It's panel save function isn't as automatic as PMDGs.

As for the rest, I think both share the same functionality. Both have failures. Both have FS2Crew support. TOPCAT support. PFPX support. Navigraph support. I can't really think of anything systems that separates the two. I think PMDG has lateral route offset and RTA. I know the iFly does.

But the PMDG must be better, because...because PMDG.""

They're pretty wide, perhaps realistically so, but ease up for games sake, and sometimes even see right behind themselves which shouldn't ever happen even if it would make sense with their heads rotated 90 degrees (which one can't do). Plus the game doesn't account at all for what the guards are supposed to be looking at, so even if they're looking down at a device, they still see 30 feet ahead of them. You distract them with a coin or weapon and when they bend down, somehow their ability to see around and ahead of them actually _increases_. It would be great and way more intuitive if their view cones narrowed according to what they were focused on and such. Bonus points if when guards engage in lengthy dialogue, their concentrations are actually more on one another, allowing you to sneak past instead of waiting out the entire conversation.

EDIT: Oh yeah, and their view cones don't even seem to be in sync. I've thought a few times that it seems like they lag behind where their heads are actually facing. Then to make it worse if they catch a glimpse of you they start facing your direction, which pisses the hell out of me... you either saw me or you didn't man!

Previous Diamond players drop down to Plat, Plat to Gold and Gold to silver. This is both true and untrue depending on your elo placement. If you were high Gold or High Plat, chances are your elo would be in low Gold or Plat. In your scenario the play were matched in Peaked in Low-Mid Plat and the Season reset placed him in Gold. Another reason you are fighting him is maybe he lost some matches and dropped to gold. Who knows? 

But instead of saying, ""Why am I matched with a Plat?"", consider this:
""Maybe I'm good enough to challenge Plat?""

Brawlhalla Matchmaking is weird, but don't let a rank border scare you. ",1498867281

It can get really spooky out here at night. Hooting owls, shrieking foxes, screaming rabbits, breaking branches and especially when coyotes start singing...

And that's just nature. People are constantly popping off guns here, sometimes after 2am. Sometimes they will set off what sound and feel like explosive charges or shells that shake the whole house. We also get some monster thunderstorms. And then there's the one creepy neighbor kid...

"GradSchool","t5_2r4r8","Basically, look into the programs you're looking to take for grad school - or what programs offer what you want to do, if you don't have a specific program in mind - and then look around at different schools that offer those programs. Different schools sometimes have different requirements to get in (such as different GPAs, different prerequisites, etc.) so you'll want to figure out which schools you're going to apply to down the road so that you complete the proper courses (especially if they require courses that are not mandatory for your undergrad, so you might otherwise not think to take them). Aside from that, there's not much else to do now, because you're still a first year student; what you want to do down the road may change over time, so don't set yourself in one specific path. You can look around at programs and schools and work toward them, but keep an open mind; you don't want to be the person in fourth year stressing out because you've worked toward getting into a specific program at a specific school, but want to go somewhere else for something else completely.

Over the course of your undergrad, think about what courses you're taking that you enjoy, what concepts interest you, so that when you get toward graduating, you not only know where you want to go, but what sort of research you want to do. Also speak to your professors often, especially in the later years, because you'll want good references when you apply to grad school, and they can also help provide some insight into the schools, programs, or potential research you're considering; don't just talk to them about grad school, but school in general, because the more profs you have as 'friends', the more options you have to get positive references. When I applied to grad school, I even got the Vice Dean as a reference, because I had communicated with her often enough during the course of my undergrad. Another thing to consider is participating in work related to your education, whether it be at the school or outside the school, because that experience will also look good when you apply to grad school.",1498867282

I knew that my wallet was in there and I didn't bother taking it out because my dad was paying and I don't know I just trusted the guy enough to not steal from me, I guess. He bagged our stuff pretty poorly, with the majority of the stuff in my bag (with the wallet) and like two items each in the bags my dad brought. I thought that was weird but chalked it up to him being a bad bagger or something.

I get home and take my wallet out and see that one of my credit cards at the top of my wallet is missing, which was easy for me to notice because I had organized my cards in a color gradient way. Then it all made sense why he had spent so much time trying to put all the shit in my bag, because he was trying to be all sneaky and steal my card! I felt like such an idiot for not being distrustful enough to take my wallet out of the bag, but lesson learned, I suppose. Never assume the good in people T__T",1498867287

Now anything can be passed as news for ratings, if you don't know that Fox and conservative media does the same shit, you're in for a surprise. Now we have absolute shit like Fox, Cnn, Breitbart and even InfoWars presented as ""news""

The media is a result of Republicans policies to not give equal coverage. If they did we wouldn't have this us vs them thing going on in the media, people tend to be liberal if presented the full story (liberal in the classical sense)

When you perform the same litmus test with Asian Americans against Asian countries, blacks against African countries, and Hispanic/Latinos against Mexico/South America, the same holds true. It's not an apples to apples comparison when you evaluate a highly heterogeneous country against mostly homogeneous ones. There's a laundry list of areas where the American educational system needs to improve and I applaud that Americans typically very open to critically evaluate themselves. But the truth of the matter is that ethnic and cultural backgrounds have a huge impact of education. Don't believe me?

"paydaytheheist","t5_2t0hx","Absolutely. I also think stuff like walk-in closet, helmet popping and other shared perks should've been made defaul for all players by now. It would require rework of point gaining system though, i suppose.


about mechanics:


&gt;Crew Chief


Maybe make into reverse underdog perk deck? You and your team gain some bonuses when you grouped up close and other bonuses when you alone. Or add more effects to screams\calls, kinda like basic inspiration increasing movement speed, but with different bonuses. Maybe screaming at other players regen their health or armor a little?


&gt;Ex-pres, grinder, biker


I think those could just use some tweaks to numbers, otherwise they okay? Just have my doubts about biker and maybe would be intresting to see grinder scaling itself to armor you use, regenerating less if you in heavy armor.


&gt;Maniac


Need some more survivalability for players themselves tbh, not just for the team. As it stands now, it basically leaves you with no protection between fights?


&gt;Gambler


Idk, seems very niche pick but works. Maybe add something like combo system when you pick lots of ammo drops at once, it rolls a short small buff, like +2-5% armor or something. Maybe add ""bad"" buffs to the pool too, to make it feel more like a ""gamble""? Just don't make them strong enough or frequent enough.


&gt; Hitman, burglar


tbh i'd rework those into dodge decks, with hitman focused on giving dodge bonuses while sprinting and recovering stamina for kills\headshots\special kills. Imo this will also represent John Wick combat style from movie's pretty good - always on the move, etc.


and burglar focusing on crouched dodge and ""less likely targeted by enemies"" thing, if that mechanic works. I'm fine with burglar being stealth-only deck though.


&gt;Infiltrator, sociopath


I'd say both are okay-ish, but melee aspect is really confusing. I'm not sure if infiltrator is still as good as muscle\armorer in terms of EHP, and maybe sociopath could use some sort of ""overarmor"" mechanic, where you can stack more armor than your maximum allows as long as you kill someone in VERY close combat or when you rampage and kill a lot of enemies in quick succession(as reference to combo system of hotline miami).


&gt; Yakuza


I think yakuza should stay a dedicated berserker deck, but there is def some tweaks needed. Good start would be if effects could start when your health drops below 100%, not below 99%.


Also not sure where to put it, but would've been intresting to see more ""middle armor"" decks, like crook, benefitting from vests or CTV. Maybe giving special abilities, depending on what kind of armor you use, like, more grenades for HBV, or additional down for CTV or something like that.",1498867290
"audiophile","t5_2qmiy","Yeah, ""lossless is lossless"", as they say. Though it pains me for other reasons, the headunit in my car only plays WMA lossless (windows media) so I use that for some stuff. Lossless is lossless--even Microsoft crap. 

I assume EAC will convert into ALAC, though it will probably require a bit of setup. Alternatively, you can rip into FLAC or WAV and then use any other format converter. I imagine there's probably one built into iTunes. Either way, you won't be losing any quality in the transfer because, again, lossless is lossless.

"caps","t5_2rouz","to add on to what the other person said - he's not a particularly physical defenseman and he doesn't really need to be because his stick work and positioning are top notch. Like the other person said though, his speed has become a big problem since the injury, and with the way the game is moving he may quickly get left behind. He rarely makes ""mistakes"" but will get ""beat"" by quicker/more athletic players (i.e., his positioning and decisions are good, but he's just not physically able to make the play)

he's also lacks the puck handling skills to be able to drive play offensively - what this means is that he's great when he starts in his own zone at defending and deflecting shots, but he gets stuck there an awful lot because he doesn't break out very well

This is a pretty negative take, but i just feel that the game is evolving away from ""stay-at-home"" defensemen - i think if he regains a step after the summer and fully recovering he could bounce back and not struggle nearly as much in transition and if that's the case he would slot in decently as a defensive minded 4th D as his technical skills do allow him to compete with top forwards",1498867291

When you make a sharp turn, you simply lift and sort of pop a wheelie to make turning easier  All BOB models have a little knob near the front wheel that allows you to adjust if the stroller is not going completely straight. It's very easy to use. I bought my BOB when my kiddo was about 9 months old or so. He's about 2.5 now and I'm starting to notice pushing the extra weight, as he's a big kid. He probably weighs around 30 pounds now. Weight limit is 75 pounds but as they get bigger, it does get harder to push, especially with an incline. I lucked out and got a great deal on Amazon. Keep an eye on sales if you're looking for a higher end model. I definitely recommend the BOB brand. The kind with the optional swivel wheel is nice to use when you're walking, but you should always use a locked wheel when running. It makes it a lot easier to run with, and it's safer. ",1498867293

They made her out to typical popular chick but then they allude to her being attracted to Frankie and then suddenly she's pregnant with Allo's kid.

Now that's just offensive. The number of women's shelters has decreased, no new legal protection or methods have been introduced to combat abuse. Abortion has been progressively banned from state hospitals. Single pregnant women can't even go to the doctor in fear that their pregnancy may be SMS'd to their parents, even when they're past the age of 18. No legal effort has been made on the most important front in women's emancipation: economic independence. The list goes on and on.

I realized it was the differing sizes and colors. It just adds a little bit of variety to keep everything from looking so monotonous when looking at it all laid out. Very interesting.

Also, those trees... lol Showed them who's boss.

Yeah, the idea of the more expensive research was to force people to build larger bases with huge throughput, but it wound up feeling more like grinding than growing. Probably won't revisit the idea again unless I take the resources to a whole different extreme. I don't think the idea was flawed in conception, I'd just need to give it a lot more thought.

LE: On track list sync from fav - please fix the picture of every movie/tvshow thats get sync from account because they are all black.

Please add watchlist's/history support for trackt syn, they are missing.

Trackt it simple but has powerfull features that can help you to save lots of time on TV screen keyboard , in favorites you could make some aditional tabs in this order to have full suport of track.tv:
Progress - History - Collection - WatchList's (here will be watclist's from tracktv, yes you can have more than one and it will be beautifull if you can implement more than one list, i have 3 for exemple, tv series, movies , anime)

The parents shouldn't decide treatment, it is a *joint* decision between them and their physician... which brings me to...

&gt;A physician presents courses of treatments (along with the risks).

There are plenty of cases of physician abuse in the US. I can start bringing up cases if you'd like. This is (and should be more publicly) presented as one, since clearly the public isn't understanding.

The EU Courts are exceptionally brave in this situation, especially with the public upheaval. 

&gt;So is placing your faith in the government.

TIL ""the government"" (I'm not European) is always bad and should never be put faith in. Sounds to me like you're just a typical American that thinks government is always bad and makes wrong decisions, if I may stereotype this common trope in this thread. I don't have faith in any(thing/one) but God, but I will be objective when assessing an action - the EU courts made the right move.

Bulk commons/uncommons: $3 per thousand

Bulk rares: $.12 each

Bulk mythics: $.25 each

Non-bulk: those few walkers.  Valued at 70% of TCG low, not mid as on that site.

So:

$7.50 for the commons/uncommons
$10-15 roughly for the 100-ish bulk rares/mythics
$20-25-ish for the walkers 

For a total of about $40-ish if you can find someone who wants to move bulk.

I know it looks like a lot when you start adding up the nickle and dimes, but no one ever buys at that price for randoms, except for the few people who use them in decks.  If you want to wait around for months to move the sub $2 stuff individually (and pay shipping/selling fees) then you can get the 'actual' price, though that's not even the actual price since most sites like goldfish use TCG mid, instead of what they actually sell for, which is TCG low.",1498867301

    supported.push(Shortcut{id: 3, keys: quit_k});
    supported.push(Shortcut{id: 1.0 keys: quit_k});

Because as soon as you add the first item, the rust compiler says ""Aha! This is a container of `Shortcut&lt;i32&gt;`"" and then you try to put a `Shortcut&lt;f64&gt;` into it and all hell breaks loose. You *want* it to be a container of `Shortcut&lt;S&gt;`, but those don't exist. One practical reason they don't exist is that `Shortcut&lt;S&gt;` doesn't have a consistent size, so you can't allocate space for a bunch of them. The other is that the types of things needs to be determined at compile time and `Shortcut&lt;S&gt;` just isn't a type (this is where people start talking about ""higher kinded types"" and I start nodding like I get it).

Now that I've stated what I think the problem is, I should note that I don't know enough rust to be able to bang out a solution. You're welcome. But this looks like the sort of thing that ""trait objects"" can solve. First, you'd define a trait `S` for `Shortcut&lt;T&gt;` and then make a container of either `&amp;S` or `Box&lt;S&gt;`.

Comp also had nothing to do with why they lost. They had a 4.5k gold lead at 26 minutes. They then make bad decision after bad decision, which leads to C9 going from a 4.5k gold deficit to a 6k gold lead and killing the enemy nexus 6 minutes later. That is not due to comp.",1498867304

""With WONDER, it is a short exercise to attempt to confirm Wilper‚Äôs predictions. Examining U.S. adult mortality in the decade prior to Obamacare‚Äôs insurance expansion (2004-2013), the all-cause mean death rate for ages 15 to 64 is 310.4 people per 100,000. The rate is fairly steady over the decade, with a low of 306.8, a high of 313.5, and a standard deviation of 2.2. If extending taxpayer-sponsored insurance to 15 million people since 2013 has resulted in 21,000 fewer annual deaths, then the mean death rate should decrease from 310.4 to approximately 300.

Returning to the WONDER database for 2014-15 numbers, one finds the mean death rate is ‚Ä¶ 320.4. Well, that is unexpected. Since Obamacare provisions extended insurance coverage, the death rate has substantially increased, by more than 20,000 deaths per year.""

"gwent","t5_384zi","RNG in itself is core to every card game through card draws and in some cases through a coin flip to determine the starting player.

It's not neccessarily bad either since it forces the players to keep different outcomes in mind and play around them.

Now, here is the problem and where I disagree from your opinion. RNG is good if it's outcomes are foreseeable and the players are actually able to plan for multiple lines of plays.

Let me talk about Donar first as he is the epitome of bad design in your list. This card is never truly bad. Its outcomes can vary from discarding a very low value card to actually outright winning games because it discards an important bronze piece like Protectors, Spotters etc.

You say people have to play around the card to not get anything of value stolen. That is simply not possible. As the player on the recieving end this kind of RNG feels really bad because it is completely out of your control. You say it is ""skill"" to draw important cards. There may be a few things like discarding QG asap, but that are speial cases and it misses the point of why the RNG is bad. You are forced to play around a card that can completely mess with YOUR game plan. Something that is on the level of a gold card (RegisHV - who about to get nerfed because of his power to disrupt strategies).

Both players have to adapt? The SK player will laugh his ass off and the opponent feels bad because his win condition goes down the drain to something that is not even intended to be as disruptive. The design limits decks built around scaling cards.

I don't want to go on a tangent about how strong the ability would be without RNG or compare him to lock options of other factions, but his ability is the only one to outright win games.

-----------------------------------------------

Ge'els:

Just because you like a card doesn't mean it is good RNG. In this case RNG is somewhat acceptable because its outcomes are balanced around the advantages and disadvantages of the card itself. You lose quite a lot of value to improve deck consistency. Often times you play Ge'els when you have a pretty high chance to draw something useful. If you play him in a situation that you can't control then you are doing it wrong or are in a situation in which it's all or nothing - pray and play. The risk is on the player of the card and it is heavily controllable. It is gold and doesn't give you a default win because of a secondary effect.

----------------------------------------------

BTM:

Like Ge'els not the best example to make your point why RNG is good. The RNG part of this card is to make this card playable in situations in which are multiple targets. Alternatively you could add another rule like ""in situations of a tie target the longest standing summoned unit"".

---------------------------------------------

Harpies etc.:

Again somewhat controllable RNG. The delta of impact is rather narrow. Sometimes it matters and you get a bad outcome of spawns. As a player you should account for this RNG when you put the card in the deck. Yet it never really has the potential to outright win you the game.

--------------------------------------------

This text is somewhat incohesive, I am not used to writing longer posts - sorry. I might have lost my thoughts at some point.

A tl;dr would be:

Controllable RNG is good for a card game.
Potentially game deciding RNG is a no-go.
Good RNG forces players to prepare for different outcomes, bad RNG puts players in an unreasonable disadvantage without counterplay.

Harpies, BTM, Ge'els are okay

Donar is not",1498867308

When it comes to food, at some point a burger is a burger. I have never ever had the best burger hands down. I've had plenty of great burgers. I would never say I had the 1 meal above all, 1 meal to rule them all. Same goes for every other food. 


Not everyone agrees the food is bland. That's simply a fact. Some people are meh on it and some people think it's their best.

Price? Some things are very expensive and some things aren't. Fully depends on what you get. Down the street is a place that serves a chicken sandwich that's twice the price. Others give you a good amount of fries with the sausage in the same order.

Portillio's isn't the spot with the best food in all of Chicago. Of course there are plenty of other places. But when you got a family or group to feed and need a place to sit down, you go to Portillos. At work in the area, you go to Portillos and take your food back to your desk. 

Terms of speed? Depends on where you go. Do it at 12-2 and yeah it's packed. Go in at 4 and after and there are a lot less people. 

The menu is diverse and food consistent. 

This is versus going to a brand new place you know nothing about with a menu you know nothing about. Especially give the area of a few locations. It's either Portillos or a more upscale sitting joint. 

Obviously depends on where you go. I go to the one down town. I have never seen lines past 3pm. ",1498867310

FreshBooks generates the invoice (as well as other basic bookkeeping and project management functions), and the invoice has a big Pay Invoice button.

FreshBooks has a free plan, and Stripe takes a fairly standard fee (not sure how much offhand, but comparable to PayPal's) from each payment. ",1498867312

"GGdiscussion","t5_3a3as","Thinking about it more, maybe Sarkeesian should have done better in dealing with Boogie. Watching his video about it and realising the effort he went to to not offend her makes me wonder if she spent any time researching the people she was going to be on a panel with. If she had you'd think she'd have known Boogie wasn't a shitlord and would have given him the benefit of the doubt. I guess if she's being paid to participate it's not too much to ask for her to read up on the other people taking part.

&gt; But yes, the points you raise about Sargon are exactly why I describe myself as ""torn"". Like, he has a history of pulling these stunts, and I had previously believed it was a conscious tactic. But you are right - it shouldn't have taken him that long to realise his behaviour towards Green was over the line. So now I think there's a possibility that he has real difficulties understanding the emotional impact of his approach unless it is spelled out very plainly. Like, maybe he's a bit stunted in that area? That's what I mean by naive.

I think I didn't word that very well and gave the wrong impression. My take is that he knew from the start what he was saying was over the line and Laci Green breaking down in tears and imploring him to see how he was hurting her gave him the opportunity not only to back down without losing face but to seem like the big man gallantly comforting the little lady he'd spent months tormenting.

Like you say, it's a very clear pattern with him. I'm sorry if I gave the impression I thought it was anything other than a conscious tactic.

[We are doing something, and have been since Bush's last year in office](http://www.americanthinker.com/legacy_assets/blog/assets/Carbon%20emissions.61111jpg.jpg).  We are at 1996 level of emissions.  Despite the bluster over coal, unless we massively subsidize it to bring it in line with natural gas there's no going back that route.  Steel production would certainly increase coal usage (coal coke is kind of required), but for energy production it's basically a dead end.  Our emissions should continue to go down as states shutter coal plants and/or the market demands renewable energy.  All of this is WITHOUT the Paris agreement.

Meanwhile, [China intends to reach peak emissions on or before 2030](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/03/07/china-vowed-to-peak-carbon-emissions-by-2030-these-researchers-think-it-could-already-be-there/).  Seems great, except [they are also building coal plants in Africa](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/05/lamu-island-coal-plant-kenya-africa-climate/).  As their economy modernizes their 'cheap labor' is going away.  [They exploit Africa and SEA to continue that trend](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/chinas-investments-in-africa-whats-the-real-story/), and will destroy the environment in those country's names.

I think that was a purely emotional, ""Jon is going to fall into Ramsay's trap no matter what, I need someone to save me from Ramsay if Jon fails."" Littlefinger fulfilled that. 

This is a case of Sansa having just enough knowledge to be dangerous. She doesn't know anything about battles but she knows enough about this one (that Ramsay had too many men, that Jon's plan relied on them waiting for Ramsay to advance on them, that Jon was approaching this at least partially as a mission to rescue Rickon. And Sansa knows Ramsay really damn well and knew this was not going to go the way Jon thought it would. She is probably feeling really anxious and scared and pessimistic about their chances.

So we could very well see a dual Vega come out that will be absolutely amazing. Unfortunately, that will require more development time and better drivers since there are issues with CrossFire with Fury right now and I'm guessing Vega will have the same issues unless AMD actively fixes them.

"EDM","t5_2qm8v","Last year was my first ADE with Hexagon Label Night and Skyline Sessions, so I'll share my tips.  
I'd combine it, so go to AMF in the big venues (ArenA, Ziggo Dome, AFAS Live) on days that interest you, and follow your favorite DJ's social media so when they'll anounce their (potential) night you can put that on your agenda.  
I wouldn't go to the big venues all nights because I think being up close to a dj adds a lot to the feel of the night, instead of them being on a stage that's 3 meters high.  
  
The way ADE works is that you shouldn't look at the venues too much, and more at the host of the night.  
  
Lastly, some clubs are way too small for the parties they host, I was at Hexagon in the Jimmy Woo and I thought it was way too crowded. I was 2 meter from the DJ booth but I couldn't really enjoy it sometimes because of the massive amount of people trying to fit in a club. Keep that in mind if you don't like that.

I should like, for the sake of restoring the desired equilibrium, to take a part of the possessions of others. But this would be dangerous. Could not you facilitate the thing for me? Could you not find me a good place? or check the industry of my competitors? or, perhaps, lend me gratuitously some capital which, you may take from its possessor? Could you not bring up my children at the public expense? or grant me some prizes? or secure me a competence when I have attained my fiftieth year? By this mean I shall gain my end with an easy conscience, for the law will have acted for me, and I shall have all the advantages of plunder, without its risk or its disgrace!‚Äù

**Reporting the brokerage Robinhood to FINRA**
&gt;I use Robinhood as my stock trading brokerage. Once in the past I was flagged by Robinhood as a Pattern Day Trader (PDT) resulting in being restricted from making day trades for 90 days. I admit I was at fault for this; Robinhood also said I was indeed at fault. I called Robinhood and asked if there was any way they could waive the restriction. Their broker said they would waive the restriction as a courtesy, and they did.
&gt; 
&gt; Last week I was again flagged as PDT. This time I believe I was not at fault. Robinhood thinks I was at fault. I called Robinhood and asked if they would again remove my restriction. I knew it was a slim chance because they had already done it for me once, but I wanted to try.
&gt; 
&gt; I was surprised to receive an email from them saying it was 'not possible' to remove such a restriction. In the phone calls and emails that led up to this assertion, I received extremely rude customer service, including being hung up on. I know for a fact, from my previous experience, that if a broker contacts the clearing firm and asks for a client's PDT restriction to be removed, the clearing firm will remove the restriction. So to hear that it was not possible was strange to me.
&gt; 
&gt; I was finally put in contact with a Robinhood broker and he started our phone conversation with an extremely combative attitude. He condescendingly explained to me that for a brokerage to remove a valid PDT restriction was illegal and that ""no matter how much I begged and pleaded"" he would not contact the clearing firm and ask for my restriction to be removed.
&gt; 
&gt; I do not want to be a part of anything illegal. I feel that it is important to report the fact that my first PDT restriction, which Robinhood said was indeed valid, was removed by Robinhood, if that is indeed illegal as the latest broker said.
&gt; 
&gt; I clearly need to read up on the rules and regulations concerning PDT restrictions, but I would appreciate it if anyone here could *confirm that waiving valid PDT restriction is against the law, specifically FINRA regulations.* Part of me does not believe the broker that waiving such restrictions is actually against the law. I would also like to know what would happen if I reported these actions to FINRA. What consequences could Robinhood potentially face? How involved would I have to be in such a case? I do not want to be dragged into a lengthy legal dispute. I just want to do my legal duty so that I am not surprised by anything down the road.",1498867324

Even if you're in bad shape, psychological issues are MUCH more common in a 31 year old. If you can achieve an erection and orgasm every day, then it's psychological.

Other things that are really common in your age group:

* performance anxiety (fear of not getting it up can keep you from getting it up)
* neuro- and psycho-active drugs (anti-depressants, anti-anxiety meds, opiates, illicit drugs, alcohol)
* psychological distress (depression, anxiety, PTSD, physical or psychological abuse)
* porn addiction--watching weirder or more hard-core porn can make it so ""typical"" sex isn't arousing anymore 

Honestly, the issue you're asking about is unclear to me. Can you not get it up with a partner? But, regardless of your sexual function, I think you have a good plan in place to just be healthier. Your lifestyle is likely to shorten your life by 20 years. I would focus on exercising, losing weight, and sleeping, but if you are experiencing distress, I'd recommend meditation as well.",1498867326

"writing","t5_2qh2n","Either you're misreading me, or I expressed myself badly, and I'm sorry if it was the latter. My point is that defining a book as ""appropriate for book clubs"" is itself making a narrow-minded, stereotypical assumption about what a book club is and can be - assuming that they want contemporary non-genre fiction (or genre fiction that's lifted out of its category by the completely subjective ""quality writing"" and marketed as non-genre) that's deliberately written to facilitate ""thoughtful discussion"" by being ""accessib[le] to real life"". 

That was why I brought in the idea of book fandom as book club: they may deal with books that are not theoretically ""accessible to real life"" because they're set in other worlds where people are dealing with different situations (which usually still tie in to a universal humanity, anyway, but we're going with the infographic's idea of ""accessibility to real life"" here), but they may still discuss, to quote myself, *what the author was doing with this scene, why they chose that word, what's implied to have happened off the page, etc.* in exactly the same way as a stereotypical book club. Yes, in theory they may wander off into discussing fanfiction concepts or start theorizing about future events in a series or use less sophisticated/dispassionate vocabulary, but these are still people acting like a book club, generally with texts that are not considered ""appropriate for a book club"".",1498867330

"gigantic","t5_2rkwg","I've recently played a lot of Voden and gotten pretty good with him over the past few days to the point where he is presently my favorite hero.  I usually get 10-20 kills with &gt;20 assists and 2 deaths max.  Yesterday I won 3 games in a row with ~40 efficiency on Voden each time.

There are a few tricks I've learned that I can share, but honestly the biggest thing with Voden is practice.  He's a sniper (more of a midrange/utility sniper than a pure sniper like Imani, but he's still a sniper) and sniping takes good aim which takes a lot of practice.  Plain and simple the more you play him the better you will get as you learn to track and anticipate movement and just aim more steadily.

That said, here is an explanation of how I use and build Voden's  abilities and some tricks:

**Arrowed:**
Keep in mind that all the upgrades for Arrowed enhance fully powered up shots, so that's the majority of what you should be shooting.  Probably 99% of my shots in a given battle are fully powered up, there is almost never a reason to not do so.

1. **&lt; Dead Eye**.  When I first started playing Voden I would go with Spread the Pain since my aim wasn't great.  I think that's probably a good idea until you get comfortable aiming since near misses will deal *some* damage and not be completely wasted.  But once you are able to make ~40% of your shots dead on the extra 20% damage from Dead Eye makes a big difference, as well as the upcoming accuracy boost from...

2. **&gt; Longshot**.   Plain and simple: longer range, faster arrows, full damage at max range.  Even though as I said I take practically all my shots at max power, powering up doesn't really take that long so I find this upgrade path much better than Bow Flex.

**Poison Spores:**
With this build path this ability works surprisingly well for CC and deterring oncoming enemies.  When in a larger teamfight save your spores so you can splash multiple enemies at once (with Seeking Spores).  But don't be too stingy, the 13 second cooldown means you should be able to unleash your spores 2-3 times in a fight.  Spores also work wonders for discouraging oncoming lone enemies, when used properly this can help you avoid sure death from an enemy assassin. 

1. **&gt; Seeking Spores**.  The explosive nature of this ability's projectile form with Seeking Spores is really strong, it means near misses can still have some effect and can be quite a powerful CC weapon for weakening clumps of enemies.  I have turned the tide of several creature battles with this ability since it is so easy for enemies to clump up when defending a creature.

2. **&gt; Acute Poison**.  Again, when you are getting used to aiming with Voden it might benefit you to go for Hungry Spores (though their homing isn't anything super amazing, don't expect pure wild shots to magically find targets).  But spores is a little easier to aim since it is bigger and once you feel comfortable with your aim here definitely switch to Acute Poison, the extra damage and heavy poison make this ability *extremely* powerful.

**Green Man:**
There are two ways you can use this ability: as a ""get out"" to escape impending doom while throwing pursuers off your tail, or as a fighting machine in a push.  I prefer the former option since I like to hang a little closer to the battle and it allows me to stay in the fray a little longer and I feel I already have plenty of firepower with Arrowed and Poison Spores.  To use this ability for maximum effect you should flee right before the enemy is on top of you, run in a direction where there are two possible routes to flee by and fire your decoy down one fork while taking the other.  Remember, the decoy is an aimed ability, don't change directions until after you have released him, but make sure to turn immediately after to avoid being caught in fire aimed at the decoy.  When done right you should be able to escape pretty much any situation this way.

1. **&lt; Alternate Root**.  This allows you to teleport to the decoy by pressing the ability button again (destroying it in the process) but TBH I practically never use this since it kind of defeats the purpose I use the decoy for.  I just choose this path because the other path eliminates the stealth feature.

2. **&gt; One With Nature**.  Again, I never use the teleport functionality so nothing really to say here.

**Hidden Spring:**
This has got to be the most criminally underused of Voden's abilities, maybe of any hero's abilities!  Maybe because people don't associate heals with a sniper and forget he can heal too?  You should be using this ability as much as you possibly can, at any point in the game there is someone on your team who doesn't have full health.  It doesn't start out doing a whole lot, but it's still something and my upgrade path buffs it quite a bit.  You mentioned that allies often run away when you try to heal, which is true to an extent but it still does something, which is a whole heck of a lot more than not using it at all!

1. **&lt; Well Wishes**.  50% more healing means more healing, nuff said.  Additionally, the ability to cast a second spring at the target location means you can heal allies you aren't right next to as well.  Cast this on your melee teammates midst fight to help them last longer, cast it on allies fleeing a battle, cast it on allies charging the guardian, cast it, cast it, cast it!  Get used to its timing and with some careful placement you can anticipate your allies' movement and cast it in such a way as to maximize its effects even if they don't notice it and keep running. 

2. **&lt; Recovery Time**.  +1s lifetime means more healing, nuff said.  (If you are playing against a lot of debuff casters Spring Cleaning might be worth considering, but you can't go wrong with Recovery Time.)

**Natural Roots:**
The strategy here is pretty simple, try to catch at least 3 enemies in the AoE and save your focus for moments when it will make a difference and you have allies around who can clean up the rooted enemies.  Like most ults, Natural Roots is often most useful during a rampage.  The higher levels do make a big difference here (lv3 being twice the effect time at 4s than lv1 at 2s), so saving up focus is often worth it.  I usually don't unleash Natural Roots until at least lv2, though you do want to be a little more liberal first couple times after getting Focused Might.

**Hero Upgrades:**

1. **&gt; Tactical Awareness**.  More back armor is nice when fleeing, more damage from the back is nice when it happens.  What I'm really going for here is...

2. **&gt; Focused Might**.  +7% damage per focus use (max 2 stacks = +14%) is a moderately significant amount of damage and more damage is always good.

For the level 5 perk I use **#3 Spring Back**.  35% more healing and shorter cooldown means more healing, nuff said.

My general battlefield strategy for Voden is stay at a medium distance, not quite in the fray but not quite as far as Imani likes either.  As far as pacing goes stay behind your team on pushes and during offensive rampages, using Green Man effectively will allow you to cover your team's retreat and pull back last.  That said, be careful, you are a sniper not an assassin so don't recklessly charge after retreating enemies no matter how vulnerable they look, if you started at proper sniping range you will end up deeper in than Green Man can get you out of.",1498867331

"photography","t5_2qh2a","Your link is not working, but I'll take a guess. When you work with profiles, you can't just change the profile for a picture (as in simply assign another one), but have to transform it (not sure of the English name for that menu item, I'm using it in a different language).

If you only change the profile, the colour values stay at their same place, but the profile tells the program that displays it that they distributed in a way that adheres to a different set of rules (a different profile). 

If you actually transform the profile, the values get remapped to match the other profile. 

Basically, if one profile has the values for a colour distributed on values ranging from 1 to 25, and you then just assign a different profile to it that uses values ranging from 1 to 50, it will skew what the programs see. Before, value 25 was full 100% of the colour, but now any program looking at it will be told that a value is at place 25 out of 50. Meaning the programs are led to think that value is only half as high as it actually is. 

If you instead transformed the profile, the 25 will be correctly turned into a 50, and all other colour values will be translated to the new table as well.

The numbers I used are a made-up example, but that's how the system works.",1498867336

 **Nasus Q shouldn't cost any mana**

&gt;As we all know,  due to lack of mobility, hard cc and reliable damage, the only relevant scaling of {{champion:'Nasus'}}  is in stacking Q. It is that quintessential to his kit that his tankiness doesn't mean anything if he can't reciprocate enough damage at the same time. We have the same situation with {{champion:'Tristana'}}  and her Q, except I would argue that even without it she can dish out fine damage ( Kog Maw's W costs mana, Draven can drop axes and still crit for respectable damage etc.) yet {{champion:'Tristana'}}  gets to have a free of mana charge on it, while {{champion:'Nasus'}}  doesn't. Not to mention that {{champion:'Nasus'}}  struggles with high mana costs until first completed item (which is earliest at levels 8-9), let alone a (unproportionately short) mana pool.

In the context of choir, contagiousness should also be considered. Singing in a group while contagiously ill is extremely frowned upon and should be avoided at all costs.

Greetings Everyone,A new hotfix has been deployed to Pox Nora.  This hotfix is all server related, so PC, PS4, and Mac players will all get the benefits of this change.HotfixThe issue causing Custom Bot matches to occasionally stay on the loading screen indefinitely has now been fully isolated and will no longer occur.  This ended up being related to the system that allowed bots to use Player Decks.  For the time being bots will not use player decks until a new system can be implemented.All players will now correctly receive League Rewards when reaching a new league.  These rewards will appear as packs in the Marketplace Rewards section of the lobby when they are awarded.Daily and Heroic Quest will now properly give track progress and award the correct rewards upon completion for all players.The ability Rapid Growth will now correctly start on cooldown and will go on cooldown when activated.Note: All missed rewards from the League and Quest issues have not yet been retroactively rewarded.  We want to make absolutely sure these are 100% not happening for anyone before giving out any compensation.Steam Summer SaleThe Steam Summer Sale is still active until the 5th of July so make sure you pick up the Pox Nora Steam Bundles before they return to their normal prices.Discussion: http://forums.poxnora.com/index.php?threads/discussion-hotfix-june-30th-2017.27650/Enjoy!

1.  This year was his highest avg points ever, at 22.3, and his highest FGA of his career at 17.6.  He is actually getting more shots and points with Durant on the team as a #3 option .....Draymond is far from the #3, hell if anything most of the time Draymond is the 5th option on offense.

2.  He has said numerous times he doesn't want to be a #1 anywhere because winning is fun, and he doesn't think a team could win consistantly with him as a #1.

3.  He has said that when the Warriors run is over he is just going to retire to an island somewhere and just show up for reunions and stuff like that.  He doesn't want to play anywhere else, and he doesn't want any spotlight on him, he just wants to be and he just likes winning basketball games.  When the Warriors stop winning it is going to be too much of a hassle to go anywhere else. 

He is not your typical player, he doesn't really need nor want the $$$$ from being a 1.  He is actually a very weird, weird dude.  There is no way he has the personality to lead a team.  It's why 90% of his press conferences are with Draymond, it's cause he doesn't want to talk so he likes Draymond answering all the questions.

But the Ferengi were just not perceived by most people as being that threatening. I mean... laser whips? Shrieks of *""BETRAYAL!""* and *""AT NO COST?""* Small stature. Silly ears.

I don't remember the exact lines or anything but there is something about how Dumbledore responds ""sadly"" and realizes that Voldemort has once again decided to turn down changing his ways. That maybe he is ""too far gone.""

Then I remember Snape. He was a bad guy who did bad things to good people. But, Dumbledore still met with him, heard him out, and offered him forgiveness. Look what he did with his life. 

Every life is worth saving. You never know how people will turn out, what things they can accomplish, or how their lives may end up affecting others. 

I don't think he means that later actions could justify not saving someone. I think he means, you should always make the effort because there is a chance the person will change their minds and their ways. That's a chance worth taking. ",1498867354

nobody expects that anymore. china remains an ally on principle alone. any strain on that relationship and it will break, as for sk, yes. i concede there is a high possibility the country will be crippled  and many civillians will die.

as for softer targets who do the same, i dont think any are left, definitely saudia arabia and venezuela need cracked down on but looking at the bigger picture. 


1. NK is a big, old problem and they have never appeared weaker. the country is starving and the governent is in chaos, nobody truly knows but it's suggested the ruling classes are split in 2. kim has already removed 60-70 members but still appears to be struggling to hold confidence and respect. 

2. nk has made direct threats of nuclear warfare against western democracies very recently on numerous occasions.

3. time, there are grandchildren abandoned by grandparents who never knew freedom. generations have suffered. the humanitarian crisis is decades behind, who knows what effects that has on an inbred society (the gene pool is only getting smaller there.) the cost and method of psychologically healing these people is unfathomable, not in the sense of the cost but in the sense that this has never been done before. as i said before diplomacy hasnt worked and there are no signs if it working. do we wait another 50yrs for the potential fallout to go from critical to 'there is literally nothing we can do'. if the economy fails on 45yrs and nk is liberated in 50 how do you think the fallout will affect china then?

4. that shit shouldn't be tolerated. duertre should have been stopped in the early 00's, kim il sung should have been stopped...fuck knows when, 1945? and the sauds...well they are another story. kadrov need to be stopped killing gays (but thats a 'new' problem, diplomcy is  an option) and erdogan needs to be removed...but all those are minor and have other solutions wheras nk does not. it's todays problem, tomorrow something else",1498867355

"EliteDangerous","t5_2vi60","Jump right in and don‚Äôt look back. 

Frontier has created an amazing physical universe with superb visual and aural effects. Nothing compares. 

So too the ships fly well and combat is a delight. Many will rightly suggest to you get a hotas. That will help your experience greatly. I'm a PC pilot so I don't know whether PS4 is compatible with an off the shelf hotas or whether it has its own. Plenty of people use keyboards, mice, and gamepads just fine. 

The social and information resources in Elite are poorly developed, but the community has stepped in and provides virtually everything that Frontier doesn't. To start with, search on the web, the forums, reddit, and youtube. In addition, visit [Elite Dangerous Codex](http://edcodex.info/) for a comprehensive list of all the amazing tools out there. For a start, I‚Äôd also use the web-based tools of EDDB, INARA, Coriolis, EDBearing, and Wavescanner. You‚Äôll see what they are when you look them up. 

As a casual player you will find frustrating challenges. The description of Elite suggests a virtual world ‚Äî part sim, part game ‚Äî as a persistent and social cosmos. Elite is nowhere near that yet. Combat is the only fully fleshed activity, while exploring, mining, trading, etc. are still being built out. 

More worrisome for you are the time, credit, and reputation gates Frontier has erected for all but hard-core players. No ‚Äúgame‚Äù disrespects your time more than Elite. 

As a casual player you‚Äôll find it extremely hard to go beyond the second of three tiers of ships. Many people have quit because of the gates, including all of my friends. As in EVE, late adopters who are casuals are more or less second class citizens. 

That said, I‚Äôm a casual player too, and there are ways around this. 

One is to focus on getting the best second tier ships which can do much of what the third tier ships do. Focus on working up to an AspX (for transport and exploration), a Python (for trading and mining), and an FDL (for combat). You‚Äôll have a blast with these, be able to dock where Anaconda‚Äôs and other third tier ships cannot, and miss little of the game‚Äôs content. 

This does not mean you‚Äôll never get a third tier ship. I have some now. But it takes quite a long time. 

Another is patient pursuit of your goals. I consistently play an hour every day. I focused for my first two years on reputation and credit gains, and now I‚Äôm secure. Then I systematically engineered my ships. Then I built trading reputation in several bubbles. I did other stuff in-between to avoid monotony, but I was focused and organized. 

Still another is to avoid pvp. I came from running a combat oriented coalition in EVE. I love pvp. But in Elite it is expensive and a huge time sink even for the hard-core. Join Mobius for PS4 when you start, and fly there to avoid griefers. If you do pvp, be prepared to see your credit reserves dwindle rapidly as a casual player. 

In addition, grab every credit making opportunity as they arise. These are opportunities to bypass Frontier‚Äôs punishing restrictions because of how Frontier itself has designed the gaming aspects. Multiple planetary scan, massacre, and passenger missions are examples. Mode switching between open, solo, and a private group is another way to get multiple missions for delivery. 

Don‚Äôt engage in cheating of course. Don‚Äôt grind until your eyes bleed. But do look for ways to be efficient with your time. 

Finally, join one of the great wings like NULL, AEDC, and others. There is strength and wisdom in numbers. They will help you thrive. 

So do it. Don‚Äôt expect too much too soon. Be very patient with yourself. Take a break from the grind when you need too. And have fun!

Mara stared at the beach-goers in distaste. *I was hoping for a bit of peace and quiet in the sun, not this ruckus.* Her newly-borrowed swimsuit was a burgundy tankini top and matching swim skirt, accented with bows on the ties. Although it was far from the most immodest piece of swimwear on the sand, the girl looked uncomfortable, tugging on the hem of the skirt occasionally as if trying to pull it down further. Sirrus was sporting a unusually large set of black sunshades; how they stayed perched on his cloudy face was a mystery.

If you shoot at 25mm, then the slowest shutter speed you would use would be 1/25th.  50mm than slowest shutter would be 1/50th.

If you're shooting on a crop sensor, then you would apply the 1.6 crop factor to the shutter speed.

But now that i have better credit and a cosigner with me(spouse) im pretty sure i could get better terms. im not looking for another 20k-30k loan for 4-6 years. I wanted a used car thats affordable that can be paid of within a year or two. 

Like i mentioned i dont have the cash on hand to buy this car outright(or else id just pay off the note i have now). So if I was able to get a new loan with better interest and pay off my orginal loan then i would be able to benefit from another reliable car. POSSIBLY less money paid out over time if i was to keep just the one car note i have now.

But due to the helpful comments above i realize that might not be possible.

I'm not denying that the rebellions wouldn't have continued and the US wouldn't have been given independence anyway because as I said, if people don't want to be under your control your only to choices are to force them or let them go.

There was an issue at the end of his initial hellblazer run where it was his love interest (Kathy I think) returning to Ireland and it dealt with her relationship with her friends and family and it was great! Nothing mystical was featured and Constantine wasn't even in it. I must say I have learned a lot about Ireland and the IRA from his work as well; another thing that I like him incorporating his roots.

As for the boys, I agree with you on the dick jokes but I loved the whole series. I do like reading hardcore comics though, his punisher run is also stuff of legends. Not sure how far you made it in the boys but the twist at the end was fantastic.",1498867370

I'm actually Canadian but I assume in the story I'm an American. I had obtained the worst bladder infection after dirty traveler sex and then a freezing cold train ride from Romania to Istanbul Turkey. 

I didn't realize right away as I'd never had one and my friend told me ""it sometimes hurts to pee for a few days after sex with someone well endowed and then it just goes away.""  So I was on day three when I realized I needed some antibiotics,  seriously felt like razor blades.  

Well we're poor backpackers so I'm not going to the fancy hospital where tourists go,  I ask directions to the cheap one and off we go on the tram to find it.  About half way there I need to pee, if you've ever had a bladder infection you know that when I say that I mean NEED TO PEE NOW.  There is nothing around but a residential neighborhood.  I look outside for a business,  a bush,  anything.  There is nothing.  

I cross my legs, I did the shuffle,  I tell myself ""I can make it,  I can make it"" standing there on the full tram with everyone looking at the unusual sight of two blonde women.

Especially at the trade deadline... teams have consistently gotten less value from good players moved then, since there's usually universal knowledge that they want the player to be moved.

That being said, I don't think there's any downside at this point to at least waiting until free agency starts. But if they wait too long into free agency, I expect more options will close rather than open.

Is anyone exploring if the ""problematic"" part of this view is not the language, or identity, but a rejection of the presumption that a cis-gender must necessarily exist because the trans-gender does? To accept cis, one must accept trans. 

Please understand me, i am not looking to make any argument to the validity of a trans-cis gender. I mean to explore the idea that people will respond problematicly if they suspect there is some tacit or presumed conceit on their part they are not willing to make. Consciously or otherwise.

&gt; I wish the church would have a stance on global warming

Oh, I think that fits in line with church doctrine of personal responsibility and taking care of the Earth that was entrusted to us. However, I don't think the Church will make a statement on that topic since they try to stay out of politics (though they're obviously more involved than many would like, especially on LGBTQ+ issues).

I personally would support some progress on this front, though I'd attack it in a different way. About half of the emissions (last I checked) come from vehicles, so to encourage use of more efficient vehicles, I'd:

* have roads funded almost entirely from vehicle registration, the cost being related to the size of the vehicle (larger vehicles pay more because they damage roads more)
* increase gas taxes and use funds to build more green energy (fund solar panel credits, more wind turbines, etc) and improve cycling and public transit infrastructure to offset pollution from cars
* allow residents to sell excess solar power back to the energy company (I'm not sure forcing them to buy it is a good idea as that's produces problems in California, but the current net metering just isn't good enough unless we have it roll over year to year)
* start installing solar on public buildings

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","As a millennial, I agree with much of your post.

However, there are two points I'd like to make.

1) Wealth Accumulation -
Millennials on average make 20% less than Baby Boomers, work longer hours and are faced with enormous hurdles in order to buy starter homes and begin building equity in the real estate market. This is an economic issue that millennials were born into. It has nothing to do with hard work or decision making, just bad luck. Just to give you a first-hand example, my wife and I have worked full-time in our fields for 6 years, make about $120k combined and can't even come close to affording a starter home in the major city we live in. As an insult to injury, we exceed the income limit for the first-time home buyers programs that would assist us with a down payment. No one I know in my age bracket, in my city, in my wage range owns a home. Needless to say, it's very demoralizing to work long hours, get paid reasonably well and still be priced out. This, in my opinion, is one of the main reasons our economy is slugging along at such a glacial pace and why many millennials feel like they've gotten a raw deal.

2) Climate Change -
Our generation is the first to enter their prime years in the midst of an impending global crisis that has the potential to upend our entire way of life. There will be vast social, economic and environmental crises as a result of climate change for our generation to deal with. This is a burden unlike any other, and it will be the issue of the 21st century. Yet, most of the climate change deniers are baby boomers who won't be alive when the shit really hits the fan.

Again, I agree with much of what you said, but we need to live in reality here. Millennials work longer hours, get paid less, have less opportunity to accumulate wealth and have to worry about climate change turning our entire world upside down.

I figured I would do a spellcaster who known as the knight with blue eyes...through his life would first come to understand not only his destiny as a Chaos Knight. He would discover his connection to the blues eyes clan and his fate to slay the legendary archfiend black skull dragon. As he journeys to his destiny he becomes an archlord. He is granted the divine sword. Thinking this the power he needs foolishly awakens the beast to slay it. He fails. He encounters the dark sage and he tell him needs to become an archfiend. He journeys to find the renaming red eyes dragons. After finding and undergoing their trials he is allowed to become an archfiend. Problem is he loses himself to the darkness and 'escapes' to the different dimension and he wrecks havoc across that realm...he is hunted down by the dark magician and the black luster soldier and her blue eyes white dragon. They find him and help him make piece with his powers. He becomes a warrior of chaos. To test himself he shatters the divine blade and forges it into the sword of chaos. Together they escapes the D.D. on the DD Jet Iron. He fights the skull dragon and in his perfected chaos form.",1498867374

"rust","t5_2s7lj","An enum with only one variant isn't very useful. It looks like you could just delete ""GenericShortcutId"" from the code and it wouldn't affect anything.

your Shortcut struct has one generic parameter, which is the type of the id field. You could use basically any type there. S is not actually connected to GenericShortcutId in any way, currently.

So, you should be able to write

    supported.push(Shortcut{id: CommonId::Quit, keys: quit_k});

without any problem, but I haven't tested it.

The issue is that the Vec can only contain one variant of `Shortcut`, since each variation is a completely different type, and a Vec can only hold values of a single type. This applies whether you use GenericShortcutId or not... that enum with one variant isn't making any difference in the end result.

The way to express this problem would be something like this:

    
    #[derive(Debug)]
    pub enum GenericShortcutId&lt;S&gt; {
        New,
        Open,
        Save,
        Help,
        Quit,
        Custom(S)
    }
    
    /// A shortcut consists of an id and a combination of keystrokes
    /// id can be of any generic type
    #[derive(Deserialize, Clone, Debug)]
    pub struct Shortcut&lt;S&gt; {
        pub id: GenericShortcutId&lt;S&gt;,
        pub keys: Vec&lt;u8&gt;,
    }
    
    pub enum MyId {
        Increase,
        Decrease
    }

and

    supported.push(Shortcut{id: GenericShortcutId::Quit, keys: quit_k});
    supported.push(Shortcut{id: GenericShortcutId::Custom(MyId::Decrease), keys: decrease_k});

S would then represent the user's custom enum type, where they can add as many enum variants as they desire. The default ShortcutIds would just be variants in the GenericShortcutId, but the additional Custom variant is where the user's variants would be attached.

The user is *only* allowed one enum type. This is important. They can add as many variants into that type as they want, but there can only be one definition of S in a vec. You can have separate vecs with different definitions of S, which is what makes it generic, but a vec instance must have a single concrete type.",1498867374

With BotW introducing futuristic tech into the world, I've been thinking more about this concept, and how much fun I think it would be.

This is because he has a reputation of actually being honest and accurate and thorough with his research. You don't risk that for nothing. That means he is very confident about this. 

Bioware won't ever comment on it because if they do, nobody will buy the game. 

The thing is, when sinclaire was false they jumped on it. This rumor is hurting sales. They'd say something by now but all the devs just went quiet.

If we simplify it and say we could spend all of the money currently spent on foreign aid (about ¬£13bn) on the NHS instead, we wouldn't be able to meet the ¬£16bn per year black hole in NHS spending estimated by 2020 (that is assuming efficiency savings of 1.5%, which is inline with estimates of savings between 2004/5 and 2011/12) [[Source](https://fullfact.org/health/nhs-black-hole-size-funding-gap-2020/)]

Taking another look at Labours plan to raise income tax, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that Labour would optimistically raise about ¬£4.5bn extra per year [[Source](https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/9229)], which is also relatively small compared to total government spending.

Then you have the flip side of who just calls her a bitch who ruins everything. That's complaining while being a dick.

&gt; There's a reason why people are so inclined toward revenge. It vastly predates all of human history.
&gt; People need to come to grips with it.


problem is that with revenge you bring in conflicts that can last for a loon time and ultimately take more lives than if the original killer was just sentenced to life or imprisonment, that is, it could cause blood feuds

humans as we are, are emotional and often irrational animals, doing things that are not in our own interests and bring an early death to us (smoking,drugs, alcohol, gambling etc...), and the loss of a significant person in our lives is often a trigger for the worst behaviour in us

taking revenge for your loved one might seem great, but by doing that you are throwing your own life away for that feeling. Not taking into account the fact that revenge is illegal, what if the person you killed has a family member that loves him dearly and might take revenge on you later, will you kill him to? Will you kill the entire family of the perpetrator and eventually become a worse person then the actual killer of your loved one? What if in your revenge you harm an innocent bystander, will you give your head for his family to take their revenge? When will the cycle end? And after you die what if your family also wants revenge? Do you wish to kill one trash and risk the consequence of everything above?

We had blood feuds in the past and it didn't work out, else we would still have them now.",1498867378

"Veterans","t5_2rc75","I see you haven't read the link to the law I posted (Using 2 or more programs) so to answer your TLFR: 

Easy 48 months is the max. of VA Education entitlement a Veteran may use (with a built in exception that Voc Rehab under certain conditions may extend a voc rehab training plan past the 48 month point for those they determine have a severe employment handicap) - so if you use 36 months of Voc Rehab you can only use 12 months of Post 9/11 GI bill and it's all gone - it's used up - there is no 24 months left like you are trying to say. 

Now there are slightly different rules when the transfer of entitlement to dependents come into play - for several years Voc Rehab ignored the transfer and told their veterans they could use 48 months of Voc Rehab and their spouse/children could use up to 35 months of Post 9/11 (veteran had to keep one month to be paid the Post 9/11 GI Bill monthly stipend) BUT now IF the spouse/child has all ready used the transferred 35 months, Voc Rehab is only giving those veterans 13 months of Voc Rehab education benefits and this is because of the reinterpretation of the law in August 2016. So if you continue in Voc Rehab before your spouse uses the transferred entitlement, she might not be able to use the 35 months you gave her.

And yes if you see my post in reply to OP, I told him/her to apply right now for Voc Rehab and try to sell them on paying for both Bachelors/Masters programs as the approval will depend on what disabilities he has and how employable he is with those disabilities.

It (O-DMST) presumably lacks the serotonin releasing properties of tramadol, which makes it desireable versus tramadol for higher doses neccesary for severe pain; which tramadol can not be used for due to potential for serotonin storm. 

Making it illegal is somewhat questionable as there is a market of people who respond well to tramadol's pattern of mu1/mu2/mu3 (mu opioid isoform) bias. As O-DMST is the primary active painkilling molecule through which tramadol administration creates its effect, it makes sense to develop as a drug.

However, it is not being pursued as a painkiller as there is potential for it getting banned due to recreational use. Part of me wants to say ""the CCP intentionally flooded the market with cathinones in order to stonewall research into novel ADHD pharmacotherapies"", but that is questionable; at least in regards from *whom* the impetus for allowance of mass psychoactive research chemical distribution is sourced from.

Then we finally get to go to a party together. So yeah, cool, I get to drink with her and friends. We get pretty drunk, the group goes to town and the two of us don't get in to a night club because the bouncers thought we were on something. Since she lives a bit away from the city she has to stay in one of her friends house so we had to wait. We go to a bar and get more drinks. So we're sitting there and then she looks really panicked. I ask whats wrong and shes like ""I don't to lose you as a friend but...."" and I'm just like ""uhh... ok"" and then we _get down to business_ (I'm sorry). 

So after we do what do, we meet up with our friends and everyone goes home. I get home and notice that there's a bit of something on my t-shirt. I then notice that my shoulder and chest is quite scratched up and my t-shirt has blood on it. Now I'm not gonna say that I am a smooth operator because I'm not but I mean I was in a pretty bad state so I must have done something right.

Overall, deep dives to utter worst and hopeful climbs back to top, but still utterly slipping grip, mainly, the deadline crunch for which I allowed short term reliefs, as the last 20% takes the 80% of the effort, the workload stayd huge, but the dimishing returns of the short term stress and performance reliefs turned in to burdens on overall performance. Now, it is about done, but damnit, that did not go well. Now, time to reorient to new phase. Again.

People will complain and report posts they don't like, and will not care for the nuances of the law. Facebook will choose to just delete those posts rather than face the fine

2) I think you seriously underestimate how many anti-immigration extremists there are in Europe.

In fact, when you ask Americans about immigration, most people have a problem with **ILLEGAL** immigration, and perfectly fine with legal immigration. Speaking as an immigrant to the US, America is one of the most immigrant friendly country there exists. 

It's just that America is a more open society, where people speak their mind, which is why it may appear that anti-immigration sentiment is far larger than actual reality.

**My brother called off the wedding with his fianc√©. Questions for what all she's entitled to**
&gt;So my brother recently ending things with his fianc√© the only trouble is the house they bought together. She put down $5k and him $6k. My brother is the one that makes all of the mortgage &amp;amp; Utility payments on the house, the only thing she contributed are the groceries. Someone has bought the house already and he will make $60,000 on it but she is telling him that she wants half.He has been naive and hasn't contacted a lawyer yet to try and sort this out.

Still not near full efficiency, but definitely on the mend. A trickle of work has accumulated into a package big enough to release, big enough even to skip 1.3 and go straight for Beta 2 :P

I'll be releasing that next week, and have a collection of demos for mostly accessibility features I did this week:

* [Lore export feature w/buttons for various formats](http://i.imgur.com/Og5wX5b.png)
* [TXT export](http://i.imgur.com/fs1uZPT.png)
* [HTML export](http://i.imgur.com/MOfLJKt.png) (includes a table of contents w/links)
* [CSV export](http://i.imgur.com/UBY2sB3.png) (for easy processing/converting into some other format)
* [Mouse users can fire guided weapons at empty spaces without the keyboard](http://i.imgur.com/X6TfmHP.gif)
* [Placing the final/max waypoint for a guided weapon shows it in yellow](http://i.imgur.com/VfjKAys.png)
* [An active Triangulator now also predicts AI paths](http://i.imgur.com/x49rkLM.gif)
* [Traps Cogmind installs can now trigger on non-0b10 hostile robots](http://i.imgur.com/pnH2rlb.gif)
* [Thermal weapons also display precise heat transfer values](http://i.imgur.com/CZ4SSIg.png) (data transparency change #683 :P)
* [Comparison between EM weapons show spectrum differences using numbers rather than cryptic abbreviations](http://i.imgur.com/ehQaD5r.png)
* [Transmission Jammer blocks the effect of all Alarm Traps within range](http://i.imgur.com/b0gNxke.png) (not just those the player steps on)
* [Items with internal power sources now show remaining power next to their name](http://i.imgur.com/Q8DhnIq.png)
* [Stasis Traps now have a finite amount of power, also shown in their info and next to their item name](http://i.imgur.com/X4yLI4E.png)
* [HUD resource displays also show total stored in inventory containers when applicable](http://i.imgur.com/2XxAtTA.png)
* [Warning before melee attacking an already disabled target](http://i.imgur.com/bsFfb4S.gif)
* Fun bug fix: [It was technically possible to set nearly unlimited waypoints](http://i.imgur.com/QnkE7Kj.gif) by switching between two guided weapons in the middle of targeting mode :P
* Discovered a neat color blending effect when [activating a Transmission Jammer overtop an active volley range indicator (red)](http://i.imgur.com/4NUhIwd.gif)
* After years of development, I only just now implemented a ""[click-to-kill](http://i.imgur.com/deCsCjZ.gif)"" feature for debugging use. Very useful. And sometimes just fun to fool around with :)

Over on the roguelike Discord server, @Rylan has been designing full 3D impressions of Cogmind's ASCII item art--very neat stuff!

* [Shock Maul](http://i.imgur.com/Ij2Oz3f.png) ([sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/models/37f09e36cb774af1b8895c02462750d2))

For the Tutorial Tuesdays I've been updating the [relevant wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/wiki/python_tutorial_series) with all those posting their repos. A respectable list of languages and libraries!

I assume this bothers you because you resent the loss of meaning when things you love go mainstream, right. I've been there, but what can you do. as more people become aware of meaningful movements, the more diluted and less potent those groups become.  

Hipsters IMO want to preserve that potency by gatekeeping others out of their scenes. I say it's a waste of energy. whenever a group produces something of value or beauty, society will try to consume it. this is good or bad depending on your perspective of who 'deserves' to like something. do black blues musicians from the 30's and 40's regret how white country singers hijacked their sound to create rock n' roll in the 50's. I dunno. but yeah pop culture is a compost heap.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Sooo, quick recap:

**Act I**

At some point in the past they (i doubt it's a team, you really don't need a team to do this kind of job) released a [Keen Dreams](http://store.steampowered.com/app/356200/Keen_Dreams/) port, which is another msdos classic technically made by ID Software. 

It was done with permission from ID as [someone checked on this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/6kbbmn/abrams_tank_developer_hard_disk_publishing_calls/djma9t0/), it was more or less handled in a professional way, and was an actual port using the base game's assets. 

It sold relatively poorly, but putting your studio's name next to ID is no small feat, and given the amount of work involved, I'd take that deal any day. 

**Act II**

Now here comes Abrams, which isn't made with explicit permission from ID, just using the open source license. In itself, it wouldn't be much of an issue if they weren't using assets from the base game while playing fast and loose with the GPL license. 

Not even mentioning the review debacle. On that note, the dev's positive ""review"" got deleted, dunno if it's because of a flag of if (s)he deleted it before steam could check it out.

Their community forum is pretty barren but what's there is a mess which really doesn't look like it was handled by the same people. 

There's a group of about 2-4 obviously young persons who spent way too much time on *chan who are shilling for the game and spewing memes. To each his own, it's not for me to judge, I'm mentioning it only because the difference between this board and Keen Dream's is quite impressive.

The [dev even ask how to fucking advertise](http://steamcommunity.com/app/518160/discussions/0/343785574522974355/) Abrams in the forum. They already made a game with ID's blessing, in what world asking this question now makes any sense?

**Thoughts**

Did they fucking hijack someone else account? Honestly, it feels like a joke made by some bored channers. Because I really don't get why the hell someone would go from act I to act II. Am I missing something here?

It's not like Hard Disk Publishing is an actual publisher who don't control its development studios. Both games have been made (if we exclude the unlikely account hijacking theory) by the same people. 

Basically it's a reverse success story. Normally, it would go from II to I, making an illegal crap game at first, growing up, get some skills out of it, and ending with a contract with ID to make keen dreams. But nope :D


Anyway, i'm done with this. I lost enough brain cells watching their respective accounts. I'd suggest someone to flag the game and link this thread to Steam so they can sort this stuff out.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was doing my food shopping at a WinCo few months back. 

I had to run down the street to a Dollar Tree, and it was like 40 F outside. There was a vagrant man sitting out in front of the Dollar Tree on a piece of cardboard, huddled up in his hoodie.

he had nothing with him.

Being a man who has been homeless half of his childhood, I understand the struggle.

I walked inside, bought him what he needed to get through a few more days. I don't get paid a lot for what I do (Homecare Provider for my mother-in-law), so I couldn't do much more than what I did.

I bought him a nylon cinch-drawstring bag, 2 liters of bottle water, 2 cans of pringles (Carbs, salt) 2 things of jerky (Protein, salt) and a bag of candy (Carbs, who the fuck doesn't want candy, homeless or not).

Put it all in the bag, walked outside and handed it to him.

I said, ""Here you go man, this'll keep you going a bit longer."" Smiled, and left.

If something only attacks people when they themselves are attacked, then we are dealing with just a dangerous animal, although the emotional kick of being a former person would still have to be dealt with.  People could hunt such a creature to near extinction.  Its likely there would be a profession specifically to deal with it, seasoned killers, which takes it out of the hands of former relatives and friends to deal with.   A sad new feature of society, but not a threat.

However, if we can back off the 'only attacking if provoked' then maybe we have a greater threat, such as ghouls.  Maybe they hide until they have an advantage - being unseen and preying on the single or small groups.  They could live in the forest, the sewer, an abandoned building, a warehouse, a cornfield, etc.    

That would be a far greater issue.  Predators with a survival instinct, pack hunters, guerilla raiders seeking only to feed or add to the pack.  Once a pack grew large enough it would have to subdivide, and larger packs would be unable to hide and be wiped out, but they would remain such a threat that society would have to seriously adapt itself to the new reality.  It would not end society, but it would change it greatly. ",1498867389

When at last he deciphered the words that had more recently turned to muffled shuffling to his hearing, he was struck at first by a disappointment. 

*That's it?* he found himself asking. Indeed, he had thought that House Grafton would have required a last minute defence, and he had envisioned himself in that place, as weak and old as he was. 

He rose slowly, as that was all he could muster these days, and reached for his cane and the page, Triss, for support. 

""Where to, m'lud?"" came his prepubescent voice between grunts from straining against the Corbray lord's feeble frame. 

For a moment Lyonel hesitated, or maybe contemplated. Who could tell? All he knew was that he was *exhausted* from all this courtly business. House Grafton seemed perfectly capable of its own ruin, and Lyonel would not aid them any more. Isaac's reappearance had accentuated this tiredness and melancholy.

Star Wars isn't leaving the MMO Cash shop any time soon, and Anthem is the new kid that gets all the attention, so ME was always going to have a hard time competing for dev time.

How much money do you anticipate your family/dependents to need if you died tomorrow? 

For example, I am a mother to 2 young boys and my husband (their father) will be our bread winner very soon.  If I die tomorrow, I have no income my family is losing but my husband would now be the sole provider for our boys as well as the bread winner for the family.  We have no family close by to help if I were gone - so, for me, the main financial need my family would have would be full time childcare until our children are old enough to be in school, and then after school care.  But if **he** is the one who died, my earning potential is roughly 1/3 of what his is, so it would require a major lifestyle adjustment to live on my income alone, plus I'd have added expenses like childcare, etc.  So - we opted for no policy for me and one to cover 3 years worth of his salary for him.

Now you have a 10* driver with an open face. Now, it is on the player, when addressing the ball, to manipulate the face to square.

"BeautyGuruChatter","t5_3jayp","I'm definitely getting downvoted for this, but what the hell ‚Äì I do sometimes downvote glorification of brands that test. Not every mention because I prefer (just for my own sake, obviously no one else knows) to give more upvotes than downvotes, and that is true for me across Reddit. But it does bother me personally to see how little attention is paid to the testing issue in general, and how brands that test are widely praised. Maybe it is hypocritical not to downvote every mention ... but I don't think so, because it would be way too extreme to expect everyone to be flawless consumers, all knowing the status of every brand at all times, etc etc. I'm sure the reason why more people are troubled (and thus downvoting) in this instance is because it's a more morally clear-cut situation: NARS introduces avoidable testing, purely for profit. Many consumers will give up NARS, while others explicitly say they don't care. That is functionally different from just seeing on MUA, say, that someone happened to use a common Benefit product on their brows (when I have no idea how old it is, if they bought it or were given it, whether they'd repurchase... or anything else). 

Consciously deciding to condone cruelty seems more heartless than just thoughtlessly and casually participating in consumerism, even though the latter is harmful too. ",1498867396

That said, as was pointed out, the change in scale doesn't affect the game itself at all, so there aren't any real problems there apart from trusting that the tiles really are laid out identically to the 2D tiles.  That would be a pain to verify in a tournament situation.  I could see the TO wanting to use something like this for the final round, though.  It would make for good video!  My daughter and I used Heroscape terrain hexes for our first campaign, and it was just fine.  Casually, anything is possible! :)

I do wish FFG would see a market for 3D terrain.  Printing 18-36 hours per tile just isn't feasible large scale.  FFG could make molds, though.  I know I'd buy them, even though I have a printer!",1498867396

If you encounter them outside the Companions quests, they're aggressive on-sight, and you can then infer they attack everyone they see. They might think they have the moral high ground by killing werewolves, but they're not much more than common bandits in action.

Your first interaction with Kodlak is during his conversation with Vilkas, where they're discussing curing their condition. You could potentially conclude that helping the group out and working your way to the inner circle will also let you help Kodlak and Vilkas investigate a cure.

As for the Civil War, the Empire isn't likely to reinvade Skyrim after defeat, and the Aldmeri Dominion faces a lot of difficulty covering the ground to invade, if they'd even be interested. As Dragonborn, with the help of the Stormcloak army, you're likely to be able to repel any small group of elves that happens to cover the physical distance and obstacles to even make it to Skyrim. Hammerfell managed to push them out without the help of a demigod.

All in all, I think your roleplay is salavageable. And if you haven't returned the Jagged Crown, you can switch sides.

ETA: now that I'm thinking about it, you can ask Kodlak about him wanting to cure his Lycanthropy right after the ceremony to induct you into the circle. It's no secret that he's investigating a cure.",1498867397

&gt; **Quest for No-Wipe**
&gt; 
&gt; by Maven Carraway
&gt; 
&gt; Recently I embarked on a journey for the holiest of holies. The holy grail of bowel movements, if you will: one which results in a ""ghost wipe"". 
&gt; 
&gt; A wise woman once said ""Nothing is as overrated as sex, and as underrated as a good bowel movement."" 
&gt; 
&gt; While I can't completely agree with that, I will say this: These pills are saving me tens of dollars every year on toilet paper.
&gt; 
&gt; Tell me, human, does your day not seem brighter when you wipe, look at your toilet paper and realize it was a clean break?
&gt; 
&gt; I take 4 in the morning and 4 at night with copious amounts of water and this seems to do the trick. Bravo, psyllium husk. ",1498867399

That's not a discussion we need to have, but it's worth pointing out that if the real controversy boils down to the quality of daycare, then OP's argument is still flawed, as he's arguing against daycare altogether.

Well, there *are* substitutions for daycare, so rejecting daycare on the premise that ascertaining quality beforehand is too difficult, or you'd have better luck picking up those cute twins at the bar, then I can see why you'd just toss out the whole shebang and go with alternatives.

&gt; I didn't say OP wanted to lock his kids in a basement. At the most extreme I suggested homeschooling.

But homeschooling is incredibly beneficial, and you're talking about it like it's a bad thing. That makes me very confused.

&gt; Of course it is, and I would never argue that. OP presents parental involvement as all a child needs and the only healthy influence in their lives, and that certainly isn't true.

Try this



Inhale a full breath with a fabric tape measure/string tied around your chest. Pinch it and mark how large you are.  After that, do the same thing but exhale all of the air you possibly can.



Measure the difference, now think about how that 1/2"" or so thick area of your body expanded by that much, you've also got the rest of your torso expanding/contracting with that.



Weight has less to do with buoyancy than you'd think. Cargo ships are super heavy, but they are able to stay afloat (buoyant) because of how much water they displace. The air in your lungs displaces quite a bit of water and contributes to your buoyancy. Considering most of your body is ""incompressible"" fluid the amount of air in your lungs has a huge effect on your buoyancy. Scuba divers learn to fine tune that when at depth in order to take better/longer looks into crevices or to float just above the silt without disturbing anything.



You can pm me if you have any questions about diving you'd like answered, I know a pretty decent amount.




TL;DR the air in your lungs displaces a bunch of water which contributes towards your buoyancy. ",1498867401

Donning uniforms of the three Grand Companies, they initiated a false flag attack against the military installation at Baelsar's Wall. After taking over the installation, Illberd's minions activated a Magitek defense system which killed most of the resistance forces. Illberd then reveals that he has gained Nidhogg's eyes, and intends to use the anguished prayers of the fighters to summon Rhalgar. He then kills himself, initiating the process and creating Shinryu which is then bound by Papalymo's sacrifice. We sic Omega on Shinryu, then the Eorzean Alliance decides that their hands have been forced and they secure the Wall and Castrum Oriens, setting the stage for open war against Garlemald."")",1498867402

"Documentaries","t5_2qhlh","So your loser ideological ass, in the intervening month didn't watch the documentary still? I only responded because another ideological tilting wingnut, necro-responded to my review that showed I watched the movie and that made me re-examine this Reddit thread:  

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/6d1k7r/the_red_pill_2016_a_feminists_journey_into_the/djlip17/

Men's Rights is not about hating women. Why did a female feminist documentarian going into the filming, Cassie Jaye, stop considering herself a feminist or associating herself with feminism by the end? Why was Cassie Jaye able to find so much footage of feminist fanatics trying to shut down speeches by the men's rights movement? It even included footage where feminists illegally pulled a fire alarm and then cheered just because it shut down the free speech of their enemies.

One MRA pointed out how if being a female is so hard for males to grasp that they need women or feminists to explain the female experience, that the same would have to hold true for males, that females couldn't grasp what it was like to be male. But most modern feminists don't want to hear that since feminism has come to be in large part a movement about hating males. The documentary even covered how Erin Pizzey, a female, who created the first domestic violence shelter is not even allowed to visit the shelter she paid for and created because it is hijacked by radical feminists who will not allow her to enter because she is not a feminist and speaks out against feminism! They also vindictively have tried to ruin her, her reputation and try to prevent her from conducting public speeches just like they do with the men's rights movement because she maintains that women are just as capable of domestic violence as men. Erin Pizzey had a good quote in the film about how the 1960's was largely about being anti-capitalist but feminists have hijacked alot of that momentum and turned it into a gender war where they want just as many rich females at the top of the social hierarchy.

Going into the documentary I had a bad opinion of men's right thanks to PUA scammers like the /r/theredpill and other bad examples from the white nerdosphere like Reddit and chanboards, but after watching it I changed my mind and me realize that modern feminism is largely about winning a gender war, and men's rights is far more respectable than mainstream feminism.

"funny","t5_2qh33","Keeping the mattress off the floor is good for ventilation to prevent mold and musty-ness in the mattress itself.

A mattress left on the floor for ages will tend to fuck up your carpet and potentially warp wood a bit with trapped moisture (depending on the ambient conditions of your household/room).  Again, ventilation is key.

Beds on the ground in warmer or humid areas tend to be more easily infested with bugs.  Or perhaps a mouse running over and shitting in your mouth (much less likely to actively crawl up a frame). 

A raised mattress may be slightly better to keep you cooler in the summer, warmer in the winter (depending on other factors such as your floor type).  

It is also a different tactile experience usually (even when including a bedspring), and most people I know are more comfortable on a suspended/supported mattress than on a slabbed-mattress.  As well, it's easier for the typical adult to board and deboard a bed if it is some height above the ground.  These things will vary person to person.

A raised mattress utilizes space better in that it gives you some capacity for storage under the bed.  The utility of somewhere to put a few boxes or shoes is significant in small homes.",1498867405

You have to be stupid to think it can be reversed, and you have to be bigoted to think it should be reversed.

The strength of America as a nation has absolutely nothing to do with demographics. There was a time when the Irish were thought to be a scourge. Now the Irish are the ones talking about maintaining the purity of this country.

Demographic changes aren't going to destroy America. People like you who are trying to create a war between races instead of focusing on the ideological greatness of this country is what is going to destroy it. 

This country isn't a strong Democracy anymore because people are trying to suppress the voting rights of demographics they deem undesirable. 

This country isn't a strong Democracy anymore because the press is more focused on entertaining and confirming biases than actually informing the public. 

This country isn't a strong Democracy anymore because compromise has been deemed a dirty word. Legislators care more about scoring political points than helping their constituents. Even worse, legislators care more about helping their party than helping the country.

This country isn't a strong Democracy anymore because this president has no respect for the gravity and responsibility that the office holds. 

And this country isn't a strong Democracy anymore because people are so focused on the demographics of people that they don't pay attention to the humanity of people.

There is nothing inherent in a Hispanic or Black or Asian or Muslim person that they cannot become a contributing member of this country. What stops them is people like you focusing on their upbringing rather than their potential.",1498867406

* The third point doesn't explain how their spirits are on Argus at all. There's another thread on the front page adressing the issue.


As for Sargeras' body, so far we have two contradicting sources: 

 \- Richard Knaak, author of the War of the Ancients trilogy, confirming that 1) Sargeras' physical form was destroyed, while his soul survived and was sent to the Nether (so as I said no contradiction in Chronicle in point #1)  and 2) that Blizzard told him that. 

\- The Scepter of Sargeras artifact book lore says that Sargeras couldn't get to Azeroth in his ""most devastating form"" and that he'd have to use an Avatar instead (that is after the War of the Ancients). His most devastating form likely being the full might of his body, that is a contradiction.

So until we have a third element that can confirm either of the two statements, it's in a sort of limbo state. We don't know. Though it's possible they'll just retcon Sargeras having lost his body. ",1498867407

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","There is no standard architecture.

That video tutorial is showing you how to make a basebuilding/sim game, so it makes sense for it to maintain its own segregated simulation model external to the game objects. This doesn't make sense for every game, and as you say, creating distance between game objects and gameplay functions can slow you down without significant benefit.

It's also a huge mess to try to do that sometimes. Unity's primary scripting mechanism (MonoBehaviour message handlers like Start, Update, OnCollisionEnter, etc.) is a little janky, and it strongly encourages bundling script code and builtin components together (kind of like React components, I guess?). It's definitely more natural to do this in an action game, since physics message and input and graphics will be tightly interwoven by necessity, and trying to tease them apart doesn't buy you much in most cases.

You can kinda do MVC in isolated areas, like most of my dynamic UI element prefabs have scripts on them that just expose stuff like `DisplayCharacter(CharacterInfo character)` which knows how to lookup character portrait sprites and format the name.

Instead of thinking about an architecture, think about the kind of conventions you want to establish. What's the procedure for adding a new character to the simulation? Is it always the same? Can you display a character without adding them to the simulation? Can you ""possess"" a character and control them yourself? Does that even make sense for the game you're working on?

A couple of things I always recommend are:

- Have an in-game console and make it super easy to write commands for it. This means if you need to fetch any game entities which aren't scripts (for which you can just use `FindObjectsOfType&lt;T&gt;`) you'll want to maintain a way to look things up by name/type/id/other predicates.

- Have a single primary initialization function. You can approximate this with `[RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod]`. This allows you to create lots of good assumptions in your code.

- If you have some data in a MonoBehaviour on a prefab that has a lot of data fields that never change, that might be a sign you instead should reference that prefab via a ScriptableObject which contains the unchanging data fields.

E.g. instead of this:

    public class Weapon : MonoBehaviour
    {
        [SerializeField] private ParticleSystem shootFX;
        [SerializeField] private int damage;
        [SerializeField] private Projectile bulletPrefab;
    
        public void Shoot() { /* ... */ }
    }

Consider something like this:


    [Serializable]
    public class WeaponDef
    {
        public int damage;
        public Projectile bulletPrefab;
    }
    
    public class WeaponInst : MonoBehaviour
    {
        [SerializeField] private ParticleSystem shootFX;
    
        private WeaponDef weaponDef;
    
        public void Init(WeaponDef)
        {
            this. weaponDef = weaponDef;
        }
    
        public void Shoot() { /* ... */ }
    }
    
    public class WeaponDefAsset : ScriptableObject
    {
        [SerializeField] private WeaponInst weaponPrefab;
        [SerializeField] private WeaponDef weaponDef;
    
        public WeaponInst CreateInst()
        {
            return Instantiate(weaponPrefab).Init(weaponDef);
        }
    }

Other game requirements will add more goals (multiplayer means play agent state changes should be idempotent, gamepad support means accounting for that in all UI etc.).

Other than that, all you can do is think about creating opportunities for yourself that have a grounding in reality. In that tutorial video, the guy mentions changing the game to render with 3d instead of 2d tiles. I think if you actually leave sufficient room make that a seamless transition, that's a huge waste of time in many cases. But maybe that's this guy's workflow, prototype and develop the sim in 2d, then overhaul everything in 3d when he starts hiring artists and whatnot.

Individual features have a more restricted set of useful implementation patterns (like the WeaponDef), but on the whole.... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",1498867408

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","Dominant chords are pretty ""anything goes"" as far as scales, so like others have said you'd have a bunch of options. That being said, if you want to sound very sure of what you're playing, here's a process you can follow:

The A, C#, E, and G notes of your potential scale of choice are nailed down since they're in the chord. The notes we have left are B, D, and F. Now, think about where you're going: D minor. To avoid unwanted dissonance you're gonna want to choose your notes based on what matches where you're resolving to as well as where you are. That means the D and F natural will sound the ""most right"" or most predictable. The B is basically fair game, you could keep it natural to avoid dissonance with where you're coming from, aka C major. This would be the scale you spelled out with the C#, and would sound on point. If you flatten the B, it's probably gonna sound more like a modulation to the key of D minor rather than moving via secondary dominant to the ii chord, but it'll still sound good. 

For more complicated chords, your ability to hear what extensions your fellow musicians are adding to what they're playing should dictate what you play (and vice versa), but that's pretty hard to do so hope this helps a little",1498867409

Not because i couldnt get regular chicks but because i genuinely had a thing for chicks who were willing to get paid for having their pussy used.  It got me off.  It just did.

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","Scientists have jargon that the outside world cannot regulate, but that's because we do not communicate to the world at large with our jargon. The only reason the jargon exists is because (most of the time) there is not a simpler word for what we're saying and, between scientists, the precision matter. 

However, languages require cultural consensus (because if the speaker and the listener don't agree on what's said, then there was no point in flapping your lips or waving your hands over a keyboard) For example, we're speaking Modern English instead of Old or Middle English. This is because the definitions and grammatical rules of earlier forms of English drifted. A lot of times the reasons why people fight the evolution of language are oppressive. (Re: racism vs AAVE). 

I think what's happening here is a little different. I think that the difference of definitions between this person on IG and members of r/vegan has more to do with a difference in identity. I think that it's entirely fair for r/vegan to regulate the definition of vegan within the subreddit. However, I think that it will be both 1) frustrating to try to regulate the definitions outside of this subreddit and 2) wrong to try. R/vegan doesn't have a monopoly on the vegan identity. There are way more people in the world than are subscribed to this sub. But, to be clear, if this IG user came to this sub, I think r/vegan has the absolute right to tear them to pieces for not minding the rules of this community. ",1498867410

"beyondthebump","t5_2u06v","So the sizes might be a bit behind my long-skinny bean of a kiddo.  Maybe that's on my kid for being really really freakishly tall.  The ratio of what sizes corresponds to what seems spot on (in my limited opinion) and that's devilishly tricky to do.  

Have you thought about deciding that brands to recommend based on... Okay, it's way too late in the week for me to explain this in anything but the most awkward way, but have a table... no... have two tables... one for 'for the median length at this age, be at this size of these brands' and one for 'for the median weight for this age, be at this size for these brands'.  Then given the individual's limiting factor (either the weight or the length depending on which one gets the highest z-score), project where they will be at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 months based on CDC charts (that's just fitting the same line at different heights) and then taking the height of that line at those points and turning it into a 'if-i-were-a-stranger-looking-at-this-baby-I-would-expect-them-to-be-this-old' month's value.  Aka, find the projected height using the complex non-linear growth-curve-ish line and then follow that across the CDC growth chart until you get to the median age at which the average baby is that height and then use that to index what clothing size they should use.  

Okay, so since some outfits are tubby and some are for stick-shaped babies, you might actually have to have two indexes... but... worse case scenario that just doubles the math and you check to see which is the limiting factor...  and it can be something that's checked for just those weirdo brands that are so perfect for beautifully and delightfully oddly proportioned babies.  

Yeah?

Sorry for the ramble--it's been a really long week with work and a summer-cold going around daycare and I don't mean to be bossy and you actually might be doing it this way already.  Just... just in case this helps... hi.  You're lovely and I might could maybe help.  ",1498867410

As for your question, you obviously have it figured out (most likely because you know how to use Google). Using RRSP isn't very useful for you right now. RRSP makes sense when you are making more money now (and are taxed more) than you'll when retired. Since you'll obviously make more money as you get older (and get promoted, etc), don't use your RRSP contribution room right now, it's almost like wasting it.

Also, RRSP have strict conditions when you want to withdraw. This can be very inconvenient.

It's delusional but...I mean, I don't want to interrupt their winning, ya know? I just don't want to play that game so I don't. I walk away.

However, on this particular day the counselors thought it would be a good idea to round up all the kids (ages 5-18) in the gym and play a game together; the game they decided to play was called Dead Lions. Basically, all the kids were ""dead lions"" and had to lay on the floor and not move while the counselors ""poachers"" tried to get us to move. If you moved you were out. The whole camp starts to play and one by one people are caught moving and told to sit on the bleachers and watch the people who were remaining. After about 15 minutes of laying there it's only me and like 4 other people, do to get me to move one of the counselors decides to try and drag me around the gym by my pants and it just so happened that this is the one day I forget to wear my belt. The counselor takes one hard tug and I'm laying on my stomach, with my butt in the air, tightywhities showing proudly, and about 300 kids saw it all. I was quickly whisked away to the bathroom where the counselor apologized profusely. The worst part of it all was that the other counselors felt so bad that they each wanted to give me money, but the counselor who pantsed me talked them out of it and gave me some bullshit story about a time he was embarrassed instead. 

tl;dr- I was pantsed in front of my entire summer camp and was screwed out of about 70 dollars.",1498867413

And it was nothing to fuck with, so I took ANOTHER excedrin and went to bed again, and as I was lying there, my face felt like I had a band wrapped around it, and then the pain was so severe, that my entire face just went numb. I was like, ""okay, I'm definitely having a stroke or something"" but I went to bed anyway because, as I said previously, sometimes I don't take medication for migraines, and I just tough it out, and if I have to, eventually I just get overloaded with pain and it just becomes numb, which, I'll take it.

He honestly was too young and vulnerable, from the child abuse and drug abuse and family rejection to be in a healthy mind frame. 
Last I saw him he was obese, homeless and drug addicted. A whole future wasted. Sexuality is not the full measure of a man or woman. It is one part. Your friend is unique, suicide rate is extremely high amongst transgender crowd. Child abuse and drug abuse is also an issue, not to mention their interaction with society. Anyone can do what they want, I honestly could care less from a moralistic perspective. It takes all kinds to make the world turn, but watching a life devolve from a series of choices that stem from rejection and poor self esteem.
....it Is heartbreaking.

"dbz","t5_2sdu8","You made me want to try and math this out. So this is a conservative estimate (to gohan but generous to everyone else) based on things stated or implied in the manga. Things like Old kai saying the potara fusion becomes more powerful the stronger each fusee's will is, Buu taking on the strongest asborbee and etc. 

Goku - 4 |
Vegeta - 2

SSj3 Gotenks - 16 |
Gohan - 18 |
Super Buu - 16.5

Piccolo - .5 |
Goten - .3 |
Trunks - .4

Gotenks Buu - 16.5 + 16 + .5 = 33 |
Piccolo Buu - 16.5 + .5 + .3 + .4 = 17.7 |
Buuhan - 16.5 + 18 + .5 +.3 +.4 = 35.7

If you all recall Shin's potara fusion we can infer than Vegito's fusion is much more potent. Due to their willpower and rivalry

Base Vegito - 4x2x2 = 16 |
Super Vegito - 80

The manga contradicts the from the daizenshuu  goten = gohan because that would make trunks &gt; gohan. Also they state gohan didn't lose power which also contradicts stuff. I probably should lower Buu's strength as he couldn't dominate Gotenks but was still a bit stronger but whatever. Actually putting  gohan at 5x goku should even everything out.",1498867414

$30/30 mins *sexting + pics + vids*

**Snapchat Premium**

Premium members get **a unique story loaded with explicit photos &amp; 3-10 videos daily!** The content of those snaps varies as well- I have a *ton* of kinks and I love showing them off- but stuff I send the most are pussy related- I just can't send enough of my grool, dirty panties and how impressed I get when I'm all creamy. Other common things are teasing flashes, lingerie/outfits, blowjob teases, behind the scenes, silly stuff and my vast toy collection. I *love* getting back dick pics &amp; cumshots, appreciative commetary &amp; tributes. Screenshots are welcome!
*$10/month if you want JUST the premium story!*

$10/week

$30/month

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;&gt;Minute changes in gravitational force, pressure, atmosphere, day/night cycles, social dynamics, etc significantly damage human physiology. An artificial being could be engineered to withstand these stresses.

This seems inconsistent with an earlier part of your view. You assume that we can fabricate a way to reach relativistic speeds, and not engineer a way around this? We've already invented Submarines which are capable of insulting humans from amounts of pressure that would otherwise kill them. Portability comes with innovation in this regard.


&gt;&gt;Humans need a complex chemical diet, which would need to be synthesized, and excrete toxic waste, which would need to be processed. An artificial being could subsist on virtually any energy source, with waste heat redirected into propulsion.

We've already come to a point where we have distilled a good amount of human essentials into small pills called vitamins. That and dehydrated MRE's already exist for both portability and sustainability. But again, your jump in logic that we could achieve relativistic speeds and not get around this seems inconsistent regardless.


&gt;&gt;Humans are vulnerable to radiation, which will be a constant issue from both cosmic background noise and the propulsion system. Artificial beings can be radiation-hardened and repair damage to maintain their integrity. In addition, their smaller cross-section reduces exposure.

Humans don't have to be the ones exposing themselves to the elements. We can dispatch robots to do that. After all, we are far closer to sentient AI than we are to getting out of the universe.

&gt;&gt;Suspended humans would need continuous maintenance and a complex recovery process. Artificial beings can be paused and resumed at will during the long journey.


This is a bit speculative. While there is certainly some validity to the idea behind cryostasis on your end it certainly isn't the only option. If we were really committed to space travel, we could build colony style ships that house generations of people, so cryogenics are not a mandatory component of the equation. 

&gt;&gt;Any destination planet would need to be terraformed for humans to inhabit. Not only would the ship need to carry a general-purpose terraformer, but it would need to remain in orbit for possibly millennia while terraforming completes. Even if it succeeds, minor differences in ecosystems or planetary composition could make it worthless.

This is not inherently true. After all, We won a sufficiently random lottery with Earth. We don't even need to look at every planet, we can start with ones that house even short term sustainable conditions and move from there.


&gt;&gt;Hundreds of humans, at minimum, must survive the journey and breed in a regimented system to ensure genetic diversity. An arbitrary number of artificial beings can be procedurally generated by a single algorithm.

I've already sufficiently answered this above.


Ultimately your view is just as speculative as any other, and it's pretty self evident that there are numerous solutions to issues you present. The fact of the matter is, it's impossible to progress the argument further than that.

Your way would certainly be the most simplistic in the here and now, but you don't even have a full grasp of the actual problems we face because nobody else does either.

But the easiest way to tell when the big news is about to drop on WaPo to watch the WaPo comments sections.

I don't know if it's for warming up or grouping up or to make themselves less obvious or something, but something definitely triggered them yesterday so something is going to drop today or tomorrow, if it hasn't already. 

There are competing Western groups on now too trying to change the dynamic, or maybe WaPo is just getting better at filtering it all out, so it's harder to discern the patterns than it was like, a month or two ago. But this started last July, about, and it's been going ever since.

Own experience: I purchased a 3 months'ish old green Plakat Betta from the natives of whereI live at, almost 1 month ago, while he was flaring straight away, after 2 days I became confused, because he started to act weird, not wanting to flare at all, and after looking closely I realized he looked somewhat more like a female, regarding his body shape and because of the white spot, after 1 week of feeding him, he finally was able to flare again, and even tough he grew just a little more, it was enough to make 100% sure that certainly, he IS a male.

It starts at 35% and builds linearly until 150%, and then it caps off. If you have max rage, moves will launch about 15% farther. For Samus, her up-b actually has very high knockback, which is designed to make it hard to escape. The high rage makes it not connect properly, and they can pop out the top which can kill some characters",1498867425
"JUSTNOMIL","t5_377ps","If you heard someone you love got drunk every night for a week, would you call them an alcoholic? I wouldn't. It would, however, give me pause and tell me it's something to look out with my loved one. All I was saying is that what this grandmother did can be indicative of nefarious behavior. That's it. A doctor's appointment unknown to the parents is weird but certainly not necessarily a mark of a pedophile.


&amp;nbsp;

I wouldn't have responded again but /u/KrytenKoro tagged me so here I am. I was speaking about this specific instance being a *potential example* of something bad and obviously the father of the child in question thought so as well, which is why he gathered his child from his mother and they flew out that evening, so I think it's a pretty safe bet.

You hear the sound of metal twisting. Sarah's staring directly at you, frowning slightly. Under your hands, the doorknob quickly becomes an unrecognizable hunk of metal, impossible to turn due to the locking mechanism being warped and crushed.

""You led me on. You...I WAS SO HAPPY, AND YOU...YOU...AGH!"" She suddenly explodes in anger, a force shoving you to the side so hard that you hear your bones creak. Nothing broken...just...a lot of pain as you impact the wall.

""...that's okay."" Her anger abruptly vanishes, a small smile flickering into existence on her face. ""You...wanted to leave...see your family...I understand."" The look in her eyes goes from fury to a dead calm. ""But..."" Your left hand is pinned to the wall. ""You..."" Your pinky snaps, pain shooting through you. ""Lied."" Now, you feel your ring finger break, agony stabbing from your hand to your head. ""...come on...let's go to my room. There's a first-aid kit there."" You feel yourself lift into the air,  beginning the nauseating trek to her room once more.

You arrive, being lowered gently onto the bed. The room is...surprisingly bare, a bed, television, table, and a few chairs are all that's there...aside from the closet...and the window.

The window. Black bars slice through the light, strips of illumination lighting the room. The room as a whole...feels like a prison cell.

You hear the click of the door locking behind you, as Sarah rummages under the bed, eventually surfacing with...true to her word...a first-aid kit. She quickly bandages your hand, and makes sure that you can't move it. If you did that, you'd make your injuries worse. The precision with which she does it, and the gentleness with which she works, tell you that this girl, despite what she's done, truly cares about you. ""I'll be back with a proper cast. There's some painkillers in the kit. Take two. Three if you really need it, but no more until I get back."" She leaves, locking the door behind her. As her footsteps recede, you hear a voice.

*""I couldn't stop her. I'm...sorry, Steven. Take care of Kazuki. He may be exactly what you need to escape.""*

Part of your property is a publicly accessible parking lot, and your orders require you to patrol said lot occasionally.

An employee of your client is getting into their car, and is accosted by a ne'er-do-well (GIMME YO MONAH)

In Ca., what can you legally do?

Not necessarily company policy, or post orders, because we all know those come from people that don't have to live by them.

Legally, what actions can you take?

O&amp;R?

Question Two - 

ok, you're unarmed, and paid piss poorly, but same rules. You're there to protect the client's personnel in said parking lot. Not a rough part of town, but clearly, shit happens.

As this is my first character though, I do have a few questions.

1. Is this something that would be feasible as far as it goes or am I missing anything that would make this either senseless or ridiculous?

2. Is there a particular ethnic group as far as humans go that might be situated more towards the mountains that might help me flush out this backstory a bit more?

3. Any advice in terms of said backstory would be helpful. Before I go through with this, I really want to have a solid idea in mind of where this character comes from, how he would have come to be there, how the society would have taken to him or why they'd take him in in the first place, and how this all will affect his mentality as a human. I've got a bit of an idea on these things, but input is always great and might help me see something I may have overlooked or that I might prefer in the way of things.

If I were you, I'd buy some variation of the Sennheisers. I believe the 518s are neutral, 558s are bass, and 598s are treble and (perceived) 'clearer.' It's probably rather obvious I'd recommend the Sennheisers in this range. You can save money and get the 558s which are virtually the same, and I believe there was a recent offer on the American BestBuy for like $70. That would be a total steal. ",1498867434

With a Roth, you are taxed *before* it goes into your 401(k); you don't get taxed on it when you remove it.

If you do pre-tax, your contribution is removed from your salary before you can be taxed on it. Therefore, if you're on the cusp of a higher tax bracket, you can actually lower yourself to a different one by going the route of a pre-tax 401(k). In the situation you referenced (where you're contributing $10K pre-tax), you wouldn't actually enter that higher tax bracket.

Don't be afraid of entering a higher tax-bracket, though. You are only taxed a higher rate on the money you are earning *within* that bracket. Using your example again, you would only be taxed at the higher rate for that $10K you made crossing over into that bracket; not on the rest of your salary.

Your math is relatively sound; it's the scenario that is unlikely. Most people don't enjoy a 2% yearly salary increase. Most people also don't work somewhere that matches up to 6% at a 50% rate (so, in this case, really only 3%). Lastly, you are forgetting the biggest variable: the market itself. Predictions like these are dangerous because people think they can set it and forget it. No, you need to be vigilant in guarding your 401(k) and move money when it's appropriate, whether that means to a new index fund or what have you.",1498867434

When you alter loft, you also alter bounce angle.  It's a 1:1 ratio.

If you make the club stronger, delofted, you lose bounce.  So, if you went from 45 to 44, and the bounce angle was 4^o, it would be 3^o after the loft change.

If you made it weaker, by adding loft, you'd also add to the bounce angle.  Going from 45 to 46 would make that same bounce angle go from 4^0 to 5^o.

As a general rule of thumb, it's safer to add bounce than it is to take it away.  If you take too much, you get what's called a ""scoop"" bounce, which can lead to many bad impact styles (excessive digging, thins/skulls, etc.).",1498867436

Also Konami does 'special' set for reprints, where the cards have a different rarity system than in normal sets. Secret and ultra would have been Super and rare foil the rarity would have been the same. As long as nothing is short printed as hell as for XM Invoker in Duelist Saga, every card would go down.

Another thing to notice is as for Spellbook Magician and Secret. They had Ultra and Ulti prints and the demand is growing up the closer we get to CODE release. They are reprinted in the same rarity so the price will obviously goes down, except for Ulti because no more Ulti are print anymore (except 3 every 4 months with OTS), and Ulti are considered prettier and definitely rarer than Ultras.

There are some incredible builder incentives at some of the other places where you might be able to get in just a little over 200 in a place like Saguaro Bloom off of Twin Peaks.  I looked at a 4 bed 2 bath up there today that was 230,000 for a corner lot, granite, etc.  I'm not sure how long those incentives were going for though.  Today is the last day of the month/quarter/first half of the year.

If you'd like to bounce some questions off of me or come up with anything during the process feel free to DM me or call me.  

Typically going into a builder unrepresented you don't save any money... they just pocket the extra profit.  They can't just discount the property because there's not another agent because they would undercut someone else's home values.

You shouldn't have tolerated your sergeant ""describing my myriad mental, moral, and genetic shortcomings because of the whole UCMJ thing."" I remember UCMJ being against that, at least since 1999. Before that I wouldn't know. From someone in a commissioning course it wouldn't be tolerated, [see Schofield's Definition](http://www.west-point.org/academy/malo-wa/inspirations/buglenotes.html). Combat Arms *kinda* lets it go, but it's not supposed to be. 

I'm defending the TA because I don't know what his superiors told him. If he permits eating in the lab he could lose his position. Some labs are strict others aren't. If you remember basic (not after you go downrange) you go to the range with blank adapters before using live rounds to develop proper safety skills. If you get injured your commander gets in trouble and he doesn't want to. As explained, when doing simple labs you should develop proper safety skills, even if just mixing vinegar and baking soda. Same thing. 

From someone who'd be held responsible when subordinates f!ck up every safety precaution is taken. If something can be f!cked up, a private will f!ck it up. You may think privates are bad, just think how their civilian counterparts are. ",1498867438

For an example, below a poster listed a stat layout of 1/3/4/2/1/1 for a Droid. A similar Human layout would be 2/3/4/2/2/2, which gives you two dice to roll in your non-specialized Characteristics, which is much more substantial than it might sound.

My impression of that is: they are not taking agents that have not played in 6 months. They are looking for active players, to include those that are returning to prepare for 1.7. But there may also be newer players mixed in there hence the 10000 in stead of like 1000. They may have different demographics there looking for such as day one veteran and 6 month veterans etc.

The NY logo itself is a sticker, and they in fact are knocked off during the course of a game some times.  Why is it beyond a reasonable doubt that a used helmet from 10 years ago might be missing a sticker that was once on it?

I have no doubt that the equipment guys were involved in selling ""fake"" memorabilia.  They also don't make a lot of money and I'm sure it's a very tempting offer that is constantly made to them by people who don't care about their futures.  I understand how they could wind up involved in this and I don't think it necessarily makes them dirtbags.  I don't think street level weed dealers are necessarily dirtbags either, and these equipment guys aren't even doing anything that hurts anything but the pride of douche hats with too much money on their hands.

I just think it's crazy to suggest that a franchise QB that makes more money for lacing up his shoes each day than one of these things sells for would be knee deep in some scheme to produce this stuff.  The truth has to be MUCH closer to ""Skiba handles the merchandise stuff...you sign what he asks you to sign in order to fulfill your obligations.

Wrong. I don't consent to a system of being ruled by a vote so of course I can complain about the coercive nature of such an arrangement.

On the contrary, I am raising my voice right now. The notion of a vote being the same as a voice is nonsense. Your vote matters for nothing on the margin. Besides, a man is no less a slave just because he can vote for a new master every few years. Objecting to enslavement without voting for a new master or casting a vote among the masses for no master isn't going to cut it.

My vision for Natalya is her aggressively manipulating the state of the front line with her shadows, poking until she can find the perfect moment to finish things off with a quadruple Dragon Claw.

We're going to have to agree to disagree about her trait's exact mechanics.

As for the combo system, I was attempting to approximate it with the Shadow Warriors, tying multiple mechanics together in an attempt to distill as much of the Assassin's essence as I could into 5 skills and a trait. She does have two skills from each tree, if you'll notice.

I'm convinced however that the best museum in the world is the British museum. You could wander that place for months and not see everything.
The Tate modern is also pretty awesome, worth visiting for the building itself as much as the collections.

Anyone interested in history should listen to the BBC radio series the history of the world in 100 objects - it's the curator of the British museum charting human history using 100 artefacts taken from the museum's collections. It's a book too, can't remember which one came first.

One thing that's awesome about all major British museums is that they're FREE. The only thing better than knowledge is publicly shared knowledge that's available to all.

Is it how their voice sounds in their native tongue? Maybe a specific dialect inflection that doesn't happen in English? Is it the idea that they are speaking in their native tongue because their mind is so overcome with pleasure that they can't even think in English? Is it that it's a part of them and that's why you love it? Is it the pitch of their voice? 

At the same time, from your partner's perspective: maybe they aren't sure what to say in the moment? Do you indulge in ""dirty"" talk in the bedroom? If so, maybe explain you want them to talk dirty to you in their native tongue. 

I would also reward them each time they do it by giving feedback. ""God, I love the way that sounds."" ""The way you're rolling your r's is getting me so hot. I love how it sounds like a growl."" ""Feel that? That's what that sound does to my body. That's all you, baby."" Stuff like that. 

Maybe if they don't want to speak in their native tongue during sex, would they be willing to do it as part of foreplay?

I'd be willing to do something I feel neutral about for my partner, but I'd probably get more buy in if I knew exactly why they're asking for whatever they want and the ""results"" that happen, it would probably encourage me more in various situations (partner feeling neutral about having sex tonight?

"standupshots","t5_2uxtj","Wait, you're a Christian and you don't know any parts of the Bible that advocate violence? Damn man, that's kinda fucked up. 

Lemme check this sweet thing I've discovered called google:
the story about the Binding of Isaac, son of Abraham,[7][8] God commands Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on Mount Moriah by binding him and placing him on a makeshift altar.[9] Abraham is about to carry out the execution when an angel of God stops him at the last minute.[10]

Violence is part the context of the story of the conquest of Canaan.[11]:319‚Äì320 For example, in Deut 20:16-18 God orders the Israelites to ""not leave alive anything that breathes‚Ä¶ completely destroy them ‚Ä¶"".[12][13] thus leading many scholars to characterize the exterminations as genocide.[14][15] Other examples include the story of the Amalekites and the commandment to exterminate them,[16] the story of the Midianites,[17]:245 and the battle of Jericho.[17]:289‚Äì296

The instruction God gives in Deut 20:16-18 is for the Israelites to exterminate ""everything that breaths"". Van Wees goes on to say that these campaigns were largely fictional.[12][18] In the archaeological community, the Battle of Jericho has been thoroughly studied, and the consensus of modern scholars is that the battles described in the Book of Joshua are not realistic.[19] For example, the Book of Joshua describes the extermination of the Canaanite tribes, yet at a later time in Judges 1:1-2:5 suggests that the extermination was not complete.[20][21]

Likewise, it is not clear if the tribe of the Amalekites were exterminated or not. 1 Samuel 15:7-8 implies (""He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword."") that - after Agag was also killed - the Amalekites were extinct, but in a later story in the time of Hezekiah, the Simeonites annihilated some Amalekites on Mount Seir, and settled in their place: ""And five hundred of these Simeonites, led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi, invaded the hill country of Seir. They killed the remaining Amalekites who had escaped, and they have lived there to this day.""[22]

Scholars point out that collective punishment, particularly punishment of descendants for transgressions committed by ancestors of gentiles, is common in the Jewish Bible.[23]

Make ready to slaughter the infidel‚Äôs sons for the guilt of their fathers; Lest they rise and possess the earth, and fill the breadth of the world with tyrants.[24]


Then I heard God say to the other men, ""Follow him through the city and kill everyone whose forehead is not marked. Show no mercy; have no pity! Kill them all ‚Äì old and young, girls and women and little children.‚Äù[25]


Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.[26]

Have you shared Contrapoints with your friend? They (Contrapoints) do a pretty good job of deconstructing white identity in a way that is constructive, nonjudgmental, approachable, etc. 

A friend of mine's disdain for ""identity politics"" (ie, poc/queer identity politics) was driving him in the direction of WN (I'm eliminating some nuance for brevity). Ultimately he reversed course, or at least idled, after I sent him some critiques of identity politics from the left -- Mark Fisher and some anarchist discourse, mainly. 

Also, the guy in the video describes what is, in my opinion, a pretty reasonable template of a conversation that you can have with a white identitarian. 

But then there's the problem that trying to persuade someone too many times, or trying to lay it on too thick, will likely backfire. Allowing people you care about to walk a treacherous path sucks, but sometimes it's all you can do. Good luck.",1498867452

Secondly, you asserted ""...and thus American values which include men and women only marrying.""  I responded that Trump had promised to be an ally to the LGBT movement, which he did. 

Now, would people who value legally defining marriage as between a man and a woman reasonably assume that a person who calls themself an ally of the LGBT movement would back their belief? Obviously not. Which means that even among the 2nd place voters who did vote for him, voting for straight only marriage could not have been a reason. Which disproves your second point.",1498867454

The war started due to tensions between the colonies of Britain and France in America, the Caribbean, and India, but mostly due to British expansion in North America. This lead to skirmishes, a few small battles, and war broke out when Britain attacked France's merchant navy in the Americas. 

The Prussians understood that there would be a general war breaking out between France (with new ally Austria) and Britain (with Prussia) and did not like their odds. Breaking their alliance with Britain was not an option as that would leave them isolated the next time Austria wanted Silesia back. They decided their best course of action was to launch a preemptive strike into Saxony, as that was the best area from which to defend Prussia from Austria and France. 

So no, America was one of the big reasons why the war started.",1498867455
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was 15 or 16 at the time. At the time I still had my learner's permit and needed to practice driving. My grandma asked me to drive her to this store we all liked that was about 30-40 minutes away. Took a back road. I was going the speed limit and out of nowhere, this beautiful golden lab just runs across the street right in front of me. I couldn't stop or swerve out of the way. I barely had enough time to process there was a dog before hitting it. The dog landed a few feet away. We immediately stop and go to check it out. Dog was not conscious and missing a collar. No blood or visible broken bones but within a few minutes, it had died. We went to the nearest houses (anything within the next half-mile or so that we could see) but no one was around/answering doors. Given the location, grandma said we'd leave the dog. I was young and really shaken up so I just listened to her. She made me finish the drive and drive back.

Dog was gone by the time we drove back. In retrospect, I'm glad this happened when I was so young and that my grandma made me keep driving. I hate that a dog died because of me but experiencing this and being forced to drive made me more prepared for the future. I've been in scary situations before but have never been affected as much. It made me realize that sometimes things just happen when you're driving that you cannot stop or do anything about. Also taught me that a car is a dangerous piece of machinery and always needs to be treated with respect/this cannot be forgotten because when you do, that's when something bad will happen.",1498867455

&gt; Why do we bother learning music theory/scales/arpeggios/sightreading if anyone can learn with enough muscle memory.

You have a lot of contradiction in your post. Music theory is one of the reasons people can play by ear so easily, or come up with arrangements or improv off a melody.

&gt;After all, who is going to listen to us play multiple 20 minute+ sonatas when we can just play Fur Elise or River Flows in You or first movement of Moonlight sonata or Frozen's Let It Go. that we memorized via Synthesia?

I guarantee I can learn any song someone learns through synthesia at least 2x faster with sheet music.


**READING FROM SHEET MUSIC IS WAY MORE EFFICIENT.** Yes, I understand you can learn a piece without knowing how to read sheet music, but saying it's ""faster"" or ""better"" is flat out wrong. And not only that, there's more benefits from knowing how to read sheet music: you can pick up songs you haven't played in years, just by picking up the sheets and going through it a couple times. If you want to learn music without learning how to read sheet music, that's fine - it's your decision after all. But learning to read sheet music honestly takes less than a day to do.

Two pulls is hilariously insubstantial for anyone to make a call. I pulled three Gaffgarions in four pulls on one of the last banners, that doesn't mean he had a rate up just because in that tiny sample set he had a 75% drop rate.

Your saying ""but look how many people have pulled two in two days"" is literally the exact opposite of data that helps. Sure, you should tally it into account. But you're certainly not tallying up the thousands upon thousands of others who pulled two off-banner units (like I've gotten four split across two accounts off-banner) who never even bothered to open this thread to comment.

It doesn't matter what odds you want to calculate. I can flip a coin 50 times in a row and the odds of every flip being heads is microscopically small, but every single flip in isolation is the same 50% chance. If half a dozen people here reported it (in a sample size that's likely to be biased), that means nothing when literally MILLIONS of people have pulled on the banner.

Hell, you'd probably even find someone who pulled two Tiduses on his two pulls in a sampling here, despite the odds of that happening are only one out of every 400,000 people.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Right now and for the past 20 years Spanish speaking citizens have been discriminated against in Catalonia, they don't have access to a public education system in Spanish even though the language is official and monolingual Spanish speakers outnumber Catalan speakers.

Children forced to learn in a language that isn't their native one drop out more often, get worse grades and do generally worse in life. This is why we are the only region that doesn't provide a public education system in an official, majority language. We have been breaching the Spanish Constitution for 20 years. 

No independence party speaks out against this and if we secede Spaniards will lose the right to take government to court for this (which has happened, multiple times).

This is only one of the issues, right now books and advertisements in Catalan are subsidized whereas the ones in Spanish taxes.

Essentially if Catalonia secedes it will ask Spaniards to become either second class citizens or kick them out of their home.


Besides the fact of course that we will not magically be richer or more free, but poorer, less free, less relevant in the global arena and I can bet our already corrupt government gets even more corrupt",1498867460

While it might be nice to have absolute escape sequences in human languages, humans are agents, not machines.

What I mean is that they can choose to violate the rules of the language - there is nothing in their code that prevents them from doing so - and that, in most cases, they actually have incentives to do so, both for deception and for emphasis.

For an example of the former, Alice may wish to cause Bob to (falsely) believe a statement, and so preferences her sentence with the ""the following is the truth"" sequence: ""I swear on my honor that I didn't do it."" As the generic ""I swear"" sequence is corrupted, new sequences come into use; ""I swear on the grave of my father"", etc.

Now, if they somehow figure a way to fit two extra cylinders into their V-6 engine you  might be on to something, but that's not the case.

In the case of Dixon, and I'm sure Ed_Severson might be able to explain better, it might have been yeah you can go on and do it but understand there will be a penalty to pay for doing it or more than likley from the way it sounds the team was willing to eat the penalty in order to get the problem solved.  In sport sometimes you can utilize penalties to work in your favor.  Think about why you commit fouls at the end of a basketball game when down for 4 points.

Also, I think you oversimplify ""fact"". It is very easy to be misleading using nothing but facts. What facts you choose to emphasize, what facts you choose to de emphasize or ignore, how you state the facts, etc. all matter.

We live in a complex world. Politics is complex. It's tempting to latch onto oversimplified beliefs to make yourself comfortable. But, if you are after truth and intellectual honesty, I would advise against it.",1498867464

After 5 days, you add another drug, so you're doing 2 injections every day. The second one stops your ovaries from releasing the eggs

On the final day, you take one final drug (so that's three on the final day) exactly 36 hours before your collection. This stimulates your ovaries to release the eggs, and then you go in for collection.

During the collection, you're under a general anaesthetic (knocked out), and they use a similar thing that they use for the scans (essentially a magic camera dildo) with a needle on the end of it.

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","I don't think you should do anything impulsive, such as leave your wife. You did not mention being in therapy, so if you are not seeing someone, I recommend that you do that and try to figure out with the help of a skilled professional what is wrong and why you feel so sad. The problem may not be your wife. Perhaps she will be willing to go do couples therapy (although you should definitely have your own personal therapy time to work out what is making YOU so sad) and she may be willing to make some changes to accommodate your needs that will improve your relationship. It sounds as though she is dedicated to being with you, although that seems to feel suffocating to you right now, but she may be someone who cares about you and might prove to be an ally as you work this out in therapy. 

UPDATE: After reading your post in the divorce section, it seems as though you've had some problems with living with your wife for some time, but divorce doesn't have to be the first step and it is not a panacea. It won't solve everything. You might ask her to try marriage counseling in light of the fact that you have told her you want a divorce, and see if it empowers you to take some control of your life while staying in the marriage. You could try starting a new hobby, make outside friends, etc. and expect her to support you as you work on feeling better. I still think you should try therapy for yourself, though, to find out why you are so sad right now. Moving out of your home and divorcing your wife won't necessary cure whatever is causing that sadness. Even if she doesn't agree to try marriage counseling, it can be helpful to go into therapy alone, to see if divorce is what you really want to do or if there are deeper issues you need to work through.

I know this sounds minor, but saying for the fortieth time, ""No, she doesn't need diaper cream; her skin is perfectly clear,"" or ""That's still not how those bottles get washed"" starts to be the death of a thousand cuts.

Also, my Ndad put such bizarre restrictions on where I could go to college. It had to have a library of at least a million volumes (this was pre-internet) and it had to have Ph.D. programs.

He tried to pull the same crap on my kid when she was applying to college, and I went serious Old-Testament wrathful on him. the irony is that when she picked a small liberal arts college and loved it, all he could talk about was what a great school it would have been for *him* to go to. I finally exploded one day and told him that the college actually existed when I was applying, and there's no way he would have let me go there. It still didn't shut him up.

"HunterXHunter","t5_2spu5","He's possibly one of the Top 5s. Knowing Netero though, I don't believe that Beyond is the only son of the late chairman ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞). 

Beyond was possibly conceived when Netero has not reached his prime yet so I'd think Netero was 30 or 40 y.o. when Beyond was born making him about 60-70+ years old. 

By the way, it's possible that the top 5 nen users Netero mentioned were basically the people who had been to the DC so that would be 1) Netero himself 2) Zigg Zoldyck 3) Linn Ordorve (I tried) 4) Beyond 5) Ging (since he was said to be in the top 5)

"aws","t5_2qh84","I just did all three of the associate exams in the last 3 weeks starting at the beginning of June (one per week).  It did help that I am between jobs right now so I had a lot of time :(

Anyway,  I recommend the following order:

- Solution Architect (mainly b/c it is the one that is a mile wide and one inch deep and will force you to dig into a lot of AWS which helps in subsequent exams)
- Developer (easiest of Assoc. exams - mostly memorizing facts, not as many scenario questions)
- SysOps (the hardest of the three; almost 90% of the test is longer scenario questions with multiple answers; no True/False questions.  You have to have a good grasp of stuff to excel on this one IMO.  I'd take it last for sure.)

Difficulty rank ( hardest to easiest): SysOps -&gt; SA -&gt; Dev

For training, I used ACloudGuru courses (I got them cheap on Udemy, but even @ $29 on the ACloudGuru website it is a good deal IMO).  I also supplemented Linux Academy course for the Dev and SysOps tests.  

The AG courses are good (Ryan is a good instructor), but I think will only get you 50% of what you need for the exam.  After that, I think LA helps fill in a lot of the gaps that ACloudGuru course. Of course be sure to also read the whitepapers and FAQS!!  Very important - the specific ones to review are referenced in the AG courses.  I printed the damn things out and read them whenever I had extra time.

For practice exams, I highly recommend the Whizlabs tests for SA and Dev.  They are about $16 each I think and include 6-7 exams for each.  IMO if you can hit 80+% or better on these before the test you will be fine.  You will also see a few of the same quiestions from WL practice exams on the actual test.  However, for the SysOps test I found the Whizlabs practice exams waaaay too hard, the questions were kind of ridiculous (and sometimes with incorrect answers).  I don't know if I can recommend them.. :( BUT I guess if you can 50-70% on those you will probably ace the test.  I bought them and was hitting 50% or so and ended up with an 85% on the real SysOps exam.  I found the AG course a little lacking for this exam and used LA course almost exclusively (with their practice exam).

Anyway - good luck!!  I think the exams are good tests of knowledge and you will learn something too.  They are not easy.  For me I was almost at zero with AWS (only played a bit with EC2 VMs in the past) and after studying and taking all 3 Assoc exams I think I learned a lot!  If you are already working with lots of areas of AWS you will probably be much better off than I was.

If you have any other questions, just let me know as the test is pretty fresh in my mind...

EDIT:  I forgot to mention, I also did lots of lab time with the free tier.  If you have experience in AWS it might not help as much, but since I was basically a newbie it was vital (plus I did want to learn this stuff not just pass exams ;)).",1498867469

The hours of making custom brushes coming through. Brushes and integration coding have been tightened up so well the past few years. This allows the us artists to make some awesome stuff without having to try to replicate traditional media strokes perfectly. It just does it for you. I love that. Think about Bob Ross and how quickly he can make something that looks detailed. He was never actually using a lot of strokes, he was using the texture of the brush and the paint within those few strokes. Having that enables digital artists to make something reminiscent of physical media really easily. Before we had vector and raster that you relied upon and bent to. Now the tech is good enough that I can make a big ass piece and it gives me the ability to paint like an oil painter. I know it's not gonna look exactly like a physical media painting. There's dead give always if you know what to look for. But oh damn I just get so excited about these awesome brushes. Aaand wall of text ends.",1498867469

I'd like to inform you that as of now, there is no such option to turn OFF the ""Try Something"" ad on the home screen of the device. However, the feature being requested by many users, this feature was included in the previous update. To help you with this, I've forwarded your suggestions to our development team and they might come up with the possible options available.

Also, I'd like to inform you that there is no motion detection on Echo Show device. However, your device is waking up because of the moments in front of your camera and as of now, there is no such option to disable this. The only option is to disable the microphone and the camera or you can use ""Do Not Disturb"" feature so that Alexa won't wake up unless you give her the voice commands or touch the screen.

Also, I've forwarded these suggestions to our Echo development team. Thanks for the great suggestion(s)!**

Hopefully they get the fact that I (we) don't that ""Try whatever"" on the home screen.

"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","Okay. So the most important fit aspect is always comfort, but that goes double for you. It's completely fine to not wear the size our calculator recommends (which is just a starting point anyway), it's completely fine if what's comfortable for you doesn't meet all the technical fit aspects. For example, normally we'd aim for the band fitting snug enough to not ride up, but you might find that's too tight for you and you're most comfortable in a band that rides up a bit (so you might want to try both 30 and 32 bands, or just start with 32 bands). This process takes trial and error for everyone, but it might take some extra work for you. I'd still start by looking at the sizes recommended by the calculator and looking for the various [signs of a good fit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/wiki/fit_guide#wiki_how_your_bra_should_fit), but don't worry if you have to deviate from there.

If I wasn't using Kim, you would simply find some other gripe about my character choice. All characters have their pros and cons.

I will rest the whole point about dashing into attacks, because in my experience playing as her, there is a delay. But, yeah no concrete evidence there either way.

Reddit, facebook, discord chats is what I'm basing my analysis off of. I play this game more than I'd like to admit lol. The kick flip is the #1 complaint. Followed by maybe her breaker, or the fact that her dash animation is unique.

It can be difficult to discern whether a question is directed at you personally or you in general when a question is written vs. spoken, so fine, I could have worded it more accurately or with less ambiguity. But my message *could* be read either way, so I'd like to clarify it was in fact the general usage and not the direct address form.

First, I'm not even sure this ""bug"" even exists. If it does, it should be fixed. I won't fight that. But I haven't seen any evidence of this in my experience or on the boards/sites I frequent. 

Second, many video games, TV shows, movies, etc. have content warnings for media that may cause motion sickness. If someone knows they get motion sick with a camera ""wobbles"", or whatever the case may be, maybe another game would be better suited for them.

I just watched the morning Joe response, they said that Trump invited Mika and Joe to Mar-a-lago, Joe went alone as Mika didn't want to go. If Mika had just undergone surgery, that would be a good reason not to go. And it wasn't a facelift like he said, she had a chin tuck (tightened up the skin below her chin); she was open about it and told all her friends. 

Trump pressed Joe to bring Mika so they went the following night, were escorted to a bedroom where they chatted with Don and Melania, left after 20 min. Again, if she had recent surgery, it would make sense that she wouldn't mingle with the crowd. I doubt she was bleeding, Donnie has some creepy fascination with women's blood.

They only went twice, Donnie tried to get them to come for New Year's but they declined.",1498867476

"pokemongo","t5_34jka","Exactly, I should have clarified a bit by using the term ""passive"" but this is essentially what I meant. Traits and skills that are inherent depending on the pokemon or pokemon type. (exactly how you explained, just tried to use different words for others to understand)  
  

  
It could REALLY add complexity to the meta which is heavily needed. It would setup, essentially, single counters to a specific situation. For instance, Pokemon A could be heavily countered by Pokemon Qs inherent/passive skill, and ONLY pokemon Q, giving, even more, purpose into trainers searching for Pokemon Q and keeping it for these very specific situations.  
  
Now, of course, it's not necessary, but as Pokemon Go gets older and older and you have more trainers achieving end-game they really need to add in end-game mechanics to keep people playing. Something that builds on efficiency and promotes min-maxing in multiple avenues rather than having the ""flavor of the month"" or static meta which we seem to have currently.

"RWBY","t5_2vhg0","&gt; We know that father might have wanted her to run the company at some point, and we know that Weiss pretty strongly opposed that

I have to disagree here. If Weiss strongly opposed running the SDC, she would not have been so devastated by having her claim to the company taken away. Why would she cry over that if it did not matter to her? Her actions clearly portray that she _does_ care about being the heir to the SDC. It's unlikely she was crying because she was grounded, as we saw, she's more than capable of escaping; which she did.

The way I see it being a huntsman or huntress is more of a side thing. We've seen plenty of huntsmen that do other things as well. We know quite a few that teach, including Qrow; I think it was stated in volume one that he teaches, about 90% certain anyways. Have we actually met a character yet that is just a full on huntsman? I could be wrong but I don't think we have. Training to be a huntsman seems to be the equivalent of someone getting a degree in a certain field in our world. You get it and it proves you can fight, but there are many different paths from there.

I could be wrong, maybe we have met full out huntsmen; though I don't recall any at the moment. The fact that Nicolas ran the company while being a huntsman proves that you can do it. Nobody said you would have to do _all_ the paperwork yourself, I'm fairly certain no company owner does everything themselves.

The two Olympic champions have been trading messages on the social networks, calling each other out to fight.


&gt;Lomachenko says everything was agreed upon, including a rehydration clause on the morning of the fight and then Rigondeaux refused to face him.
""When we started talking to them about a fight in more detail, they put forward different conditions. They demanded the [financial] amount that was required, and we agree with them about it. They made a demand that on the morning of the fight, my weight does not exceed 62.5 kilograms [135-pounds give or take]. I agreed.

I couldn't resist the Hitchhiker's Guide quote, but in all seriousness, a towel is always useful to bring along. Otherwise, I think it depends on where you go. I just got back from the Smokies a couple of days ago. My SO and I hiked ~11 miles in one day, and all we really used was water, snacks (fruit, nuts, two roll-up sandwiches each), and a couple of towels. We took along our go pro for the memories, and since we were in a region where there is a lot of bear activity, we both had whistles.

I drank probably three liters of water (I had a hydration sleeve in my pack), but my SO was also pulling from that, too. I ran out just before we got back to camp, but we also had additional bottles of water/tea. I think I probably drank 2.5-3 liters myself considering all of that.

Let's see, a flashlight is never a bad idea, and neither is a change of clothes (especially socks). Something to start a fire with could be useful *just in case*. If you can handle all that on a 10 mile hike, I think you'll do very well, indeed!",1498867493

&gt;Kid in a Fridge is essentially a ""Wild Wasteland"" encounter. I don't consider it canon any more than I consider holy frag grenades to be. 

but its fucking not. there is no wild wasteland trait and its not a random event like the zetan space ship crash. 

&gt;Not everything in it needs to be taken so seriously,

when did i even say that. if there was a game that said that a race of creatures can only breath in water and in another game they randomly can breath on land with no explanation. wouldnt you think its fucking bullshit? its called internal consistency. its what keeps us immersed in a fictional universe.

so dont be critical what so ever?

what are you even trying to say here?? if i care about a series and a writer fucks something up just dont say anything and never play that series again? really?

"Nioh","t5_39y47","Blood-Stained Cleaver and Usami Nagamitsu are the best Odachi (offensively and defensively, respectively) in my opinion. Elemental rolls are useless when Talismans and Living Weapon exist. Cleaver boosts damage against enemies with full HP (meaning, your first hit, make it count) and Nagamitsu reduces the damage affected enemies deal. The latter is massively underrated, as it's much easier to boost offense than defense in this game.

I highly recommend using Twin Moons, Charging Bull, and Tail Strike in their respective stances, since they are all good and the only skills for Square at End of Combo are the stance-shifts anyway. I personally like these to shift downward, with Low shifting to High, but this is the customizable part. You can follow Sunset Breeze with a Triangle at End of Combo attack, yet another reason to use a setup like that.

Crashing Waves is borderline cheating against blocking humans, Moonlit Snow obliterates Yokai.

Spec is a lot less important than people give it credit for. The main concern is being able to equip your armor at its best Agility rating, having enough Spirit to make use of the passive bonuses, and having the right Onmyo and Ninjutsu. Percentage bonuses and weapon level make the most substantial difference in output.

The best overall sets (in my opinion) are as follows, in no particular order:

- Tatenashi - Damage Reduction, can be mixed with partial sets
- Japan's Bravest - Skill Damage
- Fanatic - Living Weapon (Critical HP)

The elemental sets are also very good, but I think their full potential is in mixing either Red Demon or Gallantry with Warrior of the West and using Onmyo extensively to debuff enemies for more damage. This ties up both melee slots in either case, which the above sets don't do. The weakness of this setup is obviously enemies that resist one of your statuses, and none of these sets are very impressive defensively. Kingo has an honorable mention as well in that like the Elemental sets it has excellent conditional potential, but it also lacks defense, and it's weak when its condition (attacking from behind) is not satisfied.",1498867501

"homegym","t5_2ts8i","I don't care if he's doing well or not. That's none of my business and it's really not relevant at all here. It wasn't really the point of the guy above either. It clearly detracted from his point a bit, because you're still focused on that rather than his real point. Just ignore that piece of it.  The important point here is that object X doesn't offer much more value than object Y.  You could have $5 or $5,000,000 and that really wouldn't change.

You're very first sentence is the problem here.  You're talking about valuing money, we're talking about the value of the object.

You're mixing those things up.  The relevant point is not about what somebody is willing to spend or not spend for x.   Its about the value of x vs y. And in this case it's really really hard to argue that x has enough value over y to justify a few hundred dollar higher price tag.

I don't give a shit what anybody chooses to spend their money on.  But that doesn't mean you can assess whether or not they're making value based purchases.  You can be Bill Gates and still see that if there are two apples from the same tree for sale and one is $0.50 and the other $1.50, the first is the better buy.  The value of money to you does not impact which object offers better value.",1498867501

I'm using Howard as a parallel because he announced he wanted out and had a wishlist a year(with Brooklyn and Dallas at the top) before he hit FA, just like PG. Woj even leaked his team (THE NETS), and the fact that he didnt go there kinda helps my argument, that PG's mind can change easily in a year.

What's happening here, is youre looking at this like its an empty rumor from Woj (of all people, you're going to distrust him?). In all likelihood, it's what Dwight was thinking at the time. And the fact that he didn't sign there, helps my case because teams knew he could change his mind and re-sign with whoever trades for him. To every other team, they're looking at this like a future UFA. Not a guaranteed future Laker. This is pretty much what's happening with PG. 

That's why Boston wants to make the move for PG after they know Hayward is coming. They aren't making a 1 year play, but their offer will reflect an offer for a 1 year rental.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","That (art form) is better than (art form). It's art. You can't compare two different mediums of art. It's like comparing an apple to a leaf. Sure, they both grow on the same tree, but they're not the same at all.

Books aren't automatically better than the movie adaptation, and movies aren't automatically better than theater adaptations. And any combination of these things.

Think of Little Shop of Horrors. The theater production only gives you one perspective: the chair you're sitting in. You can't get behind the characters. But at the same time, Audrey II is always in view, which makes it omnipresent. And, depending on the show, the characters can interact with you.

The 1986 movie doesn't physically interact with you, but the camera allows you to get very close to Audrey II, really seeing how gross it is and ups the scariness of the plant.

If the show had a book, it would most likely be paced very differently in that you'd have plenty of time to connect with Seymour and possibly get a more fleshed out development of his relationship with Audrey. At the same time, Audrey II may be described in such detail that your brain may make it scarier than if you saw it in real life, but you don't actually see it.

Even movies and TV shows are different because in movies, they expect you to sit down and look at everything while tv shows assume you're probably doing something else while watching it. It's why TV shows hardly have silent moments and have dialogue where they explain what just happened because the viewer might be in another room doing laundry, but still wants to know what happened.

So try your best not to compare two art forms.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","&gt; My only argument has been that you can not use information coming from the people who could possibly be behind said conspiracy.

What information have I used that can only ever be found out by looking at files for the government? 

Once again, we know how radios work. We know the basics of GPS because we, as civilians, can make, from scratch, a GPS receiver. 

If you can make a car from scratch, it doesn't matter if the fuel you put in is gasoline, or some government lie. The thing is you know how it works to the point where you can make it. And you can't make something you don't understand. 

The *ONLY* part of GPS the government could by lying about is satellites. I've said this so many times. And once again, the flat earth alternatives are not Viable. Being ground based towers that have to many dead zones, and to costly. Or weather balloons, that wouldn't be accurate enough. 

&gt; You can not argue against this.

Fucking watch me. 

&gt;You've shown that you have a blind trust in science.

Science is an idea, not a closed door corporation. If I mix baking soda and vinegar, and write down that doing so made it fizz, then give that report to someone else, who does the same experiment, and they report the same results. Guess what, that's peer reviewed science. ",1498867503

This is a mistake.

Knock

Moses materialized out of thin air, carrying his Shepard's staff and dressed in simple garments, that (had it been any other man) Jesus would normally not find unattractive. But Moses was no ordinary man.

""My Lord and Savior,"" Moses said, ""what brings you to Egypt?""

""I heard what you did for your people,"" Jesus said. ""I came. To thank you.""

That was mostly true. Jesus came to thank the Shepard, but he would not leave until the Shepard personally thanked him.

""Really?"" Moses stammered. ""You came for me?""

Jesus couldn't help but laugh. ""For you, I'd come any day...""

Moses' eyes widened with pleasure. ""My prayers have been answered.""

He let Jesus inside, not knowing that soon he would be inside of Jesus.

The two men sat at a table for supper.

""Would you like some water? I'm afraid it's all I have,"" Moses said sheepishly.

Jesus chuckled. ""You forget who I am.""

With a devilish grin, he turned the water into wine.

As Jesus took his first sip, Moses teased, ""I know something else you can swallow.""

Jesus choked on his liquor, nearly spitting it out. He felt an intense surge of shame when Moses, as sly as a fox, pulled out a slice of bread.

Jesus cocked an eyebrow. ""Those weren't the buns I was expecting.""

""Oh really,"" Moses said, ""which buns were you expecting?""

Jesus felt his phallus inch closer to heaven, throbbing with the holy spirit. Unable to deliver himself from sin, he reached for Moses' staff. It too inched closer to heaven.

Moses shuddered at the touch. Every nerve ending in his body was a live wire. Unable to resist his desire for the body of Christ, he led Jesus to his bed.

Moses planted feverish kisses on Jesus' lips, slowly migrating to his chiseled jaw, stripping him with his teeth. Jesus wrapped his arms around Moses, firmly squeezing the buns he had been expecting. They were firm.

As he pulled their bodies flush, Moses growled in Jesus' ear, nibbling on the lob. ""Let me take you to the land of milk and honey.""

Jesus was caught off guard momentarily, but a new found excitement coursed through his veins and he turned Moses over, ready to sodomize.

""Jesus Christ,"" Moses said, ""you forget who I am!""

With brute force, Moses flopped their positions, parting Jesus' cheeks like he did the Red Sea. A low moan escaped Jesus' lips.

Moses toyed with the Son of God. At first, he gently kissed his back slowly making his way down to Jesus' tight, pink eye. Jesus egged him on, moaning his father's name in vain.

""Oh God!"" Jesus screamed, as he felt Moses' staff pulse. This was his purpose.

""Bite the pillow,"" Moses commanded. ""I'm going in dry.""

This wasn't the first time Jesus had been nailed, but it was the first time he enjoyed it.

With each thrust, Jesus felt the sting of Moses' burning bush, until his own caught fire, and he was in ecstasy...

He felt Moses tense inside of him. And then he felt the Nile flushing his bowels.

""Thy kingdom cum,"" Jesus moaned.

""That was the milk,"" Moses teased, ""now here's the honey!""

Moses poured the concoction onto Jesus' chest, licking his fingers seductively, and continued spreading the thick syrup until Jesus' phallus glistened. Moses feverishly licked it all, lapping his tongue around the most sacred cock known to man. Jesus squirted his own milk.

""My Prince,"" he says, caressing Moses' beard.

Exhausted, the two men slept for three days, and though Jesus had to leave, Moses vowed to abide by the ten commandments, until Jesus returned for his second cumming...",1498867503

His name's Mike, real cool guy who has an awesome sense of humor. This was when he had long hair, and a beard, back before he went to prison up north. Think a modern looking Jesus, okay? Okay. 

Mike was in a restaurant with his elderly mother in eastern KY, eating dinner. IIRC, it's a Mexican sit down restaurant. Mike says this older homeless guy walks in, and is dressed like Jesus, robes and sandals and all. Homeless guy, let's call him HG, sits down at a table by Mike. Turns toward him, says ""Hello Brother. I'm Jesus."" Mike said ""how do you do, sir?"" HG says ""Good, thanks."" 

HG orders food, asks the servers name. Guess what the servers name is? Yep, J√©sus. HG flips out, says that he is the one true God, and that J√©sus is a mockery. All that blows over, HG gets his enchiladas and goes to pray. Asks himself to bless the food, which he does. At that point, Mike gets up to leave. HG looks up at Mike, says ""when I go home, you'll have to take over, my son."" Mike says ""Thanks for the offer, but I'll have to decline. Sounds like a sweet gig though."" HG: ""it isn't bad.""

"guns","t5_2qhc8","Two things I've noticed when people handle a gun for the first time:

* When their hand is around the pistol grip, they habitually put their finger on the trigger (quite unsafe) when they should have their trigger finger off the trigger, pointed straight.  If you put something on there to remind you to not do that, it'll build muscle memory that may keep you from an accident.  Try a rubber band stretched around the trigger guard.  Your finger will hit it and you'll think, ""Oh!  I'm not supposed to put my finger here!""

* The casually point the muzzle toward things that you wouldn't want to shoot.  Normally they start out pretty good, muzzle pointed toward the floor, or in the air.  Gradually as they feel more comfortable with the gun in their hands, they start to get careless and end up sweeping the muzzle toward people.

* The usual describe a time you were faced with a challenge and how you dealt with it

* What are your strengths + weaknesses?

* How would you deal with a customer who is being 'difficult'?

As others have said, this is pretty much as entry level as it gets. Make sure you seem like a personable dude in the interview, because you are going to be taking calls and talking end users through situations that can be very frustrating for them. 

Even though some situations may seem not very important to a help desk technician, the end user's problem is very real and important to them. 

Also- some people say things like ""Don't study for interviews! Interviews aren't tests!"" In my personal experience, I have done the best at interviews that I HAVE studied for the night before. I have an ongoing document with common interview questions and exact answers typed out that I review every time before I go into an interview.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Yeah...about [that](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2436/co2-is-making-earth-greenerfor-now/)

&gt; A quarter to half of Earth‚Äôs vegetated lands has shown significant greening over the last 35 years largely due to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change on April 25.

&gt; Results showed that carbon dioxide fertilization explains 70 percent of the greening effect, said co-author Ranga Myneni, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Boston University. ‚ÄúThe second most important driver is nitrogen, at 9 percent. So we see what an outsized role CO2 plays in this process.‚Äù

Also an article just published in the journal Nature within the past quarter:

https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v544/n7648/full/nature22030.html

In case it's behind a paywall for you:

&gt; We find that the observation-based COS record is most consistent with simulations of climate and the carbon cycle that assume large GPP growth during the twentieth century (31% ¬± 5% growth; mean ¬± 95% confidence interval). Although this COS analysis does not directly constrain models of future GPP growth, it does provide a global-scale benchmark for historical carbon-cycle simulations.

and in the literature review of this paper we see that:
&gt;This knowledge gap leads to a wide spread of GPP growth estimates from different carbon/climate models, ranging from +5% to +34% over the past century, and from +10% to +52% over the next century.



Edit: Want more direct studies of CO2 increasing crop yields (rather than looking at GPP as a proxy)?

People that go around pretending to be better than everyone else because they ""rescue"" dogs are annoying because they brag a bunch for not doing much, not because the dog isn't a rescue.

Don't limit yourself with a title is all I can say. Some supply chain roles I've interviewed for were a mix of transportation and inventory planning. Some were supply planning. It's a big broad field full of different interpretations of roles. For analyst roles, I've seen across the board that advanced Excel skills are a must. In some companies, the supply chain analyst role requires a few years experience. I've seen people aged 26-35 in that role so don't get discouraged if you don't get any bites immediately.

Once you get the ILS figured out, you'll be able to fly a stabilised approach from 17 miles away in almost any weather conditions. You'll only need to make a few small corrections at the end of your approach, just before touchdown.  This will be the easiest way to fly M+KB.

I kick people off my property trying to sell stuff in front of my store constantly. If its a kid or boy/girl scouts if they ask permission I'll allow them but you can't just roll up without permission and sell stuff in front of another store. 

Funny story, just recently I was standing in front of my store on my cell phone when some lady rolls up with her daughter and start setting up tables with girl scout cookies right next to me. My employee see's them and comes outside to ask what they were doing. The lady begins to lie to the cashier saying that she spoke with the owner and got permission to sell cookies for 2-3 hours. My cashier turns to me and I just nod no. He turns around and tells the lady sorry, but you don't have permission. She starts havin a little hissy fit and says she spoke with the owner. My employee literally just turns, points to me, and says well thats the owner, you can handle it with him and walks inside. I tried not to laugh when I saw the look on her face. 

I tell her she needs to leave and I look towards her daughter and tell her that if she asks me for permission I'll let her come tomorrow and sell the cookies. The mother just grabs their stuff and storms off.

I'm not sure if this is meant to be a rebuttal to when I said...

&gt;That's a false equivalency, because DDR-style rhythm games are not the standard gameplay format of Square Enix games. If FF6 were to be remade for the PS4, it would use the same overall system as all current gen Square Enix games, just like the FF7 remake.

but it's not. Square Enix always tends to take more risks with smaller titles. In fact, a lot of game companies do that. See Hearthstone for a relevant example. That's a 3DS spin off game, and not at all comparable in cost and scope to FF15, KH3 or the FF7 remake.",1498867512

75/25 I'm in a good place with my fitness progression. Making good gains that are very encouraging!

Damage could have been a lot worse) my My Fitness Pal network is growing (I have 3 friends now, lol) but I actually like this and it's good to know others are aware. Kinda like the Instagram thing too. 

The 25 is the clash of depression and a busy schedule. I'm really starting to feel overwhelmed. Getting extra hours at work, Making sure I get to the gym, having hubby working extra days leaves me doing most everything at home. But, for most folks I'm not doing anything abnormal....

I tried to see a trich specialist but the only one in my area did not accept insurance and after four weeks ($100/50 min) of reminding him who I was every time I showed up (and what I was there for) I decided to not give him anymore of my money. Was I wrong?

He was a shitty therapist, nothing wrong with stopping sessions with them. Have you tried finding any other specialist. You can look here : http://www.bfrb.org/find-help-support/find-a-therapist

With fidget toys, you have to find what works for you. Soft fuzzy things work great for me, rubbery / sticky things are terrible. One of my tricks is to wrap a fuzzy craft pipe cleaner around one of my fingers while working. It will stay on my hand, and it provided passive stimulation for example typing this out.  Another option is Habbit Aware bracelets, look like a fibit / sport bracelet but will vibrate when you go to pull. 

NAC is a supplement that you can find, it may help reduce urges to pull. I take 2400mg a day, 1200mg in the morning, and 1200mg around mid afternoon. If you do try you need to commit to at least 6-8 weeks to see if it helps. ",1498867515

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Most Americans wouldn't give two figs on European politics. In many cases the most Conservative European candidate would be a Liberal in the US.  However Le Pen, as far as I understood, ran on an incredibly similar (if probably pared back) platform; France first, less immigration, de-regulation to jump start the economy, a general move towards decentralized government, which I think in the US would mean less Fed Govt involvement (think Trumps drain the swamp concept). Those are ideas which resonate especially with the Trumpian crowd. They are also ideas we don't usually hear coming out of Europe. 

However I agree with you, most Americans cant name another head of state. In general they don't care enough because it doesn't affect us. Not the same the other way. That's most Americans. Hell I live near DC where everyone has an opinion. Its great when someone spouts off about something in Europe and you ask them who the Prime Minister is and they go white.

"metalgearsolid","t5_2s4hr","I don't think Quiet is a waste, per se. She's one of the best characters in the MGSV cast, the problem is just the blatant sexualizing of Quiet overshadows her actual character, but look past it and she has a strong character, it's just told subtly and not pushed on you.

&gt; What about her personality? Why would someone who tried to retrieve Shabani‚Äôs necklace in all those chlorine just for the children‚Äôs happiness, join some organisation like XOF? If she was cold, Skull Face level evilness at first, then how EXACTLY did Venom and Diamond Dogs change her? No mention, not in sufficient detail to justify. With her inability to speak (communicating by text is not viable, it is lifeless and will bore you out), all that‚Äôs left to express this character is body language and actions. With not enough cutscenes, both are lacking. (Though in the cutscenes she was given, it was somehow decent)

She was never evil, in the prologue she comes off more as a killer who's good at what she does and is professional about it. She doesn't try to torture or draw it out, just get it done with. Joining up with Skullface's parasite plot is likely more one stemmed from barbecuing her lungs, which I imagine most people would want revenge for that. Quiet seemed pretty intent on killing you (and toying with you) when they first meet until Punished Snake spares her, which she probably didn't expect. It's like the saying goes, just one small act of kindness can make a big difference. The more you bond with Quiet the more you have each other's backs and support each other. Quiet got to see the man Big Boss is and it brought out the human emotions to her. Listen to Quiet's theme, it's a lamentful song that clearly reflects who she is.

&gt; In reverse, did Quiet change Venom? Nope. This is probably made impossible because of the established canon, which is a shame since she‚Äôs the only one who see Venom as just Venom, not Big Boss or Big Boss‚Äôs phantom (despite Ocelot saying ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in love with the legend‚Äù, I think that Quiet‚Äôs love for Venom is more than that). On top of that, they were similar. They were both tools. They have no identity, or true living purpose. For Quiet, there‚Äôs literally none aside from vengeance, which she abandoned. For Venom, it was just Big Boss‚Äôs orders. If somebody analysed it correctly, that identity is the recurring theme of MGS, then Venom and Quiet could reclaim their identity together. Because Quiet seems a strong woman, she could‚Äôve changed Venom, from a super loyal follower to Big Boss to a human searching for his lost identity. They can make their own mark in the world, driven by their own motives, living in nobody‚Äôs shadows. Hell, it sounds like a fanfic. But this way, more soul can be poured into both Venom and Quiet‚Äôs characters. I really hate to see them wasted like this.

There isn't much to change about Punished Snake. He's been rewired mentally to think and act as Big Boss would. He's got a thirst for vengeance but it's not against Quiet, it's against Skullface. Quiet's was at him, so of course it's a completely different story. Unlike Skullface, Venom has redeeming character points so he was able to show her indirectly he's not that bad whereas I doubt anyone can truly say they like Skullface as a person.

&gt; In the end MGS V created the impression ‚ÄúQuiet came and gone‚Äù. Smaller picture or bigger picture, she made no influence whatsoever despite her potential to be interesting. A solid evidence of MGS V‚Äôs failure in the storytelling department. I‚Äôm sure fans would love great storytelling rather than multiplayer elements‚Ä¶for an universe as rich as MGS, story and characters have always been the core.

I think you missed the point of MGSV. A LOT of MGS V and I mean A LOT of the theme is explicitely about 'impacting and being forgotten.

Skullface essentially sets off the plot of every future metal gear with his actions and the world no longer remembers him by MGS.

Punished Snake is the forgotten phantom, a man who lost his identity for a man he idolized unconditionally and died for in Metal Gear. But the world no longer remembers him, even by name he's just remembered as the medic.

Quiet impacted Venom to a degree with the compassion between them, but she leaves so she never acts on the vengeance she still partially harbors. The world never remembers her by MGS.

Sahelanthropus is forgotten too despite it setting the precedent to Venom how useful a Metal Gear would be to their cause and just how much it would change the game in their war to liberate themselves.",1498867516

"SweatyPalms","t5_2v567","&gt; The ""hanging outside of the skyscraper"" sequence used techniques similar to those on Lloyd's most famous film, the silent Safety Last! (1923). Contrary to some Hollywood lore, this scene did not utilize special effects or back projection. Before the scene in the 1962 compilation film Harold Lloyd's World of Comedy (produced by Harold Lloyd himself), a title card reads as follows:

&gt;""This sequence was made without trick photography and before process was perfected. The action ‚Äî at all times ‚Äî actually occurred as high up as you see it happen.""

&gt;Whilst this is technically true, the impression of height was achieved by the construction of a skyscraper fa√ßade on the roof of another structure: in this case the Southern California Gas Company Building, South Broadway, Los Angeles. Lloyd had already used this technique in Safety Last!, and indeed the location used for that earlier film was only a few blocks away from this one.[2] Additionally, the concluding sequence of the climb, where Harold Horne falls from the building with a rope attached to his foot, does briefly use back-projection for a mid shot.

I'm not sure what more I can do to assist you so you can understand what I say as your replies bear very little relation. I'm going to use as elementary language as I can and see where that takes us.

&gt;What is something Snowden could have released that you believe would be out of bounds?

Let me be real clear here - I don't care. I don't care what is in bounds and what is out of bounds. You're asking probing questions about my ethical framework and I'm not having that discussion with you. I've answered this many times and you have not understood.

&gt;It would be unacceptable when it became shown that we were doing in unnecessarily. The current state of affairs is that the vast majority civilians getting killed are associates of our enemies. If it is impossible to isolate the enemy from their associates, there is no limit.

This was a rhetorical question to illustrate a point. That means you don't need to answer it. Again I do not care what your morals are regarding this, this is why it is a rhetorical question. Just to be really clear here - I do not care what you believe morally.

&gt;You stated that PRISM and our operations in Southeast Asia used the exact same tools. As such, it was the IC and not Snowden who was at fault for wartime operational programs being disclosed. Implying that Snowden couldn't talk about one without the other.

Wrong.

&gt;Am I mistaken in this summary?

Yes.

&gt;Snowden release information about how we were targeting walky talkys in Southeast Asia during an ongoing conflict. That is completely unrelated to PRISM. It as if you are evening admitting it!

Wrong - poor logic and comprehension. They had access to computers and phones. You are trying to narrow this down to PRISM and radio interception only. The tools used by PRISM are not constrained to PRISM.

&gt;Do you agree that Snowden's release of information regarding the targeting of walky talkys in Southeast Asia is completely unrelated to to domestic spying programs liked PRISM?

I don't care either way. It was released, that's what I care about. I'm more interested in the implications. Also PRISM isn't just a domestic spy program.


&gt;Why did you think our SIGINT operations in Southeast Asia fell under PRISM?

Wrong - reading comprehension. 

&gt;Why did you ask for specifics. Why did you seem unsurprised when the other person did not initially detail specifics? 

It was an open ended question to encourage a response. 

&gt;Your constraints beg the question. The issue, for me, is that Snowden could have released the stuff on domestic spying without releasing information on totally separate programs related to our war in Southeast Asia (among other things)

If you don't want to answer that's fine. You don't have to give nebulous excuses. Also Pakistan and Afghanistan are in central and south asia, not southeast asia. I've been traveling to the region enough times for work to be familiar with this distinction.  


Look, you clearly want to drive the conversation in a direction that is of no interest to me. You reinterpret (purposely or not) what I say to fit a different narrative and ask questions that are on a completely different page. I'm not going to reiterate everything again, go ahead and reread it if you want, otherwise there is little more I can do to help you. Setting up strawman arguments just wastes everyone's time. I highly doubt you will suddenly see the light and get off this narrative you are trying to establish. If you do I will answer, if you don't then enjoy the rest of your day.

Did I miss the joke? Because that part always seems really weird and out of place. 

Now that you point out the Whole Foods thing I can see it but at the same time if Artie had been an evil corporate arsehole that would have been pretty stereotypical (plus they did that with the Snyders). I mean, they do show that his store runs other businesses out if town (the local bodega) and isn't all good. My take on it was that progress isn't always good but it's often necessary.

It was Lloyd's second and most popular sound ('talkie') feature. It is also one of his 'thrill' comedies, involving him climbing up a tall building. Harold Lloyd was one of very few silent film actors who successfully adapted to sound.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","I was upstairs at the comedy cellar once and had to go to the bathroom so I walked through the crowd while Chappelle was on. This was the Thursday night before Dave hosted Saturday Night Live and the first and only time I ever went. If you've never been to the cellar it's weird you have to walk right in front of the stage along the whole length of it to get to the bathroom, even if you're upstairs and don't have a seat downstairs for the show.  I'm your average looking white dude and I was wearing a polo shirt. I finished goin to the bathroom and when I walked back out through the crowd Dave stopped his bit and just stared at me the whole time I walked by. The crowd was completely silent. As I got to the opposite end of the stage to hang a left back up the stairs I looked back and Dave still staring at me asked, ""how's the squash game?"" 

Needless to say the crowd died laughing as I walked back upstairs. Chris Rock was there too watching from the stairway, laughing as I walked back up. Pretty cool night, was honored to be mini roasted. 

Later on Dave came up and sat in the booth next to me and my girlfriend and I really regret not telling him I was a huge fan and maybe getting a handshake. Oh well.

There was a big scandal where one pastor's wife slept with another pastor, and I think that kind of shattered the illusion for them. Ever since they've been vigilant not to fall into a group like that again and seriously practice the love thy neighbor stuff.

"Norway","t5_2qwrb","* The median income is significantly higher than in the US - close to 20%. Income is also way more equal, effectively meaning we've got a large middle class (which the US, on the other hand, has lost over the years) that's mostly not too far off from the median income.
* Income taxes are definitely higher, but with various deductions (most notably the one for interest on mortgages) the difference isn't huge, since most Norwegians are home owners. Also, subtract whatever you guys pay for health insurance, and the difference decreases even more.
* Norwegians don't tip much in any context since most people are given fair, living wages. The fact that ""everyone"" gets fair wages also has the side effect of people doing a lot of DIY (Home Depot type stores do very well here) or paying cheaper, foreign laborers under the table, and we don't eat out very often. Comparing the quality of the food and factoring in the ""appropriate"" tip for the server, my experience is that there isn't that much of a difference when it comes to restaurant food. Drinks are a lot cheaper in the US though.
* Norwegians typically aren't as rabidly consumerist as the average American. Most of us don't buy lots of stuff just for the heck of it and for having the latest and greatest. There's a reason why we don't hear a lot about hoarding here or have TV shows called Extreme Couponing.
* I'm sure you're aware of this, but my experience in the US is that VAT/sales tax is usually added at the cash register, even at grocery stores, whereas here you pay exactly what you see on the price tag at the shelf. Easy to forget.

* Most Norwegians still trust their pension schemes (and the real estate market) and are bad at saving and investing. If we indeed are left with less after taxes, it's less noticeable.",1498867523

All the peripherals I've plugged in have been straight up plug and play, including wireless headphones.

Another nice thing for your layout is you can try out wireless and if that doesn't cut it just run some ethernet cable through the attic/walls. My wireless works great but some people have trouble with it, but at least you've got a backup plan. Ethernet cabling will be useful for whatever you might want to do in the future with a given room, as well.

&gt;And how would driving without insurance make it more likely for you to die than driving with insurance? (I'm not defending driving without insurance, fuck those people, but I'm not following here)

Its going off of the assumption that a driver who is driving without insurance is more likely to a more reckless driver so may cause a fatality. 

&gt;It also opens a huge vulnerability to vehicles that weren't there before. Look what happened with the ""Internet of Things"" bullshit, where DDoS attacks were coming from microwaves, ovens, refrigerators, and thermostats.

lol

&gt;People who drive without insurance are a problem, yes, but a system like this is a gross overreaction. I don't know if there's an evidence that a driver without insurance is more likely to kill you on the road than an insured driver, if there is I'd love to see it. I hope it's a significant enough number to warrant something so drastic.
Finally, if somebody who's driving without insurance kills you on the road, you're just as dead as somebody who's driving with insurance.

As you mentioned you are a white-passing mixed race person.

All this talk about mice with keys; are we talking a mouse that has 12 buttons for your thumb? I used a Razer Naga for years and I found that to be the most uncomfortable mouse on the planet.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Few points. 

First the idea that simply banning guns will make them disappear is unrealistic,  the amount of totalitarianism one would have to allow in order to make that happens boggles the mind,  For the US not only would you have to toss the 2nd amendment in the trash but ever other amendment as well in order to send armed police door to door confiscation all the guns.  Any attempted at an outright gun ban in the US would bring about the 2nd civil war...  

I know and understand this next position will not hold any weight with you, and will likely roll your eyes and scoff at it, but any government unwilling to trust me with arms for my own defense,  I am unwilling to trust that government with those same arms. 

This is very idea of individual liberty vs collectivism,  I am not a collectivist, and I reject the idea of collectivism.  I do not believe the government should have more power than the citizens it derives its just powers from,  nor do I believe I am a subject of said government. 

Finally the war on drugs has proven any prohibition would be less than effective,  I see the war on drugs as the largest assault on civil liberty since slavery, a ban on guns would only serve to make the War on Drugs look like a fun day at Disney with the level of violence that would bring,   the anti-gunners like yourself believe it would solve violence,  but it would bring about untold bloodshed...

Having said all that,  I at least respect your position more than the ""Common Sense"" gun laws people,  at least you are fully honest in your goal....

"leanfire","t5_38u7g","It may be fine for you , particularly if family oriented. I cannot really advise with my limited experience in that area as my priorities are completely different. That however, is my idea of a personal hell with the exception having easy access to the outdoors for adventure. 

Places that have almost zero diversity with respect to ethnicity and thought are deal breakers for me. The lack of convenient airport access is also not for me based on travel frequency. I live above downtown in a fairly liberal, for Utah, area with lots of both and it is a good fit. 

With respect to longer term considerations, Salt Lake County and Utah County are becoming very different with the former losing Mormons at an alarming rate, many doing exactly what you propose, buying larger less expensive homes in more suburban areas particularly in Utah County which is a solid fit. It is a bonus that the other feathers are flocking there as well which further accelerates the tipping point.

It sounds like step one is working on your confidence! What are your hobbies? Maybe you could pick up something new to help practice talking to and meeting people :) For some people, working out and changing their body is also a great way to unlock confidence. 

Maybe you could also ask your friends if there's anything else you could work on. Things like hygiene, dressing well, being a healthy weight, and putting in effort are things that can make you more attractive (not necessarily just to the opposite sex, but as someone people would like to get to know!). 

Remember to treat women like people and not put them on a pedestal, and don't date someone just because it's an option, wait until you like someone. Try not to make finding a date/girlfriend your primary goal - work on your confidence, meet new people, and then you'll have set yourself up well for when the right girl comes along :)

I say this because that is my situation.

For instance, my whole childhood, from the time I was born, until I moved out of my mother's house was traumatic and completely unstable. However, I was able to power through that situation just fine, and without raising any red flags to any of my teachers or other adults. I was a good student, making straight A's etc., well behaved, very responsible, reliable, and pretty much the opposite of what people expected me to be given my situation. However, within four years of living on my own and as I started to gain my on stability by attending college, holding down a full time job, buying my first house etc., my fianc√© killed himself - which I woke up to hearing the gunshot and him lying next to me in the bed with half his head blown off. Now this sent me into my first mental breakdown a few months later, which took me years to recover.

However I did, I got a job and started to get my life stable again. Had a family, a job making decent money - ~$50k/year in the MW, which is a good amount since my then husband made the same amount. But within a year of having my new job, I was robbed on the anniversary of my fianc√©'s death, yet I pushed through. Several years later, my marriage deteriorated, and I was offered the opportunity to transfer, so I did. I took a bonus and my company paid close to $20k to move me across the company. However, within 2 months of living in the new state, where I had no family and knew no one, I was injured on my job. Within a year of my injury I found out that I could no long do the work that I'd previously done, so I had to resign and go back to school.

-
Since being in school my life has been one medical mishap/anomaly after the other, which has prevented me from working, though I do work part time at my university as an undergrad research, where I'm co-authoring a paper based on my life &amp; education. However, every medical mishap I've had, and the fact that I have little-people - my children - depending on me that I'm barely able to care for, and my illnesses has caused my anxiety to come back almost to where it was after my fianc√© died. Moreover, every time I think that I've got a handle of my situation, something happens and knocks me back again i.e. I almost died early Father's day from an illness called serotonin syndrome. 

-
So, while psychological resilience is a big factor in anxiety, I'd like to point out that sometimes a person's life is such that, there's no amount of resilience s/he can have that will prevent them from suffering from severe anxiety - that's what is happening to me right now. I'm in therapy, and on meds because I have other mental illnesses; however, the severe anxiety is something that I've only dealt with twice in my life. And that's right after my fianc√© passed, and now. 

-
I'm pretty sure, or at least I'm hopeful that I'll get through this because as everyone keeps telling me, I'm very strong and resilient, however, it's not as simple as a determining what a person's resiliency level is. Rather, sometimes a person's life is such that, there's no level that a person - any person - could possibly have in which they could overcome and/or withstand all of the trauma and/or unforeseen events.",1498867532

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","I want to add that ""all the way up"" should be ""100%"", a lot of games will allow you to go *over* 100% in resolution scaling, allowing for supersampling, but this comes with an appropriate reduction in performance. 

Generally, you don't want to have resolution scale at anything besides 100% when you're feeling out the performance of the game on your system.

If you've already turned all the quality settings to max and your GPU *still* has performance to spare, then you can raise resolution scaling above 100% to get a sharper image and reduce jaggies. 

EDIT: just noticed you're running at 4K. Yeah, unless you have a super monster system, it might be tough for your system to maintain 60fps at a higher-than-4K resolution scale. Try it at 100% and if you find you can't maintain 60fps, then you can lower this option to have the game render at a lower resolution to increase performance, but keep the UI and text 4K-sharp.

If I knew *in advance* that at the end of the fiscal year, my total expenses would be $1,000,000, and during Stampede, I made a net profit of $1,000,000, then the math kind of works out. The thing is, I *don't* know at the beginning of the year what my total expenses will be.

At the beginning of the year, I don't know if a new competitor will come into my space and impact my sales. As legendary and seemingly perennial as Cowboys is, it could happen. I also have no idea what next year's federal and provincial budgets are going to do to my taxes. Nor do I have any idea if due to continued downturn in the economy, will I be able to charge the same per-drink price as I was prior to the downturn.

In a retrospective fashion, sure I suppose one could hypothetically say that they covered that year's total expenses with the profits generated during Stampede.

Furthermore, in a more fundementally sense I think the whole modern understanding of truth as merely subjective to be a false epistemology: truth is both subject and object, in fact, you could say it is the marriage of subject and object. We can understand substance and essence, we just have to do some work discerning the accidents, because, as Aristotle notes, we understand substance as an accident.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","**Part 5: ‚ÄúAdventures in the Underground City‚Äù** (Title courtesy of 7th)

Louis straightened out as he headed back to the library. The old man might be a code red threat sometimes, but it was easy to calm him down if you knew what to say. *For a guy that Hayden kept warning us about for bein‚Äô unpredictable, he‚Äôs got a pretty one-track mind.* Louis found the door and was ready to open it. He couldn‚Äôt wait to go back to his chicken salad sandwich, and the book by that Satan guy was pretty neat too. If Louis was lucky, everything would be as he left it.

Louis wasn‚Äôt a lucky man. These psychos managed to trash the entire goddamn library. They shouldn‚Äôt even be able to scoot the bookshelves, let alone flip ‚Äòem! At least two people were in critical condition, and one of them was a custodian. That would be a bitch full of paperwork. Louis felt an aneurysm coming on, and a merciful god would have let his brain burst before he heard *that* voice again:

‚ÄúOh, hey Louis! We were just tidying up! I know this looks bad, but we got it!‚Äù

Louis could only see red for a minute, then took a deep breath. Then another. Then another. Tomska interrupted his breathing by shoving a book in his face.

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs okay though, we saved your book.‚Äù Louis looked at the book, with Hercule‚Äôs smiling face and addressed to him, Satan‚Äôs biggest fan. It was the closest Louis would get to a silver lining, so he guessed he had to take it.

‚ÄúTh-thanks, Tomska.‚Äù Louis cleared his throat ‚ÄúNow, all of you get the hell out of this library, or I will tase your balls off.‚Äù

‚ÄúUm, two of us are girls.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a robot lacking genitals.‚Äù

Louis was seeing red again. ‚ÄúJust. Get. Out.‚Äù Everyone left. Louis surveyed the damage and casualties. ‚ÄúHm, I could have sworn I had a bookmark.‚Äù Everyone froze, expecting it all to come crashing down. ‚ÄúEh, It was real hectic. Must‚Äôve been my imagination.‚Äù Our heroes left immediately.

As our prisoners returned to their cell, FF looked at the stand disc, examining its surface. *How could Hayden get this? If this disc was here, then Whitesnake and its user had to be nearby. Would the two even be willing to work together?*

‚ÄúSo, Foo. What is the disc? You said it might be more important than the keycard. Why?‚Äù

Roberta‚Äôs question snapped Foo out of her thoughts. ‚ÄùWell, you guys know how I‚Äôve been talking about stands, right? See, there are a couple ways to get one. Sometimes you‚Äôre born with one. But there are ways to get one artificially. The first involves a special arrowhead. If you get cut by it and possess a lot of willpower and strength, you get a stand. If you‚Äôre too weak, you die. Or, you can bypass that and just get a stand disc inserted into your body.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere do these stand discs come from?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this evil priest named Father Pucci. His stand creates discs that can take other people‚Äôs stands and souls. Taking someone‚Äôs discs puts them in a coma, eventually killing them. The stand becomes a disc, and just about anyone can use it. I was made by a stand disc, in fact.‚Äù FF let the information sink in.

‚ÄúFascinating. So, if we insert that disc in ourselves, we can use the stand‚Äôs gravity powers?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure how it would interact with you, Sonny. Only living things have been able to use discs. And it‚Äôs not like the janitor controlled it well. Jumpin‚Äô Jack Flash‚Äôs power could require some kind of prep, otherwise we would also be at a disadvantage using it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, what do we do with a stand disc we can‚Äôt really use?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor now, we just keep it. Whoever has these will want it back, and when they come looking for it, we grill ‚Äòem for answers. Besides, we got the keycard out of it, so this was a major success.‚Äù

As they took their places at their cots, Sonny remembered something important. ‚ÄúHey, Tomska. Remember the team name you were thinking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou remember that, man?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. I‚Äôve thought of something.‚Äù Sonny thought back to Carolina‚Äôs taunt. ‚ÄúHow does *Team Freaks and Geeks* sound?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike the show?‚Äù

Sonny raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat show?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù Tomska muttered as he flipped through Hercule‚Äôs book.

Louis headed to the warden‚Äôs office, taking his sweet time. Warden Samuel Hayden was unsettling. His mechanical face was emotionless, making him hard to read. Louis had his doubts that Hayden was ever human, although Hayden proved him wrong by revealing his brain. *That gave me nightmares for friggin‚Äô weeks.* Combine that with Hayden‚Äôs superior attitude and mechanical inflection, Louis was always uncomfortable around his boss. Still, a job was a job, and this prison guard gig paid very well. He opened the massive door to Hayden‚Äôs office, almost curious how he would respond.

‚ÄúAh, Louis. I trust you abandoned your post in the library when you were ordered?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes sir. I took care of the old guy, and I came back to a goddamn war zone.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe library can be replaced easily. What of the other prisoners?‚Äù

‚Äútwo in bad condition, but they‚Äôll pull through. The young girl though, she‚Äôs long gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúInmate casualties are an acceptable loss in this prison. What isn‚Äôt acceptable is losing a stand user‚Äôs disc.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe janitor. I used him as a challenge for both teams. His death was expected, almost necessary. But his stand power, his disc. Is. Missing.‚Äù

Louis was sweating now. He had forgotten bits of Hayden‚Äôs speech on stand users, and the disc had slipped his mind completely. ‚ÄúLook, sir. It might be left behind in the mess. We can recover it.‚Äù

Samuel Hayden didn‚Äôt raise his voice, but his disappointment was clear. ‚ÄúNo. You don‚Äôt simply lose something that valuable. Hmm. Foo Fighters, she has been in Green Dolphin before. She‚Äôs either destroyed or stolen the disc. Send someone to search for and retrieve it. We don‚Äôt need any wrenches in our plan.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir. I‚Äôll get on that‚Äù Louis figured it would be safer if he didn‚Äôt mention that he had no clue what the plan was. He eyed the large cd rack on Hayden‚Äôs desk. *Are each of those stand discs?*

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù Hayden reclined behind his massive desk, following Louis‚Äôs line of sight. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you are curious. Yes, each of these discs is a stand. Taken from a wide variety of timelines and users. Not just their stands, but their very souls and beings. Every one of them is crucial. Hopefully this makes you realize the importance of this task. You are dismissed.‚Äù

"LetsTalkMusic","t5_2t4it","&gt; Most young people I know can't stand the Beatles and they shouldn't be recommended to them. That music is fifty years old. If someone had suggested my grandfather's music to me when I was 17, I'd kick them in the balls. An introduction to music should begin with sounds that a person is familiar with. No more than ten years old.

What? I know a lot of people who like the beatles. Almost everyone I know who's gone through a musical journey is a fan of the beatles. I'm not saying they should be the first thing you listen to, but if I were to give someone 50 albums to start with there would definitely be a Beatles album in there somewhere. Might even put Pet Sounds on there as well, which I only just got around to today actually. I agree with your premise that accessibility is the main factor in intro lists, but I disagree with the idea that the time gap effects accessibility as absolutely as you make it out. 

If I were to introduce someone to metal, I would definitely start with with Black Sabbath. Even though that music is much older than ten years, it's way more accessible than most metal music will ever hope to be. My friend just made me an ""Intro to Jazz"" playlist, and while I haven't started it just yet I think it's a safe bet to say that most of it isn't recent. For an intro list I would probably focus more on having a wide range of genres represented by their most accessible/known stuff, and I think sticking to recent stuff is an unnecessary restriction (and perhaps a little out of touch with the today's youth). 

&gt;I'm not very familiar with the albums on that 2016 list, but it's the Essentials, which you have just endorsed. 

No where does that list say it's an essentials list, so I assumed it to be top 2016 albums as the title stated. I was saying it was a shitty top 20 list, it would definitely make more sense as an essentials list though. That said, just because I think essentials lists are valid doesn't mean I think every essentials list is good. 

As for the best way to get ratings/reviews, I totally see what you're saying. It would be silly to make cities restrictions; I think you only need people with diverse music tastes. And I think you should have more than one person on each genre so that you're getting fair opinions. So I would say every critic gets 2 main genres. Every critic skims the full album list once(maybe like 300 albums), giving a couple notes on them. Then the critics go deeper on the albums in their specialty field and write more detailed reviews, with perhaps some help from the other guys' passing comments. I prefer a larger amount of critics who have very deep understanding of the genre then a few critics who have a diverse pallet. 

Year end lists are definitely good intros as long as you get the right list (IE not the list you linked lol). Fantano's list is probably the best I've seen so far, even though some of his reviews are shit. Those give the listener a good idea of what a masterpiece looks like, perhaps in a genre they wouldn't usually like. And then they get a nice perspective of music and better understanding of their own tastes. However, I wouldn't recommend that unless they have already started their journey; that's for when they've already finished the appetizers, so to speak. When they've just stumbled in to music and their hungry for more. ",1498867538

"Amd","t5_2rw0n","&gt; Please tell me why less than 10 percent?

That's simple actually. How many times after a GPU was released you saw a double digit performance increase **all over** the board? Specific games sure as GPU drivers are basically a bunch of hacks to make these work properly. But actual performance increase in ALL situations? 

I recall RX 480 getting a 5% increase in performance due to PCI-E power consumption bug when they have reprogrammed IR3567B controller to offset power taken from PCI-E port compared to 8-pin and in the process gave card a bit more power to work with. 

This move you can't repeat with Vega as it's already as power hungry as it goes - 350W to make it reach stable 1500 MHz. 

So let's move to a previous generations to look for info. R9 290 and HD7970 aged extremely well but from the very start they offered sufficient performance. HD7970 was de facto named the fastest card from day 1, R9 290 went toe to toe vs 780. 

And we can't claim that ""this Vega has unfinished drivers/shouldn't be tested in games"". It's a finished product that arrived to the market and is aimed for semi-professionals. It has game mode too which AMD itself claimed to be capable of ""just playing games"" (albeit a bit outdated apparently). It's not an engineering sample, you won't change much in the last 20 days or so till RX Vega is supposedly being released.

So while drivers do make or break a video card - this card already has them. We can expect improvements over time as usual with new cards but it won't suddenly close a 30% gap it has from 1080Ti. It also won't solve underlying problems with architecture as a whole like DX11 overhead (which is probably responsible for at least some of Vega problems as it scales worse than Fury which makes no sense) and seemingly same imbalance that haunted Fiji - insane computing power bundled with too little ROPs. 

I personally am expecting an RX Vega to be 15% faster than FE. That's assuming the latter to be overvolted ""for stability"" and thermally throttling. If it can hit 1600 MHz on a consistent basis then it's a start. Any driver updates on top of that are a nice addition but I doubt they will account for that much. Would love to be mistaken. Still, 20% is what this card needs to beat 1080 on a regular basis and be a decent alternative (as it still will want almost twice as much power). Still a long way to Ti from there. ",1498867540

ACIII is the hardest of those IMO by far, it has some very tricky optional objectives in the campaign. Two tips: 1. do NOT upgrade your ship's battering ram, one of the mission optional objectives is easier without it 2. the board games against Achilles are ridiculously difficult, (Fanorama and Nine Men's Morris), but there are websites you can use to recommend good moves (you play Achilles' moves, then use the website AI as your next move in the game). 

You should probably do ACIII multiplayer trophies first, among all those games, before the community gets too dead. Fortunately most of ACIII multiplayer trophies can be done in Wolfpack solo mode. Then do AC4 multiplayer for same reason. AC4 requires more multiplayer grinding (Level 50). 

btw on AC4, on PS4, I had the Sea Legs naval missions trophy glitch out and not pop for me (even when I replayed the final mission), so I recommend making a USB or PSPlus backup of your save before doing the 15th and final mission.

Unity and Rogue are both very easy Plats. All the single player content on Black Flag, Rogue, and Unity is pretty easy except for a few of the Legendary Ships. Unity's melee combat can seem hard at first but once you learn the cadence, and upgrade weapons and armor, it gets much easier.

About a year ago I had minor surgery on my teeth to fix and issue with my Invisalign and speed up the treatment.

So everything at the dentist went well and on my way home I decided to sign up for a membership at the gym. I couldn't speak clearly because my face was numb but I figured we'd find a way to make it work and it'd be funny.
I'm sitting there waiting for her to look things up so I'm text my GF. Suddenly this giant string of drool lands on my phone. Embarrassing as hell until I realize its blood. I quickly grabbed a paper towel that I lucky thought to bring and wiped it up and wiped up my face.
The woman at the desk didn't realize. Okay good. Moving on.
I hold the towel near my mouth and continue. She stops and asks if I'm okay and I play it off again
Then I realize the whole entire paper towel is soaked with blood and I'm bleeding everywhere
I rush off to the bathroom. BLOOD. EVERYWHERE.
I clean up and stuff some towel in my mouth. I left my backpack in the room so I walk back to where she was AND SHE STARTS EXPLAINING MEMBERSHIP OPTIONS TO ME
Seriously!?!?
So I grab my bag and just peace out mid her sentence
I call my doctor and she says to put a steeped tea bag on it.
Great, except I don't have a kitchen and all my stuff is in boxes because my whole appartment is under construction
I can't even just go to the grocery story because I have no way to get warm water
So then I have to go into this pretty nice cafe across the street bleeding everywhere and ask politely for a cup of tea to go
the guy, clearly stoned, just stares at me with no idea what to do
AND THEN HE ASKS ME WHAT KIND OF TEA
I. DON'T. CARE. JUST. GIVE. ME. SOME. GOD. DAMN. TEA!
and then I had to walk into my appartment where the whole construction crew is, still bleeding everywhere and casually holding a cup of tea like its no big deal.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","So the question becomes what you can do with $32,000 over 6 years that keeps it liquid enough for you to use, keeps it completely safe from loss, and allows it to grow.

You really can't get all of those things. Any investment faces the risk of loss, so there's definitely an argument that you should just put it in a checking account and use it as sparingly as possible.

You could put it in a VERY safe investment account, but obviously security comes without much opportunity for gains. Something like a Municipal Bond Fund could work, but they grow at 4% max. Over 6 years, if ALL the money is in there, that turns into about 7k for you, but obviously it won't all be in there for the whole 6 years. Additionally, the money isn't fully liquid there; it'll take time and fees to pull it out.

The fact is that 6 years isn't really enough to turn huge gains unless you don't need the money and can use more volatile investment vehicles. I'd put it in a Money Market account, make your 2-3% to keep up with inflation. Otherwise, just put it in savings.",1498867545
"OCLions","t5_2u29i","I think he'll start. Kreis wants and honestly needs this win. However, I'm not thrilled about Larin returning so soon. These past 3 games have exposed some serious issues we need to address. Most of them come down to our lack of team play. We just aren't playing as a unit. His finishing skills are excellent, he's got a natural talent for knowing where to be. Larin's kinda been a band-aid for us. like our play depends on someone gifted to be parked in front of goal cleaning things up. I know fitness is huge for Kreis, but I'd love to see us improve our dynamics, our plays and spread out a little more. We just clear the ball far too often, and bunch almost as frequent. I'd really like to see us work on playing/depending on Larin, even if we need to lose a few more to get there.

I think it's fun to figure out how to extract the maximum potential out of a cheap setup. No manometers, no PID, just using a bottomless PF to tune preinfusion, tuning the pressostat, and being observant of flow during flushes.

"TwoBestFriendsPlay","t5_2uzei","Dude. I tried to write for them. After two weeks where I had nothing to write for because none of the leads would actually give me something, and I couldn't write my own stuff because *every faction and player was ""locked in""* despite none of them actually being written and none of the work for them being anywhere complete, and after the *fourth time* someone brushed off a serious issue with ""We don't have to worry about that because Fallout 4 is a bad game and we;re a good game!"" (including once about LEVEL GEOMETRY), I just fucking left. The way they are organized is not a way that leads to a good game being made.

Making a game story work is hard. It's not simple. It's not a matter of ""just care about the story, lol!"" or ""just write a good story, lol!"" You have to make a lot of pieces fit together. You have to know what you are doing, and do that thing. Obsidian's sentence quality was good, but they failed at a LOT of the ways to actually make the game, you know, work as a game. Fallout 4 fixes almost all of these problems; the sentences aren't as good but the game is a coherent thematic experience instead of a sentence-delivery platform that's ashamed of its own mechanics. You know what would make a really good Fallout game? Someone who paid attention to all the ways FO4 improved on how to tell the story, and then used those things to tell the story much better, instead of ignoring them and handing out grognard tugjobs and sticking to old, dysfunctional ways of doing things because ""LOL Todd the Liar stole the RP from my G!"".

And it makes me despondent when I see the circlejerk about Fallout, because it's based in praising New Vegas for things is did not do and was harmed by not doing, and condemning Fallout 4 for not doing things it did way better than New Vegas. Because I want good Fallout games. I want them to have good stories that are told well. Fallout 4 was a huge fucking leap in how to do that. You're going to ensure that development goes unused and ignored, so you can continue jacking off in each other's mouths about how ""morally grey"" the Legion is but how the actually well-characterized Institute ""doesn't make sense"" because nobody ever explicitly pukes a wall of exposition at you explaining their actions are due to their irresponsibility. You want to ignore people developing the technique of how to tell a game story well, so you can just keep pretending it's easy.",1498867546

I'm gonna be real with you, finding a good used car in that price range is not impossible. But you are going to look at a lot of clapped out vehicles and need to be patient. Edit: You won't find anything that new with 110k or less for $3k. Not without something wrong with it. Maybe look for a higher mileage vehicle, condition is more important than mileage anyways. If you want your criteria to be met tbh I think you need to spend closer to $8,000-$12,000

Be wary of automatic transmissions that old. A lot of people never change the fluid and the pieces of transmission in said fluid are often all that hold it together. If the fluid is black and dirty, be leery. I prefer buying cheap manual vehicles because the transmissions are far less likely to fail.

You're looking for a diamond in the rough. Look for good mechanical condition, it will probably be beat up to some degree. Everything you look at in that price range will need work.

What kind of work can you do yourself? And what kind of problems are acceptable? Does it need a new transmission? A new front end? Probably a bust. A timing belt job and some hoses? Maybe a little better choice. Five or six small leaks and a tune up? Good candidate. The vehicle should be otherwise well maintained and in good condition aside from whatever problems that are causing the owner to sell it. If it needs a large repair, or multiple medium repairs start stacking up walk away, live to buy another day.

If you can't wrench, spend more money on a car, unless you want a beater to drive into the ground for the next year or two or make your mechanic rich. Labor will kill you in this price bracket, but parts are usually cheaper on an old car.

Ignore brand and model. A clapped out Toyota will be a poor choice over a well maintained Chevy. How the vehicle was maintained and used during it's life is whats important. Poorly maintained old vehicles will break down on you. Well maintained old vehicles will continue to run and drive.

My current car I paid $2,000 for with 186k miles, spent $500 on parts fixing leaks and some minor worn components. It's been very reliable, and it's at 207k now. 

Be fast, and have cash in hand. Good stuff on Craigslist goes fast. The trash sticks around. Check out IFTT if you don't have it. It can notify when new stuff shows up so you have a better chance of nabbing something good. If you want to pay $3,000 for a car, be patient. If you aren't patient, spend more money.    ",1498867547

Our brains deal with things in various different ways.  Anxiety is a stress response.  The way we feel is mostly moderated by regions in our midbrain. As animals and the structure of the brain evolved, the more developed parts kind of grew on top of what was already successful.  The hindbrain is one of those early more successful bits, and its role is to coordinate some of the more complicated systems like motor control, our breathing, our sleep, autonomic behaviors.  Having this lets you be a more complex organism that can do things like breathe instead of needing a way to passively absorb oxygen.

Past that, one of the simpler successful structures that evolved was the Amygdala.  This is in the midbrain, so after the hindbrain, as part of the system that influences your behavior. The midbrain does some more sensory processing, so it handles things like vision and hearing, alertness, motivation, sensitivity to temperature.   The amygdala works in conjunction with your sensory perception does some processing and based on that processing, makes your body spit out hormones like adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol.  These go to other parts of your midbrain and which activate parts that tell you to be alert, to be motivated, to be careful and to be distrustful (more or less). 

So when you see something that the brain has evolved to treat as bad (like the color of blood, or something very large), or more advanced, if you see something that causes you to recall something that has caused you stress (like a clown after seeing IT), it responds by spitting out these hormones and making you feel stress, anxiety, motivation, anger.

Next there's other parts of your midbrain that are a bit more advanced that have more to do with advanced planning in your limbic system, and they deal with hormones that moderate your feelings of satisfaction and drive to accomplish long-term goals, like seratonin and dopamine, or your feelings of attachment and family like oxytocin. These are less important for some animals, if an animal has to eat when it's hungry, run when it's hurt or being chased, mate when it's near a suitable mate, and ignore its babies, then you can get by without the energetically expensive parts of the brain.

But we're very social, and very smart, so we have the extended version.  And they conflict, sometimes long term planning means needing to override a stress response, so they interact, one suppresses the other. 

Next there's the forebrain and this is where it gets really messy.  This is the part where we think, and plan.  While the midbrain gives us the motivation to go after longer-term goals, that's more in the Pavlovian sort of ""if I hit this button now, I'll get a treat soon"".  The forebrain is what tells us ""If I take these seeds that I can eat and plant them, then in 6 months I can collect more seeds, and have a bunch of food to eat."" and it needs to override the other parts of the brain that are saying that those seeds look good to eat right now.

So back to anxiety.  Everyone's different. And just like some people have longer legs, some people have more or less receptors for some hormones, or more or less sensitivity to them, or they make them at different levels. Not too wildly different, but a little bit.  I mean that's how we evolved to this point at all, our ancestors were a little bit different than them, and over millions of years, we're able to use our thinking to suppress our fear better than our ancestors of a million years ago could because that has been generally advantageous to our population.

So now fast forward to now, we're smart, we can think about a lot of things, understand things that are going on, we're asking questions about why people have anxiety disorders and others don't.  We can recognize that there's a difference.  At the same time, we have systems that allow different signals from different parts of the brain overriding eachother, but these systems are more or less sensitive from person to person because of just how they get put together.  So for some people, it takes a lot more contribution from the anticipation of good results from whatever it is you're trying to do to override the fear of something bad happening while you do it than it does for other people. 

Most people are within a certain range. Not too anxious, and not too tolerant of risk. Some people fall a little further out so that it's noticable, and some people are so far out that it becomes obvious that it affects their ability to function. 

Then you have the fact that our forebrain still goes and messes things up.  A big part of how we handle fear, stress, anxiety is based on how we recall memories. When we associate something with a stressful memory or conceptualization, it triggers that stress response, which then becomes a memory itself.  You can start to become anxious about becoming anxious essentially. So not only do we have the ""how your brain happened to grow?"" part of the equation, we have the ""what have you learned?"" part of the equation as well, and I think the majority of people can develop anxiety issues through experience.  Those that can't would be the ones whose brains are the most resilient to that, and who might start to have problems with ignoring risks.

But essentially, some people are going to have anxiety disorders no matter what they do because that's the way they're wired.  Many more people will have anxiety disorders through a combination of experience that triggers a sort of self-perpetuating effect and possibly a minor predisposition to it based on their neurology.  Many people will have no anxiety disorder because they've not been exposed to that sort of experience that triggers them, but could develop it under other circumstances, and few others might be very unlikely to experience anxiety, even under circumstances where it would be expected or beneficial. 

If you do suffer from anxiety disorders, you can manage it with drugs that affect the way your brain handles those hormones in your brain, or you can learn how to break that self-feeding cycle and learn how to avoid triggering it.  However, depending on what's the cause, one or the other might be a better or worse choice.  If your issue is primarily related to an issue with neurotransmitters or receptors, it might be not enough to just learn to avoid triggers.  

But despite all of this, we're still really not very good at understanding or manipulating our brains.  It's hard to tell whether it's one thing or another that's causing it in any person, and treatment is often a bit of trial and error and going with the least worst solution. 

But when we label something as ""anxiety disorder"" it sounds like it's some kind of problem like chicken pox with an obvious cause.  But in reality it's more like asking why some people have height deficiency disorder and others don't, where you define ""height deficiency disorder"" as when a man is shorter than 5'8"". The reality is that everyone's just a different height, some people are 5'6"", some are 5'7"", some are 5'8"", some are 5'9"".  Some people are 4 feet tall, and some people are 7.  Some people are short because of malnutrition, and some people are very tall because of a hormonal problem. Sometimes it's genetics. Some are tall with long legs, some are tall with a long back.  But in the end, regardless of the cause, some people hit their heads on door frames.  

People have an anxiety disorder for different reasons. Unreasonable anxiety comes from the interplay of numerous systems, including your experiences. It's really hard to tell specifically why in any individual.",1498867548

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortious_interference
""Tortious interference with contract rights can occur when one party convinces another to breach its contract with a third party (e.g., using blackmail, threats, influence, etc.) or where someone knowingly interferes with a contractor's ability to perform his contractual obligations, preventing the client from receiving the services or goods promised (e.g., by refusing to deliver goods). The tortfeasor is the person who interferes with the contractual relationship between others. When a tortfeasor is aware of an existing contract and deliberately induces a breach by one of the contract holders, it is termed, ""tortious inducement of breach of contract"".""",1498867548

Look at the Xmas scene for instance, good fun for people to unlock weapons at the time, but utterly useless over time as a sandbox experience as everything is focused around in=scene progression.

On a related note, I was re-watching some of the old episodes recently and enjoying seeing the various outdated technologies like floppy disks and VCRs that they still use in the year 3000.  But it's also very confusing because I remember that even then, we were writing some of those things into the scripts because they were ALREADY comically outdated and we thought it was funny.  But now I can't remember which ones were hilariously outdated and which ones were just the actual cutting-edge technologies of the time.  The information has gone into a black hole.

Sacred Stones (FE8) on GBA. Similar to FE7, a bit more free (you can level grind, a feature not in all FE's.)

Shadow Dragon (FE 11, and remake of FE1) on DS (and Wii U virtual console.) Pretty standard in features. Doesn't look as pretty as GBA sprites or 3DS portraits.

The UK does that to appear self-righteous to the world but if the cost of colonization of India were to be put into today's figures, it's over 400 billion dollars. The amount the UK ""gives"" India is less than what India spends on fertilizer subsidies, which, to quote Sashi Tharoor, ""is a good metaphor for this argument"". The UK has never taken responsibilities for the atrocities, and THEFT from their colonies, especially India.

Yak and Schultz were still up and coming players so he used Yak especially to make an example out of by scratching him before he even played a single game. Schultz was part of Hall's clique so he barely developed either, then succumbed to fan pressure.

I don't think Hall, Ebs and Nuge grew much during their time under Eakins. He harped on about better defensive play but they were all mediocre at best, especially Eberle.

Eberle's had a lack of care for defense under multiple coaches anyways. It was not solely a with or without Eakins issue.

""It's a positive thing to win a trophy. But the trophy itself is just a thing that is a symbol of the winner's accomplishment. The thing thing is a real problem in our society in general, and, frankly, historically for women, in general. Being treated as an object, instead of a person, is demeaning, and can seriously lower a person's self-esteem.
Instead of just giving your complement, you might consider first asking your friend what about his SO attracts him most. When you speak, remember she's a person, and respect that. If we want men and women to see each other clearly and to treat each other equally, then we have to make the effort to do so in every situation, whether the other gender is there or not.
This is sort of the equivalent in a stereotypical way, of one woman saying, wow, he's so wealthy, great catch, to another woman. A lot of women now-a-days would not be impressed by that.""",1498867555

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","I smiled down at the sword, a masterpiece in every sense of the word, it was forged from a metal long forgotten by most men, and it took a group of over two dozen men a few years just to find enough to make the sword and by then most of the men had died to sickness and whatever beasts lurked within the forest but I had finally been able to make a perfect and pure blade with some help from an enchanter. The man added to the metal's already perfect nature by making the sword only able to cit through the evil and scum of the world.

The sword seemed to shine in my hands and I couldn't have been more proud of the creation but as I went to put the blade in the scabbard when it cut me, I didn't think nothing of it for a few moments but then I realized, the blade shouldn't have cut me. It was only for the truly evil of the world, that's what the enchanter said anyway and that's when it dawned on me, that damned enchanter had cheated a few dozen coins out of me for some fake enchantment on my beautiful blade. I wrapped the cut on my hand, put the scabbard with the sword on my back and went down to the bar a block away from my shop, where the man usually was after business hours.

The bar was packed with men that had finished another long work day, some smiled and waved me over while others just glanced at me and went back to their drinks, the enchanter sat in the last seat at the bar, slowly sipping at whatever he had in that glass, ""Adrian, you cheap load of garbage, you cheated me."" My voice came out angry and a little rough on some of my words. Adrian glanced over at me with a raised eyebrow, ""Slow down Samuel, I am not a cheat and we both know I hate to be accused as such. Also no need for the name calling."" He sounded calm and looked a bit confused, how could he act like he had no idea what I was talking about? ""The sword, you said the enchantment only allowed the sword to cut the evil and scum and yet the blade cut me when I was putting it away.""

If Adrian had faked the blade, he showed no shock or really any emotion at all, instead he finished his drink, rolled up his sleeve and put his arms down on the bar, ""Fine then swing it on my arm and prove it. Of you're right then everyone will know that I was a liar and a cheat but if you're wrong, you'll feel like a fool."" His proposition made me hesitate, but I pulled the sword out and swung it down on his arm, the blade cut into some of the wood at the edge of it but Adrian's arm was left unharmed, it didn't make sense though, why did it hurt me?

As though he had read my mind, Adrian spoke with the same calm tone he had started earlier with, ""Exactly as I thought, I am no cheat, Samuel. The sword deems you as a scum of the earth."" My eyes widened and I tried to come up with the words to defend myself but Adrian kept going, ""Think about it Sam. How many men did you send to find the metal for such a blade? How many returned? I know that those two numbers aren't one and the same and I also know that most of them thought that what they were walking into was a safe job with good pay but you let men die for your own personal greed for the metal."" He stood up and walked towards me, pointing an accusing finger at me, not as calm as he was, ""Then when those families came to you for something, anything that could get them by until another one of them could find a job, you laughed at them and shut the door on them. Then you proceeded to shut out anyone who was close to you so you could work on your blade and hurt Anne, who had never done a bad thing to anyone ever. Then you barge into my shop and demand my enchantment on the blade but what really pushed you to the point of no return, is when it took you little thought before you swung your sword down upon me, believing it would hurt me, so yes the blade thinks your a scum of the earth. Honestly? I agree with it."" He walked past me and out the door without another word. Everyone that had been watching and listening now refused to look at me, I sat down and ordered a drink.

I would have rather been cheated out of my money then to turn into what I made the sword to defeat.",1498867555

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Hitler's motives and rationales were intimately connected up to his *Weltanschauung* which was predicated on domination and control. This was quite clear in his dealings with the European Axis partners where he browbeat them into following policies that their leaders were reluctant to engage in or German occupation policies in defeated countries. In countries like France which had an armistice and unratified peace treaty with Germany, German demands were excessive and near-Carthaginian. Even though the Germans agreed to a lessening of French economic payments in 1941, largely because of interagency bickering rather than any magnanimity, the occupation's economic policies alone were excessively inflationary and wrecked the French domestic economy. Of Germany's allies, only those geographically inaccessible to direct German military power like the Finns or the Japanese had any real leeway to buck German demands. Otherwise, most found themselves compelled by force or the threat of force to comply with Berlin. 

The dead-end nature of collaboration was evident in the lack of interest in German circles over the fate of France‚Äôs far-flung colonial empire. The Empire was one of the signature signs of French strength and Vichy‚Äôs leaders placed great stock in the colonies as a source of power and prestige. Admiral Fran√ßois Darlan, Petain‚Äôs main deputy in early 1941, envisioned the world as divided into three power blocs: European, Bolshevik, and Anglo-American. France‚Äôs global colonies, according to Darlan, allowed her to exert Europe‚Äôs influence in global affairs. Alliance with Germany would allow for French strength and national renewal to act as Europe‚Äôs counterbalance to the other blocs. Darlan believed that the Republic‚Äôs alliance with Britain was a mistake, since British victory would turn France into a ‚Äúsecond-class Dominion, a continental Ireland.‚Äù Drieu likewise argued that France‚Äôs colonial position would make Germany‚Äôs hegemony more secure and place France as one of the chief lieutenants of a pan-European order. Various entities within the Vichy French colonial service also attempted to articulate a vision in which French colonial space would coexist and supplement the new order promised by the Third Reich. One of the most prominent of these advocates was Edmond Vivier de Streel, an industrialist and former cabinet chief of the Colonial Ministry. Vivier de Streel envisioned France as the colonial power within a German-dominated Europe; it would be the standard-bearer of European civilization and act as a source for colonial products for Europe. As de Streel put it in an October 1940 interview, if France intensified its colonial efforts:

&gt;our country can orchestrate a material turnaround under the aegis of a noble ideal that will vivify the flame of patriotism; it can also, with the help of other European states, ensure others their supply in raw materials, and a parallel increase in exports which will liberate them from their own geographical servitude.

In de Streel‚Äôs formulation, the colonies aided both national rejuvenation after 1940, but also cemented France‚Äôs position within the new order of a German-led Europe.

The problem was that Germany had very little interest or ability to protect France‚Äôs colonial possessions, and pursued policies that undercut the viability of Vichy‚Äôs hold over the French empire. The Japanese initial moves in Indochina caused considerable alarm in the Colonial Ministry especially after a sharp border clash with Japanese forces at Lang Son in September 1940. Vichy acceptance of the Japanese occupation of the colony, even with the French colonial administration existing in some capacity, was a major blow to the prestige of the empire and its ministers since it was clear that they were taking the orders of a non-white power. Baudouin was apoplectic about an Asian power occupying a European colony. His appeals to Berlin to rein in Japan on the basis of racial solidarity fell on deaf ears as strengthening Japan was geostrategically beneficial to Germany. German strategic thought had formed a consensus by 1941 that Japanese expansion into these SE Asia was in Germany's larger interests. Japan's occupation of resource-rich Indochina meant that neither Britain nor the US could take advantage of the colony for their war industries. Similarly, planning at OKW envisioned that a strengthened Japan would tie down significant Anglo-American forces, giving Germany ample time to conclude its invasion of the Soviet Union and win the Battle of the Atlantic.

Although Hitler liked to claim in is table talk and other conversations that he would have been a generous partner to a UK that surrendered, this says more about Hitler's own self-stylings as  a national leader than a serious geopolitical thinker. Hitler would have accepted peace with the UK, but on terms that would have made the UK a lieutenant in the *Pax Germanica*. Preservation of the British Empire would have had to have been on Hitler's terms. France, the only great power that fell under German control, shows this pattern clearly. The 1941 Paris Protocols with France had already shown the degree to which German demands creeped upwards. Nor were did the Germans show much interest in preserving French imperial power. In the end, Hitler's preconditions for a peace for Britain were not in British interests to make and Hitler had no military means to force an acceptance of the new order he had seemingly won in 1940.

At the college level, students getting placed into that class aren't on track to go into a technical field. There's no more any pretense of preparing them for higher-level classes.

My rank is usually a reflection of how strong fiddle has the potential to be and unfortunately I dont think its very possible at this point in time to attain a high position in Challenger at his current state. I was challenger earlier in the season with him (proof here: https://mobile.twitter.com/Nikkonelol/status/856036627868782593/photo/1 ) but there are a few factors that inhibit your ability to consistently demonstrate your aptitude with this champion. One of the largest factors that negatively impacted fiddle was the release of the new Galio. He already has a very unfavorable matchup vs him (direct conflict of ults - galio remains useful after having countered) but galio also reduces fiddles chance for overall victory by overlapping with his strengths and allowing your opponents easy ""outs"", when played on the same team. Which leads to the next point, he is currently too easy to counter in terms of itemizatiom. I'm all for allowing your opponents to have options, but there are currently two huge issues with the current state of the application of this philosophy. Firstly, fiddle gets caught by every item that allows your opponents relief. These items should exist but atm fiddle is too sensitive against them. Mercs, qss, deaths dance, grevious wounds, and locket are big offenders of this. These items are used to counter what would otherwise be concepts that are too powerful, such as cc lock comps or swain/soraka. However, the current state of the game allows for these items to be a worthy investment even if the enemy team has only one or two factors to be countered. Secondly, these items are always worth the investment because they are too powerful. Adcs are able to be both tanky and do the most damage because of how many options they have. 

At the moment, fiddle is too niche of a pick because of recent changes to who is currently in the meta game. Fiddle doesn't need a direct buff because when the meta shifts again, it'll throw everything off balance. I do suspect riot to believe fiddles playstyle as inherently toxic, however. Not to be pessimistic but don't expect him to be seen in mainstream competition.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","The deck will still be playable, but will not be as oppressive as it is now. With the change, midrange decks can have a much higher chance of beating quest rogue because they are able to put more pressure before the quest rogue can complete their quest. Midrange paladin and burn mage, according to vS, are 50-50 vs. quest rogue. The quest, from a balance perspective, should only consistently beat control, and not also midrange. That is why you are seeing a lot of aggro in this meta, because quest rogue is so oppressive. ",1498867558

"news","t5_2qh3l","Using banking regulations to kill an industry you deem ""immoral"" is very real, and well tested already. That's what killed online poker in the US. There was a HUGE poker boom for a few years in the early 2000s. Then, republicans passed a ""morality"" bill against online poker (Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006), letting them re-classify any of these sites that use any kind of out-of-country bank as ""money-laundering"". They were raided and shuttered. Now, you mostly have to play on European sites, and they don't like dealing with Americans.

The poker boom is generally considered to have started around 2003, and attributed to an amateur winning the WSOP (""Chris Moneymaker""), but there's also the fact that hole-cams were added to WSOP tables in 2002, making it actually interesting to watch on ESPN.

In any case, after a boom of just a couple years, the Bush administration HAD to smash it. After all, the wrong people were getting all this money! Much like the alcohol industry case we see above",1498867559

1. Woman aren't as practiced at thrusting, they also have a higher centre of gravity so they'll find it difficult in traditional positions, woman will also have difficulty generating as much power/speed and maintaining rhythm. It'll take time for your partner to learn and get better at it.
2. Cock and dildos feel different in terms of texture, mallebility, density. If you want to simulate an actual cock then look into getting softer dildos or something like a Vixskin mentioned by other commenters. Of course with a strap on you can get dildos that no man can compare to; see Baddragon.com
3. Tactical feedback for your girlfriend will be less than usual, so you'll have to be more communicative.

"pci","t5_2rnpz","What you want to setup is a method of alert whenever a threshold is reached in terms of certain flagged files. This concept was bounced off the PCI SSC by the last company I consulted for and was accepted in the initial attestation audit. I feel that it was BS, but they claim to have implemented some sort of alerting method for when flagged files are touched by a user. The QSA accepted it, but I was basically told no info on it and treated like a mushroom for wanting to actually meet the requirement. Something along those lines may serve as a temporary stop-gap until your MSP is up. The problem is getting your QSA to accept it. Last guy argued with the PCI SSC until they basically got sick of listening and caved. I wouldn't recommend it for anything long term and legit as it is absolutely not encompassing of any level of security close to what that requirement is meant to do, but if it avoids unnecessary fines in the short term AND you're serious on meeting the requirement legit through your MSP, then I don't see a problem in applying it to this situation. Something like SCOM for windows environments would be a functional alert console.

Never got any form of apology for all the flak I got or the work I had to put in to save his company from that catastrophe. The support from that maker was no good either. I'm not saying it is a horrible product, but that if you want to use it, you're taking on a lot of support responsibility in having to fix anything that goes wrong on your own.

But it's no different than what Harrison did in his prime and quite honestly is a huge reason concussions came into light in the past ten years. Questionable low hits, may I ask what in the hell that means? You can blame the NFL for low hits. That's the way the game is played now. Knocking over camera men? 

Vontaze Burfict is the villian the NFL and media wants. He makes crushing hits and sometimes goes a little too far. But nobody mentions how great of a linebacker he really is and quite honestly he reminds me of Harrison on the field. I enjoy watching Burficts intensity and I definitely do not condone some of his hits. But what really pisses me off about ESPN, NFL.com and fans on this subreddit is the unnecessary bullshit he gets for being a 'punk' or a 'criminal' is absolutely ubsurd. Go ahead, look it up. He's never been arrested for anything and is a gentleman off the field but because all everyone does is watch ESPN they get spoon fed an unbelievable amount of crap about him. 

If Burfict played for the Steelers he would be considered an all time great. If he played in the 80s, he would be a HOFer by the end of his career.

The youngest was flown to my best friends house in another state for ten days, and the house and dogs were handled by the older ones. We are planning another trip like this in 2018 and have already made plans for the youngest. Out of the country for 7-10 days at a time, I just feel better sending the youngest to someone that is a little more seasoned in life and knows how to handle those ""extra"" needs my youngest has.

With four kids, three dogs, and two careers... it takes a shitload of planning and saving. But, our marriage is important to us, and our time away helps us get back on track, relax and laugh together, and refocus on ourselves and our family as a whole.

My mom says, ""Children are and addition to a marriage, not a replacement of your marriage.""  We try to teach our children that marriage takes work and a good relationship needs time away from kids so we can be better parents.  ",1498867566

You should be researching profs at the schools you're interested in, find out who's done what for research, maybe also get reviews on the profs from current/former students...you need to make sure you find someone who can guide your specific thesis topic well, and someone who will actually be good as a supervisor (not someone who will ignore you all the time).",1498867567

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","Being awarded a McDonald's franchise is like hitting the lottery, so it isn't the best example to hold all other franchises up against. The qualifications are so stringent that nearly nobody is eligible. Most people have to go with one of the thousands of other franchises out there, and many of them, even ones with big names, are sketchy. Your example is the same as someone complaining about the quality of their car, and you holding up a Ferrari as an example of what cars are typically like. Most cars are not like Ferraris, and most people can't own a Ferrari. The same goes for McDonalds.

I think most people would be surprised at the $150,000 per year profit. Considering how busy the average McDonald's is, operating at 24 hours per day, or nearly so, $150K doesn't really sound that high. McDonald's corporate is making $127,000 per store, through a combination of royalties, rent, equipment, food, etc. People think that they'll only have to pay a 5-10% royalty, when in reality, nearly 50% of the profits find their way into Corporate's pocket.

And corporate doesn't foot the entire advertising bill. Most franchisees pay a combination royalty, in which a certain percentage is actual royalty, and another smaller percentage goes into an advertising fund. So the franchisees are paying at least a part of all that advertising. If they wanted to cut that advertising in fee in half, they couldn't, they're on the hook.

This is McDonalds, and it doesn't seem like a very good deal. Imagine how all the other franchises must be like. I know many, many people who have owned franchises and finally sold them all off in order to create their own brands.",1498867568

However, your argument here seems to be curiously 'religion is okay when it influences the choice between values/ideas but not okay when it introduces new perspectives out of fresh cloth'. I think this is misguided because religious thought is inextricably linked to wider society. This is difficult to prove given the life of 'society', but I would argue that cloning is an example of that.

It's also kind of intellectually weak, because it means that one can ignore values that have become embedded in other parts of culture as a result, and only focus on those where there is an ideological  clash.

Hey Futurama team!

I love the show and have watched all of the seasons several times, and one of my favorite things about the series is the plethora of interesting and funny side characters.  Whether they show up several times, such as Nixon‚Äôs head, or only for one episode, such as the Monks of Dschubba, the side characters help to make the show what it is.

My question is, what is everyone‚Äôs favorite side character from Futurama?

My personal favorite is [the greeting card](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/en.futurama/images/6/61/Mother%27s_Day_Card.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080112213451) from the ‚ÄúMother‚Äôs Day‚Äù episode.

Oh, and for Mr. Groening: can you tell us anything about your new show coming to Netflix?

Thanks for doing the AMA, and have a good day!

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","Probably because they have the bitrate turned down low so as to maximize how many people can watch the stream.  Tom Scott has a great video explaining the concept of Bitrate [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6Rp-uo6HmI), but let's talk about what it means.

The higher the bitrate of a stream is, the better the quality of the video looks, but it also means the viewer needs a better internet connection to watch the stream without playback or buffering issues.  Considering Blizzard wants the stream to reach as many viewers as possible, I'm sure they are very careful with the bitrate they use, and try to keep it as low as possible.  With that restriction in mind, it only makes sense to keep the stream in 720p, since increasing the resolution will double the amount of raw data they have to compress through the pipe.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR** - You may have a fat pipe, but not everyone does, and Blizzard wants everyone to fill their pipes with hot streaming HotS, so they keep their flow low to avoid overflowing the smaller pipes.

&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

**Edit** - So I'm sure the inevitable response is going to be ""but so-and-so streamer broadcasts in 1080p just fine, how can they do it if Blizzard can't?""  I can't answer that definitively, but I can give you my guess.

You see, that streamer you love to watch is literally a one-man show.  They are the ultimate authority on all decisions for the stream.  If they decide they want to up the bitrate a bit and make the stream look cleaner, there's no one to tell them know.  They may lose a couple of the lower viewers, but they decide it's worth the cost (and maybe it is).

Compare this to a multibillion dollar company like Blizzard, where there is inevitably a businessman one or two steps up that is analyzing the raw data without fully understanding it.  They review complaints without necessarily understanding the complaints.  Compare the following two hypothetical complaints:

&gt;  Viewer 1: Hey, I can't watch your stream because it keeps stuttering and buffering.

&gt;  Viewer 2: Hey, I watched your stream, but the quality is shit, you should start streaming in 1080p

To a suit, those complaints might as well read:

&gt; Viewer 1: Hey, **I can't watch your stream** *blah blah blah blah blah blah blah*

&gt; Viewer 2: Hey, **I watched your stream** *blah blah blah blah blah blah blah*

Viewer 2 is already watching anyway, so even if they have a complaint it's a minor one.  but viewer 1 wants to watch but can't.  that's a problem.  Suit sends an order down to tech guy with a list of Viewer1-type complaints saying ""these people can't see the stream, fix this"" and tech guy does his best to make it happen.",1498867574

I had a great drive (I was hitting the ball the best off the tee as I have since I started playing again) and had a 5 iron into the green. I shanked it off the hosel and was PISSED. Went to punch it out, topped it. Went to hit a wedge and shanked two of them off the hosel in a row (with a punch shot hitting the bottom branch sandwiched in there). Hit 
My lob wedge fat into a bunker, hit one fat in the bunker to the lip with a plugged lie. Actually hit a great shot out of there to 3 feet to give me the 11. Granted, I adopted a bit of a ""well I'm not breaking 90 so fuck it"" mentality but the shanks didn't help at all either.

However, what you have to understand is that it is one game out of many and the objective decision should be made by the players and results.   Again, if their choices are so bad that you are extremely likely to lose the game - they will drop out of your ranking.  It's not even really about punishment.  Poor gameplay of any sort - whether that's not hitting your abilities, face checking bushes or not last picking healer will result in a loss.  That's how you learn.  If they keep doing it and it really is causing them to lose, they will keep losing.  For you it is one game - sometimes you lose games.  For all sorts of reasons - of which you should always focus on the mistakes you made.  The next game is a new group of players.  Your enemy team is drawing from the same group of players.   For the player who is doing what you consider to be throwing the game, it is every game or they learn better.  The main thing I want to avoid is punishing players for things that they honestly believe will help them win, or that they are playing with a desire to win.  They are actively engaging with the game.  Thus the solid line between in game choices (including draft) and out of game or disengaged with the game choices, like toxicity, intentional feeding, blocking allies, etc.

Losing the game is the appropriate punishment ONLY for game choices.  Which includes hero picks and in game decisions that are attempting to win the game even if you don't agree with them.  They aren't the appropriate punishment for someone disengaging from the game as I clearly stated.

I'll 100% agree with you that there is not enough action taken on banning actual trolling.  I 100% agree with you that people have lost all faith in the reporting system and for good cause.

I've come to believe that the only way to correct the issue is with a big, fairly expensive push.   They need to hire a bunch of people on a temporary basis.  They need to provide them with full access to chat transcripts and replays, including blizzard voice if needed.   Upon receiving reports they need to promptly respond, investigate thoroughly and deliver punishments which are consistent and escalate on multiple offenses. Including punishment for false reports.  They need to provide the information on punishment done and why to both the offender and the person reporting.   This needs  to be public, well advertised and most of all extremely consistent and transparent.  Once that is done for a while, you can start cutting back on the necessary employees as people learn that such trolling is not acceptable.   ",1498867576

I came into WoW from playing EQ, the biggest sort of foundational change to the genre to me coming into WoW was the random enchantment gear ala diablo, hell even just the fact you got random gear from random mobs was crazy.

People that were new to the genre and more likely came into the game because of their previous interest in warcraft maybe didn't notice that, but for people that played MMO's up to that point that was a huge addition and change to the genre. WoW was built on the foundations of many different pieces of various MMO's but it was the things they took from diablo and put in that really set it apart from the rest to anyone that was actively playing the various games in the genre at that point.

WoW owes as much to Diablo in terms of it's personal identity as it does WC3 and the fact that are still drawing from an ostensibly different genre is not always a bad thing, legendary system not with standing.",1498867577

Prior to this period other branches of the Homo Sapiens family had already began populating North America, ~15,000 years ago, continuing a hunter/gatherer existence.  
Nomadism is well adapted to the infertile regions these early inhabitants encountered, so there was no benefit to establish permanent settlements, but which meant there was no opportunity for the growth of specialized occupations and technological advancement. It was only until these early inhabitants encountered more advantageous conditions for agriculture that permanent settlements were established, on the west coast, southern US, Mexico and South america.",1498867578

After a while people stopped caring though, because even Republicans didn't think that lying about a blowjob was an impeachable offense. In most people's minds, lying about an affair was expected behavior when confronted, so they didn't think Clinton should be fired for it. Plus the economy was booming and most people have a hard time worrying about politics when times are good.

Politics was different back then because the two sides still cooperated a bit, although Gingrich can take credit for being the Godfather of the divisive politics we have today. In fact his own party threw him out of office over ethics violations, so things haven't always been so rosy for ol' Newt. He seems to be a pretty decent guy now, but for me it's still hard to see him as anything other than the villain role he played as Speaker of the House under Clinton.",1498867582

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","TSM's picks seems to be one that tries to punish the J4 pick, as well as Tristana's slightly weaker mid game. A few observations of what went wrong.

1. TSM had no way of winning extended fights whatsoever.
2. Braum denies so much damage from Corki/Jhin. Braum also makes Kled think twice about jumping in. This was an excellent draft move by Cloud 9, especially into Jhin and Corki. TSM should have not have picked Corki in the first round and should have picked up Thresh instead. 
3. TSM focused on shutting down Ray and securing objectives. Tristana was allowed to farm just enough to be relevant. Meanwhile TSM did not invest barely anything into bot lane, which caused Biofrost to be severely underleveled.
4. Picking Elise and Zyra is rather redundant. In this game, they accomplish the same thing, i.e. make picks and burst. The problem is that both Elise and Zyra are too squishy to reliably get vision. As shown in the game, Gragas took advantage of this by getting surprise kills on both of them while they were playing vision. Thresh or Gragas, or even Lee would be better. An Ashe would have worked here too. TSM's vision game was sub par and they did not respect this enough.

I'm confused, Why has the US (Or UN) not sent in heavy military support? When Africa has issues, the UN sends forces. When Mexico/South America has problems, nobody seems to care. Here we are trying to stop Muslims from doing Muslim things in the east, when a border country requires military assistance. 

If we focused our enegry, we could end the Mexican drug war. Many will die, but trying to stop gunmen without gunmen isn't working. That gang needs a US military installation installed at where ever the HQ is. Find each gangs HQ, home turf, place an installation right smack in the middle. Door to door searches for weapons, drugs, and those with gang tattoos. Those with gang tattoos must be killed, trying to convert them to normal people won't work. They'll go from organised crime to normal crime. 

If we pay this burden ourselfs, a future generation will rebuild mexico into the economic partner we always wanted... Or at least, you know, Mexico will control Mexico. Rather than cartels stealing it from Mexico and getting very little push back. To be clear, until I see an Army, I'm referring it to be ""very little push back"". Sending police ant doing shit. Send marines. 


Unfortunately until were ready to sentence many to the death pentaly (In mexico), these gangs will regrow. Gang affiliation needs to be sentenced with death, maybe add a judge's panel in there to weed out people caught in crossfire. But if they can prove in court a gang affiliation, or tattoo, death pentalty. They're not scared of Mexican authorities because there's nothing to fear. Somebody needs to give them the fear. The prisons controlled by gangs must be burned to the ground, all inside included. Those people cannot be allowed to return to the streets.

If they want to consume more than they produce, then others will have to give some of their production to them.

The analogy of a factory owner holding a gun to a person's head is inapt. No one is forced to work in a factory. A person can start their own business, rely on the charity of people or organizations, or live subsisting off the land themselves (like pioneers or such). Working in a factory may be the most convenient, most available option, but the person still chooses whether to work in the factory or not in order to produce, and therefore consume.

In developed countries in the modern world, most people work for someone else because that's the easiest way for most people to be productive and allow ourselves to consume. Additionally, the world is now the richest it has ever been.",1498867584

2) Shoulder Bash is more than just spam, use it for utility. You'll want to mix up SB -&gt; GB -&gt; Heavy, SB -&gt; Light -&gt; SB, SB -&gt; Cancel -&gt; Parry. Also don't do that classic SB into double light into SB -&gt; GB, most see that coming. Make it unpredictable.

3) When they they they know your mix-up, Sb -&gt; Double Side Light -&gt; Side Heavy -&gt; Feint. As this is a combo it comes out really quickly but most want to parry it, you'll almost always get the GB.

4) You know how you started feinting those side and top heavies so much? Once in awhile, its all about gut feeling, let one of them go through naturally.

5) Know your range. Heavy attacks track very well and you'll see an opponent whiff an attack, this is a good time for Heavy.

6) Don't abuse your Zone Attack, it's very punishable against Warden. Use it to open turtles or unsuspecting opponents.

7) If you manage to GB someone and wall splat them, you are guaranteed Top Heavy. This can be glitchy due to distancing but you'll get the hang of it.

8) From neutral, you'll hardly ever start with a side light or a heavy attack. Use top light, feints, SB, and Zone to open people up.

9) When someone is OOS, if you land a GB throw them against something so they'll travel a short distance, you'll usually get top light into top heavy.

I'm not the best Warden in this game, but I'm pretty consistent and I consider myself good. I win most of my duels and do fairly well. He requires little skill to do well but a lot to Master. If you want to take recommendation I would advise you watch Mege92 on YouTube, He's taught me everything I know.

"hoggit","t5_2tifv","It's neat. I've played it a bunch and it's one of my favorite VR games right now. It's basically Pilotwings VR. Pressing switches in the cockpit to startup is cool, but the game has done a lot to reinforce my thoughts on virtual controls. Without any kind of physical feedback it feels imprecise and vague. I get the feeling there's better ways to do this with Touch, and I plan on experimenting myself in Unity.

While I haven't played VTOL VR, he has a really interesting (and seemingly effective) solution. Exploiting the fact that the Vive wand is very tall, he grabs the stick in his game, then places the base of the wand on his lap and uses it as a pivot. [This way he actually *is* holding something in real life and because in his game it's a side-stick, the ingame stick actually pivots around where the base of the Vive wand would be](https://streamable.com/6luba).

As far as political correctness, I think there's a difference between using a condition such as autism as casual speech or insults, and a word originally meant as a racial slur being off limits. I don't think words should he banned or put on pedestals. My issue with the casual use of autism, autistic screeching, and the like, is that you're not using it in a positive or meaningful sense. It's derogatory. This is my personal opinion, but I feel that in conversation and in debate, there are norms and basic values that need to be adhered to. No name calling, derogatory comments, or refusal to debate a valid point/diverting. This, again, is a personal view and not something I'd enforce on others. I don't believe in enforcing my, or anyone's views onto someone else. People must be free to make their own choices and beliefs. As far as your invitation to join the right, I'll pass. I disagree with both left and right, and would rather be my own person than beholden to a side. I disagree with harsh immigration laws, I also disagree with universal healthcare or media censorship. I like aspects of universal basic income, but I also believe in a market economy and the need for personal responsibility.

"Barca","t5_2s561","No hay mucha logica la verdad. Me gustaba el Barsa de peque√±o (especialmente Rivaldo) y el Madrid nunca me gusto. 

En cuanto a Busquets, no es cierto que Xabi (con b, no v) Alonso jugo mas en 2010. A X. Alonso lo cambiaron en todos los partidos menos Suiza y Honduras, mientras que a Busquets solo lo cambiaron una vez, precisamente en el unico partido que perdieron (ante Suiza) en el 61'. A X. Alonso lo quitaron antes de la prorroga en la final para que te hagas una idea. (A X. Alonso le quitaron en el 73 contra Chile, 93 contra Portugal, 75 contra Paraguay, 93 contra Alemania y 87 contra Holanda).

Y no es por repetirme, pero de verdad que la contribucion de Busquets esta a la par con Xavi e Iniesta, simplemente que esta haciendo una funcion no tan vistosa. Todos esos nombers que dices serian de mucho riesgo, ninguno esta consagrado. Se pueden traer, pero no en intercambio por Busquets. El Madrid se puede permitir apostar mas por promesas porque no tiene las urgencias que tenemos nosotros ahora. Busquets es lo unico que funciona ahora mismo en el centro (con Rakitic siendo bueno tambien), asi que intentar cambiarlo mientras que aun esta a alto nivel es un riesgo innecesario.

I really miss when you would have insurance that you are fucking paying for, and they would find a way to drop you or not cover your illness.  That was awesome, lets do more of that. 

I have bad news for you guys.  Without rules, the insurance market wants nothing more than to not pay out your claims.  They will build in loop holes, judgement panels, force arbitration, and other rules to make sure that if you get ill in an expensive way that will make the insurance worth it, they will drop you. 

Hell, from a market perspective, ACA was a real improvement.  Before ACA it was almost impossible to get private insurance outside of work, and if you could get it, it was insanely expensive.  Now you can actually by insurance not through a job at a price that is vaguely reasonable.  Fuck the old system.  Fuck the repeal people.  Don't like ACA?  Fucking fix it or offer your own solution.

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","I don't know very much about skincare (the reason I joined, just a couple of days ago), so there's that disclaimer, but I've been using pure aloe vera gel- as in, I raise aloe plants and snip off pieces to smear the raw gel on my face- for months. I don't really use it to treat acne, but if I've over-dried an area with another product, I'll usually wash my face, leave it wet, and smear the gel over the water to help ""lock in"" the moisture. I then dry the rest of my face, wait a few minutes for the aloe to dry, and top it off with my moisturizer. 

I don't think aloe vera gel-- the real stuff, at least-- needs to be washed off, since it's a natural product. Because I'm sourcing mine straight from the plant (and don't want to waste my poor aloe babies), I goop it on LOL. 

It definitely helps with redness and dryness. I've heard of people using it as their moisturizer, but it does make my skin feel tight if I use it all over, which...kinda seems like the opposite of moisturizing. ",1498867593

I run a Neverwinter Nights server, which is a game engine that permits D&amp;D rules-based role play and features 3D video-game style play. If you are up for some 3e/3.5e D&amp;D, Neverwinter Nights might be the thing you seek... a great place for games on YOUR schedule.

You can join us anytime! Some of our DMs use skype / teamspeak / etc. to enable voice in-game. We use Neverwinter Nights as our virtual tabletop it is a licensed D&amp;D game based on 3e / 3.5e rules.

Neverwinter Nights (NWN) is a good base from which to start, as it includes PLAYER and DM software as well as a solid TOOLSET that allowed us to build our game world which features 1337+ areas your PC can visit, including more than 100 areas that are 'blank zones' that DMs dress-up to simulate locations not otherwise built-into our nwn game server.

We enhanced the ROLE PLAYING aspects of this game by creating our IMMERSION TOOLS - a two part toolset that enables PLAYERS to record a backstory for their PC, and both the DMs and the game itself reads from this backstory to enhance game play. Our DMs 'get to know' PCs quickly, and you may find a PC involved in adventures to rescue kidnapped siblings, or visited by a grandfather's ghost (and yes, your PC looks a lot like they do).

We have added over 100 spells from D&amp;D to our NWN server, spells including Wish, Wall of Ice (melts too), Blink and more! We have enabled additional modes of movement including FLY, SWIM, CLIMB (both with and without ropes), SWING (from ropes and vines), JUMP and SQUEEZE-THROUGH-TIGHT-SPACES.

PLAYERS are free to play solo (a great way to get to know the game controls, your PCs capabilities and even explore the world some), but the game really is meant to be a sandbox for DM and PARTY. The sandbox features an excellent 'jumping off' location; the city of Dohral where all starting PCs find their ship diverted to in dire need, driven by storms and damage to the craft requiring repair. Why have the gods brought you here? Perhaps the coming days will reveal that, for now, a strange city and stranger lands beyond it lay before your PC.

We have several DMs active presently, in time zones from eastern europe to several USA time zones. You are welcome to join us anytime.

To do so you need a copy of NWN, which you can find for $9.99 or less at

An abstracted model of a person's face can be used to identify them in virtually any condition, from any camera angle, even if their face is obscured by skintight clothing or partially blocked by other features in the camera image. A single 2d image, on the other hand, is limited by the lack of an entire fucking dimension; it's effective for images where the face is clearly visible from the front, and not much else.

A constantly-tracked high resolution video taken at point-blank range can reconstruct a model of a person's facial geometry in excellent detail. A fuzzy still frame taken by a government camera in Belize and stored as a jpeg isn't going to offer the same granularity. 

Given the nature of legal proceedings, the details of a face are of extreme importance when being used as evidence. ",1498867595

He ignored Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma and all others like them because his power was still growing at that point. His reach was not quite that far at that point, which is why he sent emissaries to influence Mandalore instead, using deception and guileful planning to weaken the Republic and the Jedi. Revan and Malek were a stroke of luck as they came to him, allowing The Emperor to influence them and use them against the Republic and the Jedi.

You are indeed right to point out that the Outlander role doesn't fit very well with non-Force using classes. The Outlander, however, is still an individual or great physical prowess, defeating the possessed Master Surro on Ziost. Also, The Outlander is someone who has openly defied The Emperor, both (tenuously) on Yavin IV and Ziost. The Emperor has a demonstrated streak of pettiness and spitefulness against those who insult him, namely Lord Dramath (painful entrapment for thousands of years for abandoning him as a bastard) and Lord Scourge (becoming an accomplice to a plan he hates while being unable to ever feel physical pleasure of any sort for hundreds of years for plotting against him with Revan). What more cruel punishment is there for the Outlander than being trapped in his/her own mind and becoming that which s/he fought against. This is why The Emperor chose the Outlander for his plan. Note that every class (such as Jedi Knight) that is not the Outlander has presumably disappeared and are not available for taking over due to dropping out of the galactic picture.",1498867597

"intermittentfasting","t5_2tluu","Hey sorry you're feeling down. Don't let your negative thoughts knock you off the right path. Stick with IF - it really works! I've tried everything except keto and so far IF is the only program that's helped me lose the weight and keep it off. I saw results within the first week but that may have been mostly water weight. To date I've lost 8 pounds in 3 weeks. I'm skinny fat.

Instead of counting calories (so impractical) I eat as much as I want until full. Maybe after the BBQ consider switching to a similar diet as me. I eat whole food plant based foods - that means no processed ingredients like oil, white flour or pure sugar. It works because your stomach can get physically full to the brim on 500 or less calories when eating WFPB. If you're curious, check out this episode of former Biggest Loser contestants losing the weight they gained back after the show ended thanks to exercise and a WFPB diet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B71GkKItC1U

"HotPeppers","t5_2tlk9","I started these guys a lot later than I should have probably (Phoenix, AZ...our blistering heat started a few weeks ago), but how do they look?  Not sure if they are small for their age or if they are about where they should be?

I topped and pruned them when the main stem first forked into a Y shape which seemed to pay off in terms of bushiness.  I'm pretty sure they won't set fruit for a while given how hot it is right now, but they are starting to produce flower buds at least.  

They are in air-pots with a media that is about 4 parts coconut husk chips to 1 part pumice.  I fertigate with a low concentration of Dyna-Gro Foliage Pro and Pro-Tekt silicon supplement at every watering.  I also add anhydrous citric acid to the concentrate that I feed through the siphon injector because our water is insanely hard.  The Pro-Tekt and Foliage Pro precipitate in the concentrate that I prepare if I don't add the acid.  I try to get down to the pH of rainwater but I initially calibrated my recipe against pH test strips which aren't super precise so it's very very approximate.

I don't have a control to compare against, but the Pro-Tekt seems to really be helping with the heat tolerance.  Even when the leaves feel super thin and wilty, they don't actually end up drooping down which is a pleasant surprise this year.  

I've done too many things different this year compared to last year to know with certainty if it is the silicon supplementation alone or a combination of other factors, but whatever the case the plants are taking the intense AZ sun/heat like a boss so far this year.  Hopefully I can actually get some full size mature peppers this year!

Personally, I'd feel very self conscious and awkward if someone called me the wrong pronoun and would be worried as to why I wasn't ""passing"", but wouldn't outwardly make a big deal out of it. If it was someone I know, I'd correct them. A stranger I'll never see again (cashiers etc) and I probably wouldn't bother. I'd just move on. An accidental slip up is just that, and I wouldn't want any hassle over that.

If it's a genuine mistake from someone who doesn't know me, I wouldn't think any less of them. Same applies to someone *trying* to get it right but slipping up. Sure, it still isn't ideal, but it's not as much of a problem. Like if someone slipped and accidentally knocked me, I'd be far less angry than someone deliberately hitting me, even if they both caused as much pain. A genuine accident I'd correct (if someone I know/ignore if someone I don't know) and just hope they don't do it again. If they kept doing it though and made no effort, then I would be a bit frustrated. 

What *would* annoy me is someone doing it deliberately. Someone who definitely knows I'm trans making no effort to show how little respect they've got, someone using it to ""prove a point"" or suddenly misgendering me because they disagree with something or simply to be annoying, and I wouldn't be so alright with it. Probably more likely to get cross than upset. I'm used to that now, but still. This *would* affect my opinion of someone, especially if I've already repeatedly corrected them in the past.

However,

1. I don't see evidence this kind of behavior is exclusive to WMAF - there are people of all colors sex-touristing to various poverty-stricken areas for easy sex.

2. These couples have zero relations to the average WMAF couple. Just because say, 8% of White children are born to alcoholic parents, this implies nothing about the other 92% of White couples having children. (completely made that statistic up as an example)

3. There are tons of examples of extremely successful WMAF offspring, a fact they very obviously try to hide.

4. For r.Hapas to then say that all WMAF couples are destined to have failure children, and that WMAF is by default wrong and should not reproduce, is absurd. I truly cannot believe they are Hapas for spreading such hatred towards the very coupling that births their race.

5.

"bostonceltics","t5_2qmkf","Putting Smart's floor at Jrue Holiday seems extremely optimistic.  Jrue averaged 15.4 points, 7.3 assists, 4 rebounds, 1.5 steals with 45%/36%/71% shooting last season.  He's also a solid defender.  We've had 3 seasons of Smart shooting under 40% from the field and under 30% from three.

There's a reasonable chance Smart will never be an NBA starter.  Love him, though.  His shot might limit him to being nothing more than a defensive role player with average point guard abilities and excellent intangibles.

Also, I'm interested to see what Zizic can do because people seem to rave about what he did overseas... but I've watched about 5 highlight videos of the guy and can't shake the feeling he looks exactly like what I'd expect Tyler Zeller to look like in those leagues.  A Nerlens Noel floor also seems very optimistic.

This blog post is interesting, but its purpose is advertisement, not a goodwill attempt to keep users safe.  These types of posts have a financial incentive to sound as bad as possible to get more readers.  As someone who has been in the receiving side of one of these posts, we fixed and pushed s fix in under a 4 hours.  I guess this made for a boring blog post so the ""timeline"" posted was a ""creative"" take on the actual events where either wording was stretch well past any logical assumption or just completely fabricated.  We had no where to turn though, all we could do is either post the raw email exchange (bad taste), fight it out in public(hurts sales to keep a vulnerability in the news) or just drop it(what we did).

Like if I were in your shoes and someone in the social circle asked me about what happened with that chick, I would just laugh it off and say ""oh that's what she said about me? Hmm ok. I had a good time that night so its cool.""

Just say that and be done with it. Let her be the cunt that talks shit. Don't even worry about bashing her because her being the girl, it will always look much worse if you were to bash her. 

Just move on.

Now if you run into her again or whatever, just say to her ""what's up"" and act like you know nothing about her talking shit about you. In situation like these or whenever a rumor about you is being spread, you have to really show that the things she says about you don't phase you at all.

Sebastian clutched a diary -- his wife‚Äôs, Sarah‚Äôs -- in his hands, pressed it to his chest.  The pages were yellowed and crinkled, the ink written in style of a different time.  But its words were still the same.  *1642,* thought Sebastian, in mimicry of what he‚Äôd read.  *I found my soulmate again, under the name of Charles.  He was beaten and bloodied for having been caught stealing, but I‚Äôd recognize that face anywhere.  Always with brown, almond - shaped eyes and strong jawline.  Same body too, chiseled but thin, like a courier.*
 
He looked down through tears.  *1653.*  The next entry.  *He died.  We had eleven years together before his end.  He is reborn, but I am now alone.  I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôll have to wait.  I never age anyways, and we‚Äôll be together someday.  But being apart from him is my definition of pain.  And when we do meet, fifteen years from now, it‚Äôll be like meeting another for the first time.  If he were of wealth this time, it would be so much easier.  Arranged marriages are in some ways the blessing of God.*
 
He closed the book and rubbed his eyes.  Sarah ‚Ä¶ was that even her real name?  They‚Äôd met in Australia on a boat through Blue Lake.  So long ago, it seemed, when he were young and fit.  He still was, but gray peppered his strands of black.  Wrinkles had formed along his face and neck.  It made sense, though, how his wife aged so well.  *She doesn‚Äôt, does she,* thought Sebastian to himself.  *Age.  She never grows old.  Time has no meaning to her.*  The neighbors commented of his age at forty but told Sarah she didn‚Äôt look a day over twenty.  Sometimes he was mistaken for her father, or a visiting uncle.  *Perhaps it was why she never wanted children.  Imagine the pain of losing someone you love, knowing that you‚Äôd live forever.*  But it was time to go.  They had dinner reservations at eight.  And it was a quarter ‚Äòtil, Sebastian saw.
 
When he arrived -- and he made sure to show early -- he asked of the waiter to not come until called.  ‚ÄúYour daughter.‚Äù The waiter smiled sagely and glanced at the reservation ID.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs having boy trouble?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Sebastian.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my wife.‚Äù  The waiter left him alone from there.
 
Sarah arrived in a two part black dress, looking as youthful as the day she‚Äôd been wed.  Her long skirt trailed the floor, reminding Sebastian of the wedding gown she‚Äôd worn.  *She still has is,* he thought.  Her body was slim and curved with a flat belly and glowing grin.  She walked with the stride of youth, a walk Sebastian had lost ten years before.
 
‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she said.  Sebastian pulled a chair for her then went to sit.  ‚ÄúSorry I‚Äôm late.  I got held up at work.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúI get it,‚Äù said Sebastian.  ‚ÄúBeing CEO sucks.  Busy work too.  But let‚Äôs not talk about work, ok?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúOk.‚Äù  Sarah took a sip from the wineglass and smiled.  ‚ÄúWhat do you want to talk about then?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYou.  I want to know about you,‚Äù said Sebastian.  He held the diary in the folds of tablecloth and fingered its pages, watched Sarah‚Äôs face.  She seemed surprised.
 
‚ÄúWhy?  You know everything about me.  My favorite color is green, I play the harp, my favorite fruit is the apple ‚Ä¶‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWhat did you do before we met?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúI was a child model and rising actress.  But I told you that.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWhy have I never met your parents?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúI was adopted, remember?  Are you ok?  Do you have amnesia?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúNo.  I don‚Äôt have that,‚Äù said Sebastian.  He knew there was no going back from this.  ‚ÄúWhy have I never met them, then?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù
 
Sebastian pressed forward.  ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd they name you Sarah?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúHow would I know?‚Äù  Sarah‚Äôs cheeks had taken on a tinge of red.  Perhaps the wine had gotten her, but Sebastian knew that she was mad.  ‚ÄúSeb, what‚Äôs going‚Ä¶‚Äù
 
‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs not your real name.‚Äù  He said it with a finality that left no room for lies.  Then he lifted the diary and placed it on the table, slammed it against the wood with a dull *thunk.*  Dust motes flew into Sarah‚Äôs face and she coughed.
 
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not.‚Äù  Then, ‚ÄúWait, don‚Äôt drink the wine.  I put maitotoxin in there.  I was going to kill you tonight.  Look, I‚Äôm going to be truthful, ok?  I was going to murder you because I can never grow old.  You‚Äôll want to have kids sooner or later.  But I won‚Äôt have them, not what happened the first time.  And I want to be with you, but staying this young with you aging‚Ä¶ well, I need to keep appearances.  I don‚Äôt want to see you all wrinkly and old.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve always cut my life short, then.  You don‚Äôt want to see me old, so I never live out a full life.  Or appearances are too important to you, and you don‚Äôt want to be seen with some doddery fool.‚Äù  Sebastian felt like to grin.  He didn‚Äôt -- appearances *are* important to maintain -- but trumpets of victory laced his words.  Sarah seemed a cornered mouse.  For all her confidence, she‚Äôd been reduced to a deer caught in headlights.  ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù He asked.
 
Sarah shook her head and sniffed, then blew her nose against a cloth napkin.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your wife.  I always have been.  Isn‚Äôt that enough?  I love you.‚Äù  But Sebastian shook his head.
 
‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not.  I‚Äôm going to ask again.  Who are you?  What is your name?  Not Sarah,‚Äù he said when his wife moved to speak.  ‚ÄúYour real name.‚Äù  Sebastian openly grinned now, but the answer was not what he thought.  Sarah sighed and took another sip of wine.  
 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Seb,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Eve.‚Äù

This choice to only print money for the old/ill goes hand in hand with the choice to print money to grow the money supply through fractional reserve banking.

That's to say that any more money which you printed and gave directly to the young people as government spending would be money you didn't have to print as a loan created by the banking system.

That reduces the levels of rent income which, hand in hand with handouts to the old, currently create the income distribution which results in this demographic trend.",1498867617

"childfree","t5_2qtwb","It could be fixed if people voted for someone like Bernie Sanders. But this underlying selfishness cannot be fixed easily, it will take a while I think. I just don't understand why americans vote for people with faulty logic, faked facts and downright stupid arguments (see anti choice idiots). I also don't understand how they can see how much better countries like Sweden, Norway, Germany, etc ... fare with their social systems but still completely refuse it? 
White middle/upper class male americans also seem to think that it's just as easy for everyone as it is for them. ""Why don't they just get a good job or go to med school or something?"" They don't get that a black, poor, lesbian woman doesn't have the same chances they have. It's ridiculous to act as if it was so easy to just not be poor or something. What about chronically ill or disabled people from poor families? How would they get out of that? What about kids who grew up in abusive trashy families and got denied an education? What about people whose lifes didn't go as smooth as yours? Who didn't get born into privilege?

The police show up, we show them our work order, they see our clearly marked moving truck and make a call to a surviving family member to ensure we are not burglars and are just doing our job.
     The one exception we had was from a rather aggressive pair of cops who were partners who pulled in sirens blaring and guns immediately out and pointed at us. I was carrying a very expensive antique dresser down the stairs when a cop turned the corner with gun drawn and pointed at my head ordering me to drop the dresser which I was carrying with my coworker. I had three steps left until I could safely put the very expensive piece down which I proceeded to carefully and slowly do. The officer took this as a direct refusal to follow his order and within seconds I had a gun to my head and was hog tied along with my co worker on the floor. Totally unacceptable behavior for any police force.

"politics","t5_2cneq","from Ludwig Von Mises' classic ""liberalism"" (verbatim quote) ;

*Liberalism* as defined by Former US Senator Joseph S. Clark (circa 1950's) ;

*""To lay a ghost at the outset and to dismiss semantics, a liberal is here defined as one who believes in utilizing the full force of government for the advancement of social, political, and economic justice at the municipal, state, national, and international levels.... A liberal believes government is a proper tool to use in the development of a society which attempts to carry Christian principles of conduct into practical effect.""*

Von Mises than explicates his position on material ""welfare"" as it feeds into social policy ;

""Happiness and contentment do not depend on food, clothing, and shelter, but, above all, on what a man cherishes within himself It is not from a disdain of spiritual goods that liberalism concerns itself exclusively with man's material well-being, but from a conviction that what is highest and deepest in man cannot be touched by any outward regulation. It seeks to produce only outer well-being because it knows that inner, spiritual riches cannot come to man from without, but only from within his own heart. It does not aim at creating anything but the  ***""outward preconditions""*** for the development of the inner life. And there can be no doubt that the relatively prosperous individual of the twentieth century can more readily satisfy his spiritual needs than, say, the individual of the tenth century, who was given no respite from anxiety over the problem of eking out barely enough for survival or from the dangers that threatened him from his enemies.""

---

Healthcare, the ACA or ""Obamacare"" if you're so inclined*...has not only saved lives,* it will continue to save, if not stabilize lives, and it will continue to represent one of the left's most significant policy accomplishments in a generation. More importantly it is the left's single greatest contribution to removing the ***""necessary or {outward} preconditions""*** for social policy.

Vanquish is like Devil May Cry in that poor play is effective on easier difficulty settings, but there is a scoring system that rewards better play so the player is encouraged to learn beyond just what is required to beat the difficulty setting they chose. Vanquish's problem is that it insufficiently emphasises and contextualises its scoring system, it's only visible at the end of each chapter (rather than constantly in DMC) and it's number without any sort of explanation of if that number is good or not (compare with dmc's letter grading or Bayo's medal grading, which both demark clear ranges of scores as being good or bad).",1498867619

Mulholland Drive 

Lost Highway 

Blue Velvet 

One because they are some of the best films ever made but no one creates a simultaneously gorgeous and unsettling atmosphere like lynch. 

Vertigo - Hitchcock's masterpiece but also amazing cinematography and colors. 

Videodrome - weird as fuck and sick fun 

Existenz - same 

Possession - kinetic madness that's already too much for many sober people 

2001

Wild at Heart - the most fun you can have watching a lynch film 

Aguirre the wrath of God - you'll be tuned to how insane it was for explorers to cross the ocean and fight the jungle in search for mythical gold 

Eyes Wide Shut 

Eraserhead 

Sorcerer - for similar reasons to Aguirre 

Holy Motors 

Forbidden Planet 

Fantastic Planet - kind of like watching heavy metal but actually a brilliant film 

Texas Chainsaw Massacre - one of the best horror films of all time and so intense 

The Visitor (1979) - there are no words. 

For all mankind - tons of footage taken by astronauts on actual missions 

Showgirls 

Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai 

Road House 

Desperate Living 

Polyester 

The Room 

Samurai Cop 

Story of Ricky

"Prevent_Suicide","t5_3he4l","First, be proud of yourself for reaching out. The internet can be a great place to find support. Take credit for turning your anxiety into ACTION. That's the first step in overcoming anxiety and overwhelming thoughts/feelings. 

Second, I can't tell you how to stop feeling like this, but I completely understand the nature of your desire to be free from this anxiety. What I can do is remind you that recovery IS possible. It can be a long, difficult, exhausting road, but there is a path to freedom. 

Third, I'm so sorry your mother won't help you get some help. I know exactly what that feels like. It's absolutely gut wrenching. My only advice for that is to basically... Accept that your mother maybe doesn't have the emotional energy you need to feel supported. That's is NOT your fault, though. Maybe she has her own reasons for her behavior, but it doesn't mean you deserve that kind of treatment. You can only control yourself... Not others. It really sucks, but it's damn true.

Finally, try not to be so hard on yourself. I know, I know... Easier said than done. It really is an essential first step in curing anxiety, though. The whole reason you have anxiety is because there's this little voice in your head criticizing and belittling almost everything you do. DO NOT entertain that voice. It speaks lies and distorts your world to cause you PAIN. Whenever that feeling or voice arises, simply say, ""NO"". NO -- I will not believe the lies my anxiety tells me about myself. NO -- I am NOT worthless. NO -- you cannot take my happiness, anxiety. You may not know what to do after this, but this is yet another important first step in getting better.

Extra finally (lol), I know you don't know me, but I believe in you. If it helps at all, I definitely believe you deserve MORE from life. You CAN do this!! 

Lots of luck &amp; love ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

"MaddenUltimateTeam","t5_2v23y","&gt;  I'm in the rookie tier does everyone have these kinds of teams?

To answer your question, no not everyone has these kind of teams, but many do this late in the game as others have explained. What I haven't seen anyone else explain is how H2H matchups are done.

Your tier does not matter. Your team's OVR rating is hardly accounted for (if at all). What does matter is a hidden rating your team is given. The system is called Elo and is used widely these days in many games. If you want to read about it [Wikipedia has a pretty good writeup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system). 

One reason why you matched up against such a good team right away is because the system had no information on you. It takes 4-5 games for it to give you an accurate score. So generally, expect to get demolished by players and teams way better than you for awhile to start. After you play several games, it should get better at matching you up against more evenly skilled players.",1498867623

The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in competitor-versus-competitor games such as chess. It is named after its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-born American physics professor.

The Elo system was originally invented as an improved chess rating system, but is also used as a rating system for multiplayer competition in a number of video games, association football, American football, basketball, Major League Baseball, Scrabble, board games such as Diplomacy and other games.

The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match.

To avoid crooked placement:

Best thing to do is, hold the shirt infront of your chest by the seams of the sleeves. Then look down, examine the weave of the shirt. Usually it's threaded vertically, make sure you note whether or not the shirt's weave is perfect, more likely than not the weave is skewed either left or right.

From this, when you load the shirt onto the shirt board you can be sure the shirt is loaded straight. Be sure to check sleeves and shoulders, making sure both are in the same position and even. 

Eventually, through experience, you won't have to check the weave of the shirt, only the shoulder and sleeve while on the shirt board.  ",1498867625

This is for Billy west, mr. West, I worked for a short time with an old friend and collaborator of yours Jim Jinkins. He currently lives in the same town in Georgia as I do. He spoke very highly of you and told me so many stories of Doug. Which as a 31 year old was my first favorite show. And an aspiring writer it was a great opportunity to see things on the other side. 

So what I want to say is thank you. Thank you for my childhood. I know you were not in the Disney episodes but as a kid I preferred the nick ones anyways. 

I am a big fan of your work and I can't wait to see what hit shows you voice in the future.

You're in desperate need of depth (part of being an expansion team), any DP signing would be valuable at this point - both for revving interest for the team and improving the quality of play. Signing a starter quality DP means one of the players starting now is available on the bench, a reasonable player for Heath to bring on at 60' or later to make an impact. 


I find it difficult to imagine that Minny would screw up so badly that a DP couldn't make that XI.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I would say I often don't have synergy with my ADC and it's exactly what you said: not being able to match the aggressiveness/passiveness of my ADC.

I feel I have a good idea of what match ups I can play aggressively against and which I can't. For example, the other day I was playing Soraka alongisde Jhin against Karma and Caitlyn and I am pretty confident the Karma+Cait combo wins in trades so I told my adc to play safe and he refused to and tried to be aggressive.

I committed with him because I don't like to leave teammates out to dry because it takes the tiniest thing for people to threaten to afk and we got destroyed twice by their combo which meant we were underfarmed and underlevelled and went on to lose the game as the Caitlyn snowballed out of control.

I guess I create my own problems playing the role with the least carry potential. But I don't think I can match the cs'ing of most people in the game. I have no experience on it having only started playing League this year and sort of been glued to the role. But I'm confident I can climb on support, albeit more slowly. 

Would you recommend hard committing to decisions my ADC makes? I often get ignored when I make calls and it's frustrating so I regularly feel stuck and not sure what to do.",1498867627

I had hair going halfway up my shaft and that made restoration difficult. I decided to take the hair off my scrotum years ago and shaving wasn't particularly difficult but the stubble was a bit uncomfortable.

I get waxed and I love it. If that's not your thing and you aren't excessively hairy you can try tweezing. Both methods hurt a little when you start but you will get used to it.

Firstly, Vol'jin was burned. There's no body left. Second, the Darkspears are adamantly against necromancy as a whole, it's part of their culture. If Vol'jin was revived, they'd put him back in the ground where he belonged as soon as they saw him, and unless Sylvanas put him under her control, he'd let them.

Aside from that, 'for all we know' is a little bit far. Between the Cinematic, the quest text for the Stormheim quests involving the lantern, and the Nathanos short-story posted around Legion's launch, everything I said is sourced. The only thing that isn't is Sylvanas' motivations for doing what she's doing. Her endgame might be something else, we don't know that, but she was using the lantern to compel Eiyr to hand control of her Valkyr to Sylvanas so she could keep herself alive. The Nathanos short story makes it very clear that she's horrified by what's waiting for her on the other side of death.

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","Give Darmanitan a unique move that allows it to switch into Zen Mode (this would still require the ability ""Zen Mode"" and the &lt;50% HP condition would be removed). I think a fire-type Psychock would be pretty cool, since Zen Mode Darmanitan doesn't have access to Psyshock, **AND** an opponent could still switch in their physical wall to take the attack the same as if you were a Sheer Force LO Flare Blitzer.

**OR**

Change Zen Mode to act more like Aegislash's Stance Change where Zen Mode is activated when using a special-type move and Darmanitan returns to normal when using a physical-type move.


Currently Darmanitan has ""meh"" bulk [105/55/55] but amazing physical attack [140] and competitive speed [95]. Zen mode requires &lt;50% HP but in return almost doubles his bulk [105/105/105], swaps his Atk &amp; SpAtk [30&lt;--&gt;140], and then cuts his speed by ~30% [55].

Darmanitan has a decent special move pool; Overheat/Fire Blast, Solar Beam/Grass Knot, Focus Blast, &amp; Psychic; but it's almost impossible to activate Zen Mode and then survive long enough to fire off 1-2 attacks if you're lucky enough to still have a substitute after taking a hit from the opponent (Zen Mode doesn't activate until the end of the turn so Darm only has 105/55/55 bulk behind the sub). Zen Mode also deactivates after restoring HP above 50% which means that healing items (Sitrus, Leftovers, etc.) can be more harmful that reliable on a ZM-Darm strategy.",1498867633

As I said I really loved the game and want to see it in top 10 games that's why I'm worrying about the balance issue, yes probably I'm playing the characters that Tripp easily counters them but whenever I search things about gigantic in youtube or reddit the Tripp character is the famous one. The titles like ""How to one hit with Tripp"". Let me give you an example; I brought the game called For Honor months ago and started to play since the game is out. The community was huge and so many people were playing it. But weeks after weeks they couldn't balance the characters. Whatever you do or high mind games you try a character called ""Peacekeeper"" (an female assassin) can kill most of the players with only spamming left mouse. That's why all of my friends and people I met in the game uninstalled the game. And such a good game nearly died now. People only playing it for fun like a singleplayer game.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","The ""sequoia"" (human name)

Seqoia are the most prolific space faring race, and generally have good relation with everyone. 

Life sycle

Seqoia have 2 distinct stages of life ""seed"" and ""tree"" 

The first ""seed"" resembles a spider about 3' across, this ""seed spider"" is very common in their planet's ecosystem, but the ""seed stage"" of the Seqoia is different than its relatives, while most of the seed spiders are very short lived only traveling a few days before burrowing into the ground to mature, the Seqoia seed are more adavanced, favoring quality over quantity.

The seed spiders of the Seqoia are significantly more developed, instead of just traveling for a few days before burrowing, these seeds are ment to stay neer their parent tree for extended periods, pruning away compeating plants digging canals and scaring away herbivores. 

These seed spires are reasonably intelligent, and they can solve most problems they encounter, when they get stumped they are capable of speaking to the tree through an exposed nerve that allows them to connect their brains.  The brain of the Seqoia grows with them, allowing them to have a massive memory and be very good at math and similar problems, but they are a bit slow.

In The past these seed spiders could only last until winter (when they would normally feeeze), forcing them to set off to burrow a few weeks before it gets to cold, but the seqoia have built hibernation burrows for themselves, allowing the number of seed spiders per tree to sky rocket.

This along with them building canals and other infrastructure alowed the, to live closer together and pool resources and share thoughts with other trees led to the, becoming the space faring species they are today. 

Society/technology

Sequoia space ships are built around one mature plant, they resemble a giant web of metal beams with thousands of spiders clinging on to the extirior of the ship.

Because their home had verry little atmosphere , they don't bother sealing their ships, and prefer to be in a vacuume. 

Because each ship is linked to a single living organism which directly controls its every action, the Seqoia have no dedicated warships, they are plants not predators, and run from combat unless absolutely nectary.

They where verry nterested in buying human computer, (a technology they had never bothered developing before), their hope is that these computers could let them have a credible military, because as of now it well known that they are rubbishy at fighting. 

Most of their technology is interfaced with directly through their exposed nerves, sometimes a number of trees use conductive cabals to link themselves up across long distances to communicate. 

Like everyone else they have no FTL but instead just have to wait a thousand or two years to get where they need to go. 

TL;DR, spiders that turn into space faring trees

And like I said, the Eric Garner situation should STILL result in consequences, and even with his non compliance the police actions were COMPLETELY unacceptable.  Especially because IIRC he ""resisted"" in the sense that he tried to move his arms away, but he didn't hit the police or try and shove them or anything, he just moved his own body.        
      
But that doesn't change the fact that from a **pragmatic advice** standpoint, people need to just shut the fuck up and comply in the short run (especially if we are talking about an individual interaction with the police and not some sort of protest or something).     
      
Although (and this is a legitimate question because it was a while ago and I don't remember clearly), wasn't Eric Garner breaking the law?  Not like a major safety law, but selling cigarettes illegally or something?  And if so is it really harassment if he is breaking the law?  Though once again just to be clear, that still would not justify at all what happened to him.

(though, yes, I understand it's more than just voices).

But given how many of you guys have *multiple* voice packs and are telling me how awesome it is, screw it, I'm going for it.

Now I just have to decide who I want to talk to me.  A bunch of people seem to be saying VERITY since it matches the ship...but I heard you can turn off the ships voice and just run the voice pack, so I'm not sure there is any point to having VERITY as I'm not familiar with the ship voice as it is.

Honestly I'm really leaning towards Shatner...just makes that immersion into Star Trek that much more.  Now if only they had Piccard I could die happy in space, haha.

17 in 2017

EXISTING FINISHED

1. Triderma Extreme Dryness Hand Cream | Done

2. Triderma Extreme Dryness Hand Cream Tube 2 | Done - These were greasy but not truly hydrating - very disappointing.

3. Elf Lipstick Pouty Petal | Killed by 
toddler - Looking for replacement.  This was such a wearable pink for me and I only had half left, but it's discontinued. Sigh.

4.  Avon Luxury Liner Dark Brown - the wood was so poor and splintery. I used most of this on my brows, actually, soft and smudgy on my oily lids.

5. Avon Beyond Color Sample - Stolen Kisses - Done!  Pretty color and so moisturizing but it does settle a bit in deep creases.

6. Elf Blemish Control Face Primer | ALL DONE!  WNRP - doesn't mattify, kind of greasy, cheaper ways to apply salycilic acid.

14. Elf Lip Exfoliator Clear - I really don't like the flavor of the original one (same flavor as most ELF lipsticks - yuck).  WNRP original flavor.  Now using the grapefruit!

Newly Finished! 

11. ELF HD Loose Powder | I ended this and I'm now using my previously purchased backup, but I don't think I will repurchase after this, as the pressed form is finer.

16. Avon Beyond Color Sample In the Buff - This was 0.6 grams apparently and now it's done.  WNP because it's too pale and can be streaky/chalky.

8.  NYC Angel Lash Mascara | this mascara was big - 12 ml and I didn't get to the point where it was totally done and dry like I was hoping (did start flaking during the day though), but I bought this last fall and it's just getting too old.  I WNRP because the brush is too big for my eyes.

Still Working On:

7.  Elf Eyeshadow Primer | was 15% | now scraping down sides | This is my HG actually and I have backups. It has been 3 months since I took the stopper out and I use it 6x/week.  This just won't end!
 
9. L'Oreal True Match Crayon Concealer - seems like this will never end.  I use this to clean up around my eyes every time I do eyeshadow.  Not a fan, really dry/thick/flaky.

10. Elf Flawless Eyeshadow Quad Golden Goddess | large dip in top shade, word wear on others | pan one shade by year end - kind of bleh finish and I don't like the copper shade since I'm not a big fan of warm eyeshadow.  Not going far fast on this one but the pale gold should see pan this year.

12. Gluten-Free Savonnerie Moisturizing Lotion - was 95% | now 60% | I can doooo it!  Sort of thin/runny.

13. ELF Instant Lift Eyebrow Pencil Neutral Brown | 5% | Finish | there actually isn't a LOT of product in these (0.18 g) so it shouldn't take long - going fast - another 1-2 weeks maybe

15. It Cosmetics Je ne Sais Quoi | currently 20% | Finish - making very visible progress, this is basically just overpriced lip balm

17. Nivea Essentials Lip Balm - Not my favorite formula - going fast, very soft, only 20% left

This is going really well.  I think I can do it!",1498867638

That part is bit hard to stomach, but when you just minus it against the points you earn it feels better. Also with the CIP you get 20k UR per person you refer who signs up for it up to five people. Get just one referral it and pays for the annual fee and more. Literally, you can turn UR into cash. Not the best redemption, but it is an option. You can refer friends or family or we have referral threads here where you can post your referral link. Just got 20k UR last week woo hoo! That reminds me, here it is: https://rankt.com/r/churning/referrals/ random referral links for each card from members of r/churning. Use it for the CIP, but I think the SW cards were still just 40k for the referral links even when the high 60k offer was out so don't use those.

The CIP I would downgrade to the CIC after a year. Always better to downgrade if you can to a no fee version if possible to keep your history. Make sure you transfer your UR points to a different card though. The CSR I would keep for the 1.5X UR multiplier. The Sapphire I would downgrade to a Freedom.

"patientgamers","t5_2t3ad","* The *Gundam Vs.* series, in particular the Gundam SEED Destiny one for the PS2. It's a fantastic Gundam simulator (even if the fights don't feel like ""space war""), too bad it's only Japanese. Also tons of fanservice for fans (and even non-fans; I actually watched Destiny after playing that game).
* *Wii Music*. It's a tiny but rather interesting game. Its biggest drawback is sound itself (since sound is generated by user input, it's pretty midi-ey), but it's great to build and record your own arrangements of any of the included songs.
* *Solomon's Key 2* (released in the States as *Fire and Ice*), a very charming NES puzzler. You have to manipulate ice and create or push around ice blocks to put out flames scattered throughout the stages. It's more fun than it sounds.
* The *Pro Evolution Soccer titles for the Wii* use the Wii Remote to full advantage. You're able to manipulate the whole team (well, at least all of your players on screen), pointing to them and leading them to wherever you wish, and a bunch of other tricks.
* *Metroid: Other M* is not exactly hidden, but veeery underrated. Although it IS a subpar Metroid title, it's still a solid game otherwise, with tight gameplay.
* *F-Zero Climax* for the GBA. Japan-only title unfortunately, but the best 2D-plane F-Zero title in my opinion. Amazing music, soundtrack, content and gameplay.
* Does *Gimmick!* still count as hidden? It's an amazing and very advanced NES game, with crazy accurate physics and even crazier music, thanks to the chip it uses.",1498867639

Here's an amusing one... not necessarily clever though... involving the episode ""Proposition Infinity"", where Bender debates against the Professor to legalize Robosexual Marriage.  When the show was edited for syndication and possible earlier broadcast times, the Fox censor would not let Bender say ""I'm our A in the Hole"".  So we changed it to ""I'm a master debater"", which was deemed acceptable.  So proud.

It just happens to be test-bed content which is prone to have bugs, change with each patch and slowly become more and more fleshed out over time.

If you're talking about a finished product, the multi-player sandbox universe is likely at the very least 2.5 years out from an initial release - I outlined why I believe this in [this post reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/6kfa02/will_30_put_sc_6_within_6_months_of_release/djlodk7/?context=3).

Some will certainly disagree with my guesses but then, everyone is guessing at this point so take it as you will.

The first episode of the single-player campaign which takes place in the same universe and is expected to have many of the same features that will eventually be a part of what makes Star Citizen unique is also in development and has a projected (by CIG) release date of this year.

Many will tell you (based on the next to no information that we have about Squadron 42) that it wont be released this year and maybe not even next year.

I'm going to hold off on making any prediction beyond 'earlier than Star Citizen Beta' and that is simply because we have *very* sparse information on the current progress and any blockers with regards to SQ42's development.",1498867640

You know what? You're reminding me of a former friend of mine. I met him in his early 20s. He was a geeky friendly guy, but a little bit awkward. He was an individual, different in his own special way, just like everyone else. We had some common interests and we got along just fine. 

Then, a few years later (in his mid-20s), he got a diagnosis that he had Asperger's Syndrome. Suddenly, everything he said was prefaced with ""as a person with Asperger's"". We had been friends for a few years by this time, and he even started telling me I had to treat him specially ""because I have Asperger's"". When he had a few troubles at work, he accused them of discriminating against him ""because I have Asperger's"". 

He had functioned just fine before the diagnosis. He was just a quirky individual. We all have our own little idiosyncrasies, and that's okay. But, after the diagnosis, he stopped being an individual and became Asperger's Boy‚Ñ¢. 

I got sick of it after a while, and we stopped being friends. 

You are not your diagnosis. Be an individual, not a stereotype.

I started with Blood Money when it came out and worked my way backwards, playing Contracts then Silent Assassin (Codename 47 wasn't an option at the time since I didn't have a computer that wouldn't overheat after 15 minutes). Now I can play it! Yay!

They're all good but also take varying levels of patience. The newest one feels like the older games in many ways but has a number of differences that make it more accessible and a bit easier than past games. Blood Money uses to be the easiest game in the series IMO (and I think most people agree?) But it came out in 2006 so a lot of things would feel a bit stiffer and older by today's standards. Hitman Absolution is meh. It's a decent enough stealth game but not really a good Hitman game IMO.

From there, the games before BM were more difficult. Contracts is a bit harder with its disguise system but the game plays more or less like BM just with less things you can do. Silent Assassin feels a lot different mostly because of how much harder and less forgiving the disguise system is which makes it hard to get the hang of at least for me. Eventually, something clicked and I learned what was and wasn't allowed and had a lot of fun.

Really, most of the games are good but the two easiest to get into would be the new one and BM. If you like the series, you could then buy the others down the road if you're up for an increase in difficulty. FYI, I'm comparing the Normal modes of each game. The newer games' Normal modes are easier than the older games' Normal mode for various reasons.",1498867641

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Be the center of a nasty gossip so they will know exactly how it feels when everyone is spreading meaningless rumors about them. 

In high school a guy ""friend"" ask me if he could come over for a bit because he was locked. He told me his parents went to a dinner party and weren't home yet. It was about 9p-10p not too late but still late enough for me to be in bed (I had super strict Asian parents - think tiger mom). I reluctantly said yes thinking it would be just an hour or two. 

He got there, snuck him in through my window and we talked for a bit.  An hour passed, two hours have passed still nothing. Around hour 4 I was getting really tired and so was he but still no word from his parents. We decided to call it a night. I had two beds in my room. I slept on mine and him on the other completely innocent. I was just about to fall asleep when he gets up and tells me he has to go so I was like okay whatever. He left I went to sleep thinking nothing of it. 

Next morning I got to school and went to my group of friends. They seemed like were in an intense convo about something juicy. As soon as I made eye contact with someone they looked frantic and just stopped talking as soon I approached. I thought it was weird but just brushed it off. Later that day one of my best friends pulled me aside and asked if it was true that I slept with guy friend from the night before. I said ""no, we talked and were about to sleep on different beds but he left"". She believed me but as for everyone else they kind of gave me the cold shoulder from that moment on. The gossip and rumors kept on coming like I slept with him, did all kinds of things with him, how easy I was etc. I've never felt more alone and isolated than during this time. I felt like everywhere I walked people I didn't even know were staring and talking about me even though it's completely not true.

Interesting point. I'm a Kurama fan through &amp; through, so I'm biased towards him by default. So I looked back on the eps we've had so far, &amp; you're right, we really don't have much of Kurama (compared to the others). But in the few episodes we have of him, I believe his distinct character has already shined through. That he is capable of extremes--both tenderness &amp; mercilessness--more than the others. That he provides a refreshing non-traditionally-masculine contrast in the show. It's a different take on ""badass"", compared to Yusuke's or Hiei's (for example). Haven't read the manga yet though, so I don't know how he's handled there. Not really to convince you or anything, but hope that helps shed light on his appeal somehow.

Hokage can only be nominated by the previous hokage. Hiruzen originally named Jiraya to become 4th, but Jiraya refused back then so he had to pick Minato over Orochimaru. Since Minato died before being able to name a successor (and the spot being free for couple of weeks after his death) Hiruzen returned to the position. After Hiruzen's death, naturally the village elders turned to the one he originally named his successor - Jiraya, who once again refused suggesting Tsunade to be better suited and going off to bring her to konoha. After the Pain incident with Tsunade being in a coma and Jiraya being dead the elders wanted Kakashi, but Danzo opposed that nominating himself, since time was short and people were desperate - the elders agreed to name Danzo ""temporary 6th hokage""(replacement, substitute figure)",1498867646

It would definitely help you case. 

If she really intends to go through with this and insist she is moving in, then she needs to provide you with two months WRITTEN notice that she is ending the lease for these purposes AND she has to give you the equivalent of one month's rent.

So for arguments sake let's say she gives you notice on July 1st then you need to vacate by September 1st and she can either give you a cheque / deposit for September's rent OR you can keep September's rent. And remember, it's two FULL months. So if she gives you notice on July 17 to vacate, you have until October 1st.

If she agrees to that then you can then dispute the reason to end tenancy with the RTB. Tell her that she has not acted in good faith and you do not believe she intends to occupy the unit so you intend to file. (It costs around $100 to do this) and you two can go to arbitration.

She'll either bend because she'll have to explain it to arbitration and you have the email showing that she (really) doesn't intend to move in. If she's somewhat smart she'll realize what a pain in the ass and how expensive it would be to have to go through all of this for a few extra hundred dollars a month. She's soured the relationship.

If you do end up going to arbitration, the 2 month notice is effectively on pause until the issue is resolved.

If she does give you notice and agrees to all the terms, start watching the rental posts to see if you can see if she has re-listed her property. That would pretty much sink her.

You have 15 days from when she provides you with notice to file with the RTB.",1498867648

I'd mostly just be guessing at where you might want to take your deck (and what cards you might have in your collection), but those are good for reference and can show you what kind of things work. I don't mean to suggest that you ought to make your deck more like them, but depending on how much you want to tweak, there is a lot that can be drawn out of their construction (for instance, if you want to swap out gold cards, that could be a place to look for inspiration). While they play differently from your deck, strictly speaking they are similar decks:

The smaller trio deck is an example of what makes Kaedweni Sergeant tick and all but four of the bronze and silver cards in it are included in your deck (the exceptions being Roach, Alzur's Double-Cross [which is very similar to Reinforce], Reaver Hunters, and Temerian Infantrymen).

The larger deck has all but four of the bronze and silvers that you have in your deck: Pavetta, Nenneke, Kaedweni Siege Supports, and Ballistae.

&amp;nbsp;

Your deck includes both the muster theme (of which the two decks I linked are good examples) and the machine theme, and the last deck I linked seems to me to be the champion of that.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I'm not a doctor, but you probably have a mix of physical and psychological factors here. High blood pressure is commonly associated with erectile issues. In terms of physical activity having a direct correlation with erectile issues, some research shows yes, some show no. Either way, there isn't a super strong connection there, although it does point to at least having some benefits. Sleep absolutely is connected though. Diet is negligible. If you have diabetes or smoke, then that has a very significant negative impact.

You're clearly distressed about all of this though and are putting a lot of negative judgment on yourself. That definitely has an impact on your erections. Being self-conscious and anxious and/or depressed can get you into the performance anxiety cycle. The masturbation stuff doesn't typically impact your ability to get/maintain erections, unless you're doing it too often. If you're not aroused/turned on when with a partner though and need to make sure that you have specific kinks and/or fetishes involved, that can be a factor. 

Either way, definitely work on those three things you've listed here. Also, read [this section of the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/index#wiki_erection_issues) and yes, do kegels. ",1498867649

The skirmish ended almost as quickly as it began. Qoren's speed and skill proved too much for the older Captain of the Guard, and he quickly put Captain Tycho on the defensive. The ferocious onslaught gave Toks, whom no one could call a skilled fighter, opportunity to get in some hits on the man.

After hitting Tycho several times yet not getting touched themselves, the man straightened up.

""Enough!"" he barked. 

He turned and smiled at Qoren.

""Come now, Master Qoren, did you not expect me to recognize you after that. You've aged up a bit, sure, but you still fight like an angry beast.""

Tycho turned to Princess Meria, watching from the edge of the yard.

""These two will do just fine, Princess. You recall your bastard brother, Qoren Sand? It appears he's come home.""

There was a silence as Meria slowly approached Qoren, studying his face. Her eyes grew wide.

""Qoren..? It **is** you!""

She jumped up and wrapped her arms about Qoren's shoulders, embracing him warmly. After a moment, she let him go, beaming at him before punching him lightly in the arm.

...Especially when these people believe public goods don't exist, and that if the free market, unfettered by regulations, rules, morals, or ethics, doesn't provide, it was never worth providing in the first place.

Now, that would be fine and good if literally any of it was seen through data, but the Austrian school *doesn't believe in data!* Oh, what a surprise!

Maybe it's because the data never says what they want it to say unless they *make* it say what they want it to say. 

Goddamn I hate Austrian schoolers so much. You get a couple good ideas in 300 years and think  that you're hot shit when your ideals have led to the fall of nations and economies ever since.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","Oh if only I could explain in depth, within a Redditor's applicable reading length/level, what all I've been through.  I'm freaked out that I'm still alive honestly.  Still not right with myself though.  It's been years, not just months.  I practically feel dead to be honest with you.  I just get more tired by the day now.  I'm working on a heart attack at the moment.  I've gained all the weight I lost after high school.  And I'm not even being sarcastic about this, the thought has crossed my mind to just let go of myself to the point I have a heart attack and fall over one day; however many times I need to do this until I finally can not be brought back to life or something.

There is much more than just some girl breaking my heart leading me to this though.  I can't put all the blame on her, although I hope I never see her face again now, because just like Spock, I never want to experience that pain again.  The rest of the pain is that, I didn't have a friend network until I moved to another state, go to another high school.  Then they are gone.  Not just moved away themselves or anything, the people that use to hit me up just quit one day.  Like, all of them all of a sudden.  It's completely fucked my head up, I don't make friends like that either.  I am the only person I trust now pretty much.  At least, as far as IRL goes.  I've shared much with my parents too, and I am still somewhat close to them, but that's not the same as a friend network.  Ever since then all I keep running into are trolls pretty much.

I guess you could say this is my 3rd attempt.  First time I tried to hang myself in the house I was raped in; on the second story balcony/banister.  My grandfather was there when I got there though so...he interviened of course.  And we sat there and talked about God some.  Although I don't believe in God myself, I still cherish all the moments I had with my gpa on that porch, watching out over the mountains into the sky and wondering all the worldly things while enjoying the colours life has to offer.  Second time I forced a quart of moonshine into me and put a 12 gauge barrel in my mouth.  Dad came home from work right when I was going to load it.  And now this, letting my body die naturally.  Sorta like when a mother dies of depression from a child not making it or something.  Normally they just stop eating and drinking water.  Where as I am gorging myself because food is the only thing I sorta like still; tasty stuff to trick the mind while I destroy my body intentionally.  I fake it until I make it.  I lie and tell everyone around me I'm fine and just hope they are used to seeing my melancholy face ya know, think I'm content.  And just wait patiently for an artery to collapse or clog or whatever happens.  Really weird way to attempt suicide if you ask me.  And no, I don't cut myself, I can't even imagine or fathom that sense of self infliction.",1498867652

Always lots of fun recording with our cast, but some things do stand out...
- In the earliest days, John DiMaggio was the ""new guy"" who could not stop laughing while the other actors were trying to record their lines.  We had to get a large pillow for him to hold over his face and suffocate himself temporarily.  True.
- Of course having Shatner and Nimoy in at that same time was a lifetime highlight.  All the writers wanted to be there but we didn't want to scare them with a mob of drooling nerds, so the writers all jammed into the recording booth and hid with the engineer until the end of the session, when everyone exploded out like clowns from a clown car.

"TheSilphRoad","t5_3c2d7","Dev here: I haven't taken a single look inside the APK of PoGo, but this sounds a lot like a cache collision of some type of ""op log."" And it's understandable to see why this is a tricky problem.

Example: Vaporeon a5b7 attacks Gym 12345 at 10:07T00:00. The actions you take on your side to attack obviously can't wait to be confirmed by the server side before taking place. They therefore cache them locally and attempt to sync with the server and resolve any conflicts as friendly as possible. This is likely the same as the dodge/death bug. ""Dodged!"" (locally) ""Pokemon dead!""(server) ...""wait, we're not on the same page here. I dodged that. I'm alive!"" ""No you didn't. You're dead!"" (Server) etc...

We see that happen all the time in the game. What OP is describing sounds like a more serious, long-lived cache collision where neither the server or the client can differentiate between the gym battle transaction that happened earlier and the gym battle transaction happening now. It's simply replaying the op log of the previous battle thinking that it's syncing up with the server side. Perhaps the gym battles happened too close together in time to differentiate them? Perhaps they're not uniquely identifying the attributes of specific gym battle accurately enough? (This is the scarier one)

Either way, serious bug and I don't envy the person that needs to fix this.

Falta-me um mais espec√≠fico que trata espec√≠ficamente a adiada reforma do nosso sistema eleitoral (j√° em 1985 se achava ultrapassado).

Ao n√≠vel de fic√ß√£o li ""O Homem que era Quinta-Feira"" de um escritor brit√¢nico que na √©poca era bastante conhecido mas actualmente quase esquecido, G. K.

The intimacy of the wedding was amazing and every single person in our party gave a heartfelt speech during our lunch reception. Neither of us wanted a huge wedding and this was the perfect intimate ceremony for us. We also opened up the rest of the weekend to friends and family in the area to continue celebrating with us.

Either way, Microsoft isn't really participating in the VR space at all right now. PC is a free for all, and PS4 has Sony funding first party titles for it. The PSVR is $400, and has been selling out, but at just $200 more, the Oculus Rift doesn't. And the Vive at $800 sells, but doesn't sell out either.

My final time was 6:49, a little over 5 minutes but, I made a pitch count every break in sets just so that I get my head back to it.  

Only in the final round, I did it unbroken.  However, like most commenters, I speed up on the next round and I remember the round of 15 felt really hard to do even when I break it 5-5-5.  

My rule of thumb with sprint style workout (21-15-9) is to scale the weight to the point where I can do them either unbroken or in big sets of 2-3 at most with good form.  If you have to do 4-4-3-3-1, then scale.

* The shoulder seam should hit the small bone on top of your shoulder without being constricting and too tight.

* button all the way up and you should be able to comfortably fit two fingers between the collar of the shirt and your neck.

* While still buttoned grab a handful of the fabric with one hand and the shirt should now be tight.

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","If half of this is accurate this is just an alarming confirmation of the rumours of May aiming for no deal and the general lack of all the personal qualities needed to deliver Brexit properly (lacking in both May &amp; Davis).

&gt; Mr Chapman said the reason for wanting to withdraw from Euratom was to prevent the free movement of nuclear scientists, which is governed by the ECJ.

Seriously, wtf. What the actual f is this obsession with the ECJ good for. What former ECJ decisions have been so bad for Britain to have made May so absolutist. My guess it's the stuff on mass surveillance. 

Basically, the ECJ red line trumps the economy, nuclear scientists, euratom, preservation of the rights of UK expats, participation in other programs, ** the UK's security **, fast access to new medicines, being able to deport &amp; arrest criminals that have crossed borders, the ability of UK digital industries to do business with EU customers and businesses smoothly and so on.

And what will Brits get in return? 

- A more oppressive, unrestrained surveillance scheme

- fewer places to challenge and appeal decisions made against Brits in the UK

- in the long term perhaps the scrapping of the HRA, which could be replaced by a new bill of rights that includes fewer rights and fewer protections.

This is obscene authoritarianism running amok. And the irony is that pro-liberties Davis of all people is the guy trying to deliver this new Britain.

Obviously they want more log ins per day, but there has to be reasonable balance or they will lose their player base.  Right now we have GW - time intensive, lots of different timers for various store refreshes, flash events at other times, arena payout, guild raid times, on and on.  It's a lot!

To hit all the store refreshes, I currently have to log in in the following time periods:

9pm-6am

6am-12pm

12pm-6pm

6pm-9pm

For flash events:

10am-11am

2pm-3pm

6pm-7pm

7pm-8pm

9pm-10pm

I've also got regular arena payout at 6pm, ship arena payout at 7pm.

Plus I have to remember to check the challenges 5 different times, ship challenges 2 times, and wait between 5 arena countdowns.  Not to mention 5 free bronziums spread out (not a big deal at all to miss those, but they're still there).

If they're going to add more content, streamline some of that!  Eliminate the cooldowns on challenges, so I can knock them all out at once and not think about it again later (I waste a lot of time going back to recheck and make sure they're done).  Add an option to GW so you can go right into the next round with your same team to speed things up.  Reduce the cooldown in between arena/ship battles so there's not so much waiting around.  Give us our 5 free bronziums at the same time.

Do some of that to streamline the old stuff and reduce the time burden of the game and I'm happy to see new content.  If they don't do anything to streamline the older stuff, then I'm right there with you.",1498867660

This twilight zone episode always stuck out to me, and it really is a kickass reminder. It's called ""people are alike all over."" It's so true. Every person online who is just such a total piece of shit in another strangers eyes is just living their life, and working to survive within the environment they happen to be in. No one is waking up and stomping around trying to shit on internet strangers all day every day. Well, maybe. But I don't think so, since I can only speak from my perspective. And I just don't have it in me to be that person. It's easy to demonize someone else and decide you're just a thousand percent better than they are.

The same private companies are making money from phone calls in private and public prisons.  The same private food service companies are profiting from public prisons.  The same private security services, IT support, uniform suppliers, maintenance workers, etc etc etc etc etc

Regarding that Bender in space episode -- ""Godfellas"" (ep 3ACV20) -- I was just talking about it with the episode's writer, Ken Keeler, last week.  He had stumbled across his first outline for the script, and it reminded us that in the original plan for that episode, the entire Bender-in-space adventure was just act one of a completely unrelated story (I already forgot what it was about).

In my opinion as long as you're not negatively affecting people, which I doubt you are, I assume you just lack confidence, then you are good enough for anyone's friendship. Also, I'm sure you'll find people who instantly latch onto you (confidence really helps with this, people like confident people).

In terms of your mother, unless she's really homophobic, I suggest being open with her about it. She may not be warm to it at first but I'm willing to bet she'll come to terms with it. (ALSO I'M NOT AWARE OF THE LGBT SITUATION IN COLOMBIA SO USE YOUR OWN DISCRETION ON THIS ONE, THE WORLD IS CATCHING UP IN A LOT OF PLACES).

If you want to feel good about yourself and confident, suicide is not the right move. For many people, coming out can really help their confidence in themselves (THOUGH AGAIN IT MAY WELL BE REALLY TOUGH BEING GAY IN COLOMBIA BUT I DON'T KNOW).

I was a little annoyed, like, dude, move to the turn lane or bike lane or something, don't block the middle of the road, but as I slowly went around... 

Dude had stopped and was calmly chilling in front of a fucking massive cow just standing in the road. Deer? Fuck deer. But this beefy motherfucker was like the size of a minivan and clearly not bothered by cars driving past. I drove a 4 door Fiesta, heck, small dogs could screw my car up if I hit them. If I ran into this fucking enormous black COW chilling in the road at 10:39 pm, I'd have totaled my car. It scared the fuck out of me when I realized I'd almost completely fucked myself up.

Yes, this is the point of contention that the WTS legal dept had their shirts in a knot over. They tried, unsuccessfully, to argue that because the Commission's mandate was to investigate *institutional* abuse, that any child abuse issues that they had did not fall under the Commission's mandate. They claimed that not only were the majority of the JW cases familial, but that the abuse could not be considered institutional because the JWs did not run programming, etc that put children into an institutional setting. 

The ARC rejected the WTS' arguments and clearly stated that because incidents of child sex abuse allegations were handled internally, with record keeping, etc, that the internal handling of the cases made them into institutional cases. In other words, the mandatory judicial system is what makes the familial cases institutional cases.

I find this concept to be interesting. The JW family is an institution. The org's judicial process has institutionalized the JW family.

Dear Futurama, You rock.  Especially when that guy was on the roof.  PS:  Do you know The Simpsons?

Okay, I have a few questions:

* What advice do you have to an aspiring TV writer?

* What's your favorite Futurama episode? 

* Is there a possibility of another direct to video(or possibly theatrical) Futurama movie?

* To either of the voice actors, what is your hardest character to voice?

* To Mr. Cohen, when you or any of the other writers were coming up with plotlines and gags, where did you get your inspiration? 

* Now, a question for Mr. Groening. In episode 2F09, when Itchy plays Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone, he strikes the same rib twice in succession, yet he produces two clearly different tones. I mean, what are we to believe, that this is some sort of a... magic xylophone or something? Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","Mine is inspired by this. It's a lot simpler than it seems, and very fast. My system separates movement from actions entirely. Initiative is similar to what Matt describes, except that it's either a d4, d6, or d8. The important thing to understand is what the system means.

When you declare your action, you are generally performing that action, and the die roll indicates when that action resolves. In other words, it's not when you take your turn, but when your turn takes effect.

Initiative starts with 1, and you are simply counting segments until your next turn resolves.

Spells that end at the beginning or end of a creature's next turn work the same way as usual. Spells that last until the beginning or end of YOUR next turn last 10 segments instead. I haven't checked every spell yet to see if I'll make any exceptions yet.

When you complete your turn, you roll for your next initiative count. After the first round you add 4 to the die roll (this is always 4, not cumulative). So players just need to keep track of when their next turn resolves, the DM tracks the monsters, players, and effects, of course. But it's a simple sequential list.

Each time your turn resolves, you refresh your bonus action/reaction as well. So if you took a reaction, once your turn arrives, you receive another reaction. 

You can choose to hold your turn, that is, if you are on segment 13, you can wait until somebody else finishes something on 15, then take your turn. 

If it's necessary to know what happens first, you make an opposed initiative check (d20 with regular initiative modifiers). If you held your turn, you have disadvantage on this check.

Movement is typically tracked from turn to turn, the question being whether you can get someplace without running. You can move 5 feet per segment (base speed 30), but if you aren't using a grid the DM can just tell you whether you are close enough or not. You can start a Dash with a reaction, but must use an Action to keep dashing.

"learndota2","t5_2tta4","&gt; That one time courier usage could delay important items to mid, which is arguably the most important lane to win during the laning phase. 

Sorry, but I think one-time usage of the courier by either of the side lanes is completely justifiable, even if the midlane is more important. Saying otherwise is the same as stating that the courier is **only** usable by the midlane during that time. Are you claiming that the offlaner never uses the courier during this time? I still think this is completely ridiculous.

As I said, a starting RoR *does* give you more options to survive -- since you are already effectively 10 last hits ahead in your path to a Soul Ring, you don't need to get as close as frequently and can afford to play more slowly. As Timbersaw for example, this is fine since you can rely on reactive armor to augment your durability.

"Warhammer40k","t5_2rr81","Oh hey, I remember that thread.

The Start Collecting box is a great start, as mentioned. Tyrants are solid and warriors are our versatile heavy infantry. Carnifex broods are solid, especially with Old One Eye. You can take a brood of three fexes, and each will operate independently. OOE provides buffs and regenerates wounds, and will utterly decimate things in close combat.

Trygons are good for getting troops in close fast, and can line up a rough charge at the start of the game. Mawlocs can't charge, but can harass an opponent and put them on their back foot at the start of a game. I've used both to great effect. Exocrines and Tyrannofexes can be devastating as artillery support since they'll fire twice if stationary. 

Beyond that it's largely to taste with big bugs. Tervigons are better for swarms of gaunts, but can make an on-demand troop unit if you set up points for them. Haruspex and Maleceptors are good in the right situations (clearing heavy infantry and providing durable synapse, respectively). Harpies and Crones are fast and can help with the alpha-strike by charging gunline targets turn one, though each has a preferred target option (vehicles vs hordes respectively). 

For support, I would recommend Warriors or Zoanthropes for Synapse, Hive Guard or Biovores for ranged support, Tyrannocytes for deploying big melee bugs, and Trygons for depositing troops on the board. You can never go wrong with genestealers, but that may be a bit more model-intensive than you want to go.

Anywho, TL,DR;

 - Synapse / Psyker: Swarmlord, Hive Tyrants, Tervigon, Maleceptor, Trygon Prime, Sporocyst

 - Melee: Carnifex, Old One Eye, Haruspex, Toxicrene, Trygon, Swarmlord, Tyrant can be loaded out as such

I think this was Mvp beating TT1, Dimaga, San and MKP to claim a GSL; it was a 16-man tournament 8 of which were charity foreigner seeds (all foreigners died to the first Korean they faced).

I also gotta love how the the GSL supposedly took a strong stance against cheating but they flew maphacker TT1 over, and let maphacker Dragon play but they kicked out CoCa and Byun because omagawd they Byun asked for an extra game in a 10 EUR prize pool online cup and CoCa gave it to him and the admins didn't even intervene who were watching as it happened.

GSL doesn't give a shit about cheating; they only give a shit when there is enough outrageous to make them give a shit. Wallaah if no one cared about Life's fixing because he was too popular GSL and KeSPA would just let him continue on.",1498867673

On top of that we were still in the middle of a hunt for the playoffs in NASL our office still need to finish that season before they really could get into preparing for MLS.

So essentially we had from November till February to but together a team to start competing in March.  To try to pull in a big name player we would have been over paying due to it being mid-season every where else, there would have also been an transfer fee cause they would have still been under contract somewhere.

"summonerswar","t5_324pd","Hi :D i would like to ask some stuff today again! thanks in advance everyone~ ,first off my current progress :

- I am currently farming GB10 and DB10 quite easily with 3min runs on both, i thought about starting speed teams but my rune quality isn't there yet, i am not interested in NB10 yet,tough i have most of the recommended monster and even a Water Lich in storage,never used him yet.
- Toan cleared twice so far easily, Toah atm stuck on artamiel F80, i am running a stun lock team with Baretta,Hemos,Woonhak,Spectra,Mav , woonhak and hemos are my latest additions so they are poorly runed HP wise,i just took my leftover runes with decent spd and acc, its working because enemies don't touch me and mav perma taunts bosses, of course doesn't work vs Artamiel cuz he counterattacks,i will let go of those beautiful 300 crystals for this month Q.Q ( i am F2P but at around 3k crystals atm due to anniversary events &lt;3 )

- I tried yesterday a few runs on Raids to see what i can reach, couldn't clear R3 so i guess i am not ready for grindstone farming yet. no progress on PvP either just farming glory points with one weak unit on defense,even tough i am working on my Lushen atm so i might give it a go sometime soon.



 * Now for my questions! please bear with me x) :

- how can i further improve my runes? been farming for 3 months or so both gb10 and db10 (db10 for only a month and half i think) , i thought about trying grindstones but as i said R3 got me wiped so i guess i am not there yet?

- Am i ready for some lushen-ing? once i +15 his 2/4/6 runes, he will have +1700 atk ( total 2600 ) , 60% Cr and 157 Cd , if i want to further improve those i gotta stick to GB10 for a bit more i guess, is this any good? i have Megan and Bernard on +210 spd if i remember well, check out my swarfarm plz and rate? :D

- Oh yea i got my first Ifrit pieces summon yesterday, and i got the one i wanted! Tesarion :D , i know everyone loves and wants Theomars, but i personally do not think i have good enough runes to make full use of him, Tesarion seems like the best for some Toah progress and for the Oblivion debuff as i have no other unit with that, what kinda build can i aim for him? and stats?

- I would like to improve my DB10 runs even if by only a tiny bit,i got Verde and he is a 19k hp,100cr and 160 spd, i tried the classic verde face team of Verde(L),Vero,Bella,Megan,Sig, its the same spd as my previous team and it fails more so i am not using verde in DB10 so far, back to my right tower team of Sig(L),Vero,Bella,Briand,Konamiya , almost never fails and is just at 3-4mins. what should i work on to improve my Verde team? i would love a sub 2min team.

https://swarfarm.com/profile/Knight8ray/ my swarfarm is 2 or so days behind i popped a 12h double exp today so tesa is already 5 star max and the fodder to 6 star him is almost ready.",1498867678

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Back in college over spring break, 7 of us were staying at a beach resort. One night (around 11pm) we're getting a little hungry and decide to go to Waffle House, one of the few ""restaraunts"" open 24/7. We had two cars, so Car A had 3 people and Car B had 4. Not really knowing where this Waffle House was, we agreed to meet there.

I was in Car A. So we fire up the GPS and it looks like we'll be going about 12 miles on the highway to get to our destination. I'm thinking that's kinda a drive just for Waffle House, but whatever.

About 15 minutes later, we pull into the Waffle House, ready for our confectionary delights. My friends from Car B are not there yet, but we're all like, eh, they'll be here soon. It would be understandable if they for lost; the place was out of the way.

So I get a call about 5 minutes later from my friend was driving Car B. ""We're here, but where are you guys?""

I look around the restaurant and don't see him and give my friends a confused look. ""Umm, we're at the Waffle House,"" I reply. ""I don't see you here.""

""Which exit did you take?"" He asks. I tell him. 

Turns out his GPS had him go to a different Waffle House in the area, about 5 miles closer to the resort than the one we were at.

So we enjoyed our sugary late dinners at the same franchise, but at different locations. We didn't feel like meeting up at that point.

I think our GPS's planned to separate us that night. They succeeded.",1498867680

"sousvide","t5_2rzyz","In general, tender cuts can be done at short cook times with good results, and tough cuts do better on long cooks. [Here is a sous vide time-temp table](http://therationalkitchen.com/sous-vide-time-temperature-table-proteins/) that may help.

Here's the thing. Since sous vide is done at a constant and relatively low temp, you can't overcook the meat. Leaving it in longer simply changes the texture (""long"" meaning more than 6 hrs or so). So with short ribs (beef), you can cook them for 72 hrs at 140F and the result is fall-apart-tender-yet-medium-ribs with some pink inside. This is not a result you can get by braising them in the oven--they'll be fall apart tender, but faaaaar from pink.

I'm not sure how this works for pork, and I've had the same question about the collagen breakdown. However, when I sous vide ribs I do it at 150F for 48 hrs and they are tender and juicy every time. If anyone has an answer why this works, I'd love to hear it. 

I think ""newer"" sous vide sites are trying to make sous vide a more mainstream cooking method by offering recipes that don't take any longer (or not much longer, anyway) than an oven. IMO this misses the whole point of sous vide. Sous vide is a tool you can use to manipulate results with amazing precision. Long cooks are part of that. Furthermore, sous vide allows you to stop looking at a clock while cooking! You can throw steaks in and they'll be done in an hour, but you can sear them at any point after that hour is up and they'll be just as good. This kind of freedom is not possible with any other cooking method.

And FWIW, don't do your veggies w/your meat. Either do them before, as treesarecool said, or do them on the stove. Sous vide veggies are great, but I think you lose more than you gain trying to do them with the meat. ",1498867681

That's a great question. Recently we scientists have spent a lot of time researching exactly the question of the ""musicality"" of animals. You may have seen Snowball the dancing parrot, or Ronan the head-bobbing sea lion on You Tube. These animals appear to ""get"" the rhythm of music the way people do. More specifically, they can hear the beat in complex musical rhythms, like we do.

Also, the natural behavior of some animals, like rhythmic drumming of bonobos and the duetting of gibbons might be closely related to human musical behavior.

However, I do agree with you that music -- as we normally think of it --- is a human invention. Or perhaps not so much an invention as a discovery about the fundamental nature of how the brain responds to sound. That is where the theory of synchrony of neural oscillations comes in. 

Our cortical simulations, essentially explain how people heat the beat in complex rhythms. Let's see if I can embed a link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJPBayI9x9k. However, at a faster time scale, we believe this theory will also explain the perception of pitch, consonance and dissonance, and tonality (perception of notes in a melody as stable or unstable). We have a number of papers on tonality already, and we are currently

I had some Achilles tendinitis issues while training up for a halfie a couple of years back and went through a similar set of emotions / loss  - couldn't run for eight weeks. 

While it's not the same I found that I could kinda keep going with training by doing deep water running (ie in a deep enough pool to not touch the bottom), it's zero impact and helps keep your form and muscle tone. However its really, really boring, could only manage about an hour of it before getting sick of it. 

Just remember, you're doing the right thing by managing the injury, it's not forever and you know the way to get back to where you were. 

For me - mine's a cycling injury too, I have traffic trust issues now so haven't been back on the bike properly for a year. We'll get there eventually. Maybe summer this year. ",1498867684

Even shedding the salaries of Randolph, Allen, *and* Carter (combined $20m), you're still already almost at next year's cap. You're paying a combined $74.2m to only three guys. Basically, even if you could schedule a few interviews, you can't afford practically anyone, anyway.

Hi everyone, I don't think I realized the AMA was going live immediately. Does making music make you smarter? No, not really. The Mozart effect was reported early on and gained a lot of media attention,  but no one could replicate it. More recently there have been some studies that have correlated increased performance in certain kinds of tasks by people who study music. And of course, there are therapeutic applications of music.

"mattcolville","t5_3f0mp","Mine is inspired by this. It's a lot simpler than it seems, and very fast. My system separates movement from actions entirely. Initiative is similar to what Matt describes, except that it's either a d4, d6, or d8. The important thing to understand is what the system means.

When you declare your action, you are generally performing that action, and the die roll indicates when that action resolves. In other words, it's not when you take your turn, but when your turn takes effect.

Initiative starts with 1, and you are simply counting segments until your next turn resolves.

Spells that end at the beginning or end of a creature's next turn work the same way as usual. Spells that last until the beginning or end of YOUR next turn last 10 segments instead. I haven't checked every spell yet to see if I'll make any exceptions yet.

When you complete your turn, you roll for your next initiative count. After the first round you add 4 to the die roll (this is always 4, not cumulative). So players just need to keep track of when their next turn resolves, the DM tracks the monsters, players, and effects, of course. But it's a simple sequential list.

Each time your turn resolves, you refresh your bonus action/reaction as well. So if you took a reaction, once your turn arrives, you receive another reaction. 

You can choose to hold your turn, that is, if you are on segment 13, you can wait until somebody else finishes something on 15, then take your turn. 

If it's necessary to know what happens first, you make an opposed initiative check (d20 with regular initiative modifiers). If you held your turn, you have disadvantage on this check.

Movement is typically tracked from turn to turn, the question being whether you can get someplace without running. You can move 5 feet per segment (base speed 30), but if you aren't using a grid the DM can just tell you whether you are close enough or not. You can start a Dash with a reaction, but must use an Action to keep dashing.

"reddevils","t5_2rxse","The trouble you've got there is; that if we were to drop Carrick (12 months left), Ibra (already gone), Rooney (going in at the most 12 months) and Valencia (who fucking knows), you then looking at a team that is almost too young across the board.

We have plenty of players who are not that old already that fall into the 23-26 age ranges; Pogba, De Gea, Bailly, Jones, Lingard, Lindelof (at the start of the season). And we've got a shit load of under-23's that are already starting games for us.

And you're point that all age groups are lasting longer is pretty much irrelevant. If the argument is ""oh my god these guys are 28 and 29"", then to say ""well everyone is improving physically"" might be the most moot point you could make. Sure, a 23-year old now would destroy most players from 20 years ago, but the 30-year olds would destroy most of anyone from back then too.

And you've also said how Perisic is in a position where he is most vulnerable to decline, but look at the wide-men out there now who are still killing it at 28+ in Di Maria, Robben, Ronaldo, Sanchez, Reus.

By your logic, Alexis Sanchez would be too big a risk. I'd break the Pogba record for Alexis if that's what it took, the man is a fucking machine.


And what's worse; someone on YOUR side of the debate would have said ""Van Persie is too old"", or ""Ibrahimovic is too old"", or going further back; ""Larsson is too old"".

Finally;

&gt;expensive patch-up jobs below the standard of a title-winning team

That's the worst part of your post, and to me makes me think you don't know enough about the players in question. They are both brilliant players that would add to any side, and Chelsea fans are unhappy that the idea of him rejoining Mou for us is evidence alone on that, and Perisic has been one of those players that has held Inter afloat during this shite run they've had, and their fanbase is desperate to hold onto him.",1498867690

This is difficult to ask questions about. Seems like everyone has their own personal soundtrack list for motivation &amp; relaxation.

I prefer radio stations that are theme based. Popular stations can alternate between aggressive beats and calming rhythms and when they play a song I wasn't 'in the mood for' I'm often quickly changing the channel even if it is a song I've enjoyed before.

I guess my question is this: how long does it take to change the mood by changing the tune?

I agree, everyone has their own musical preference! ""how long does it take to change the mood by changing the tune?"" I'm going to guess you mean how long does it take to change a person's mood by playing a specific kind of music. Is that right?

If that's what you mean, I think it all depends on whether or not the person is open to having his/her mood changed. We do experiments all the time in the perception of emotion -- and mood is understood by psychologists and neuroscientists as being the same sort of thing as emotion, but it just happens on a longer time scale And emotional experience is relatively short, whereas a mood can last days.

Anyway, imagine you just broke up with your lover, and you are in one of our experiments. You are horribly depressed, but I play you some music and ask whether its happy or sad. You can tell that it's happy, but it doesn't actually make you happy, you are still depressed.

But at other times, listening to happy music can actually change you mood. It is all about the interaction between the music and the intrinsic dynamics of your brain. It is going to take us a long time to sort that out scientifically.",1498867693

It's hard to say how expensive that will end up after you take into account DDoS attacks and transaction volume, but the main expenses at such companies wouldn't be paying for a few servers. It would be paying employees a salary. 

The infrastructure costs can still be made very low if its properly designed and after seeing transaction volumes on niche exchanges like EtherDelta, I doubt it would cost that much to host servers for - even if you do take into account bandwidth.

The issue here is that even though these things don't cost that much to run, you still need to guarantee there's proper incentives for user to want to bother to run matching servers. So 0x has a few issues there but it doesn't seem to be impossible to fix their design.",1498867694

How you don't understand is beyond me.

 Also I really think you underestimate the amount of support it takes to make it possible for the military to have those shiny helicopters and tanks. Without the support of another nation the US military would have 0 chance against the armed populace of the US. 

Also, based on this ""So how are your pop-guns going to fare against 1,000 Apache helicopters?"" You see, based on the constitution and our natural rights we should be able to own the weapons that are required to deal with tanks and helicopters, but they have been immorally and unconstitutional deprived of us since the early 20th century. We need those rights back to better deal with the modern weaponry the state has.

So you have tinnitus? Unfortunately, this happens to many people and is so annoying that it has literally led some to suicide. I'm afraid I can't answer as to why that sensation is annoying, but it may be that the phantom sound experienced by tinnitus sufferers is treated as a real sound by the brain, so serves to orient attention. Unfortunately there is no known cure for tinnitus, but for tonal tinnitus really any sound helps. White noise is good. Also, some audiologists report temporary relief by playing real sounds whose frequency is near the frequency of the phantom sound. There are some apps out there that trey to choose music for you based on the frequency of your tinnitus.

The top 3 engines DID NOT come with 2 speed automatic tranny. I have tried to run the special cam shaft 315 gross hp edit with a 2 speed tranny. And all ratios , general behavior and power were so off and low. Lack of torque at the bottom end showed through 2 speed auto. However once fitted with 3 or 4 speed manual the car becomes alive. I am not going to link the exact quote but that is exactly what I read up on those cars on line. Also depending on how you slide and dice the math each engine come in Slow Medium and Fast versions as well. So there will be total of 15 different engines edits in one pack. 5 x 5 x 5 . The way I locked the gear ratios in garage allows you to switch between 3 speed and 4 speed ratios all within garage section without the need of separate EXEs for 3 and 4 speeds. Other wise there would have been 30 different EXE.  15- 3 speed and 15 - 4 speeds. However no need for that. Super slick. Also only 4 options of differential ratios are available. Which ever once the 1961 cars came with 3 and 4 speeds. Also 3.56 diff ratio was only for automatic and I could not feet that one in the number of steps-skips-clicks to include it with the other ratios. So basically you got your slow med fast 283 - 195 hp automatic edit separately from others. Anyway when all done and complete it should be the bomb to try out and compare all different versions on the track. ",1498867697

Male circumcision is the removal of the foreskin from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans. After that, a circumcision device may be placed and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is used to reduce pain and physiologic stress.

I want to thank you so much for your post. I recently lost someone out of my life who I loved very much - he removed himself from me, telling me that the fact that I cared about him, and the nice things I would do for him were more than he could bear, that the feeling that he didn't deserve anything good was overwhelming, and there this huge backlash of self-hatred doing him in. This was so hard, because I *do* care, and doing nice things is one of the ways I show it, but he shut down and went away. He told me, and allowed me to see, that he is in a really crushing depression. I don't think he was lying about any of this, but deep down I kept feeling that if someone leaves me, it means they don't like me. So I was feeling like I was going to lose my mind, in addition to the deep sadness over the loss of him.

So the loss is still there, but when I read your post, it made me feel like this thing is real, where someone can't accept other people being nice to them. And knowing that made it hurt less. I wish it weren't that way, for him and for you, but you really gave me a huge piece of comfort, relief, and a bit of my sanity back by explaining the feeling so vividly. So thank you for this.

I hope that you can come to feel that you deserve good things, to accept them and fully receive all the kind intentions that go with them. I think that in and of itself is a good thing that you very much deserve.

Thank you again.",1498867702

"TokyoGhoul","t5_315h3","Funnily enough, [Eto **adopted** her ""birdcage"" philosophy](http://readms.net/r/tokyo_ghoulre/061/3188/18) from [Kanou himself](http://68.media.tumblr.com/628d331e197f3b7bc16f19b284e52ab3/tumblr_inline_nlxqg6ZHes1rg62an_540.jpg). 

When it comes to the birdcage, Kaneki, Eto, and Arima were all just inadvertently puppets to Kanou's plans to destroy the boundaries holding back human and ghoul evolution. Eto simply believed that ""the birdcage"" was V's fascist control over the world since she blames them for the destruction of her family and her own life. 

[Even Kaneki doesn't really believe or care about the coexistence between humans and ghouls](http://readms.net/r/tokyo_ghoulre/118/4131/15). Just like Takizawa, he simply just wants to live but of course he has his responsibilities and his *burdens* holding him back from accomplishing that: his friends. Much like the play referenced in the original series, Kaneki is simply playing ""his role"" as both savior and antichrist.

In the end, Kanou will most likely break ""the birdcage"" and the true villain of the entire series will win. Kanou and Furuta aren't actually strengthening humanity; they are *destroying* humanity from the inside out, making them rotten. 

An ""outbreak"" of ROS disease would make sense since Kanou and Furuta will be researching the possible reverse engineering of [Noro's ""life force""](http://readms.net/r/tokyo_ghoulre/121/4184/16). The rapid cellular regeneration and metabolism found in Noro (and Karren) can be compared to a cancer. Let's not forget that *everyone* has RC cells so if they were all to metabolize and over-secrete at ROS/Noro levels then you either have a pandemic of [berserk Noro ""zombies""](http://readms.net/r/tokyo_ghoulre/54/3069/11) or ROS sufferers. 

An accelerated ROS disease pandemic is basically just like the the Apocalypse Virus from Guilty Crown -- except with fleshy eldritch growths instead of cancer crystals.

"tf2","t5_2qka0","Sure it is true that the game was designed around 12v12 at first, because without releasing the game to the public, the competitive format wouldn't have been created. But when the game was released there were a lot of balance issues. Demo had 6 shots in the grenade launcher, and sticky bombs had a larger radius. Pyro didn't have airblast and Engineer couldn't level up his buildings. The terrible balance wasn't caused by 12v12 format directly, but I'm just stating that from the beginning it wasn't balanced. 

When you want to balance a game, or find balance issues, or do an experiment, you have to isolate variables. Let me start by saying that 1v1s are the best way to find out if something is unbalanced because there are less random factors. In a 12v12 format, there are many random things that occur which don't make it easy to isolate the variables. 

A player can't possibly predict what all 12 players on the other team are doing, so it's much more likely for one player to get luckier than the other. Players also can't perform at their full potential because they'll die to the other team's focus fire and spam. Just think of all the times people get undeserving kills even though they wouldn't win in a 1v1.

Some specific classes are hard to kill in 12v12 stalemates like Medic, Sniper, and Engineer because they are always protected. Pushing also takes very long. If you kill one half of the team, then the other half, the first half will already be alive again. 

There's also the fact that 11v12 is a small disadvantage. If one player is useless on a 12 man team, it is less noticed. This is the entire philosophy that casual is built on so that bad players can participate, and above average players aren't at their full potential. It's flawed to balance a game where skill doesn't yield the proper reward. ",1498867702

One is that music evolved as a sort of fitness display and is therefore linked to reproduction. But I'm skeptical of that one.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I'm not going to tell you whether you should or shouldn't draw on your 401k to buy a home, but I can tell you some of the benefits.

First, DO NOT withdraw the money.  Early withdrawals come with a tax penalty, so never, ever, ever do it.  Instead, take out a **401k loan**.  401k's have special loans specifically for purchasing homes.  The interest rates are low and the terms can be long, so the monthly payment for the loan will be lower than if you borrowed that money directly from a MTG lender.  Additionally, the balance is still in your account making the money as if it were still there, so you're not losing any investment returns.

Private Mortgage Insurance is almost impossible to get away from these days, and most lenders require the borrower to pay for it.  PMI is a percentage of the loan amount, so the less you borrow from the mortgage lender, the less you'll have to pay in PMI as well.  If you put enough down so your loan is &lt;80% of the home's value, you won't even need to pay PMI at all.  To put that into perspective, PMI is about $50/month for every $100k borrowed right now.

Your 401k isn't collateralized on your home, either.  That's because it's your money you're borrowing from yourself.  So if you default on your 401k loan, you don't lose your house - you just lose that balance in your 401k.  You don't want to go default on your 401k loan, though, as they just treat it as a withdrawal which comes with penalties.

Since a down-payment is instant equity, the moment you sell your home, you can easily pay your 401k back in full.  This is of course barring any crisis we saw back in the mid-oughts, so be sure to do your research on the home and ensure it hasn't appreciated much more than the national average of 3% a year over the last few years.

As long as you do it correctly and pay it back, a 401k loan isn't a bad idea.  Buying a house outside your budget may very well be, though.",1498867702

Wow. Reddit people ask great questions! I have not seen any research that asks that question directly. We do know that in congenitally deaf individuals auditory cortex may be recruited in the service of vision and other things. However, it is not clear whether this changes the rhythms in that part of cortex. We do think that our LED visualizations may be interesting for deaf and hard of hearing people as an alternative way to experience music, and we are doing outreach to the deaf community.

Good question. Believe it or not, music and memory is not as widely investigated as it should be. We do know that music, and especially rhythm helps people to remember things. There is plenty of evidence about that. The mechanism is not yet clear, however. But I would point out that the hippocampus, which is critical in memory formation, works on theta oscillations.

if you do add some sort of identity system, it also outs you as an individual on owning a particular address at a particular time, and could be used to chain transactions either direction.

part of the bonded requirement is that when you go to a notary, part of their license with the state *requires them* to show up when called upon by a court or government, and verify their notary seal.  failure to do so triggers their bond, usually something like $50k worth of insurance for damage caused by improper identity verification.  blockchain tech doesn't have this.",1498867705

The wireless home phone and internet and hotspot devices can both be added, IIRC.  Obviously, the 22GB-until-deprioritization limitation applies.

We set my dad up with the rural 250GB plan on a ZTE Wireless Home Phone &amp; Internet unit they offered in some markets back in February.  I never bothered to investigate changing that into one of the unlimited plans that came out a month later as he uses about 1/10-1/4 of that in any given month, but I seem to recall some people moving those over with their new unlimited plans.",1498867706

Neural population rhythms‚Äîor oscillations‚Äîare cyclical fluctuations of baseline neuronal activity that can be observed in neocortical and thalamic regions of the brain. Thalamocortical oscillations exhibit peaks in specific frequency bands, called delta (1‚Äì4 Hz), theta (4‚Äì8Hz), beta (13‚Äì30 Hz), and gamma (30‚Äì70 Hz) (Buzs√°ki, 2006). The frequency range of the musical beat corresponds nicely with the delta band, while faster metrical frequencies fall within the theta band,and slower metrical frequencies occupy the sub-delta range. Musical rhythms entrain these rhythms. Also, fluctuations in the power of beta and gamma oscillations time lock to acoustic rhythms.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Domestic appliances fail all the time all around the world. Sometimes they catch fire as a result.

There is on average at least one appliance related fire a day in London alone according to the London Fire Brigade. That covers fridges/freezers, washing machines &amp; dryers, ovens, microwaves, and all sorts of other things like that.

Sometimes it's due to poor quality cheaper brands with inherent faults in particular models that are only subject to a manufacturer recall if enough incidents mean it draws too much attention; sometimes it's due to misuse or poor maintenance by the owner; sometimes it's due to a power surge causing an overload.

In the case of the fridge/freezer at Grenfell, it's suspected that a power surge caused a preexisting fault in the appliance to fail and it caught fire. We'll have to wait for the fire investigation report to say exactly how it actually caught fire.

However we do know that the residents of the tower had previously complained to KCTMO that the building was having occasional power problems like surges &amp; brownouts, and they had said that it was likely to cause a fire if it wasn't resolved. They were basically ignored.

The fridge fire was actually extinguished by the LFB but they were unaware that the fire had managed to spread to the exterior cladding of the building, maybe because it was smouldering beneath the visible outer layer with no visible signs of damage. Apparently it wasn't until the LFB were leaving the building that the cladding outside that flat then ignited fully and rapidly engulfed the exterior.",1498867707

Great question! You are referring to the well-respected scientific theory that synchrony of neuronal oscillations is responsible for our unified experience of consciousness. The idea behind that theory is that neurons communicate only when they are synchronized, so this phenomena literally allows different parts of the brain to communicate with one another (or not) depending on what you are doing at the time.

I believe this is related to neural entrainment to musical and speech rhythms in the following way. Imagine there are two brains instead of one. How would they communicate? By synchronizing oscillations. But how would they do that? With sound. So I believe musical communication and speech communication are essentially ways of synchronizing multiple brains so we can communicate.

There is plenty of evidence that people who merely synchronize body movements 1) like each other more and 2) are more likely to cooperate with one another. There is also direct evidence of inter-brain synchronization between musician using electroencephalograph (EEG).

That question is both easy and impossible answer. The most recent research out of the Zatorre lab at Montreal Neurological Institute indicates that intense pleasure in response to music can lead to dopamine release in the striatal system. 

The more difficult question is why does this happen. There are many theories about this. One is that music engages our expectations. The idea here is that the brain's job is to predict the future, and the better our predictions the more the brain rewards us. But the questions here are significant: Why does music that we know by heart still give us chills? How exactly does the process work. This is a fundamental question in the neuroscience of music field, and we will working on this for years to come!

What are we talking about then? You said ""It's just a matter of faith as to whether or not you believe there was a creator."" I then stated ""faith is an excuse people give when people have no good reason to believe in something."" If you want to explain to someone why you believe something, faith is not a sufficient answer to justify said belief. You can use it as your reasoning, but it isn't a reliable means of finding the truth or convincing me or someone else that your argument holds any merit. If you're not doing anything I listed in my previous comment then great, we got nothing more to talk about. 

&gt;I don't care what you believe.

I don't care what you believe either but you made a comment and I am responding to it. 

&gt;No I don't. You either have the faith or you don't.

Again, if you want to attempt to convince another person to believe what you believe, or if you are attempting to justify *why* you believe what you believe, faith isn't a good reason. If you aren't doing either of that, and content with living your life using blind faith, more power to you. Just again, don't push it on my children. 

&gt;Yep.

So you agree that faith means ""I really really really really really believe."" If so, why do you think this is a good reason to come to a conclusion about the origins of our universe? 

&gt;Your angry at religion/different churches. There's nothing inherently bad or incendiary about living as a Christian.

I agree, but the problem isn't being a christian or not. It's people refraining from using critical thinking skills in an area that is so vast we can barely even begin to imagine it while subsequently using their religion to justify committing atrocities in the name of god. People believing things on faith opens the door for people to begin believing things that have negative consequences. This doesn't mean the specific individual will produce said negative consequences, but it fosters a mindset of belief without justification. And that's dangerous. 

&gt;I don't care what you believe. I don't care what your children believe. So long as neither of you are posing a threat to me, I will do unto you as I would have done to me.

The problem is your religion poses a threat to me. Enacting laws that negatively affect people who do not follow your religion is damaging and disgraceful. You believing in your religion doesn't hurt me, but when you vote in an evangelical that cuts off an atheists right to hold public office. (South Carolina, numerous other states) or deny abortions, restrict gay marriage, that's where we have a problem. It infringes on peoples rights and I will not tolerate that. ",1498867713

What are the effects, if any, of listening to the same songs over and over again versus listening to new music for somebody with depression (or anyone, really)? Perhaps this is too specific a question, but one of the ways I manage my depressive symptoms is by engaging myself in music that I have never heard before as a way to help my brain not get so entrenched in its own patterns. When I hear a song I've been listening to for years, it does not have the same effect as the first time I've listened to it, even if I still enjoy the song. I've recently been exploring genres that I used to have no interest in as a way to teach myself to be open to new ideas, new patterns, new melodies, and thus helps open myself up to new experiences in general which is something difficult to accomplish with depression.

I'm firmly on your side on this one. But many of my colleagues believe it is ALL learned and cultural.

I think that once you understand the predictions of neural dynamics, you see that there are fundamental neural processes -- like the way nonlinear oscillations respond to rhythms --  that do an astonishingly good job of predicting human neural and perceptual responses. And if you check out the visualizations on our YouTube page, you can literally see for yourself how well our neural networks ""get"" the rhythm. For example, check out the response to this sax solo by Alex Blade Silver of the Civilians. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcU_2hv_wok
It starts out responding on 1 and 3 , but when Alex emphasizes a faster metrical level, it goes to the faster level (every quarter note). And when his rhythm slows, the LEDs get that too. It does all this without any learning.

But ... I wouldn't try to argue that learning isn't important. It is! There is a critical contribution of the musical culture and  style learning. In fact, our theory includes a learning component, and our research now focuses heavily on learning.

These ideas apply not only to rhythm, but also to pitch consonance/dissonance and tonality, as I mentioned in an answer above. Check out our publications page top read about it: http://musicdynamicslab.uconn.edu/publications/

"thelastguardian","t5_2slha","Yeah, that's another scene I checked out. There are two significant pieces of dialogue there. The old woman/Nanny says something that sounds like ""ee-anyu kume"" as she mournfully watches Trico fly away. It's not given any subtitles. The old man says what sounds like ""Inomotu otunum isarober (isaropea, maybe?)."" This line does get the subtitles ""Be among the chosen ones."" The boy also repeats this exact line at the very start of the game. 

I'm inclined to think his name is not hidden in the ""chosen ones"" sentence, since that one is already translated for us. As for what the Nanny says, I guess it is possible that his name could be something like Anyu/Ainyu or Kume/Kome, but the fact that both Ueda and the author of the book seem to think it is entirely possible to pick out the Boy‚Äôs name, makes me think that it is more likely that his name is spoken on its own, as opposed to part of a sentence. I could be wrong here, though.

There are a few factors that make me gravitate toward the ending scene and towards ‚ÄúIchi‚Äù in particular, such as Ueda specifically calling out that ending scene as the place where his name his spoken, and the fact that the word is spoken on its own, as opposed to hidden within a sentence‚Ä¶ and to me it just rolls off the tongue in the way that a name should, though I suppose that part is entirely subjective.",1498867715

"exchristian","t5_2r95q","I've gone through the same process with my wife. We both come from devoutly religious Christian upbringings.  

The way I went about it, whether intentional or not, was to constantly ask her questions.  


-Terror Attack on the news: ""so do you really think it was part of 'Gods plan' for those innocent kids to die?""  

-On the Bible ""so if God literally made everything we can even conceive, why did he choose to leave a book written thousands of years ago as his last correspondence?""  

-Looking up at the stars at night: ""isn't it crazy that our whole planet is in a sea of uncountable number of stars, and those are just the ones we can see?""  

-Going through our miscarriages ""Do you actually think God is punishing us? 10s of thousands of healthy Kids are born into other religions every day, why would he do that?""

-Watching a documentary on other parts of the world: ""so do you think it's fair that those kids will go to hell because they don't believe in god even though the country they were born in isn't predominantly Christian?""

Whether she ever denied Christianity or not, I just wanted her to see how big and diverse the world we live in is, and hoped one day she would see that religious devotion has more to to with geography and upbringing than actual truth.  

As far as her response to your new found way of thinking, she's reacting from a place of fear, because let's face it, what other world has she known to this point in her life? She has be taught , probably since she could form sentences, that a god in the sky watches her every move and if you don't believe that you're going to burn for an eternity.  

If you truly want to be together, and think it's what is best for your kids, talk to her about WHY you think this way now, and plant that seed of doubt with the questions that you have that can't be answered with religion.  

It might not be next month or next year, but if she really is seeking the truth she will come around to your way of thinking because if her religion can't answer some of life's biggest questions what's the point in believing in it?  Best of luck OP. ",1498867715
"airsoft","t5_2qi2x","&gt; but lets be honest, I want a P90

You could go Plug and Play and take a TM high cycle, or if you know how to tech you could go the Cyma way and change a few thing to make it a bangstick feared amongst your ennemys.

I started airsoft with a Cyma P90 (the Cybergun repack, because I was a n00b and I did the stupid newby stuff) and that's litterally the one and only gun I kept my whole airsofter career. I'm pretty sure I'll still keep it as a souvenir if I have to give up airsoft someday.

The pros to this gun are:

* Compact as fuck while having a decent barrel
* Barrel and sights are part of the same bloc
* Easiest gearbox ever made to work on

The cons are:

* Bulky mags, with no hi-caps that works well
* You have your hear on the gearbox
* Ankward wrist angle

The Cyma P90 comes with awfull seal and shimming, a high torque motor, ridiculously overpowered spring, a surprisingly good 9.6v Ni-Mh battery and the best low-cap ever made. Except for the Marui ones.

You'll want to:

* Change the spring for something weaker
* Perfect the sealing (ultimate o-ring nozzle and SHS mushroom type piston head was all I needed)
* Shim the gearbox (while you're at it...)

And that's it for the necessary. Though I would recommend to do as well:

* Swap the wire for 16aug with T-deans for better RoF and trigger response.
* Put a homemade mosfet (P90 switches age bad)
* Change the barrel, bucking and hop-up bloc. And shim the barrel.

Since the barrel and sights are mounted on a solid one piece upper receiver, if your barrel and hop-up are good and shimmed properly, you'll get a stupidly accurate SMG. I had on numerous occasion got compliments on my P90 by players who didn't expect it to have as good of a range and accuracy.

If you can get used to the short length ergonomics and the bulky mags, a tweaked P90 can be used on any field.

About the mags, avoid Hi-caps, they don't really work and jam A LOT. Mid-caps are good with a 110 rounds, but the only one I was able to find was King Arms ones and their plastic is not as strong as the Cyma ones. Cyma low-caps (68rds) are my all time favourite mags, they have the sexy fake bullet inside, are dirt cheap and are really close to the quality feeling of the Marui ones.

TLDR: If you want a P90, go for it. TM for easy plug and play, Cyma if you're willing to pay less but work a bit on it.",1498867715

Great question. Your colleague may be referring to the work of Dr. Nina Kraus and her colleague Erika Skoe (now my colleague at UConn), who once recorded from human brain stem of people listening to ""smoke on the water"". When she plays the EEG, you can literally hear the song in the brainstem. I love that demo!
Yes, I definitely have an opinion. The human brainstem is synchronizing to music too, but at a much faster time scale that the cortex. The brainstem synchronizes at hundreds maybe even thousands of Hz. The cortex synchronizes in the delta-theta range (fractions of 1 Hz up to about 10 Hz), as I described above.
Brainstem synchronization is important in explaining pitch perception and consonance/dissonance in music. We have a model of brainstem synchronization too (but we aren't using it in our visualizations yet). It was published as

Lerud, K. L., Almonte, F. V., Kim, J. C. &amp; Large, E. W. (2014). Mode-locked neural oscillation predicts human auditory brainstem responses to musical intervals.

It would be interesting to try. One thing you see when you look at our LED visualization is
that for simple music, you basically just get the beat. But when you use rhythmically complex music, 
you see all the crazy rhythmic changes, and you can even witness rhythmic ambiguity ... like in
the Civilians video I posted above ... when the music transitions from 6/8 to 4/4, it takes about
2 measures for the lights to start getting 4/4, and in the mean time, they are perceiving stress in the wrong
places. So in a way, you are seeing a scientific prediction of what people will perceive when they hear
that music.

And I wouldn't mind so much if it weren't for the fact that this really should've been a game for everyone, being the whole reason for the aim controller's creation. The devs knowingly excluded a not insignificant number of gamers just for the sake of... well, of what, exactly? Would Farpoint have been that much worse if they'd used some alien quadruped or another instead of spiders? Arachnophobia is pretty damn common, just like a fear of snakes. If I was developing or publishing a VR game (a market that's already prohibitively small, commercially speaking), I sure wouldn't put lunging snakes in my game, even though I personally am not troubled by them. 

The devs, whatever. They knew what they were making. They made an artistic and capitalistic decision about which they've ostensibly no moral qualms. No, it's Sony I'm disappointed in... I look over at Oculus, and they launched their new controllers with Robo Recall, an ""everyone"" sort of game. Sony, however, seems hesitant to spend a penny on anything that isn't a horror game.

Revealed preference theory, pioneered by American economist Paul Samuelson, is a method of analyzing choices made by individuals, mostly used for comparing the influence of policies on consumer behavior. These models assume that the preferences of consumers can be revealed by their purchasing habits. Revealed preference theory came about because existing theories of consumer demand were based on a diminishing marginal rate of substitution (MRS). This diminishing MRS relied on the assumption that consumers make consumption decisions to maximize their utility.

I'm going to briefly discuss my opinion of the infrastructure of various cities I've been to with the following format:

City Name (familiarity with city): Description/impression.

I recently drove from Atlanta to Seattle as part of my move, so a lot these will have low familiarity values and may not be particularly informed.  I'll try to go higher familiarity first.

Atlanta, GA (10):  I lived in Atlanta for 7 years.  I went there for school and got my first ""real job"" there.  I am so glad that I was able to find a job outside of the perimeter only a few miles from my apartment.  Even still, my commute to work (which was like 4 miles away) took me 35 minutes in the morning and 25 in the afternoon.  I did not have to use the perimeter (I-285), but a lot of the city's traffic issues come from that road being the be all end all of car travel for the entire city.  It was a huge deal when the Braves (baseball team) moved their stadium out of downtown (where they had public transportation) to just outside the perimeter.  I moved before it opened, but I didn't get off the subreddit.  All of the issues expected happened and it's just horrible.  Public transportation in Atlanta exists, but is kind of a joke.  I couldn't get on a train from where I lived and instead had to drive to a station close to where I worked (so about 5 miles from me) and ride one in.  The city is a sprawl, basically unhindered by geography.  Based on the politics of the city (4 counties fighting for dominance in addition to the city itself) and the fact that it's so sprawling I don't know if it can or will ever get better.  If I did it again I'd get the job first and try to live close enough to walk (or just be entirely outside of the city like I was last time).  The trains are fine, the buses are considered dangerous (and also will take forever to get you anywhere useful).

Jacksonville, FL (9):  I basically grew up here.  Lived here for middle school and high school and learned to drive here.  I went to a private school downtown and lived near the beach.  Jacksonville isn't a big enough city to have the issues that Atlanta does, but that doesn't mean they don't seem to have based their infrastructure on Atlanta.  A perimeter road that is smaller than Atlanta's, what amounts to a cross of highways in/near the down town area, etc.  I think the city will have issues when it gets bigger (and it is getting bigger).  It needs a rail system desperately, but the conservative politics of the area likely won't allow it without some change.  There is (was?) a monorail that I think was supposed to be that, but it hasn't expanded... ever?  It's fine... for now.  Good luck getting to the airport, though.

Seattle, WA (8): Just moved here a few months ago.  I already love it.  There's more people here than Jacksonville and more geographic constraints than most other cities I've driven in much.  Hills everywhere, the sound and a major lake that needs crossing on a regular basis by a large number of people certainly didn't make the civic planning easy, but they knocked it out of the park.  I live on the east side of Lake Washington, but getting around on this side of the lake as well as the west side is far easier than I would have expected.  My commute across what should (and basically is) a crowded interstate bridge straight into downtown only takes me 30 or 40 minutes.  The express lane on I-90 on the Lake Washington crossing was genius.  At the end of the day, I think the traffic is helped immensely by incentives.  I'm incentivized to take public transit here.  It will be at least 2023 before the previously mentioned light rail in the middle of the interstate is finished, but if I'm living where I now (I likely won't be) and still work where I do (I probably won't) I would just park and ride the train.  The buses here aren't scary (by reputation, still haven't ridden one) and seem like they can get you where you need to go.  Walking around downtown is less of a joke than it previously was.  I actually feel like I might not need a car at all if I were to choose to live in downtown Seattle.  That would be a recipe for isolation and depression in Atlanta or Jacksonville.  The route I don't take to get to downtown is a toll route, but 520 seems like it's very similar, commute wise, to I-90.  I have found that I-405 and I-5 do seem to be where a lot of the traffic in the city is, however.  That said, the infrastructural engineering of the ramps is far superior here than it was in other places I've been.  The impact of a back up on a ramp is relatively minimal (I deal with it where I-90 meets both roads every day without much delay) and past the ramps the roads seem to mostly flow.  I'm pretty impressed overall.

Charlotte, NC (4): Alright, now my familiarity is dropping off quite a bit.  I went to Charlotte for some events once or twice a year for 2 or 3 years while living in Atlanta.  The main interstate is built in a way that allows you to mostly bypass downtown entirely, relieving a lot of the traffic issues that other cities (Seattle with I-5, Atlanta with I-75 and I-85... and I-20, Jacksonville with I-95 and I-10) have.  That's not to say that getting downtown from the interstate is difficult.  It's actually pretty easy.  I never lived there, but walking around their downtown was pretty comfortable.  Their public transit also seemed to function, though their light rail seemed under developed, even in comparison to Atlanta's subway.

Orlando, FL (3):  If you ever drive anywhere in Florida, you likely go through Orlando.  There isn't a perimeter road and the interstate goes right through downtown.  This has always caused me traffic when I've been there, even when it's not rush hour.  It's super wide, but at some point, widening a highway just doesn't do anything.  Tourists not being familiar with the city is a serious problem since they drive like idiots.  The turn pike doesn't go through downtown or too close to Disney and therefore flows much smoother.

Running out of room, lets do some cities I was recently in from my cross country drive...

Montgomery, AL (1):  That's an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back.  One highway through downtown, no alternatives so far as I could tell.  It was rough.

Memphis, TN (1):  Stayed there for the night, didn't have much trouble getting off the Interstate and into my hotel downtown.  Didn't have much trouble getting back on, either.  Design seemed deliberate and well thought out, but I wasn't driving during peak hours, so I have no idea how it handles load.

Oklahoma City, OK (1): Interstates cross near downtown, which I'm sure can cause issues.  Stayed near the airport and avoided downtown, though it was very pretty to look at on approach.  The infrastructure seemed very new, or at least well maintained.  Seemed like they were preparing for growth.  Don't know anything about local politics, so I don't know how realistic that is.

Albuquerque, NM (1): Drove through the mountains and it was very pretty.  It also seemed like it was basically the only route in from the east, which I imagine can cause traffic.  I honestly don't have much of an impression from this one.

Las Vegas, NV (1): It seems like it's entirely possible to avoid the strip if you are just passing through.  Getting into town was pretty simple.  We got there at what seemed like rush hour and it moved, which was nice.  It certainly seems like work and home are in different areas without much mixing, though, so that likely is a big source of traffic.

San Jose, CA (1):  What. A. Clusterfuck.  Getting anywhere anywhere near the bay area is a fucking disaster.  I know from a previous visit that taking the train to get places is entirely viable, but driving in was a mess.  I think it has to do with how expensive it is to actually live in the bay.  People have to commute in from outside and it causes all kinds of issues.  Not that different from Atlanta, really, in that way, except you have the confounding factors of mountains, a bay and an ocean.  It's terrible.  Oakland isn't any better.

Sacramento, CA (1):  Didn't even see the city, I just hopped on a connector and avoided it on my way north out of the bay area.  Beautiful traffic pattern.

Portland, OR (2):  Went back there after driving through the first time.  Downtown is on a loop road that splits off from the main Interstates.  I respect that, and I assume that it helps with traffic, though I haven't really been there when it's been rush hour much.  Seems well planned enough.  Big, gorgeous bridge over the river on the north side of the loop road.

Vancouver, BC (1):  I miss the interstate system.  Google maps took us on surface roads for miles before getting all the way into the city.  Very pretty city, but I wish the highways were... wider?  More American?  I can't really put my finger on what was off about them, but I felt very impeded on my way in and out.  I may have just been trying to figure out the conversion between miles and kilometers for the speed limits, though.

Yes, I do support blocking pipelines and I do oppose blocking abortion clinics. So how is that not ""disingenuous?"" Because if someone replied, ""I support blocking abortion clinics and oppose blocking pipelines,"" I would not attack them on the grounds that they were being inconsistent. I would say that pipelines are bad and the right to abortion is good. But they would be as justified in making a distinction based on the cause as I believe I am.

In any case, we make the same sort of distinction with other acts all the time, most obviously about killing other human beings, which is alternatively good or bad usually based on who is killing whom and why. Unless, of course, you're an absolute pacifist, which comes with its own unpleasant bullets to bite. Absolute pacifists cannot claim belief in a right to self defense, for example. Any other degree of pacifism leaves room for the allowance of violence based on the reasons. My position on disruptive protest is similar: Good or bad, depending almost entirely on the reasons for it.

But you're on to another claim now. First you said the right to protest ""ends when you begin stomping on the rights of other people and telling them where in public they may or may not go based on your own political opinions."" This is a different claim than the right to disruptive protest is only activated when the state blocks the right to non-disruptive protest. I happen to think this second claim of yours is better articulated. But I don't recognize the difference, and that's not me ""being disingenuous."" It's entirely consistent with my view that the motive behind the protest (largely) determines the moral permissiveness of its tactics.  Do I have my own red lines on tactics? Of course.

"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","I'm just going to copy-paste an old idea of mine for how I would handle kids in a future game which sort of concerns gameplay: 

Since the Outrealms are basically established to be a thing my idea is simple. Once you reach your first S-Rank the game would add a new option called 'Go to the Outrealms'. This would be a sidestory arc focusing exclusively on the child characters. It would start out small, only focusing on the first child you got and their parents but as you completed more S-Ranks in the main game you'd be introduced to those characters as well.

The biggest problem is that the plots would be rather similar or halfassed though I think I have a solution. Namely, give each child their own separate subplot that you can access from a menu. That does bring up the problem with children having more than one father/mother as an option but that can be fixed by limiting the amount of romantic Supports a character can have in the main game to two or three/limiting the children to two or three possible mothers/fathers.

While the subplots would have to be disconnected at first I'd find some way to make it so that as you unlock new subplots in this mode the different families would show up in the background that way these subplots wouldn't feel empty. I'm not sure how to make that work though so that'd be a job for the developers.

The second part is to add a playable epilogue. However, there are two requirements to unlocking it. The first would be the most obvious which is beating the main game. The second requirement would be to finish all the child subplots that you've unlocked. Not all in general but just the ones you have access to. With these two conditions met you would unlock one last subpot in the 'Go to the Outrealms' menu, fittingly called 'Exit the Outrealms.' This subplot would establish a reason for the children to travel from their realm in the Outrealms to the one where the main game takes place. Finishing this would open up the playable epilogue I mentioned earlier.

In this playable epilogue the parents would be fully aware that the kids they're interacting with aren't actually their children but one of many possibilities and the kids would be aware of the same. The plot of the playable epilogue would be rather simple with it being about the kids helping these alternate versions of their parents deal with the leftover members of the enemy army. Beating the epilogue would naturally end with the kids returning to the Outrealms and another set of bonus credits unique to the epilogue. I'm not sure how Supports between parents and children/the children and the main cast would work for this but Supports between child characters would work the same way as they do for the main cast: each child would be limited to two or three romantic Supports with specific characters and unlimited nonromantic Supports with all the other children.",1498867721

As I made mention, I am no boomer I'm not even 50, which puts me in GenX if that's the label I am to wear. I see the destruction of the economy, I see the fracture in our political parties. Our country is failing in so many ways. Corporate greed runs rampant. I can not disagree with you on any of this. However, I will not blame everything on one generation. The same generation that helped build this country. I still believe with the right will, sacrifice, determination that anyone can achieve success. A lot of that depends on how one defines success. I work for one of the Huge Utility companies that have been growing and spending billions on infrastructure rebuild. My first point is not invalid. These are great Union jobs in a closed shop. Great benefits and pay. For the last 100 years, if you got on with a utility or the city, these were considered great careers. This last group of new hires that make up the aforementioned generation do not have the same will and desire. It's just the way it is. Different priorities for a different age. We can not keep people employed. They quit or get fired quickly. Well within 6 months. This was unheard of even 10-15 years ago. No college, just a ged will do. 70k in 3-5 years depending on how many hours you put in. Some techs make over 100k but are never home and I would not want that life. All I am trying to say is people recognize a difference in many of today's younger adults. It is not all. I know of many great, hardworking young men and women that will continue our companies success. It's just that we now have to try out 10 before we find a keeper. I'm sorry you have worked so hard for what you feel is so little. You and your wife have made some hard choices however. Living in one city without the option of moving limits your opportunities.

I also think there's a linguistic factor you need to be aware of when trying to understand this sort of thing. I wouldn't really suspect a typical westerner to understand the difference between, say, Umbrian culture and Genovese culture anymore than I'd expect people to understand the difference between Lebanese and Palestinian culture. I understand in the cases of Arab nations they are distinct countries,  but they still are Arab countries, as such the similarities are much stronger than they would be between countries with different languages.

I wish I knew. From a neuroscientific perspective, I think that the most interesting question is why doesn't everyone have perfect pitch (we call it absolute pitch, by the way).
In your brain their are spatial maps of frequency ... the same frequency will always activate the same neurons. So ... why don't we all have absolute pitch? Instead most people have relative pitch, but as far as I am aware, no one has ever found a map pf relative pitch. That's the real mystery to me.

Anyway, some people have argued that absolute pitch is learned. It is true, for example, that tone-language speakers (for example, Mandarin) have a higher rate of absolute pitch that non tone language speakers (for example, English). We are still in the early stages of understanding the brain mechanisms behind this.

My friend Dan Levitin has shown that the average person has something like absolute pitch  and absolute rhythm as well. If you bring someone into the lab and ask them to hum their favorite song, most people get darn close in pitch and tempo.",1498867725

Hi Dr Large, 

I'm only beginning my journey in the field of sensory and evolutionary neuroscience. I just wrote my thesis about how the structure of the human visual system gives rise to certain geometric hallucinations (Kluver's form constants) which can be used as a reliable model to compare to prehistoric art (and specifically, Late Neolithic pottery).

A lot of psychedelic art contains these form constants, because they manifest themselves when taking psychedelic drugs. I have always been attracted to this kind of art all my life, and I think it has to do with the fact that I am autistic (which can create a mode of sensory processing that has overlaps with the effects of psychedelics.) Likewise, I have always been attracted to psychedelic trance (psytrance and goa trance) which has always had profound effects on me. Some psychedelic trance sounds as if it sounds both ""outside"" and ""inside"" my ears, eventually becoming one big expanse of pure euphoria in which my consciousness and body just dissolve. It is a feeling like no other and I have never seen it described it by anyone else anywhere. It doesn't just sound good or pleasant, it's a whole new scale of experience.

From an academic perspective I would like to ask: Have you ever found a definable relationship between music that induces these types of experiences and the structure of the human auditory cortex, or in the way it processes auditory information? Have you ever heard of these types of experiences before and do you have any theories as to what might cause them?

From a personal one I would like to ask if it's possible to analyse the specific music that affects me, and look for commonalities and patterns? Any lead I have on what causes this effect allows me to understand it better and find more of it.

As promised last week, this was a light week otherwise: it's my last week before the new job starts, so I took it mostly off from Demon work. I did however find some time to do some preliminary designing on what I want to tackle next, but I'm not ready to talk about those yet...

...and besides, it's still my week off, so that means no lengthy post here either. :) On that note, while I do plan to do some Demon work next week, it is the first week of a new job, so let's call it a ""we'll see"": historically I've always needed a little time to adjust to a new job before I get back in full groove on part-time Demon work.

A music therapist, Andrew Dudley, just sent a a rhythmically free piano improvisation and asked us to test synchrony with it. Look what we saw: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owqua6zryHI. The complexity of this response is just a simple approximation of what is actually happening in your brain. So no wonder you (and lots of others) report such intense experiences in response to trance music, which has such a strong beat.

My colleague and collaborator, Mike Hove, is currently involved in fMRI and EEG responses to trance music. So the answer are starting to come in. Search google scholar for Michael Hove trance music and you will be able to read about his discoveries so far.",1498867727

If your friends really did ""remember"" the events like you said they happened, but distantly, then I'd say that's good proof that this was not something purely contained in your own brain - not just a strange seizure. Of course, as someone else mentioned, they could've been messing with you (or just high... had they been smoking already? Sure the weed wasn't laced?). But if that's not the case, then that part of the story is what makes it so tantalizing and what should give you some relief that you're not ""crazy"" (whatever that means).

What this reminds me most closely of is accounts of religious mystical experience. Mystics in Buddhism, Christianity, etc., etc., all report a feeling of ""nothingness"" at the highest stage of their ecstasy, as if their selves were dissolved in an all-embracing void. Typically this is not considered an unpleasant experience, but it's also true that most mystics have built-in ways of interpreting their experience (through the lens of their religious traditions) and undergo long periods of preparation, which may make it less uncomfortable. It's possible that, for whatever reason, you spontaneously went into a very deep 'mystical' trance, and without any former experience it was deeply frightening. It's not unprecedented.

That's one explanation at any rate. It is, however hard to square this with your friends' reactions. It's possible that something truly super- or paranormal happened. If that's the case, try to count yourself lucky that you are among the few who has ""pierced the veil"" so to speak!

M/F do not indicate hormones, internal organs, secondary sex characteristics or chromosomes. If their outward genitals are important to an emergencey, I am sure EMT will not hesitate to look for themselves to help them out. If it's not an emergency, then I am sure the patient/patient parents will be more than willing to share confidentially with their doctor and other medical personnel the status of genitalia so the right treatment can be administered.

We have entire medical files for things that are medically nessicary. Things that never make it onto ID cards. I have asthma. It's far more medically relevant than my genitals but I don't see asthma on my ID. But it sure as heck is in my confidential files. Just like someones genital status should be.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt;If it's OK for the company to make you work over 40h/week without paying overtime

If you work more than 40 hours per week without pay, that's on you not them.  Legally speaking it isn't ok except in very special circumstances that your average employee isn't familiar with unless they have family/friends in the know.  My people do occasionally go over 40 hours and if it's their fault for instance (because they weren't actually doing their job during the time they should have) I sort of look the other way.   I don't reprimand but I also don't reward for the task being done late (the schedule was created by them and all they had to do was explain why they couldn't meet it most of the time).  Now if *I* force them to stay late because I need it done faster then I absolutely pay them overtime.  You work somewhere shitty, do an anonymous reporting of unpaid hours, although most programmers are paid well in excess of the federal minimum wage for programmers of $27.63 so you are being paid you just don't realize it was part of the negotiations at hire.

&gt;it's also OK for the employee to work less as long as you get your assigned work done and they're happy with your performance.

I don't have a problem with this.  I have a problem with an employee saying they were busting their ass for 40 hours and can't fit any other tasks in only to then find out they do all their work in 2 hours and the other 38 doing nothing of value to me.  To put it in context you're bitching about someone working 50 hours a week with 10 of them unpaid (25% free overtime), I'm bitching about someone taking advantage of their employer by 2000%.

&gt;The deal for salaried employees is ""get the assigned job done"". 

Yes, but if you lie about how much time it takes you to get done that means I need to hire another person instead of just assigning you.  You're basically saying it's ok to lie to people so long as you benefit.

You've got a limited number of spoons, and I think you're running out of spoons before the end of the day. Can you tweak your current regimen to allow you more spoons? Maybe instead of an hour at the gym, you decide you can take a half-hour walk, or do fifteen minutes of yoga or stretching? Are there healthy meals that you can do that don't take a lot of time to make?

You're in triage mode right now. It's okay. You won't always be here. But if you can find a way to save a couple of spoons for yourself every day, you might find the transition period goes a little easier.

We have published a lot about it, and there is a simple version of the code on GitHub that is freely available to the public https://github.com/MusicDynamicsLab/GrFNNRhythm. The program that we actually use to visualize music is a more complicated than the free version, but the basic idea is the same. One thing that I would point out is
that the important and unique aspect of the system is a network of neural oscillators. The algorithm numerically integrates this dynamical system. So in an important sense the lights are not controlled by an algorithm (i.e. by fixed rules). They are controlled baby the dynamics of this network. The reason to emphasize this point is that the LEDs may do something different every time they hear a song. It depends, for example, on what song they heard last.

Between this and your other comment about your dad's ""advice"", I hope he's not a criminal defence lawyer. You need the advice and probably the representation of a Virginia lawyer. 

That said, I have no idea what the police officer was thinking charging you with reckless driving when he had no evidence of your speed or manner of driving; as the Virginia Supreme Court observed (rather obviously) in [*Powers v Commonwealth*](http://law.justia.com/cases/virginia/supreme-court/1970/7326-1.html):

&gt; The essence of the offense of reckless driving lies not in the act of operating a vehicle, but in the manner and circumstances of its operation...The mere happening of an accident does not give rise to an inference of reckless driving.  

I don't know the courtroom procedure of whatever Virginia court you'll be appearing in; my only suggestion would be to tell the judge/magistrate that you need time to hire a lawyer (and come prepared with dates on which you would be available to appear). ",1498867744

I guess the part that's missing is that you wouldn't be hiding how you originally found the evidence this way as you pretty much have to admit it wasn't obtained in a way that would make it admissible but the exception allows it in because it would have been discovered no matter what. 

Now I will admit before this article I had never heard of this term, but the first thing I thought of was this exception when I heard it. I also rarely deal with evidence in my practice area since almost everything that would be used as evidence is under the business records exception if it was needed (it's not, trial almost never happens).

The pharmacist is there to tell the patient about the addictive-ness and harmfulness of such medications, but it's ultimately up to the person to seek out help if they find themselves addicted.  If they can seek out an illegal means of obtaining the drug, they can seek out help to get over the addiction.

Both measured two days after an injection (the high point): 848 last week, and 1200-something this week.  Units in the standard pg/ml.  I'm surprised.  And T levels have been near zero.

I guess it just builds up over time.

I'm going to lower the E dose to 5 mg every week and see how it is in a few weeks.  Levels that high concern me.  While the E levels are high like this, it might be advisable to balance out with progesterone - but that's just conjecture from somebody who wouldn't know.  I guess we should just be glad that the HRT works!  Still surprised at the high levels, though.",1498867748

"kaptainkristian","t5_3ejwo","Great questions! I'd like to put my 2 cents in, but I should say first that I don't have any experience with writing a script for a video essay or making videos. I'm just a fan. And I'll answer your questions in regards to my experience enjoying KK's work.

1) What makes a video essay work content-wise?

A narrow, thoroughly researched topic. I'll use my favorite KK video, ""South Park - Language and Censorship"" as an example. KK could have rambled about South Park's history; listed the top 10 most controversial, grotesque, offensive, etc.; or thrown some randomly researched facts at us. Instead, he narrowed the topic of ""South Park"" down to what he believes is their most significant contribution, pushing the lines of censorship. Everything in that video is about that specific topic, and he doesn't pander to the audience by saying ""Hey remember this super popular episode?! We all liked that right?!"" 

2) What make KK influential?

He speaks directly to his target audience. I'm a 25 year old man, I still play Pokemon, and I wish I could articulate to older people why Pokemon means so much to me. I grew up on it, I have friendships grounded in it, and it reminds me of some of the best times of my life. KK's video on Pokemon was spoken directly to me. He says ""we"" and ""us"". I know almost everything there is to know about Pokemon, so I didn't learn a lot from the video, but he was able to articulate my feelings in a way I was never able to (Another great example of this is video essay writer, SuperEyepatchWolf. His video on ""Why You Should Watch/Read One Piece"" hit the nail on the head). KK knows his audience and he doesn't speak down to them. He starts a conversation, he doesn't just present facts.

3) What distinguishes a good video essay from a bad one?

So many things. I wanted to save my thoughts on KK's editing for this question rather than #2. Editing is a huge factor. KK's videos are so much fun to watch, and I couldn't start to explain why they're so visually pleasing. That requires a lot more knowledge than I've got on the subject. One thing that stands out to me is his clear sound when he speaks. He's not a phenomenal voice-over artist, but he has some strengths that he uses to his advantage, but what stands out about his voice is whatever equipment he's using. It wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable if he sounded digitized or however you would describe it. Sorry, I don't know the terminology for audio quality. 

4) How does KK analyze his topics?

This goes back to my answer to #1. He narrows the topic down to one aspect that he can thoroughly research. Not just X-Men, but how color and costume affect comics. Not just Childish Gambino, but the art of storytelling through hip-hop. Not just Pokemon, but the community building potential of video games. Come to think of it, he could start with the cultural idea and then find the best example of it. Want to talk about how anime got popular in the US? Sure, that's an interesting topic, but who is going to click on that video? Toonami was instrumental in that, and his target audience grew up on Toonami. Let's write about Toonami's influence on the rise of anime.

You mentioned watching Suicide Squad and not catching things that some reviewers caught. This is a whole different side of entertainment imo. KK doesn't do reviews of singular works, he does in depth research on specific aspects of one or many works. To be able to catch the things that those reviewers catch in movies, you need to have a very thorough understanding of story structure, writing, filming, etc. When I watch football, I see one team pushing down the field while another tries to stop them. When a real fan of football watches football, they see the plays, the mistakes, the athleticism, the intricacies of teamwork, and many other things that fly right over my head because they have studied football for years. Weird comparison, I know. 

I could probably write more on each question, but I've rambled enough. I hope this helps at least a little! Good luck! Whenever you do make a video, be sure to let us know! I've seen a few people who were inspired by KK share their work here, and it's always nice to see.",1498867754

If a ship in E:D is measuring its speed as mach 3.6, it is measuring that ""relative"" to the (nonsensical, simulatory) absolute frame of the instance. In a space station instance, that space station is going a speed of ""0"" relative to that instance. But the space station is still clearly moving, since it has an orbit, so if a ship goes mach 3.6 in that station's instance, it is moving whatever the vector summation of that plus the station's instance is, which means it can very trivially be going faster than that station by just moving with any greater-than-zero amount of its vector in the same direction as the orbit.

This is why they're incomparable, though. If things were actually Newtonian in the E:D simulation, whatever acceleration produces the ""top speed"" of mach 3.6 in the time period it is produced in E:D would actually be quite high by modern standards. The ISS cannot produce that level of thrust, and required a very large rocket to reach its current velocity.",1498867754

Ainz is not losing his memories, at least, not any more so than what would be considered normal. You understand that it‚Äôs normal to forget things, right? People don‚Äôt have perfect memories, events that occurred in the past are slowly forgotten. It was never said that he couldn‚Äôt remember aspects of his guildmates, it was said that he was forgetting conversations that took place between him and his former guildmates, which is natural. Do you remember every conversation that took place 1-12 years ago with perfect accuracy? No, no one does. Hell, people usually forget things they said a week ago, much less years ago.

Excerpt from Yoongi's interview:
 
&gt; I have decided what kind of music I want to make. Hopeful songs like ‚ÄòTomorrow‚Äô or ‚ÄòSo Far Away‚Äô ... Many people find it weird how the least hopeful person would want to make such kind of music. (laughs) I grew up listening to Epik High. At that time, songs about dream or hope were a trend, and the reason I like Tablo-hyung was because he made that kind of music. I want to make such music too. I have an influence now, and I want to use that influence in the right direction.
 
Epik High broke through in 2005, when Yoongi was about 12 (internationally). Can you imagine growing up listening to an artist who inspires you, makes you want to grow in their footsteps? Just assuming Yoongi got into Epik High around the ages of 12-14, can you imagine step by step over 10 years, getting to the point where you get to meet one of the people who through their music influenced your career, aspirations, life decisions the most?
 
And then being familiar enough with that person that you text often? And that when you tell them about a achievement you're proud of, having them personally tell you in return, *""I am truly proud of you""*? I don't imagine I know anything about how Yoongi feels in reality. But this whole concept is incredible to me.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; These media outlets were the main ones saying blacks shouldn't own guns because of black on black violence for years

Gonna need hella source on that. 

And it doesn't at all address why they were silent on Castile. 

You'll also note Noir says NRA is ""A 2A policy based organization"" yet it was quick to make a statement after Sandy Hook to blame violent movies. 

Try again.

&gt;Federally, he signed one larger law that had a small provision allowing carry in national parks. That's it. Otherwise, he attempted to ban the most common .223 ammunition, he needlessly made it harder for trusts to buy things, and other actions.

Your source is...what? 

The .223 ammo ban is false propaganda:

http://www.snopes.com/politics/guns/ammoban.asp

""Harder for trusts to buy things"" is on par with ""and other actions"" for ""I don't actually know what I'm talking about but I'm sure it's happening."" 

&gt;Thus what sounds reasonable on the surface was actually a backdoor way to limit gun sales.

A way to limit gun sales is...the ATF not giving licenses to people who sell only at gun shows? Again, you're making nonsensical allegations without a whiff of evidence. 

&gt;He also he attempted to get an ""assault weapon"" ban passed, but couldn't due to opposition from groups like the NRA. Don't give him credit for a failure. Where gun rights expanded was in many states, in opposition to his positions.

When? Where? Because nothing I find shows he tried to ban assault weapons. 

http://www.snopes.com/president-obama-assault-weapon-ban/

A fake news article claimed an executive order on internet security was a ban on assault weapons, and in 2016 Obama ""encouraged"" congress to do something to prevent terrorists from getting their hands on assault weapons, but never said to ban them. 

&gt;The NRA is a single-issue organization.

That blamed movies for causing Sandy Hook but stayed silent on Castile. 

Look bud, I can tell you're a hardcore gun advocate who believes whatever you see passed around on social media. So this conversation is going to go nowhere, because you refuse to acknowledge basic facts. We can't get anywhere when I'm living in reality and you're living in a scary utopia where anti-gun liberals are hiding under your bed.

I understand pasteurization and sterilization are a huge part of it but it seems like a happy medium was reached, somewhere back in our evolution where we gained the evolutionary hand on viruses/disease.

Which ones, like tuberculosis, has the potential to mutate and replicate into different branches. At what point do the viruses turn the table back? Constant contact exists between places that were once isolated, heterogenity on a mass scale. But also an introduction to foreign diseases, like ebola.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So surprised to see this comment on Reddit of all places. Everyone doesn't have to go to the lengths of literally standing on the ""other side of the line"" but it wouldn't hurt to look at the opposite side and just hear the rationalization of why they feel the way they do.

Problem is you have people so far to the left and right they sounds just as bizarro and nuts as each other. But the truth and the solution always lies somewhere in the middle. 

Like, immigration. No, all immigrants aren't illegal and commiting crimes and need to be banned. But neither is a solution of just welcoming in everyone regardless of ANY sort of policy a feasible solution. There has to be SOME policy regarding immigration for ANY country... but if you could actually rationally weight up the pro's and con's instead of people thinking everything is literally just 2 completely opposing viewpoints, it might ease the pain.

Healthcare? Democrates bring in Obamacare. Republicans get in power, want to tear it appart. What do you think will happen when Democrats get back in power? Yup, we go right back in the other direction. Surely there is a middle ground that's at least workable so the policy can continue and evolve and just getting better through each administration. But nope... all they want is to do the opposite of what the other guys are doing. It doesn't solve anything.

As a side, Joe Rogan had a podcast recently with the grand daughter of the guy who founded the Westborough Baptist Church. It was really humbling. She's left it now, but she did explain really rationally, why at the time, as a kid, she *thought* what she was doing was good and right. It wasn't... but when you actually listen to the other side, you can at least think ""Oh yeah, I don't agree... but I can understand why this person living under these circumstances thinks as they do"".",1498867766

"nba","t5_2qo4s","&gt; Despite not playing, he's still hanging around the team, attending games, practices and community events. Yet while it's good to see Ezeli doing what he can to be part of the team, sometimes his efforts are getting on his teammates' nerves.
At least that was the case of C.J. McCollum after a close 88-86 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on Dec. 7.

&gt; Drawing upon his championship experience with the Warriors, Ezeli talked to the team after a loss to the Bucks a few days before. But against Memphis, when Ezeli tried to inspire his teammates, McCollum wasn't having it.

&gt; From ESPN's Chris Haynes:
After suffering a challenging, 115-107 loss to Milwaukee, Ezeli, in street clothes, addressed the team in the locker room with a stern speech centered on playing with urgency, sources told ESPN. Then two games later, after a crushing defeat in Memphis, Ezeli once again started giving a team speech, but he was cut short.
&gt; McCollum interrupted Ezeli in midsentence and told him that was enough, sources told ESPN. Portland was in the midst of an emotionally draining December, losing 11 of 13 games. Players were desperately pouring out every ounce of effort trying to change the trajectory of the season, and being lectured by someone who wasn't even playing wasn't received favorably.

"PS3","t5_2qhhw","I'd say super slim. These systems are getting older, so a sliding disc tray gives you one less part to worry about breaking involving the disc drive. They also come with far more memory on average which is useful for digital games often going on sale for very cheap. I don't find it any louder than any other ps3, although it was marketed as being slightly quieter. Which I will say it never got as loud as my slim would 

I will say there is a point of contention on the disc tray where mine can be a little annoying and close like 98% of the way but discs will still run and its still not enough space for air to even get through. Its obviously not as convenient as a disc drive, but its more reliable. And the ""grill"" look is a matter of preference- I at least prefer the shape to the rounded slim.

Two months isn't really a lot of time to fully experience everything for RoI anyways, unless you throw some serious time into it to catch up on levels and grind for loot drops that you might only get a couple of uses out of before D2 drops.",1498867769

I'm gonna assume you're a sedentary, deconditionned as fuck, mid-thirty dude who have no prior experience with exercice. I'm not judging, it's just best to assume the worst. Also, this Assomption is based on the fact that you suffer from no desease, desability and are generaly in good Health.

First thing I want to ask is how you started smoking weed? Did you smoke high amount daily from the very first time? Probably not, and it's exactly the same w/ exercise. You won't be doing high volume and/or high intensity from the beginning. So don't try to replace it with the same quantity.

Now, I would recommend starting with cardiovascular exercices. Much more beneficial on short term notice imo. I would start running 3 Times a week, with at least a day in between every sessions. If 10 to 15 minutes is what you can Do for now, than Do just that. Try this for a few Weeks, and make sure you write your distances, your time and notes if you feel like it (something like ""it was hard as fuck"" or ""it's starting to feel easier""). That will condition your body before we can move on to harder exercices. I could go on but I'm lazy as fuck and have no attention span whatsoever, but feel free to PM me.",1498867771

"TeamSolomid","t5_2t8co","NA is the only region that is near perma banning LeBlanc still. Everyone did it when the Gunblade build was brought out, but people have since learned how to beat it. It was highly contested at MSI but went just 5-12 in games where it got picked (TSM won against it). Since then other regions only ban it situationally, while NA teams (including TSM) still treat it like it's the best champion in the game.

The ban strategy around it just makes no sense. For every other power pick in league history, the red side is always forced to ban it because otherwise the blue side first picks it. Right now that's Zac, but TSM bans LeBlanc even on blue side (note: it's warranted against Jensen, but TSM bans it against everyone).

If LeBlanc was so strong, why wouldn't TSM just leave it up and first pick it on blue side? If it can't be picked blind because of counters, why doesn't TSM leave it up and pick those counters if the other team selects it?",1498867771

And honestly I think it was very shortly after that that I just..I dunno, started feeling very lonely when I'd dive into toku. Everything else I get into has some sort of social component, but talking about KR to people who aren't well versed on Japan-centric entertainment (which is pretty much all my good friends) can be a little mystifying for them. 

I actually recently marathoned Stranger Things because it was a show that literally every one of my good friends enjoyed. Just to have something to talk about with them. And I guess I was late to the party because nobody's talking about it much lately lol

"POTUSWatch","t5_3jgtl","&gt; When you have a heart attack, are you going to take the time to examine prices and decide to go to a lower cost hospital?

It's called ""planning for the future"". We do it with everything else. For instance, I keep a reserve of cash in my bank account just in case I lose my job so I can buy food. Or if someone in my family gets sick, just to cover the deductible. (Insurance is worthless nowadays.)

&gt; When there is only one company that produces a life saving drug, are you going to let people die because they can't afford it?

If they can't afford it, they can't afford it. If no one can step forward to pay for it, then it can't be made and produced. Let's say a drug required a rare isotope that is only found on the moon. Would you be willing to spend umpteen trillion dollars to mine the moon to get the drug? No, you aren't. Everything has a price attached, and that helps us decide between options. And there is never, ever a case in medicine where there is only one option, unless government made it so.

Medical care is just like every other economic good or service. There is a supply, there is demand, and there are a billion other competing factors.

If we really cared about people's health, why don't we just enslave 75% of the populations, force them to become doctors and nurses and staff hospitals 24/7, and then take the rest and force them to spend the rest of their lives developing new treatments? The answer is simple: Because we have other priorities too, and forcing people to do things is wrong. If people CHOOSE to participate in the medical care industry, either as a consumer or producer, that is their choice and theirs alone.",1498867773

For example; in the anime ""Black Butler"" the title character, a demon working as a butler as part a deal with the main character, has a catchphrase which in Japanese translates to ""I am simply a butler"" the pun is, if pronounced slightly different, it sounds like ""I am a demon butler."" This obviously doesn't work in English, so in the English Dub, he instead says ""I am simply one HELL of a butler."" 

So maybe you can do something like that. ",1498867778

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","There really aren't very many bad motorcycle brands in the US, IMO.  Ducatis sometimes have the reputation of being head and shoulders more powerful than other brands (the ""Ferrari of the motorcycle world"" mystique) but they're approximately the same as similar offerings from other brands.  The design is appealing to some and if you like a lot of midrange torque, they're for you.  They've worked out their maintenance issues so that they've been approximately as reliable as everything else.  They aren't a whole lot more expensive either and they're usually equipped with better components (suspension, etc) than the entry level bikes from other brands.

I've had 5 bikes, 2 of them Ducatis.  All of these have had upwards of 20k miles on them.  I haven't had a whole ton of maintenance problems on the Ducs but I've had enough shit happen that I can rank them.  We can just ignore the model years for now.  

Reliability from best to worst has been:  Ducati, Kawasaki, Ducati, BMW, Aprilia. (The aprilia I had had a reputation for being super reliable...)

Fun factor is:  Ducati, Ducati, Aprilia, Kawasaki, BMW

Point is: buy smart, take care of the bike and you can be happy with pretty much anything.  Don't spare any fucks for what motovlogger cares what brand people think is overrated.  ",1498867778

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My mother had an affair, my dad found out and allowed it to continue for a year or two while I was in HS.

I found out because my parents asked me to transfer some old photos from one computer to another (I know, right?). I got to work on this arduous task while they were both going out for their weekly trip to the ice cream shop. A trip which I was never invited to for some reason, and always seemed to take an inordinately long time; considering that a Dairy Queen was right down the road. Regardless, with USB in hand I began transferring the photos when I noticed a word doc titled ""journal"". Being a nosey teenager, I of course opened it only to find 40 some odd pages written by my dad detailing his feelings about their marital strife. It was pretty intense. I stopped reading rather quickly - mostly because it was chock full of stuff I really did not want to read. They returned home and we continued life as normal. It's been at least a decade since then and they are still happily married (at least from the looks of it) and have no idea that I know. 

In hindsight I'm also 99% sure those ""ice cream"" trips were for marital counseling. Which is probably for the best- I had gone a full year thinking that they just didn't want to bring me back a cone, which honestly would have been more damaging to my
Psyche than me just knowing that they were working on their relationship, so I'm thankful for that at least. ",1498867780

You understand that an integrated mill is a BOF, right? And I already stated that BOFs are going away in the form of mini mills or ""specialty mills"" which use an EAF right? Do you understand what an EAF is or what it does? Because it sounds like you are trying to teach me the difference between an integrated mill and a specialty mill when you appear to have no clue.

Directly from wikipedia, which I'm assuming you sourced those numbers: ""There were about 112 minimills or specialty mills in the US, which in 2013 produced 59% of US total steel production. The specialty mills use iron and steel scrap, rather than iron ore, as feedstock, and ****melt the scrap in electric furnaces****.""

That means there are 112 facilities that melt and produce their own finished products without importing any slabs (because they make their own). The fact that you didn't know that those 112 facilities melt their own steel and cast their own slabs speaks volumes. I have personally been to more than 9 EAF facilities that produce their own slabs from melted scrap and DRI.

To address your other criticism, I'm not confusing anything about iron ore. The corporation I work for literally owns multiple DRI facilities and I helped start one of them up. I can assure you I understand the difference in DRI and melting steel. If you would point out what I said that obviously confused you about refining ore vs melting DRI for steel, I will be glad to correct your confusion. The only thing I can see is that I shouldn't have said ""refine"" iron ore into steel, but that's why I went straight into explaining DRI facilities. I had no clue that integrated mills made up the entire breadth of your knowledge on steel production, so semantics on iron ore, DRI, refining, etc didn't seem to be that important.
Also, no one melts slabs man. Slabs were imported back in the day to be rolled. The mill I worked at in 2008 used to not have an EAF and caster and would import slabs in to roll them into plate. They built their own when EAF technology took off.

Maybe you should go understand the differences in integrated vs mini mills. Nothing you have said makes me believe you have any experience at all in the steel industry other than purchasing steel products and speccing grades. I would really like to hear how you reconcile not knowing that those 112 facilities make their own slabs but attack my background. Just so we are clear, those 112 facilities have EAFs (like my map showed) and an EAF makes liquid steel. That liquid steel must then be cast into a slab in order to make finished product. Only a pure rolling facility would import already made slabs in order to roll into a finished product (I counted 7 on the map).",1498867781

1)The place didn't have heat, so we would turn on the oven for warmth when it got really cold. 

2) It was a second floor apartment with a back door that opened to the yard, but it was missing stairs so it just opened to air. 

3) The floors were so slanted, you could see it and feel it. I had to position my bed in a particular corner of the room so I wouldn't roll off the bed at night. 

4) The cockroach infestation was disgusting. We didn't know how bad it was until it rained really hard one night and cockroaches were pouring out of a hole in my closet. One night, my cat caught one and brought it to me while I was sleeping, just plopped it still alive onto my pillow. It was horrifying.

 - Astro-Tech AT72ED (at f/4.8, 344mm FL) on a CG5-ASGT Mount, guided with a 50mm Orion guidescope and a ZWO ASI120MC

 - Canon Rebel 450D with Intervalometer


**Capture Details:**

 - Lights: 300"" x 44 at ISO , total 3h 40m of integration

 - Darks: 36, Bias: 120


**Processing Details:**

 - Starfield: All Lights stacked with standard settings for the star field and processed in a typical manner. I subtracted a blurred and starless copy to remove the leftover comet ""smudge"" ([Tutorial - see pg 7/8](http://www.astrophoton.com/tips/comet_images.pdf), then ran GradientXTerminator a few times to even out anything I missed. After that was some touches with Curves to bring out the stars

 - Comet Isolation: To remove the trailed stars, Lights were split into groups of 3 sequentially (ie 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 placed into A, B, C, A, B, D) and each group was stacked separately. The 3 resulting stacks were manually aligned in Photoshop and combined with Median stacking.

 - Comet Processing: Ran GXT twice, then made all Curves adjustments identical to those made to the star field. I then opened the reference image, aligned it to the starfield, and then copied the comet over and aligned it to the reference image with ""Lighten"" layering. The reference image was removed, leaving the comet in an accurate position. From there I made some saturation increases and a little DeNoising, but the image was very clean already.

 - Tutorials found [here](https://www.astrobin.com/151422/) &amp; [here](https://www.astrobin.com/288768/?nc=all)

**Observations for the Night:**

 - Location: May 28, 2017 in Wichita KS, Bortle 4

 - Conditions: Clear and still. Temperature remained about 9C for most of the night. Humidity was fairly low, so no dew problems.

 - I am happy with how this turned out. Often in this hobby I will blindly run for the data in the hopes that I know how to process it at some point in the future, and comet processing being unique as it is, was especially true in this case. I have only been partaking in this hobby for 18 months, and only 12 of that was I capable of DSO capture, so I always skipped over comets. I considered them not unique enough to win over the grand galaxies and nebula which rose in the sky every New Moon. Johnson caught my eye after 3 months of useless weather conditions, being right overhead, within days of opposition (just outside of Mars' orbit). The more I looked into it the more fascinating it seemed - Johnson does not seem to originate from our solar system, and with an eccentricity of &gt;1 it is in the process of flinging itself out of the solar system as we speak, likely never to return. 50 years from now no one will be taking new pictures of it, which I think makes it special enough to image",1498867784
"CODZombies","t5_2sal9","The best strategy for xp is no doubt the ascension spawn room strategy with the rk5 or sheiva with DEAD WIRE. This is not the fastest but dead wire gives more xp than the thundergun or other wonder weapons. Check Frenzy's channel for a more in depth guide.

The FASTEST strategies:
1. Revelations camping with the worm gun (lol) in the verruckt section of the map next to the electric trap and the box.

2. Moon tunnel 11 strategy with the wave gun. The wave gun doesnt allow any drops so when you are out of ammo, throw a gersh device and hack the drop to get a max ammo. He one downside of this strat is the setup and having to hear the annoucer's voice for the excavator which will ruin your run.

3. Verruckt kitchen strat with the wonder waffe. Use a crate power to pap. 50-60 this strat becomes unuseable because of ammo.

4. Kino alley strat with widows wine and thundergun. This strat is extremely safe and pretty fast. Widows wine is KEY to this strat. If you run out of widows on high round then train on stage. The fire trap room is technically faster but very risky and makes training on stage impossible because you have to open the stage door.

5. Shadows of Evil 5and5 strat. I don't know much about this one but there are plenty of guides on YouTube.

6. Shangri la strat right outside the left spawn door when facing quick revive. This strat involves luck of the pap stone placement and can be difficult to setup. Still very fast. Check Frenzy's YouTube channel for a more in depth guide.

This is just my list from my experiences on high rounds. Let me know if I missed any or if you disagree. Hope it helps! :)

"Naruto","t5_2quts","&gt;obito suddenly has a change of heart and wants to help its sakura's fault for not destroying it on time

It is her fault because she had ample time to process what Obito was asking her to do and actually go through with it. Sure, he had a change of heart but like you said he started the war in the first place so she had no reason to hesitate. You can argue it was done for plot related reasons to keep the War arc going but Neji's death had a similar scenario earlier on to pair up NaruHina and at least provided reasonable in-universe context for his sacrifice: he was a mentor protecting his student (Hinata).

&gt;Her involvement is rare in cases where naruto is not involved

Considering he's the main character and the most important in the cast, that's not really a negative on its own.

&gt;her development didn't go anywhere

That's actually not true. Unlike the other female characters, Hinata's a significantly different character by the end of the series than she was when first introduced. She doesn't back down to confrontation, doesn't stutter anymore (if not after she confesses to Naruto, definitely after she starts dating him), and overall expresses much more confidence. She has evolved as a character over the course of the series and for the better: did you imagine [she'd somehow manage to be scary as a grown-up](http://i.imgur.com/fAPjCp0.png) back in Part 1?

&gt;Besides from helping naruto transform in pain's fight, with naruto tranforming and meeting his dad etc she never did anything helpful or good, just went around saying ""na-naruto-kun"" 

Did you forget how she fought off Toneri and actually landed a victory by retreat (before he got Tenseigan but after the first ambush), destroyed the Tenseigan Weapon to stop the moon from falling (with Naruto's help but he was just a rocket booster for her attack), and directly saved Naruto's life when his chakra was being drained in The Last?",1498867786

Goku &amp; Beerus energy clash was about to wipe out the universe

and in episode 13 Beerus nullified the energy

Yet in episode 14 Goku powers up even ore and Beerus says this

then too top it off Goku destroys Beerus sphere of destruction which was the strongest energy attack since it was the combination of Goku's KHH and Beerus own attack which was already confirmed to be universal and he nullifies it in one punch.

"financialindependence","t5_2t34z","Wedding photog here - My thought on the entire wedding industry is that it's all kind of a big scam. The industry has successfully been selling people on shit they don't really need for a number of years now and it's kind of gross how ridiculous weddings have gotten. 

Consider just this point In the not to distant past, Wedding photographers would shoot 3 or 4 weddings a weekend. Primarily because all they'd do is show up, snap some pics at the ceremony, do some photos of the family and then maybe a few posed bridal shots. Often times they'd hand over the rolls of film, get a check and be on their way to the next one. 

Now you'd be hard pressed to find a wedding photog to work for 2 hours on a saturday in the summer - because odds are they'll book someone for a full day package. Do you REALLY need a picture of your dress hanging up in a place you'll never actually see it hanging? Do you really need that shot of the hair stylist spraying hair spray that's all cool and back-lit? Do you really need an artistic shot of your rings? 

Don't get me wrong, I love weddings and I think they're great fun. As a photographer I love to make those images. I know the reality of the situation is though, that they're only really going to cherish a handful of those images, and almost all of them will be captured in a 2 or 3 hour timespan, yet almost all couples I work for will pay me to hang out for 10+ hours.

 You think she can't help but abuse you because she's mentally ill. She could have sought help, gone to therapy. pwBPD often wear masks. They can control their mental illness in public then let it loose in private. My mom used to tell me she was a bad mom so I'd reassure her she wasn't. That tells me that she knew what she was doing was wrong. **They can help it.**

She drives people away because she's abusive. Just because no one else is willing to be her punching bag doesn't mean you have to be. If she's alone, that's on her--not you. Right now you are carrying her loneliness, you need to give it make to her. It's the only way to heal and move forward.

I believe my mom loves me too. But it's an unhealthy love. Have you ever wondered why fairy tales revolve around true love, instead of just love? It's because there are all different kinds of love, and many of them are twisted and unhealthy. Men who beat their wives can still loves their wives. And the wives stay because they still love the men who beat them. But that's not true love. Parents who abuse their kids may still love them, but it's not true love. You deserve true love and she will never be able to give that to you. That hurts but it can also be freeing.

You keep using her BPD to excuse her behavior/abuse. If she was an alcoholic, drove drunk, and killed someone, would you blame that on her disease or would you want her to take responsibility?

You're sacrificing yourself--your sanity, your happiness, your life--for your mom. Parents are supposed to sacrifice for their children, not the other way around.

The guilt is a bitch. I honestly thought my guilt would break me when I went NC. But owning the word abuse helped so much. It was hard because my mom's biggest crime against me was parentification. I wasn't hit. I wasn't neglected. It didn't feel right at first using the word *abuse*. But claiming that word, it really helped with the guilt. It's been oddly empowering. It also helped to visualize giving my mom back her pain--her loneliness, her victimhood, her fear, her anger, her misery. Coming here to this forum and being validated has been a god sent. I agree with GilmoreGirl28, find your anger, your outrageous at what was done to you. Anger can give you strength.

All you have to tell your mom is that you need space to work through some things, that it's about you not her. Or you don't have to tell her anything. I highly recommend blocking her phone number and any social media if you do decide to go NC. pwBPD are resourceful. Even if she's elderly, she will find a way to carry on without you. They always do. Mine did. 

I'll say it one last time: It's okay to cut her off. ",1498867789

I just don't get it. I mean I can understand hating on Scott Buck , in all honestly, I just can't understand what you meant by saying that AoS puts more effort into ""being comic book accurate...."" or if you meant their Inhumans are better or what. I can think of like 18 Inhumans, that have been shown on AoS, and only 4 (if you count Hive's ""true form"") that had any extended outward deformity (and honestly, this is the truth here. Sure in Seasons 2 &amp; 3 they started to show some really weird Inhumans- which only amounted to Raina, Gordon, Hive's ""true form"", and Lash. Overall, the majority of the  Inhumans on AoS are just regular people with powers. They don't have any outward deformities (which in the comics states that the worse the deformity the greater in power and Inhuman typically is) that I can say that this two-minute trailer did worse in. I mean we only saw like two or three deformed guys, but that is like over half of the known deformed Inhumans on AoS, and also Lockjaw. Plus, it seems a bit dishonest to say that within those two minutes that you somehow right away now know that they won't be any outwardly Inhumans or not.

&gt; **Section 8 of the NVRA requires that States keep and make available for public inspection, for a period of at least two years, all records concerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters**, except to the extent that such records relate to a declination to register to vote or to the identity of a voter registration agency through which any particular voter is registered. **The records to be kept shall include lists of the names and addresses of all persons to whom confirmation notices are sent, and information concerning whether or not each such person has responded to the notice, as of the date that inspection of the records is made.**

&gt; **In addition, an independent requirement in 42 U.S.C. 1974 mandates that all records and papers relating to any application, registration, or other act requisite to voting in any election for federal office, be preserved for a period of twenty-two months from that federal election.** Since voter registration is unitary and permanent, this obligation is ongoing, such that registration records must be preserved as long as the voter registration to which they pertain is considered an ‚Äúactive‚Äù one under local law and practice, and those records cannot be disposed of until the expiration of twenty-two months following the date on which the registration ceased to be ‚Äúactive.‚Äù Hence, States should maintain all written records related to applications to register to vote as well as declinations to register to vote. **The Department of Justice can require that such records be produced for inspection and copying through a written demand, and a lawsuit to enforce such demand.**

 This reads as though the DOJ is within their legislated authority to request basically any voter registration materials. Perhaps that rules out the voting history element but voter rolls would certainly be covered.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; Churches, atheists, republicans, democrats, independents, pretty much all kinds of people do.

That says nothing about the about of charity each of these groups provide. According to politifact the Catholic church alone provides 17-34% of all charity in the US - http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/19/frank-keating/does-catholic-church-provide-half-social-services-/

That figure doesn't count businesses that are run charitably by the church. eg low cost schools, aged care, etc.

&gt; Though the pre-marriage education I received from the church was a god damned joke at best and disgusting at worst.

Here are the facts: the divorce rate in the US is 48%. Pre-marriage education drops that to 11%.  Part of that is encouraging people to ask questions of each other before entering a relationship.  For example, in a mixed religion couple, are the kids going to be raised Catholic or Sikh? It is better to have that argument before marriage.

There are a few reasons that you may have found the education useless:

A) it was (just as likely as anything else)

B) You expected it to be (you seem to have a problem with Christianity

b) You didn't have issues, and therefore the course didn't really apply to you.

While they're all equally likely, I'm going with B simply because it seems to reflect this conversation more and that is the extent of my sample.

I was in the middle of moving from Florida to California for family reasons, then suddenly my family wants to move back to Florida after I quit my wonderful job, turned in my moving letter to the landlord, and told everyone I was leaving. I cried for two days and it felt impossible, but I did it anyways and I love living where I am, found a new job I'll be starting soon, and am slowly meeting new friends. If it doesn't feel like it's impossible, it's not worth doing. *If it doesn't feel like it's impossible, it's not worth doing.* I keep telling myself that and it really helps me take leaps into new things.

He knows the police department can be corrupt but most times the best punishment is through the legal system, sure you can punch a guy a few times but what is that going to do? A beating isn't a punishment to someone like the Joker. Punishments definitely vary and that's up to you. Generally you and your GM should work together to set what your own laws are and stick to them.


  

If you're somewhere where there is no legal system available then yeah it'd be entirely up to the paladin's choice of punishment.

You should not make walls of text because it can get you banned anywhere unless it is a place that encourages walls of text. I highly doubt any place does support something so irritating and annoying, but anything can exist, but not really because unless you are in heaven then that can happen. But no one actually knows that was just a hypothesis, a lame one that is. Actually not really lame. You can create a wall of text supporting site, but you would be hated if you do that, so do not. But you can if you like, but I discourage that. Meow on to the actual information of walls of texts. The wall of text was invented when the Internet was invented, but actually it was slow at that time. So whenever it became fast. But there would need to be some free or not free community for people, and that community would be able to have walls of text. But that community probably wouldn't have actually invented the wall of text. So basically, no one except God and Al Gore knows when or where or how the wall of text existed/was invented. Noobs probably invented, but probably not. Who knows. Walls of texts are usually filled with a lot of useless information and junk. Information and junk can be the same, but only if the information is junk or the junk is information. But who cares. The information/junk inside a wall of text are usually related to wherever the wall of text is located, but the best walls of text, which are actually the most irritating, most eye-bleeding ones, are completely random. Walls of text usually make the reader asplode or have their eyes bleed and fall out of their sockets. A number of people can stand it, but not read them. Actually some people can stand and read them. Those people do not have short attention spans. These are boring and patient people who have no life or have all the time in their hands, which are the same, but not really. The punishment of what making walls of text varies of the strictness of the community. But it doesn't really matter. Nobody cares. Walls of texts should be free of links, different font colors, strange characters, which are those other symbols used in society, and capital letters because it ruins the whole purpose of the infamy of walls of texts. It makes them look fucking dumb and weird. Walls of texts are obviously free of huge spaces and outstanding things like capital letters. Of course, paragraphs should never be in a wall of text. Walls of text are known to create nausea, confusion, head explosion, and others. The others being something I can not think of either because I am lazy or if I do not feel like it or I can not actually think of anything. Like what the fuck? That was a rhetorical question right there. What the fuck? You are actually not requesting a satisfactory answer, you just say that because you try to be funny or you feel like it or if you are pissed off. You must get a proper bitch-slapping to stop making walls of text, but if you are weird then that doesn't apply to you. Walls of text are defeated by deleting them or splitting them into paragraphs. Or some other things that would work but will take hours to think of. People are considered a nuisance if they create walls of text. This might be the end. If you hope this is the end, I am not sure. But if I was not sure then I wouldn't be talking. I should know. Or should I? The best way to make a better and good wall of text is to copy and paste what you previously typed or write. Hey, that reminds me. Walls of text aren't always on the internet! They could be anywhere that is able to produce symbols. D'oh. A wall of text is something that is frowned upon in most, actually virtually all Internet societies, including forums, chat boards, and Uncyclopedia.

Walls of texts should be free of links, different font colors, strange characters, which are those other symbols used in society, and capital letters because it ruins the whole purpose of the infamy of walls of texts. It makes them look fucking dumb and weird and dumb. Walls of texts are obviously free of huge spaces and outstanding things like capital letters. Of course, paragraphs should never be in a wall of text. Walls of text are known to create nausea, confusion, head explosion, and others. The others being something I can not think of either because I am lazy or if I do not feel like it or I can not actually think of anything. Like what the fuck? That was a rhetorical question right there. What the fuck? You are actually not requesting a satisfactory answer, you just say that because you try to be funny or you feel like it or if you are pissed off. Meow I just copied and pasted part of this huge wall of text, which is actually not. Wait what? Nice right? Ba boom a rhetorical question right there. Is this the end for the sanity of your eyes? What the fuck did you actually read up to here? Or did you skip to near the end and read this? Either way, you fail in life. Just kidding. Or was I? Oh well. Congratulations, or not, actually not. Get a life right meow. I found a cheap life on eBay, but cheap lives are rare. Well, good luck in finding one. Not! Okay go kill yourself, but I wasn't meaning that. So go sit in the corner in your house. I do not care which, just stay there and rot. If you are not in a place with a corner, then lucky you. Find one if you can. There is no other option because I said so. Meow if you pity yourself for reading this like most do, then do something productive and useful to the environment. My goodness. OK this is me here. I am starting a new section of this article. I didn't read anything in this article above here, but nevermind, because I have something important to say, and you really have to read this. So just skip everything above and just come to this part and start reading and agreeing. The wall of text was invented by engineers using typewriters. Everything was in typewriter font (because it was made on typewriters - remember when I explained that in the previous sentence?) and the point was to use all of the paper, because paper was very expensive back then, it had just been invented I think. So anyway, the point was, no margins at the top or bottom or sides. If you left a quarter inch on the sides of the paper, that was very bad. And the guiding principle was ""This was hard to write, so it should be hard to read"". Because they were software engineers, not writing engineers. Is there even such a thing a writing engineers? Probably. But anyway, please go back to the top of this article and read it over again. You'll get the point after you read it for approx. 10 to 15 times. OK have you done that meow? Good. Meow let's be honest - you're not reading down this far. Are you? Nobody would read down this far, unless they were a crazy person. Are you a crazy person? You might be. Meow I'm afraid - it's just me alone with a crazy person. No one else has read down this far, just you, so it's just the two of us alone together here. Are you going to do something crazy? Maybe you will. Please don't hurt me. If you promise not to hurt me, I'll give a coupon good for a free Grand Slam Breakfast at Denny's. OK? Meow just do this one thing for me, read the article over again, just one more time, and if you really truly don't agree with everything in it, then fine, I'll retire from my job with the railroad and we'll call the whole thing off and just go dancing, just the two of use, me (the writer) and you (a completely random crazy person who has actually read down this far), and boy won't we turn heads when we show up at Rockefeller Center with the entire Donner Party in tow!

I feel like the reason why he treated me like that afterwards was because I slept with him so soon, and I feel like no guy will ever actually love me because I'm not the kind of girl that guys fall in love with, I'm just the kind of girl that they sleep with and leave.

I refused to sleep with the guy I'm dating now until we had been hanging out for a couple months, and I still get massively self-conscious that he only wants me for sex, even though he hasn't left. I feel like I'm damaged goods and like I'm only good for one thing in the eyes of most guys and it makes me want to stop wanting it. I actually started crying afterwards the last time that I slept with my boyfriend because I felt so guilty.

Heavy Great Club, blessed caestus, and heavy longsword.

Summary - there's episode selection in the pop-up menus for all 5 seasons; all but the first season start with a specific screen, which is just the pop-up menu over increasingly-fancy video clips.

Disc 3, Season 1: Launches right into the first episode - in this case it's the cold open of the butterfly murder guy (The Dreamscape) and I thought it was an ad for some other show. Episodes menu available in the pop-up bit.

Disc 2, Season 2: Launches to a screen with ""Play All/Languages/Episodes/Features"". The Episode menu from there is very boring, but it's available right away. It's basically just the pop-up menu over a static image, but it still works fine.

Disc 2, Season 3: Menu takes a while to load, but it's animated now! Otherwise it's the same as Season 2, just fancier - the episode list is there, and it shows you which ones are on which discs for the season. It asked me if I wanted to resume where I left off, but I restrained myself and kept checking.

Disc 3, Season 4: Identical to Season 3, but with a different background animation.

Disc 3, Season 5: Same again, but the background clip has a bit more effort put into it.",1498867807

There are two related but distinct phases. You have a mind AND a brain.

First, there is a ""fight or flight"" response which everybody experiences at some time. You have have this for a few months and can recover.

In the longer term, excess neurotoxins cause damage to the brain This may cause permanent damage long after the stressors are gone. [Chronic anxiety can damage the brain](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/01/160121121818.htm) [Here's a picture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC60045/figure/F1/) of some of the processes.

- chronic stress releases [brain-derived neurotrophic factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor#Depression) (BDNF), which is a toxin that causes brain impairment

- a part of the brain called the hippocampus actually shrinks. This has been measured in animals at about 20% shrinkage with long term stress.

We (as a society) need to actually teach and listen to kids, they rely on us to help them, they can't do it on their own. 

And it would change people's thoughts on things like this, less people would be excused for dangerous behaviour and less people would feel like they had to excuse it. Its fucked up.

As for the new engine, do you know if it runs now?

With a water line that low it prob didnt get into the crank case but depending on the location of the air intake it could have hydrolocked the engine or cracked a piston.

Before you do anything with it, check the air filter box  for water signs and then pull the spark plugs and rotate the engine 360¬∞ using hand tools only. Dont use the starter yet. If it turns over easy with no rusty water or antifreez coming from the spark plug ports its prob ok. After finding that it will turn over easy you can use the starter and do a compression test on each cylinder.

Another thing youll run into is that these engines will prob have a few transmission specific differences that will also need to be swaped out. Clutch and flywheel, throttle body and a few others.",1498867812

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","&gt; The only thing in the game that wields a 500lb sword is Susano, and that sword is far bigger than 6ft long.
Actual two-handed swords are closer to 5 to 8 pounds.

Whew, it's almost like very few Greatswords in the game come anywhere close *""actual""* two-handed swords.

Such wonderfully small and light swords such as [this](http://img2.finalfantasyxiv.com/accimg2/01/4c/014c78534f942c4d21cf783711b538b324e88c47.jpg), or [this](http://img2.finalfantasyxiv.com/accimg2/0a/98/0a98c9baa7ff3048c3977315c300a60c6ee21a65.jpg), or [this](http://68.media.tumblr.com/60f2e21425fa237a815c12b4a7f35fde/tumblr_o35rsg0oxf1sgrnkgo3_1280.jpg). The list goes on and on and on. **None** of those swords would weigh anything less than 200lbs, and that's being modest. Given the length, width, and thickness of the blades. They're akin to Guts' Dragonslayer sword from Berserk, which when actually mathed out would weigh over 600 lbs. Even replica Buster swords, made with lightweight aluminum, weigh 70-100lbs and they're far thinner than any of those swords I posted.

&gt;Kenjutsu doesn't rely on defensive techniques. Iaijutsu, especially. I mean you're looking at a style that starts with a drawn blade at the hip--you aren't parrying with a weapon at your hip in its scabbard ffs.

There are plenty of defensive techniques in all kinds of Kenjutsu such as Kendo, and even Iaido. A huge number of draws in iaido are to block. For someone who brings up the ochs stance you sure don't have a clue what you're talking about.

&gt; Notice the lack of protective crossguard

What the hell do you think a [tsuba](http://japaneseswordindex.com/tsuba/tsuba18.jpg) is?! It's even the SAM's job symbol for crying out loud.

&gt;I mean ffs, you want to be realistic here? Fine. But please avoid the made up bullshit here like swords that weigh half a ton and samurai parrying arts. 

I'm not arguing realism in the slightest you bean, *Yoshida* was, which makes zero sense when we have all other kinds of fantasy shit. Even his ""realism"" that a katana can't block (and yours saying it can't parry either) is factually untrue on top of that. 

And as explained, the majority of greatswords in FFXIV would *absolutely* weigh upwards of 500lbs. 

&gt;I know, in one or two games, Samurai had the blade grab ability you could get. But those weren't parrys--those were evasions.

That's because parrying has never been a thing in traditional FF games for one. They've also had plenty of history of attacks and abilities that require them to be struck first. ",1498867815

""Atheistic"" was poor word choice as a summary of the period, but  the Roman aristocracy was cynical and materialistic in a way that the Greeks and Egyptians were not, and of course the Epicureans, while not popular, were foundational to the premises of modern atheism. 

I'll check out Skinner's work. I'm well versed in the Egyptian and Greek myths, but not so tight on the real history there. I'm definitely curious to know more about the origins of Hermetic Philosophy. 

Yoga will get a mention in the New Age section (with an emphasis on its origins and practice in Eastern philosophy, as opposed to how it's generally perceived / portrayed in Western media, as a suburban mom hobby).

I think a big help is people writing in prompts, if someone doesn't have some writing in a prompt it's a huge red flag for me, similarly if they use pictures instead of language to describe themselves.  I wish more people were willing to admit they didn't know what they were doing and to ask people to play with them in a no-stress way.  

It feels bad to put effort into a reply and get nothing back.  I think if a person is restrained and gagged irl the reality is a dom does a lot to keep them in power.  Subs have the power, really, always able to safeword, with the d type stopping regularly to check things are safe.  In writing these things get lost.  But a good sub in writing, and dom, will try to bring up in their internal thoughts and room description/response description what they want ""the belt stung and she wondered if the whip would as well,"" same with any writing.

Took him to the vet and found out he had heart worms, of course. After treatment I noticed him limping on one of his back legs, took him for x-rays and found that he had a broken pelvis and dislocated hip--he had probably been hit by a car and we weren't told. $600 surgery later, our ""free dog"" is bionic.",1498867818

EDIT: I found these

 

    Pizzagate has absolutely proven

&gt; Me: Bit to strong a term there buddy. I don't believe that many coincidences can just be accidental but ""Absolutely proven"" is going over board. I definately believe alot of them are pedo's but a shill will jump down your throat over a comment like that and it hurts the conspiracy
 
[‚Äì]Billsucksass 2 points 1 day ago 

&gt; Basically alot of pedo related shit has been traced back to a pizza place called comet's. They have bands playing there who use child pornography based images in their music - some vids you can find on YT, They have paintings of child abuse, they use codes (Like pizza and other symbols) That are in the F.B.I's record of pedophile symbolism used by pedophiles, Email leaks that link back to a pedophile network etc...

&gt; This is some basic stuff, you can find an archived post somewhere if you search for pizzagate. Had alot of information on it.

--------------
&gt; Why because I can support my argument. I don't claim to have proof that pizzagate is a undebatable theory, but I know enough to explain why pizza has significance in the theory.
