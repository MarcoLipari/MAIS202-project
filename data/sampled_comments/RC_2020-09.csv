Am I the asshole for hating my sister and wishing her death? I (18M) have grown up with amused parents since I was 9 years old, my sister (23F) had many problems with social services and with my mother when she was young (14-15-16-17), my sister ran away from home, physically fought with my mother, drugged and dated assholes. Over the years she apparently matured, the problem is that she is still stupid in terms of personal relationships and she continues to treat me badly, she has been dating a boy for almost 5 years, they have fought very regularly since forever and the guy is not A very good example, he has never been violent with me and I don't know if he would have been violent with my sister, which doesn't matter to me either, the fact is that this guy is or was related to illegal activities, he doesn't have any studies or work. They currently live with me at my mother's house (my mother does not live with us, she lives with her boyfriend who is a great guy). My sister has always treated me badly with insults, belittling me and being condescending to me. She and her boyfriend had a fight today and theoretically they had left him, (but the uncle came to sleep at my house today too) so my mother told me that tomorrow we would put a camera in the hallway of the house in case he tried to enter to know it and call the police, this annoys me because the camera is controlled simply from the mobile and I do not think it is very useful. I am thinking of buying a lock for my room since I do not trust my sister or her boyfriend, (although he has never treated me badly and treats me better than my sister in most occasions, I always feel sorry for him and I hope that I left it with my sister) but I am afraid that my mother does not want me to put the lock on my room. By the way, my sister has cheated on this guy many times, I know because I have met a couple of his flirts. I sincerely hate my sister and it only causes me apathy. And I am also afraid that if one day she breaks up with this guy, she will have a relationship with someone worse. If you want more info I will update

&gt;Miyanaga Saki is a first year high school girl whose family would get angry if she won the family mahjong games. But losing would also have its consequences. Because of this she develops a new way of playing that allows her to stay on the thin line between winning and losing, the plus/minus zero score, an almost impossible score. In a game that relies mainly on luck, the plus/minus zero score is harder than winning, but Saki can achieve this every time.Having always hated the game, her friend from middle school, Suga Kyotoro, forces her to play in the schools mahjong club. Her developed skill and superhuman luck has made her a worthy mahjong opponent, even to the middle school's national mahjong champion.

Loved LOTR and read books as a kid before even films came out (sadly I'm nearly 40!) and loved the films too (but not the hobbit films. waste of space they are). Anyway, tried reading Silmarillion when I finished LOTR but could not get my head around it, wondered what it was all about. Later, got back into Tolkien in a big way and was actually teaching it a bit for my work and decided to give Silmarillion another spin. I read it twice back to back. It just makes LOTR seem common, the rest of Tolkiens mythology was Legendary (he called it his legendarium). Like Sauron just being a servant, that's no joke. Morgoth was utterly evil and messed everything up, but he was literally a god (Vallar) whereas Sauron is only a demi-god (Mair, like Balrogs and Gandalf).

The hospital was updated. There's a state police barracks located in town. The local high school lost its accreditation a few years ago, but I believe it got it back.  
Also, my cousin has to drive his trash and recycling to the city dump...there's no garbage trucks, which I find odd.

Personally, I couldn't live out there. I couldn't find a job with my background, it's too rural, and just out there. The residents of Athol can tell I'm not from around there.",1598918403

All I know *for certain* is that I will not do it and it's an absolutely terrible idea, and no one else should either.

"Fios","t5_2syiv","Verizon charges top of the line prices for mediocre products. The products work fine for 90% of the customers. But for half the price you can get something brand new and twice as nice...better range more bandwidth better security more personalization options a better app more connectivity better network integration and better reliability. The downside of course is Verizon will be limited in tech support because they won't touch your service if the router isn't theirs. If they can ping your ont and it seems fine to them then the service issue is on you to figure it out on your own. 

This is all moot if you have tv service as mentioned in other replies. With a somewhat confusing and expensive exception that limits your choices you are required to use the Verizon router. The best option in that case is to daisy chain the Verizon router to another $50 router. Put the tv on the Verizon router and everything else on the other one. This will actually give you better service and reliability. 

If you decide to by a cable modem you will be wasting your money...it will have the same effect as trying to plug an ethernet cable into an hdmi port and wondering why you aren't getting picture or sound.

Also don't buy used unless you can verify it isn't a rental. And preferably see that it works first. There are sketchy people who sell broken shit.

If you have tv and internet is to bite the bullet buy the g3100 new and buy an additional router of your own and daisy chain them. In 2 years time you will have saved more than the cost of both combined in the lack of rental fees...it's approximately 300 per year just to rent.",1598918406

In general I agree that RPGs (both WRPG and JRPG) are primarily focused on power fantasy, so the characters outside of the party tend to be oriented in that way.

I guess in general I just feel there is more ""fawning"" over one character in JRPGs than in WRPGs.  But it may be the games that I've previously played.  It's not really present in every game either.

Don't get me wrong, I prefer JRPGs to WRPGs for the most part.  I prefer a more linear story, I typically enjoy the world settings more, and I find them more humorous (usually in a 4th-wall breaking way when characters mutter their reactions to themselves).

"Reincarnation","t5_2u9b9","My belief is that suicide is understandable if you have a terminal illness and you're ready to go because staying alive for a longer period of time isn't in anyone's best interest. In some cases the suicide of a celebrity raises awareness of an issue or disease that needs more media attention. I'm thinking of Robin Williams here.

It's also understandable if you simply can't take it anymore in this life and you can't see a way to turn it around despite trying repeatedly. The BIG problem with this is that you could be wasting learning opportunities that you took great pains and much planning to set up for yourself, for your soul's growth. This means you'll have to come back and learn those lessons in your next life - you don't escape. You will literally be kicking yourself in the afterlife for not finding a better way of coping with life's trials and disappointments. There are also a finite number of incarnation spots available at any one ""time"" so you've basically thrown away a chance that some other soul would have liked to have.

I don't think there's anyone sitting in judgment of you.  In fact, it is you would be berating yourself for not sticking it out as planned and vowing not to do that next time. Nobody will be angry with you.

Some suicides ARE planned in order to help others learn lessons, and that is all agreed upon before birth in the pre-planning stages with the input of the soul group and spirit guides. 

We all plan our lives with free will in mind, building in several exit points along the way that we can take if we feel the need and/or we feel that we've done what we came here to accomplish. If you have not yet accomplished what you set out to do, the goal is to NOT take those exit points and to stick it out to the end for ""full learning credit,"" for lack of a better term. However, some souls are too tortured to stay so they leave at one of the prearranged exit points. This exit could be suicide, accident, illness, whatever.

To sum it up: Unless it was planned before you were born, suicide is a cop out. You knew ahead of time what you were getting yourself into, and in fact you set it up this way deliberately, so you really should see it through to the end if possible.

This is all of course my opinion.",1598918407

"nutrition","t5_2qoox","Hi /u/Bhazen21, **please ensure you READ THIS BEFORE reposting or sending an appeal to avoid a potential ban.**  

Thank you for wanting to participate in /r/nutrition but your submission has been removed due to a probable violation of sub rule 2 - *Personalized Nutrition inquiries may not be submitted as posts and should instead be asked in the comments section of* ***[the /r/Nutrition weekly Personal Nutrition Discussion Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/sticky?num=2)***  

Why the rule: Individualized nutrition posts do not generate fruitful discussion for the whole subreddit, they often lead to off topic discussion, and subscriber feedback has been overwhelmingly opposed to it taking over the front page. The forest gets lost for the trees.

## You've missed our many attempts to get your attention to the rule;

* the welcome message for new subscribers to the subreddit

* the notice at the top of the subreddit above the post listing (on old reddit)

* the rules in [the sidebar](/r/nutrition/about/sidebar)

* [the rules post at the top of the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/sticky?num=1)

* [the subreddit rules page](www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/rules)

* [the /r/Nutrition weekly Personal Nutrition Discussion Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/sticky?num=2) found 2nd from the top of the subreddit

* the notices on the posting page

## Where to ask your question instead 

ALL inquiries which involve any personal situations / context or request a diet evaluation MUST instead use [**the /r/Nutrition weekly Personal Nutrition Discussion Post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/sticky?num=2) which is found 2nd from the top of the subreddit.   

## About Appeals

*IMPORTANT! -- To avoid a potential ban, read ALL of the following BEFORE requesting an appeal. -- IMPORTANT!* 

We urge you to take the rules and this notice seriously. As stated in the rules: ***Trying to end run this rule, pretending it is unclear, or making any kind of baseless, false, disingenuous, or entitlement based appeals will result in a ban.*** The moderators are not going to engage in any bad faith debate about the removal or the rule.

You cannot appeal this removal if;

* **the post includes ANY personal context** - if *anything* in it is about you or someone close to you, no appeals allowed.

* **the post includes any form of a diet / consumption evaluation request** - any form of ""here's what I (or someone I know) consume / am thinking about consuming, what do you think?"".

* **the post violates any rules** - the only exceptions are those specifically provided for in the rules.

We do not grant exceptions for reasons which are not provided for within the rules.

For those very very rare few cases with valid appeals - *If this does not contain any personal context*, is not related to a personal situation or an evaluation request, only then can you send a [**message the moderators**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fnutrition) with a kindly worded appeal **which must include the link to this post attempt** for consideration. 

*IMPORTANT! -- Please be sure you have read ALL the above thoroughly BEFORE you request an appeal -- IMPORTANT!*

## TLDR

DO NOT request an appeal if your post contains **any** personal context. It will not be granted.  

DO NOT request an appeal if your post contains **any** personal context. It will not be granted.  

DO NOT request an appeal if your post contains **any** personal context. It will not be granted.

"psychotherapy","t5_2sodo","I certainly think that graduate programs are the catalyst for burnout. Many programs (especially Masters) are not fully funded, leaving students to take on enormous amounts of loans. Then they must take a full course load, hold a job to feed themselves/pay rent, complete internships/practicums, have a social life (hopefully). Overworking oneself is often unavoidable in graduate school due to the variety of hats students have to wear. Of course, I am sure every program emphasizes self-care but that won't take away their stressors of paying their bills and completing assignments. 

Then finally they graduate! Yay! Now is the exhausting job hunt, where good-paying jobs are scarce for new counselors. So they take a job in a CMH where they are given more clients then they can handle and most will be challenging cases. It is overwhelming, to say the least. Not to mention the low pay makes one resentful, they have a master's degree which they are now in debt for and start at $50k (maybe). 

Two years grinding nonstop in graduate school then another two years in a CMH or similar will leave anyone burnt out.  I really feel for new counselors, the cost of living only increases while wages continuously decrease.

"TheSilphRoad","t5_3c2d7","It's not one of the most common complaints I see. I see most people understanding that Mega evolutions are temporary, they always have been in Pokemon and I see most people understanding that from the outset, but complaining about the resources required vs the limited use cases.

I got the numbers from imagining a day's worth of playing (assume somebody evolves at 8am - 8pm, let's forget about anybody who evolves later in the day and sleeps with their pokemon mega evolved).

30 minutes of actual use would be, VERY roughly speaking, twenty 1.5-minute uses, just to break it up. I suppose somebody COULD raid 20x in one day, or more, using their mega each time. But even then, they are using other pokemon in that battle, so really they are using the Mega-evolved pokemon LESS than this. Nowhere close to 30 minutes of mega usage raiding all day long.

If people are using it for Go Battle league, the max they can do per day is 30 battles. Do you think their mega pokemon is alive and in-use for an entire minute in each of those battles? No way. 

A person who does all 30 GBL matches and raids 20x all in one day would be hard pressed to be using their mega-evolved pokemon for 30 minutes during all of that. Maybe the can, but not much more. Certainly not an hour of the 12.

Feel free to correct my math but I don't think you'll be able to correct the larger point, which is that most of the time the mega pokemon isn't being used, it just sits in your phone as a Mega doing nothing.",1598918409

"survivinginfidelity","t5_2x8ez","It just sounds like you never properly processed everything.  Either individually or together.  You hysterically bonded with him when you didn‚Äôt know he cheated and recovered the relationship to a point to where you were happy until you finally discovered the infidelity but felt too invested to break up at that time.  I think seeking a professional will first help you recognize whether it‚Äôs a relationship worth saving. There‚Äôs too much here to resolve in a reddit response.  You need to process all of these emotions you are feeling and properly address them to decide whether to commit or cut bait.  And then, if it‚Äôs commit, bring him into the equation so y‚Äôall can process it together.

It‚Äôs okay to admit to yourself that you can‚Äôt get over it and it may be time to move on, if that‚Äôs the case.  Neither of you deserve to be stuck in this limbo state.  

It‚Äôs also ok to stay with him too.  But realize this.  If you don‚Äôt work to overcome these feelings, eventually the relationship will be ruined.

"androiddev","t5_2r26y","No, what Evan told you is that the `class DetailsViewModel: ViewModel()` is MVVM's viewmodel **if and only if you say it is.**

ViewModel in MVVM is a *concept.* AndroidX `ViewModel` class provides a convenient container which survives configuration changes. Therefore it naturally lends itself to being the primary choice when implementing the *ViewModel concept* in a MVVM application.

But AndroidX `ViewModel` class can just as well serve as Presenter in MVP. It's only a matter of how you handle view state updates.

* Does your AndroidX `ViewModel` expose streams of view states, which are observed by the View? Then your AndroidX `ViewModel` is *conceptually* a MVVM ViewModel.
* Does your AndroidX `ViewModel` expose something like `fun attachView` and `fun detachView`, and it directly calls methods on the attached view? Then your AndroidX `ViewModel` is *conceptually* a MVP Presenter.

Therefore you can see how the name ""ViewModel"" chosen by the AndroidX team for that retained container is considered a poor naming choice.

The fact that this Reddit post exists is a testament to how poor the name `ViewModel` in AndroidX is. Of course I don't blame you in any way for being confused about this!",1598918410

Its not hard to read between the lines of how a customer was acting towards your staff it just takes experience, i always ask my CSA afterwards their side and reassure they did the correct thing. 

If your ever in a situation where your CSA is causing problems or is telling them incorrect information i do my best to distance them from the customer by either asking to cashier on another till or a task away from the register all together.

Dont keep stuff because its valuable, keep it if you want it.

he would never be like Hannibal cuz his pathology is unique. 

IMO: he tries to lead a normal veiled life, because of his empathy disorder. if he is surrounded by normality he would project normality
 (like he did until he met Hannibal)

he rejects every fiber of himself when he goes thru his changes because, unlike Hannibal, he has morality. he understands the concepts of whats good and evil and that there's no evil in the civilize definition of normality.

so, he is mouring the world he would need to leave behind. which is everything that he knows,
its a bit like he is the prisioner in Plato's ""Allegory of the cave""",1598918412

The passion. The rage. The friendship. The loyalty. The betrayal. Together, they will brace themselves for the brutal transition to manhood... and one will not survive. With all the dramatic brilliance he brought to The Great Santini, Pat Conroy sweeps you into the turbulent world of these four friends -- and draws you deep into the heart of his rebellious hero, Will McLean, an outsider forging his personal code of honor, who falls in love with a whimsical beauty... and who undergoes a transition more remarkable then he ever imagined possible.",1598918412

Definitely visit Dragon Papa for a cool Chinese treat and kind people. Definitely recommend lands end, the mosaic stairway, the golden gate of course, pier 49, the ferry building, the full house area. Best vegan tacos at chisme cantina if you‚Äôre into that (I think they have meat tacos too but don‚Äôt remember), BEST breakfast at sweet maple.

While we should celebrate his live and the impact he made. There is alot to begained by recasting the role and have T'Challa live on. There are children being born right now that can grow up with the next T'Challa being their hero. There are fans of him right now, that could get another role model taking on the mantel that they would be just as enamoured with. There are alot of great black actors out there that could be used to recast the role and take the mantel for another decade. Why would we deprive those kids of that?

If the person playing Santa dies we don't cancel Christmas, we find a new one. Children won't mind, fans won't mind. The best thing to do is recast and keep Black Panther going. Shuri taking over probably was always in the books for Marvel.

I'd also heartily recommend the Inclusive Bible. Most translations run on a spectrum of 'word-for-word' to 'thought-for-thought.' the NRSV leans towards the word-for-word approach. The Inclusive Bible falls a little outside this spectrum. While still being a fairly literal translation, the translators have made some changes in the wording in various places to make the language more inclusive. The NRSV has made some of these changes too, to words like pronouns to reflect the gender neutral intentions of the writers that don't quite come through in literal English because of differences in how grammar works. However, the Inclusive Bible takes this a step further and makes more activist changes to the English translation to reflect the translators perception of God as inclusive. Definitely a good reading Bible, even if it's not great for study.",1598918414

Try resubmitting your post with the fire emoji at the start your title.

I don‚Äôt think he consciously wanted to be a white man (dude is literally one of the biggest black icons ever) but I feel like a lot of his make up, hair and surgery choices pointed to insecurities about his black features.

You beat the opponents you have in front of you, and that's how you win. Flat-out. It's simple. If you can't do that, how can you say you'd be a champion? You'd be the champion of a theorycraft Finals, but there's a reason why you actually play the games. 

Every one of your arguments is pretty much a defense of a hypothetical than a reality. It's also again, a defense of wanting to rank ""every team in Worlds"" instead of a ""find the best team."" None of those teams you're arguing for beat who they were supposed to in front of them. SKT, if they were the better team, would have and should have beat G2. RNG if they were the better team, would have and should have qualified over G2/FNC. 

They didn't do so, hence they weren't the best team. Just look at all the other past winners you just so clearly chose to exclude like clearly dominant SKT, Samsung in their glory days. They beat whoever they faced in groups, they beat whoever they faced in their playoffs brackets, and SKT at one point rolled the entire tourney and lost a grand total of 1 game to KOO in one of their runs. That's without a doubt, the best team in the tourney.

Which means that people won't pursue or look for relationships if they are currently in one. And if they want to pursue one, then they should inform their partner about their relationship. 

Now in your CMV you give lot of example of situations where social contract was already broken by spouses being abusive, or where people have mental problems or something similar. Those are pretty extreme situations which would morally (if not legally) excuse almost every action. (Is for example murder the worst thing if you were brutally abused by your partner?).

Nevertheless you should agree that even tho it might not be the worst thing morally. There are tons of other ways on how to handle the situations better. It's the same with cheating. Even tho not the worst thing you can do to your partner. It's certainly up there.",1598918417

"RedditReads","t5_33xfn","Oakley Hall's legendary Warlock revisits and reworks the traditional conventions of the Western to present a raw, funny, hypnotic, ultimately devastating picture of American unreality. First published in the 1950s, at the height of the McCarthy era, Warlock is not only one of the most original and entertaining of modern American novels but a lasting contribution to American fiction.""Tombstone, Arizona, during the 1880's is, in ways, our national Camelot: a never-never land where American virtues are embodied in the Earps, and the opposite evils in the Clanton gang; where the confrontation at the OK Corral takes on some of the dry purity of the Arthurian joust. Oakley Hall, in his very fine novel Warlock has restored to the myth of Tombstone its full, mortal, blooded humanity. Wyatt Earp is transmogrified into a gunfighter named Blaisdell who . . . is summoned to the embattled town of Warlock by a committee of nervous citizens expressly to be a hero, but finds that he cannot, at last, live up to his image; that there is a flaw not only in him, but also, we feel, in the entire set of assumptions that have allowed the image to exist. . . . Before the agonized epic of Warlock is over with--the rebellion of the proto-Wobblies working in the mines, the struggling for political control of the area, the gunfighting, mob violence, the personal crises of those in power--the collective awareness that is Warlock must face its own inescapable Horror: that what is called society, with its law and order, is as frail, as precarious, as flesh and can be snuffed out and assimilated back into the desert as easily as a corpse can. It is the deep sensitivity to abysses that makes Warlock one of our best American novels. For we are a nation that can, many of us, toss with all aplomb our candy wrapper into the Grand Canyon itself, snap a color shot and drive away; and we need voices like Oakley Hall's to remind us how far that piece of paper, still fluttering brightly behind us, has to fall."" --Thomas Pynchon",1598918417

Biggest advice I can give is to get started crafting asap. The quests aren't hard for the most part, require very little time, maybe some gold, and unlock some of the best gear in the game now and surely more good stuff in the future.

Other than that, make sure you have a pet with damage and resist, and later a pet with damage and critical talents.

 There are videos and lots of guides on specific builds for tanking and healing, hitting, etc on YouTube. Just look it up and find something you like.

My mom and I are the ones who go out. Stepdad has only been out for doctor‚Äôs appointments and to take his dad to his own doctor‚Äôs appointments. Which is fine. My grandpa is 92 and has pretty much completely stayed inside since March. So, I am not worried about my stepdad having contact with him. Especially since the doctor my grandpa goes to gives him covid tests every 3 weeks.

We also go to the pharmacy for my mom to pick up meds. But, we go thru the drive thru. Which, has a plexiglass window with a Dropbox for the goods.

I‚Äôm quite tired of staying home. I am bored as hell. But, until this ends. I‚Äôm stuck here.",1598918419

[If you want just examples of his personal racism this has a few prominent examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/FragileWhiteRedditor/comments/ecajmz/does_this_count/fbazhe8/?context=1)

One of the most plainly damning to me has always been his insistence that a judge of latin descent wouldn't be able to fairly oversee a trial he was involved in *because* of their ethnicity.

"iastate","t5_2qtol","My only wish is that there was a better option for those living on campus who wish to go home. At the beginning of the year, I was told I would have 4 in-person classes. After I had moved on campus, the emails came in from professors sending out information from the class.

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","I‚Äôve used the orange coloured wash of theirs. Many do complain it dries their skin out. There are other SA washes on the market (Cerave makes one that I haven‚Äôt tried yet personally). My suggestion would be either give an SA wash from another brand a go, or if you feel your skin can handle it - you could use an SA toner such as the Paula‚Äôs Choice 2% or perhaps 1% stridex pads as an intro into leave on products. You know your skin best so do whatever you think it would tolerate best.

My only caution is actives can make the skin dry when they are too much for the skin or the skin barrier is impaired due to their use. Make sure you moisturise properly and thoroughly no matter which route you take with the SA! :)",1598918421

In how the UK is dealing with the economy, the Tories are a lot closer in opinion. Tory remainers are a little more positive about personal and national finances in the future.  Tory remainers also think that the government is underreacting, while the Leavers are more balanced in their opinion.  They have similar stances on lockdown.

\- I've researched plant pests &amp; the best I've come up with is possibly scale bugs? The white bumps themselves don't ever move... I've found ONE slightly larger dark brown bump in the past (not sure if this was the scale bug itself...? but scraped off too).

The 60 unit marker is typically you have finished your sophomore requirements/lower division stuff, and therefore an AA.

Main thing is if you transfer now without it done, you may still be sophomore status rather than a junior (what you'd likely be if you finished the AA/lower division reqs).

But should check to see which schools offer Spring transfers + which majors (as some are limiting of the majors for Spring). Otherwise, you are likely looking at transferring Fall 2021 (applying Fall 2020). It is ideal to get as much done as possible that you can at the CC, but if they are series types, may be hard if you can only do 2 a semester or something due to pre-reqs.

Should be able to check the school's catalog to see what the pre-reqs are for the upper division stuff, so you may be able to finish off those lower division pre-reqs then just leave some random lower division ones that are not pre-reqs to other courses in your major to be done after transferring.",1598918423

"youtube","t5_2qh44","&gt;If this sub is for only discussing the platform, and not the content or creators, then I'm genuinely curious what the hell you'd have to discuss here...

The features, bugs, etc of the platform. EX: How YouTube implemented COPPA features.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  I mean, are you just hoping for posts to pass that say how incredible of a website YouTube is, and flag all of the criticism? That seems not only counter intuitive, but also entirely pointless.... 

Please take a look at the majority of the posts here. Half, if not more, of the posts are criticizing YouTube. We do not have rules against complaining about YouTube. We have rules about keeping the discussion civil and about YouTube as a platform.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; While I agree that ultimately it's YouTube's responsibility to remove abusive and inappropriate content, there's also a staggering amount of evidence pointing to the fact that YouTube admins ignore the community and remove creators for the least of infractions 

I am in agreeance with you on this - to an extent. As a Trusted Flagger I used to escalate incorrect terminations/strikes in the past (when we could.) I would say around 90% of the claims I've seen on this sub of ""incorrect"" bans or strikes are actually valid based on the information they provide as well as the web-cache data I find.

That being said, yes, there are certain things that I've seen YouTube drop the ball on (EX: Logan Paul/Suicide Forrest.)

There's a lot of valid things you can complain about YouTube for. That doesn't mean we are going to remove it from this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; furthermore, correct me if you think I'm wrong, but is social media not the best source for having misconduct of any kind removed? People in mass quantities and their outrage is what creates change, especially when they've been ignored for so long.... THAT is what people are trying to do here. 

You are correct - when groups gather and complain it's more likely to get something done. This isn't the sub for that kind of a ""call to action"". If you want abuse dealt with, report it. This sub is for discussing the platform, not the content on it that shouldn't be.",1598918423

 Happily... Unless you're a victim... The Sabbat are limited in who they can perform a Mass Embrace on. If they take people from a night club, who have family and friends, who will attract a police investigation, they run the very real risk of the Camarilla being able to call upon its most powerful tool - Mortal pawns. It helps the Camarilla narrow down the location and identities of a Sabbat Pack that is active in their city and, from there, it's just a matter of time until said Vampires never wake up from their daily nap thanks to a police raid, some building renovation or a sudden, unexplained house fire.  
  
 In order to keep their activities secret, the Sabbat has to choose carefully for a Mass Embrace. Sure, they can take one or two good quality people if they catch their eye. After all, the occasional disappearance or murder happens and would easily fly under a Sheriff or Scourge's radar. Taking 10 people in 3 days, though, is going to make someone take notice... So they have to pick people who *won't* be noticed. There's a reason the Sabbat isn't known for its high quality Vampires.  
  
 Homeless people, gang members and criminals in general are popular targets. Gangs are notorious for not reporting missing members to the police, homeless are often not recorded, have nobody who will miss them and may not even have ID and criminals often go out of their way to keep their business their own, meaning there aren't many people who will notice a big change in their schedule. Obviously these things aren't foolproof. If a Nosferatu's homeless informants start vanishing, a Brujah's gang members or a Ventrue's organised crime partners start going dark, the same risk is present, but as far as the mortal world is concerned, those people can vanish and we'd all be happier for it... No need to bother the police!  
  
 The real trick comes when that Mass Embrace, starved, beaten, held over a fire, splashed with hot blood and then unstaked in the middle of a shopping mall, breeches the Masquerade.  
  
 Luckily for the Camarilla, we all *know* there's no such thing as the supernatural, and we all *know* that videos which show a person throwing another person through the air like they were filled with straw are CGI. With their total control over the media, the police and the legal system, it's easy to have such things dismissed publicly as fake, hysteria or nonsense. When it comes to eye witnesses, a different touch is required...  
  
 ... It doesn't always have to be death, though. Nor does it have to be Dominate. It's easier and safer not to be directly connected to these things. Who knows if the Sabbat are watching the police stations, waiting for some stupid young Ventrue to go down there to Dominate the witnesses personally. Instead, maybe that eye witness gets a visit from some men who hold him down and pump LSD into his system, then the blood results say he was high as a kite? Maybe his record is changed and this is his 6th drug offence now? Sounds like he's pretty unreliable to me! Maybe someone brings in pictures of the next witnesses husband and children. Maybe she can take a $50,000 pay out and never speak to anyone about this ever again... Or life can become very difficult for her?... Maybe the next witness finds their bank account empty, their house repossessed, their job letting them go and they become just another insane, homeless nut job, gibbering about having seen monsters during the shopping mall shooting. Sad, really. He's obviously been mentally upset for a long time... Just look at his medical history which says he's been in and out of mental hospitals since he was a kid.  
  
 The Sabbat, in the mean time, are hoping this chaos stretches the Camarilla thin and brings a few of them out of their ivory towers and into the streets to do some dirty work. That's when they can follow them back to their precious Elysium and strike!

"batman","t5_2qqt8","I'm beating a dead horse, but holy rusted metal is the Batmobile unbearably obnoxious. It controls just fine, looks cool and at times it's downright satisfying, but it's the textbook definition of shoehorning. Every mission is either following Cobras or just aimlessly firing missiles and bullets at endless waves of tanks. Like FFS, *no one* at RS sat down and realized that most of the game is just blowing shit up in the Batmobile (and when it's not, you're racing somewhere in it)? It was like I was Sweet Tooth, not Batman. There are a lot of positives to this game, don't get me wrong, but it's really demoralizing to get through a tank mission, get a 15 second cutscene and no matter what is happening or who is in the scene, **somehow** you're right back to blowing more shit up. It's almost humorous how it seems like the entirety of Gotham is self-aware that this is the first game with the Batmobile, so everyone tries to find a way to make Batman use it.

Tl;dr. The overuse of the Batmobile outweighs any positives to the point that it's my least favorite of the 4 Arkham games. I felt like Batman maybe 20% of the game and the rest of the time I was some destructive futuristic mech/tank/robot war machine.",1598918425

2. As soon as someone sends money withdraw to your bank immediately and then remove your bank details from your cashapp account. This ones a bit time consuming because you constantly need to refill and delete your bank details every time someone sends you money.

These methods work because if someone refunds, even if you have withdrawn to your bank cashapp will pull the funds back out of your bank account if it is still attached. If there is no bank account attached it will take your cashapp balance into minus. You simply delete that account and create a new one.",1598918426

"RedditReads","t5_33xfn","Shrouded by myth and hidden by Hollywood, the real pirates of the Caribbean come to life in this collection of essays edited by David Head. Twelve scholars of piracy show why pirates thrived in the New World seas of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century empires, how pirates operated their plundering ventures, how governments battled piracy, and when and why piracy declined. The essays presented take the study of piracy, which can easily lapse into rousing, romanticized stories, to new heights of rigor and insight.The Golden Age of Piracy also delves into the enduring status of pirates as pop culture icons. Audiences have devoured stories about cutthroats such as Blackbeard and Henry Morgan from the time that pirates sailed the sea. By looking at the ideas of gender and sexuality surrounding pirate stories, the fad for hunting pirate treasure, and the construction of pirate myths, the book's contributors tell a new story about the dangerous men, and a few dangerous women, who terrorized the high seas.Contributors:  Douglas R. Burgess, Guy Chet, John A. Coakley, Carolyn Eastman, Adam Jortner, Peter T. Leeson, Margarette Lincoln, Virginia W. Lunsford, Kevin P.

&gt; Aug. 31, 2020, 10:31 a.m. ET.ZHONGSHAN, China - This was supposed to be the year that China&amp;#039;s export machine began to stall.

&gt; &amp;quot;China has the largest supply chain of the parts you need to make a speaker, and China has the most stable, affordable labor force,&amp;quot; said Philip Richardson, the American owner of Trueanalog.

&gt; President Trump points to the deficit as proof that unfair practices by China have been hurting the United States, and has campaigned on promises to get tough on China.

The only solution is to hire more actors and kill those ones instead, or say fuck you and make characters actually mean something again.

The guy has no visible motivation to improve his living conditions and while frustrated with his life has done next to nothing to change it. He's going to get *real* comfortable living in a new space and moving into his own flat is going to be a major downgrade for him and he just might resist that. You absolutely *must* lay down hard rules and be stern when he does not follow through, otherwise he will exploit you and lose all respect for you.

You *cannot* afford to be giving and charitable in this situation, because he will bleed you dry if given the opportunity. Even if it makes you feel like scum, you need to be immovable in this.

He was actually introduced to me by my handlers, but after I kicked my ex out he came to me and told me my ex had told him I had ""just went crazy for no reason"" and kicked him out. He told me he didn't believe him and that my ex seemed like he could be a pathological liar, and that I had always shown him kindness and seemed like a nice person and if I ever needed anything or just to talk to call him...

I didn't trust him at first, I thought he could be a plant, inserting himself into my life to extract information from me and fuck with me further, but after grilling him intensely he seemed genuine, and even stayed with my son and I for a time to help us out and to help us feel safer at night. My son absolutely LOVED him and in fact he only felt safe enough to tell me what had happened to him if he was there. I think he saw him as a father figure and someone who could protect us..  He ended up getting picked up on a parole violation (he had spent some time in prison on federal charges for theft), and so we were seperated from each other for several months.

He just got out a couple weeks ago and contacted me and had come over to my house the night before this was found in his car. He had stayed the night at my place and this was there in the morning. My ex was extremely jealous and possessive and I think he saw/sees this friend of mine as a threat. I also found evidence on my late ""stepfather's "" facebook, in his private messages, that he was discussing torturing this friend of mine with a contact of his, long before I ever met him. 

I'm beginning to wonder now if my stalkers were planning on using my friend as a fall guy for something they were planning to do to my son and I, and so that's why they introduced us to begin with, but they didn't expect us to contact each other and become so close, and are now threatening him for helping us.",1598918432

Rolf even talks about rounding up some guards for more aggressive questioning... this guy is Galmar Stone-Fist's brother: it's not an idle threat. 

That's your introduction to Windhelm, the Cloak Capital, which Mr. Cloaks himself presides over. The developers wanted to make sure you saw a racist shakedown before joining the Cloaks.

&gt; Aug. 31, 2020, 10:31 a.m. ET.ZHONGSHAN, China - This was supposed to be the year that China&amp;#039;s export machine began to stall.

&gt; &amp;quot;China has the largest supply chain of the parts you need to make a speaker, and China has the most stable, affordable labor force,&amp;quot; said Philip Richardson, the American owner of Trueanalog.

&gt; President Trump points to the deficit as proof that unfair practices by China have been hurting the United States, and has campaigned on promises to get tough on China.

Sidenote since you‚Äôre newer to DS2: every build is viable.  All 4 caster types are solid.  Lightning scales with faith, magic with INT, dark with the lower of faith/INT(level them equally, soft cap at 30/30), and pyro with the average of INT/Faith",1598918434

The bottle neck in this type of situation is gonna be the DB, but PG is really fast and shouldn't really be a bottleneck at all. Since it is only read operations and the source is only updated once per day you should be able to take advantage of PG pooling/HA options for load balancing. This will work well since you have only read operations on the DB.

You can point out the White Sox again with what they got for Quintana. But some of that is desperation as well. The two young pitching assets Avila could have moved are Fulmer and Boyd. One immediately got hurt while the other turned into a pumpkin. I tend to give Avila a pass on Fulmer and one could argue the same for Boyd. But I think he should have been moved last season.

And as good as JD Martinez is, hitters entering FA don't bring back much. They have to be young and under contract for a few years.

While I'm still not fully convinced Avila is the right guy, I think they could be worse than that are. He has done OK given the spot he inherited. Hopefully he learned from the Jordan Zimmerman debacle.",1598918437

I wouldn‚Äôt say that the pandemic resulted in me becoming slightly ‚Äòdepressed‚Äô, but it‚Äôs been more of a ‚Äòcall to action‚Äô, or a realisation moment, and that I need to do something about it, and hopefully I won‚Äôt forget about it and continue to improve. I tend to stay away from assigning the word ‚Äòdepression‚Äô to my emotions, because I‚Äôm a firm believer that if we allow that to happen, it will only continue to grow on us, and ironically this same concept could be applied to my current problem. 

One problem with meeting new girls (for me) is that I live in U.K., which has slightly different culture regarding meeting new people (you can‚Äôt really walk up to a random person and suddenly be friends, I think, as opposed to majority of other countries), plus I‚Äôm not really sure how to approach them (if we have nothing in common) and become legitimate friends. 

And yes, I‚Äôm totally inexperienced hah, won‚Äôt go into details but next to none is a pretty good approximation of my experience when it comes to dating/relationships/flirting.

I think that I do realise that if I get rejected, that‚Äôs that and it‚Äôs nothing serious (whereas before, I was a bit down after getting a rejection as I wasn‚Äôt aware of how ‚Äòit works‚Äô (plus the girl, in my opinion, might‚Äôve dragged me on, which only added to that)), but in my head if I ask her out and she says that we should hang out, I will have no clue what to do afterwards, and if she says no then it‚Äôs obviously a no, so in my head it‚Äôs a lose-lose situation, then comes in the factor of me wanting to avoid that risk and firstly gather information/understanding whether she is interested.",1598918439

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","&gt; Incidentally, those activities are how you acquire Prisms and Golfballs, which puts you at a disadvantage - to get the currency necessary to improve your armor to take on more difficult content, you have to play difficult content without the additional benefits from masterworked armor.

Not really though, you get 3 shards from the season pass and can get many prisms from PoH. Or though it's very inefficient you can even burn some cores. There's also lower-tier nightfalls that give prisms sometimes. Not to mention, you could simply complete a master nightfall even if you're at a small disadvantage due to having less energy and stats. It's not that big of a deal. 

&gt; Moreover, when you disassemble armor with prisms or balls, you don't get them back.

If it's like MW'd PoH armor, you get 6 prisms for dismantling a fully MW'd legendary, that's about half the cost of the MW.

It isn't obvious that BTS is in better terms. We just don't know at this moment how their relationships really are. Kpop groups just act differently, you'd never find them publicly outright fighting or sabotaging each other like some Western groups. 

&gt;  BTS has also mention their fights and how difficult it is to be on a group. 

This is my point, fans only know about their fights when they are over and done with. While they are actually ongoing we don't have a clue about them.

I know about Shinhwa and about how they were so badly treated by SM. 

To compare BTS to Western groups, they might have a (I think) genuine close bond like Little Mix or they might have a lot of dislike like Fifth Harmony did. But we can't tell what it is at the moment because of the way Kpop works. I am just cautioning about being over-invested in the bond BTS displays to the public because in the past I have seen a lot of fans of different Kpop groups get very upset when members leave.",1598918440

Another example I can think of:

When Haida and Inue(?) are talking to each other about the reasons they like punk music. Throughout the conversation in the sub, it's about how ""edgy"" it is and how that appeals to them.

"badeconomics","t5_2wbw4","NG does not split the difference.  Their training and ethos is the exact same as any ad soldier they go to the same schools and taught the same way.  Many of them have as much overseas experience as your standard AD soldier.  The ONLY potential difference outside the obvious downsides of only training once a month, is that they are from the community in question.

National guardsmen are not trained for domestic response missions no matter what anyone tells you.  They are trained to go overseas and fight or to fight foreign invaders.  And those guardsmen are at some level wired to be okay with that.

Look at what that Dallas shooter who was a reservist did a few years ago and the way he tactically moved around the crime scene.  Most people do not close with adversaries the way he did his victims.  He wasn't even a combat arms soldier he was like a carpenter.  

If NG are performing better in counter protest roles it's a credit to them as individuals not their training pipeline.  And with making a riot/protest spill over into death only takes a few people snapping and escalating the violence.  They also a. Aren't seen as negatively by protestors as police which minimizes violence and escalation of violence, b. likely aren't armed to the man because of their command teams fears, and c. Probably scare protestors because armored soldiers are intimidating, even if it's a guardsman.",1598918441

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","Labs tend to like to play roughly (not in a mean way, just lots of body contact) and are very rambunctious as puppies and adolescents. So the bigger the size difference between your two dogs, the more likely it is that the lab will accidentally injure the smaller dog.  As a point of reference, the lab will likely exceed 30 pounds by 4 or 5 months.  This doesn't mean that labs don't get along well with smaller dogs, it's just something you need to be mindful of. Same thing for golden retrievers.

So if you are going to get a small dog now, I'd recommend sticking to the larger end of your range. Maybe a cocker spaniel or a larger miniature poodle?",1598918442

Title: **Refinancing Real Estate Question**

Original Post: 

&gt; I have 10 poperties I purchased using an investor and they are through an Escrow company. My interest rate is high therfore, I have initiated the refinancing process with my bank. It has come to my attention that the Escrow Officer (Escrow company Owner) released this information to a third party person whom has no interest in the matter. Is this legal?

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","I wouldnt say so, the details suggest he was. Which is why they are charging him with murder rather than letting him go on the grounds of self defense. Again, i'm not claiming whether the report is accurate or not, but according to the report there was an argument, one of the victims threw a ""carrier bag"" towards him which had to be confirmed by two separate videos, shortly afterwards a loud bang is heard and the victim shouts ""fuck you"" and starts to approach Kyle. It states that victim is unarmed, but Kyle subsequently shot them as another 4 gunshots are heard and the victim fell to the ground. In a court of law you can't say you shot someone in self defense because they approached you unarmed and shouting, nor can you say you shot them in self defense because of the carrier bag that was thrown at him. 

The language might not make him sound like a murderer, but neither does it say anything to suggest he acted under self defense either. The details leading up to the gunfire, and the circumstances of when he fired, don't do anything to suggest he was under threat of anything other than a man shouting at him. The word ""engaged"" does not mean threatened or attacked, it means engaged in an altercation, which is not an open excuse to shoot them, nor does it suggest who engaged in the argument first. Also, at no point in the entire report are the words ""self defense"" even mentioned, in fact the witness who sounds like he had talked to Kyle previously, states that he was holding the rifle poorly, with the gun pointing towards people but pointed downwards, then when the victim started to approach, he raised the rifle to aim directly at him. Again, this victim was unarmed.   


The rest of the report is missing from the screenshot, so they might conclude it afterwards with something to suggest otherwise, but from what you can read in this screenshot, its not looking good for Kyle.  There's nothing in that report to hint he acted in self defense, never mind make it obvious.",1598918442

Lots of the guys here have been treated badly by some trans women in other subs, so they come here to vent. For example, I made a post a week ago making fun of a trans woman on /r/honesttransgender who was saying because HRT made her more emotional and apathetic that the opposite MUST be true for trans guys. Many trans people, women included, tried to explain to her how this was flawed, but she just doubled down on her statement. So I made a post making fun of it. But it was a statement on one trans woman, not all trans women.

There's apparently some trans women who troll this sub and report every post here for being transphobic. So then I make fun of the reports that don't seem to get the point of the post. And if someone was being genuinely transphobic, and not just saying something in a joking manner, the comment would be removed.

As for shortest and longest, the shortest I can actually remember was around .2 miles, which is quite literally around the corner. The minimum amount I make off of any delivery is 3 dollars, so I wasn‚Äôt complaining. I just thought it was a little weird. 

The longest I actually DID was just short of 20 miles, which if I remember correctly, I had to pick up some ice cream from a GAS STATION (some pints of Ben and Jerry‚Äôs) and drive them to an apartment complex. I‚Äôm not sure about that one either, as I didn‚Äôt have any actual correspondence with the customer beyond notifying them of my arrival. The longest that I‚Äôve ever seen was a delivery that was nearly 40 miles, which would have earned my about 19 dollars raw. That is a decent amount for an order, but surprisingly low given the distance I was supposed to travel.

Of course, if someone will have to spend a lifetime in a spaceship it better be a large one. But we aren't far from being able to develop the equivalent of suspended animation (e.g. very slow metabolism under coma). 

So it's not like we can't do it, it's just that it's terribly inconvenient to do it today.

I.e, we used to bend not the elements, but the energy of beings themselves. Aang then takes away Ozai‚Äôs bending. We can extrapolate that if it can be taken away, it can be given.

"ThornTree","t5_2ifo3w","&gt;*Yea I think this shows that either you are in one camp, or the other, and not many on the fence, more keeping quiet.*

Yes I tend to agree - there might be 90% or so who know very well who they're going to vote for.  The critical issue - especially for Joe Biden, given he has to overcome the significant Electoral College bias - is whether he can attract the swing voters, independents, and those who really don't want to vote Trump a second time.

And under your voluntary system, just getting big numbers out to vote is an issue, and this cycle, the effect of mail-in voting, for both Democrats and Republicans, is hard to predict.

My more pessimistic view is a bit like Michael Moore's - who predicted in 2016 that Trump would win.  Biden has to convince Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, etc, etc, that the black riots in big cities are NOT a reason to rush to the arms of Trump. We'll see.

I don't mind black sports stars  being a bit disruptive - flexing your muscles when you make up a good slice of the talent seems fair enough to me. Whites do shit like that all the time, in their own way.",1598918444

Certainly, some Western NGOs were meddling, but the vast majority of the demonstrators has enough of Lukashenko, and they aren‚Äôt interested in any geopolitical reorientation of Belarus towards the West.

However, if Lukashenko, who is already unpopular, now remains in power and suddenly goes along with an integration into the union state that goes further than most people want, a dangerous Ukraine-like situation in which opposition against Lukashenko might merge with anti-Russian nationalism (which has already been there, but so far, it was rather marginal in Belarus) could emerge.

Lukashenko staying in power a bit longer may be the lesser evil compared to a violent coup. But I doubt that Babariko, who had been an employee of Gazprombank for many years and who is now in prison, or Tsepkalo, who has fled to Russia, are puppets of a Western color revolution. What would probably be in Russia‚Äôs best interest would be to pressure for new elections in which these most popular candidates can participate. One of them (probably Babariko) would probably be elected in free elections, and he would probably be a much better partner for Russia than Lukashenko whose time has passed.",1598918445

I was down there for maybe 15-20 seconds until the wave finally ‚Äúreleased‚Äù me and I started to swim back up to the surface. But before I got back to the top another large wave came through and completely obliterated me. I had no idea which way was up and started panicking. I was trying to hold my breath, but my body forced me to take a breath. I inhaled A LOT of salt water, the pain in my chest was something I‚Äôve never experienced. Far worse than breaking any bone. I thought it was over and my body limp, but I somehow got back to the surface. Threw up a bunch of salt water and paddled back to the boat. My friend I was with said I was down for about 45 seconds to a minute, but it felt like forever. 

Just for reference, at the time I could hold my breath for almost 3 minutes easily. Getting rag dolled, swimming, and the panic limits you a lot more in real life.",1598918445

Add to list
In nature, an animal is most dangerous when cornered and wounded. The same is proving true in the closing months of President Trump‚Äôs term.

Trump botched the coronavirus pandemic, bungled the economic recovery and flubbed the handling of civil rights demonstrations. Members of his own family denounce him. He faces a seemingly insurmountable deficit against challenger Joe Biden.

And so the president is trying to provoke a race war on the streets of America.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve arrived at a moment in this campaign,‚Äù Biden said during a visit to a rehabilitated Pittsburgh steel mill Monday, that ‚Äúwe all knew . . . we‚Äôd get to ‚Äî the moment when Donald Trump would be so desperate, he‚Äôd do anything to hold on to power.‚Äù

After violence claimed lives on both sides of the divide between racial-justice demonstrators and Trump supporters in recent days, Biden said Trump ‚Äúfans the flames‚Äù of violence. ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt stop the violence because, for years, he‚Äôs fomented it.‚Äù

Biden quoted from departing Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway‚Äôs acknowledgment that ‚Äúthe more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is‚Äù for the president. Said Biden: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs rooting for chaos and violence.‚Äù

When the president‚Äôs supporters, often armed, drive into cities to provoke racial-justice demonstrators, Trump calls them ‚ÄúGREAT PATRIOTS!‚Äù His convention glorified vigilantes who took up arms against protesters ‚Äî ‚Äúdisgraceful anarchists‚Äù and ‚Äúthugs‚Äù in Trump‚Äôs telling. The president declares that the backlash against demonstrators by his supporters ‚Äúcannot be unexpected‚Äù and says that ‚Äúthe only way you will stop the violence in the high crime Democrat run cities is through strength!‚Äù He declines to condemn ‚Äî and his son helps lionize ‚Äî the far-right militia member who allegedly killed two protesters in Wisconsin.

Trump is doing this because, he thinks, White suburban women will be frightened and will vote for him to protect them. They should be frightened ‚Äî by a leader who instigates bloodshed to promote selfish ends.

There‚Äôs plenty of blame to go around for the violence: far-left ‚Äúantifa,‚Äù far-right militias and opportunists and criminals of all variety. What‚Äôs needed to calm the situation is for leaders to denounce violence in all forms.

‚ÄúI want to make it absolutely clear,‚Äù Biden said in Pittsburgh ‚Äî chosen instead of Wisconsin, where Trump is scheduled to travel Tuesday, to avoid further inflammation. ‚ÄúRioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. . . . It‚Äôs lawlessness, plain and simple, and those who do it should be prosecuted. Violence will not bring change, it‚Äôll only bring destruction. It‚Äôs wrong in every way.‚Äù

And Trump? Invited at a news conference Monday evening to condemn violence by his supporters, he declined.

This matters. Preliminary new research from political scientists at the University of Maryland and Louisiana State University suggests that neither side is inherently more violent; about 10 percent of Americans, equally divided between right and left, condone political violence, and only a tiny fraction of them are actually violent.

But the researchers also found that when those prone to violence were read a statement by either Biden or Trump condemning violence, they became 20 percent less likely to support political violence. The more partisan, the greater the effect. ‚ÄúWithout a message of anti-violence, the strong partisans are more violent,‚Äù Lilliana Mason, an associate professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland, tells me.

That‚Äôs why Trump‚Äôs leadership is so deadly. The Anti-Defamation League found that four of the five years Trump has been on the national scene have set records for extremist-related violence. In 2019, right-wing fanatics were responsible for 90 percent of extremist-related murders. Elizabeth Neumann, who recently resigned a high-level position in Trump‚Äôs Department of Homeland Security, told Yahoo News that ‚Äúyou have right-wing extremists coming in trying to take advantage of the cover of the protests to carry out these violent acts and they are trying to start a race war.‚Äù

Trump, who likes to say his supporters are ‚Äúmuch tougher‚Äù than the other side, has routinely spouted violent notions. ‚ÄúWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.‚Äù ‚ÄúVicious dogs.‚Äù ‚ÄúDominate the streets.‚Äù ‚ÄúLIBERATE MICHIGAN!‚Äù ‚ÄúKnock the crap out of them.‚Äù ‚ÄúVery fine people on both sides.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to punch him in the face.‚Äù ‚ÄúEnemy of the people.‚Äù ‚ÄúAny guy that can do a body slam, he is my type.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe audience hit back. That‚Äôs what we need a little more of.‚Äù

The potential for political violence has grown as parties polarized by race and racial attitudes. Only leaders‚Äô restraint has avoided a conflagration up to now. But Trump has unleashed the hellhounds, and it won‚Äôt be easy to stop.

‚ÄúI look at this violence and I see lives and communities and the dreams of small businesses being destroyed,‚Äù Biden said from Pittsburgh in his latest anti-violence plea. ‚ÄúDonald Trump looks at this violence and he sees a political lifeline.‚Äù

Biden is doing his part. But calm won‚Äôt come unless and until the American president acts like a human being ‚Äî not a cornered animal.",1598918445

It would be like calling a bat a type of bird. Yes, bats and birds have the common trait of being able to fly. However, there are fundamental differences at their core that make it scientifically inaccurate to call a bat a  type of bird. It's the same way for the Incas and socialism.

"Vermintide","t5_36d6l","Shade main here. I love shade as she has among the most versatility in build options and how she can be kitted to deal with many different scenarios. However, that comes with one main drawback: often you will feel that your build will lack in either horde clear, special clear, elite clear or monster dps. As such, mastering shade involves understanding the strengths and weaknesses of your kit and playing around it.

As general rule of thumb, shade is mobile and has an extremely versatile ult that can get your or your teammates out of jail free (ulti when surrounded, when a friend is downed or caught by a special and everyone is swamped, so please NEVER ult to clear that one lonely cw). As such, often I find one way to shore up her weakness is to split the enemy from my team and leverage my mobility to draw attention from my team. Example: team aggros a chaos patrol and I'm holding dual swords. I'm not gonna kill anything so I'm gonna split off, try to proc spring heeled assassin using L3 and L4, and try to weave within sniping distance of my team so I can pop ult to clear a surprise special. Use your mobility to buy space for your team, but Never run too far off as you have one of the best special clear with ulti+longbow/hagbane.

Always remember that V2 is a team game, so always think about what's best for your team. Often you cannot afford to be right next to allies (accidental dodges into swings for your allies hurt too much), but you should be within res and sniping distance. 

To more specific tricks:
Cloak of Pain is amazing utility. Extra space to pop pots during monsters, you can ult to res a teammate, pop first hit to trigger Cloak of Pain then res/heal someone else, extended invis time to reposition closer to team if you effed up positioning etc. 

Do try to spread your kit to cover as many bases as possible. Daggers mean your horde clear is lacking so consider hagbane+blood fletcher. Dual Swords has considerable horde clear but little to no armor dmg so consider longbow instead etc. And always remember that if you picked shade, monster dps is your job so don't neglect that (like taking vanish, cloak of mist, longbow, dual swords and 0 crit power) 

Longbow makes you among best special clears in the game. Prioritise sniping during hordes as most builds have poor-ish horde clear so support your team by giving them piece of mind from specials. 

Backstab procs from enemy flanks as well, not just their backs. Find out which attacks of your weapons have crit chance and time a side dodge for that attack to land on an elites flank to have chance of procing backstab. (dual swords, dual daggers and S&amp;D L3 and L4 have it)

Hagbane MUST be accompanied by blood fletcher, and experiment with shooting the floor when surrounded to attempt to stagger the everything around you to get out of there. 

S&amp;D is the gold standard for melee weapons but is a pain to master (me I don't use it but I have to acknowledge its strength) 

Cloak of mist+vanish+dual swords seems cool where you can pop ult then wipe the floor with hordes and patrols with permanent invis and cleave through armor using dual swords heavies. But you lose the monster dps and utility of ulti so not sure if it's viable or meme as I'm dropping all monster dps. Feels like may as well get salt or kruber or sienna for that armor dmg at that point..

Overall, I love shade as she's an extremely reactive class that forces me to adapt to every new team. Good luck and have fun!",1598918447

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt;Even if we agreed gameplay comes first, and story second, and even in cases where that mentioned statement is right, that doesn't mean I can't say the ludonarrative dissonance sucks, that it lowers immersion. It doesn't matter if they pushed themselves into corner where ludonarrative dissonance is the best choice, the point is that it breaks the continuity between character+story and what I actually see on screen, and it's worse for it. If I had a game with as good characters and as good story as Uncharted, but they'd be different in a way such that it make for them to have gameplay they have, it'd simply be better. 

&gt;Then you're talking about other gamified aspects making this okay - but suspension of disbelief has its limits, the more you stretch it the worse the product becomes (assuming other factors are same). I also mentioned the worth of trade-offs - ofc sometimes it's better to keep the ludonarrative dissonance if the alternative breaks the game. That doesn't it's always the right choice.

But remember I was saying that a game has two parts the gameplay and the story. They don't always match up but they don't necessarily have to. One cannot coexist without the other. Again a game has a certain level of buy in, you have to be able to accept that Drake is a ""mass murderer"" in order for the gameplay to not suffer for story's sake. 

I agree that it gets ridiculous and you stop and think about it but games are supposed to be ridiculous in some way. Remember all three of the Batman games take place over one night yes one night. You mean to tell me that one guy can take on all of these people in a 14-hour time period? Now what would be cool is if they WB made a Batman game in where you fight a bunch of different supervillains over a period of time say a couple months, think like [The Long Halloween](https://batman.fandom.com/wiki/Batman:_The_Long_Halloween) I think that would help the suspension of disbelief a little. 

It take the first Tomb Raider the game takes place over what two weeks? Lara goes from a scared little teenage girl who never even killed someone to a person who has killed dozens of people by the games end. I mean ok, but the game has to progress that way or else Lara will die on that island. Sure she doesn't have to kill 150 people, but like I was saying earlier that just gives the player something to do. If I'm playing an action game I want to kill a few bad guys. That's why I'm playing the game. The story is just to give me an excuse to go from point A to point B. I need to know why I'm killing 

&gt;Finally, what sets games apart from other forms of media is not simply being literally 'games' you play. It's high degree of interactivity. And there are plenty good games that focus on story because there's no reason why it should not. Games don't have prescribed specific length, style, gameplay, ...

Listen I'm not disagreeing with that. It's just I'm action game like Doom. It's kind of silly to have a guy go down to the depts of hell and kill a bunch of demons with a shotgun, but I mean again it's a video game you have to kind of let some things slide. I do agree that games don't fit in a specific box ,I mean they do but at the same time they all don't. A puzzle game has to have puzzles. It's the very nature of a puzzle game, just like a survival horror game has to have horror. 

I just believe if I'm playing a game like Life is Strange I don't expect to be killing hundreds of Nazis but if I'm playing Wolfenstein everybody be at least 1500 zombies and robots dogs to kill.",1598918447

* rearrange or add more tank decor! They're super curious and love to explore
* Draw with a dry erase marker on the outside of the tank! Again, something new to be curious about
* Teach some tricks! If your guy is food motivated, he'll love this. You can teach bettas to jump out of the water, follow your finger, swim through a ring, and other stuff
* Somebody else also mentioned quick flaring exercises with a small mirror. This is one of the best things you can do (in my opinion) in terms of free enrichment!

In exchange for iMessage you're gaining a lot more than you'll ever have on iPhone. If you still want to FaceTime with Apple users you can use Google Duo or other apps. 

I think any experienced iPhone user will easily overcome the foreign feeling of Android at first. There is so much more freedom in every aspect of the Galaxy than Apple would ever permit on their devices. I have every game ever made for SNES/NES/Sega with little space used. I can watch movies and YouTube. I could connect controllers or devices by Bluetooth easily. Access all my music. Share content from the phone to PC effortlessly without the trouble of iTunes. The camera is excellent. I was able to easily customize my phone the way I liked it in the first day and even was able to get deeper customization on the battery saving mode. No notch is bonus. The screen space is fully used on this phone which is wonderful. On my iPhone X I still felt like my screen space was very limited. I can keep going. I recommend you go to your carrier and tinker with an in store device. I pretty much had most things figured out before I left with the phone. Felt more comfortable making the jump after that.

"starcraft2coop","t5_3ob90","Empower bonus is actually very simple to calculate  and won't  relate to those numbers.

You can check out how it works in summary [here](https://starcraft2coop.com/commanders/alarak).

&gt; **Empower Me:** Alarak's attacks and abilities deal increased damage for each allied unit nearby. Mechanical units grant him double the power. Resets the cooldown of Deadly Charge and Destruction Wave.

&gt; Biological units provide a 5% damage bonus per supply up to 100 supply, and then provide 2.5% per supply onwards. Mechanical units provide 10% damage bonus per supply up to 100 supply, and then provide 5% per supply onwards.

&gt; Supply count is additive, with biological units favored first. So if you have 100 supply in bio and 1 supply in mechanical units, the mechanical units will provide the reduced rate of 5%.

Edit: It's  not mentioned in there but heroic units that cost 0 supply (like Tychus, Zag roaches, etc) all add 3 supply of their unit type with the exception of the Death Fleet Mothership which counts as 10 supply (meaning  the Death Fleet in total counts as 34 supply of mechanical units).",1598918448

""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.""

Sometimes, bad things happen not because of people having bad intentions, but because they didn't think it through properly. Poor design choices are often made due to negligence and human error, but asshole designs are specifically engineered to exploit the user for profit. Try to think what the designer would gain from deceiving the user, and if it's likely to be an oversight on their part rather than an intentional design.

I think we all know many games, especially kickstarter projects, that are happily ambitious but forget to ground their project in their actual abilities and end up not being able to do anything properly.

Solasta being shorter, more focused and more ""humble"" (and again i don't mean that in a condescending way, I really enjoy the team's visible passion, the seriousness of everything we've seen so far and the quality of the content) is a good point in my book.

Speaking of not mentioning any kind of Socialist doctrine,  they actually outright reject Socialist doctrine:

**Fascist Manifesto**: ‚ÄúOf the Manifesto's proposals, the commitment to **corporative organisation of economic interests** was to be the longest lasting.‚Äù. And Marx or really any Modern Socialist will let you know - Corporative organization is the opposite of public organization (AKA Socialism).

**Doctrine of Fascism**:‚ÄùA key concept of the Mussolini essay was that fascism was a rejection of previous models: ""Granted that the XIXth century was the century of socialism, liberalism, democracy, **this does not mean that the XXth century must also be the century of socialism, liberalism, democracy**. Political doctrines pass; nations remain. We are free to believe that this is the century of authority, a century tending to the ""right"", a Fascist century. If the XIXth century was the century of the individual (liberalism implies individualism) we are free to believe that this is the ‚Äúcollective‚Äù century, and therefore the century of the State.""‚Äù The explicit rejection of Socialism in the form of a totally new political system, built upon, in practice, Capitalism.

Repetition works.  Especially on the people the Dems need the most right now.  The people who would find it ""tiring"" and unseemly are you... and they're already Biden voters.

Buy hey, how did Axelrod's strategy work for 2016?  That high road has cost us our country.

Another key example: when trump was doing daily pushes to ram through his health care bill, it started as a near certainty.  But every night, whatever Trump had just said would get smashed to shit by... Jimmy Kimmel.  Night after night, Kimmel would rudely and crudely and passionately demolish Trump's lies and mock the living hell out of him.  

In fact, as soon as trump would say *anything*, our heads swung instantly to see what Kimmel would do or say.  We were conditioned for it.

Day by day, that percolated into public opinion, which led to calls to senators, which led to press skirmishes, which led to protests at their offices, and eventually an undeniable Kimmel-inspired public opinion consensus which led to flipping the outcome.  

People *want* to see a fight.  They *want* that rebuttal.  Biden giving some detached, high road morning address is fine, but it's NOT the same as the night time MMA match the people want.  Dems are, as always, blowing a huge opportunity here.",1598918451

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Depends on how much you let yourself get distracted. It's tough for a lot of players to answer because they removed a lot of junk from ARR recently so we have no fresh experience.

Mr Happy did it in about 50 hours which was 28 hours for 2.0 (base game), then the rest for 2.1 to 2.3 (ARR epilogue) and 2.4 to 2.5 (pre-Heavensward). But he has played the game multiple times so while he said he wasn't trying too hard it'll still be faster than many new players.

You might need to farm some poetics for level 50 gear with roulettes and things after hitting 50 while doing the quests which will add some delays to your daily play time, but you don't need a full set because the quests will reward gear as you go. Weapon is #1 priority as always. And you should probably do the level 50 alliance raids as part of that since you need them cleared for later even though they are side content for you right now.

My recommendation is usually to click through a scene fast if there is no voice acting, otherwise pay attention. Don't read the quest logs if you're in a hurry, just go and do the thing. The quest logs are mostly fluff. Quests after 2.0 were also delivered many months apart in major patches, which is why characters spend a lot of time recapping stuff you just talked about. They probably should have cut some of that but apparently they left a lot in.",1598918451

Not to mention she WILL continue coming back to the spot where you've fed her. And having shelter from the weather there would be good. 

And you, have done the taboo thing, you fed her. Normally, you're not supposed to feed, or even pet, stray cats. (or potentially already-owned cats). They will follow you home and expect you to feed it. By feeding the stray, you've given her attachements, and expectations. To STOP would be cruel. You say she knows how to survive, that isn't entirely true, if so, why is she wanting to eat the food you bring? She's clearly hungry, no?

I don't mean to be harsh, I wouldn't leave a stray alone myself. But I know the commitment I start when I start seducing a feral cat. And over time, if you continue feeding her, you will earn her trust, and she won't be much of a feral around you.
(if you have no knowledge of cats, blink slowly at them and don't stare at them. This shows you're no threat to her. Blinking slowly.. says a lot of things to a cat. But the short of it is: I like you, I'm no threat to you).",1598918451

Tongue weight is an important maximum rating to be aware of as it's weight placed into the rear suspension of the tow vehicle.

Without any significant tongue weight you'll have more flexibility in what you can tow safely. 

Tongue weight would typically be 10-15% of the total weight which on a class 3 hitch would give you a maximum pull weight of 4000-6000 lbs (600 lb tongue weight).


Your specific vehicle may be rated for a 400 - 500 lb maximum tongue weight, which would have a lower safe limit than my above example.

You had a high level meta, which consisted of premade hunters (4-players group, aka survivors) with voice com destroying the monster (solo player, aka killer) so hard that it wasn't even fun. 
Then you had the solo queue, low level meta, a place where the monster was dominating hard (I remember having a 90% winrate when the game was still brand new without any meta)

They didn't find a solution and the game ended up dying unfortunately...
To be fair it mostly died because they had one of the worse economy system I ever saw, it felt like they tried competing with EA to see who could create the biggest piece of ***** 
They released 60$ DLCs every few months, to a game that costed already 60$, and you had to buy them to remain somewhat competitive

It shows that unfortunately having an imbalanced meta because of the fact that premades can cooperate so much more is not something you can easily fix. There might be no good solution

I feel their best shot at balancing the game could be to buff survivors' ability to know where the others are and what they're doing.
This way you reduce the advance that premades have, and you can do other balance changes (probably buff killer) without destroying even more the low level experience",1598918451

Nobody will cleanse you in &lt;masters leagues.

&gt; So it's a triple cleanse? So what? It's not Iron skin. 

Guaranted cast ulti. Good players always trying to interrupt him.

&gt; It already does with normal clease/statis and such. 

Yes, and Qhira is bad against this heroes. Now Qhira is autolose hero.

&gt; 1 sec of unstoppable for taz'dingo? 

Stunlock him before his ulti, yes! This strategy is gone.

&gt; So he's free to cast it once each 5 minutes? 

With 20 lvl upgrade it's always value. Guaranted AoE-disable (well, someone can press selfcleanse).

&gt; Still 5 minutes... 

For possible kill Artanis? You can catch his prism with selfcleanse, and this can win game.

&gt; Most hooks you do not see coming, as far as I know you cannot self cleanse when you are already stunned. 

Pre-selfcleanse always better than support precleanse. You feel your hero better than ur support.",1598918452

"myterribleneighbors","t5_2wx1n","It happens.  My wife and I lived in an upstairs unit in an apartment complex and the downstairs neighbor complained a lot about creepy shit.

When we had guests over he complained he could ""hear"" the guests moving around in the bed (not sex).    Or he could hear them opening and closing closets when getting dressed.  Or our friend's three-year old daughter walking around the floor even though it's all carpet?

I don't get it.  Does he expect us not to live in the unit we pay for?

My wife and I consider ourselves quiet.  We never play music or even own a sub-woofer.

What sucked is the downstairs neighbor was the building-manager.  I eventually had enough of his shit and moved to live in a townhome which we paid-up for.  Apartment living is not for us.",1598918452
"IntellectualDarkWeb","t5_e0m2r","Well looking at their section on De-escalation I think it's clear they failed to consider all the options available to them as well as failing to recognize the possibility of a medical crisis, yes indeed. Remember that in the video Floyd complained about not hearing or understanding what the officers were telling him. Also keep in mind under de-escalation tactics avoiding physical confrontation is an option when there is no threat. Floyd was handcuffed and sitting down at parts and laying down at parts. Floyd also continually asked to talk to the officers which would have been in line with their related de-escalation tactics. Instead they used their discretion to handle the situation as quickly as possible instead of as safely for the suspect as possible. This alone doesn't point to a depraved indifference to human life but I think many would see a certain amount of callousness in their handling of the situation, especially when looking at all the options their training allowed for. 

The neck press isn't happening in the vacuum of an instant but is a continual application of force. There was a point where Floyd passed out and some moments later one of the officers did appear to check Floyd's pulse on the wrist but said nothing. The officer performing the neck press never seemed aware of the medical situation the suspect was in though he had multiple opportunities to make himself aware. The depravity claim comes from the excessive force used on an unconscious man because compressing the neck of an unconscious man should be seen as excessive for the purposes of gaining control of the suspect. There was a callous attitude displayed from the beginning and there seemed to be indifference to the well-being of Floyd up into his death.

My opinion anyway lol.",1598918452

I figure if normal conversation isn't working for you, try a game. He could be in a bad place mentally and that could be just the thing to distract him for a bit, and you'll also get some interaction!

I'll just keep trying, I guess. I've seen some more experienced PvP pilots, Suitonia of course, and also Blights Wretch, use the standings system to identify potential gank vs. honorable fight situations, although I didn't know what it was at the time. I'll be sure to use that going forward.

Knowing the engagement profile is also really helpful. As a T1 pilot, flying different ships, I have a grasp on what I can and can't win - ex. Tristan vs. a Hookbill. If I'm in the plex first, I should almost always win that matchup in the Tristan if I'm kite fit. If he's there first, I will 90% of the time lose because Hookbills usually fit double webs and a scram.

I use various resources for coming up with fits - Eve uni before they took down their fittings, and the aforementioned PvP pilots Blights Wretch and Suitonia. My fitting is not usually the weak spot.",1598918452

But let me say this: The people who state, ""I hate how political this sub has become"" or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like how political this sub is,‚Äù are most likely people who believe in conspiracies and buy into far right talking points. They don't like it when people challenge their narrative with facts.

3 years, that is the time that you have put yourself on fire to keep him warm. I get that you love him, but that will be a different story when he becomes a financial burden, that probably won't clean or do anything apart from Facebook. 

I would give him a last chance, tell him that things can't continue this way. Stuff needs to change if he wants to stay in the relationship. (Think about what you want from him. Obviously it shouldn't be more than a half of what a normal person does.) And you need to leave if he won't do so within 2 weeks , starting today.

"GalaxyA71","t5_2egc23","I'm a huge advocate for this phone since getting it (and using it A LOT) in April. Like the other guy said, what you get for the price is crazy good. My gf bought a brand new IPhone 11, so I was able to do a side by side of daily use, and it can hack it in literally every category against the likes of the 11.

Im always watching Twitch, or have it on in the background, on and off wifi, and the battery life is still amazing. I have a lot of downtime at my job so I'm usually on my phone, and this thing will last a whole 8 hours of constant use and still have juice left when I get home. Speaking of the battery, the ""super fast charging"" is phenomenal. At first, I assumed those were just some gimmicky buzzwords, but after draining the battery completely, I was back to 100 in roughly 45 minutes. Even when I'm not using a ""super fast charger"",  and using some random cord + my Apple 10w block, it still goes surprisingly fast.

Originally, I was on the fence about the plastic construction, for obvious reasons (my last Samsung was a J7 so....), but the build quality is great. To me, it feels just as good in the hand as an IPhone 11, but significantly lighter, and not in a bad way. It's still a super solid device. All that being said, mines been in the same case since day 1 so even if it was a little odd feeling, it wouldn't have swayed me away necessarily.

Another thing I was sorta iffy about was the in-screen fingerprint scanner. Again, I thought it was just a gimmic. But it works perfectly. I will say, the iPhone 11 does have quicker unlock in general, but especially the Face ID, but both are just millisecond differences.

All that being said, this is coming from someone whos been a diehard Apple fan since the 4. Obviously you can tell this is a toned down version of a flagship, but I don't think they cut corners in any of the wrong places, personally.",1598918453

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","&gt; Kyle Rittenhouse Shot First

*The actual sequence of events from the criminal complaint and video evidence.*

* Rittenhouse was running, retreating from a group of pursuers.

* Rosenbaum threw a weighted bag of trash at Rittenhouse from behind.  Rittenhouse turned, pointed his weapon at Rosenbaum (who halted temporarily) as a warning,* **but did not shoot.**

* Rittenhouse turned and retreated again.

* **One of Rittenhouse pursuers (trailing behind Rosenbaum) shot first... into the air.** The muzzle flash and the sound of the shot are visible in several videos and audio examination of the incident.  The sound of the first shot is distinctly different from the next four.

* Rittenhouse then became trapped between parked cars, Rosenbaum, and additional protestors.

* Rosenbaum again advances quickly, lunging at Rittenhouse. He tries to take the rifle.

*From the Criminal Complaint*

*McGinnis stated that the first round went into the ground and when the second shot went off, the defendant actually had the gun aimed at Rosenbaum. McGinnis stated he did not hear the two exchange any words.* **McGinnis said that the unarmed guy (Rosenbaum) was trying to get the defendant‚Äôs gun.** *McGinnis demonstrated by extending both of his hands in a quick grabbing motion and did that as a visual on how Rosenbaum tried to reach for the defendant‚Äôs gun. Detective Cepress indicates that he asked McGinnis if Rosenbaum had his hands on the gun when the defendant shot. McGinnis said that he definitely made a motion that he was trying to grab the barrel of the gun. McGinnis stated that the defendant pulled it away and then raised it. McGinnis stated that right as they came together, the defendant fired. McGinnis said that when Rosenbaum was shot, he had leaned in (towards the defendant).*

* 4 shots are fired. The first shot may have gone into the ground. Richard McGinnis , a reporter, who was standing behind and to the right side of Rosenbaum, was struck in the leg by debris. Subsequent shots strike Rosenbaum.  The additional protestors scattered.",1598918455

It's what most people use for a reason. CATIA is better if you're doing complicated, smooth flowing surfaces, but also harder to use, and hella expensive, even by CAD standards. Inventor is perfectly good if you're a student, get you a free copy. I actually do know people in industry who use onShape, it's very similar to SolidWorks. It's one big advantage is that it runs on mobile systems too, so you can look at or edit your models on the go. But, the free version has all your models public, so if that's an issue for you, be aware. 

In the end, honestly, SolidWorks, Inventor and onShape are all great, and everyone is generally pretty good with those. If you're any way computer or engineering savvy, switching between one to the other is very, very easy. Hell, even designing in Mastercam isn't awful, provided you've got the surfaces and solids packages. I would stay far away from sketch up though, I know people who've tried to go that route cause it's cheap and easy, but honestly it's awful for anything precision, and works very differently from standard CAD software.",1598918455

The reverse usually won't work because the 2032 is too ""thick"" to fit/stay in the battery holder.

In any case, I'd only do this if I was in a pinch and only until I could get the proper sized battery.  Because the 2025 is more likely to ""fall out"" or have other problems/issues, since it's not the size that the battery holder/compartment is designed to take/hold.

I picked up writing about 12 years ago and used [writing.com](https://www.writing.com/) a lot. It's got a great community and you can get some really good feedback and tips that you'd otherwise have to pay top dollar for. After starting out with some mediocre stories, I eventually got about a dozen stories published in various literary journals. You just have to compete against your last story and you get better all the time.

I haven't written much for 7 years or so, but this game has inspired me to get back into it. I ordered a laptop purely for writing (which comes on Wednesday) and I've got an idea for a TLOU fanfic to get me started.

"yugioh","t5_2rpe6","So I've been enjoying it so far. 

I'll say that Yuga definitely surprised me in that I went in expecting to hate him like the other two kid leads but I like the fact that he's basically Phineas if Phineas intentionally played the ugliest monster to ever walk the face of the earth.  

The rest of the core four I like to varying levels. I think Rook and Romin (weird loli shit aside) are the breakout hits of the show so far, whereas I don't think Gakuto is all that great, but the fact that I can say that about him instead of ""lol fuck him, send him to the Shadow Realm"" speaks clear about the level of character writing this season. 

As for the stuff I don't like...so they went on hiatus for six months after Vrains ended and aesthetically it looks pretty damn cheap. The Mons probably cost the same amount to make and barring some bad looking shots, they look a lot more professional than Sevens does even at its best. On top of that, the humor is very hit or miss. I can understand someone not liking the humor (it's also heavy on Japanese puns so that's gonna be a hurdle for the dub), but I did get some actual laughs here and there. Thankfully, YGO's diverse enough as a franchise that they can do stuff like a kid friendly anime and I'll atleast warm up to the idea eventually. 

Tldr; show's good, could be better. I want to bully Sevens Road Magician.",1598918456

"news","t5_2qh3l","They will be there only for the ""last mile"". The drone delivery is meant to be ""local""

The amazon truck will drive to a start point in a given neighborhood. The truck has a launchpad for one or more drones. Inside the truck there's an automated system to push out the next package to be delivered. When a drone is ready, it picks the next package. Drone grabs it, flys off for delivery, then comes back for the next package (or to swap batteries, or to be done) The drone has to travel at most a few miles. This way if something goes wrong, the driver can go investigate at the last known position (as retrieve the remains of the drone when, as other comments mentioned, it has been used for target practice). Or maybe there's another team with lighter vehicles charged with retrieving failed drones.

But on a normal day, you only have to pay for a guy to drive to the GPS given direction and sit there until the drones are done. Then come back to the distribution center for another load.

"Welding","t5_2serw","I have no idea, i built mine when i first started by copying a YouTube video and then as soon as stuff started selling i bought a dedicated metal saw.

You should go look at it in person tho, you've got to make sure there is no side to side play, because if there is your cuts won't be 90 degrees and you'll have large holes on one side.

Idk what do you have in USA, i've heard of Harbour Freight, go check out similar shops.

Or, if you are mechanically inclined, make yourself a stand like me. Go search up a YouTube video, and copy it to your liking.

Honestly if i was you i'd do freehand cuts for a while and invest money into steel, once you get some spare income buy a decent metal saw.
Abrasive saws are usually really expensive on per cut basis, for mine the cutting discs are $5-$7 a piece and on a good day i'll use up a full blade and then some. On your angle grinder stand it's only going to be worse, good quality cutting discs are like $2 a pop and you'll go through 10 a day easy.

Don't underestimate small stuff like this because it adds up quickly, for example when just starting out i'd make $20-$30 profit because i'd spend $30 on metal, $20 on consumables like electrodes, cutting discs, flap discs, paint etc, and you can't charge $200 for a pull-up bar you hacked at home when the store one is $140, so i'd post it for $70-$80 to stay competitive. 

And last, but not least, make some business cards saying you are a welder. Go do some small favours to people like weld something small for free then give them cards and ask to say a good word for you.

I've did three small jobs for free and then jobs came pouring in, kept the quality up good and good word spreads around fast. 

Left that stuff when i moved for my college, mostly because it was boring jobs like welding broken fences, gates and other stuff. Basically anyone can do it with 15 min of practice, and the pay was very little.

Then started the workout gear thing two years ago, it took like 6 months to catch grip but it was only going up from there, ended that when i earned enough to get my certificate and also buy a used car.",1598918458

"AnnArbor","t5_2r5tm","&gt; I don't have the numbers, but I'm willing to bet that the numbers of bike/ped incidents on sidewalks are far higher than the number of incidents where a car hits someone getting out of a parked car. Yes, the physics are worse for the latter type of incident; however, plenty of serious injuries (e.g TBI) have occurred due to bike/ped collisions (or due to accidents resulting from avoiding a collision).

If bike/peds are really that much higher, then that shows a high amount of stupidity with bicyclists. I ride my bike all the time for exercise and transportation, I've never hit a person walking on the sidewalk. You'd have to be a moron to hit somebody. I've seen bicyclists jump in front of the AATA bus too. It's unbelievable.

Visibility + communication 

bicylist + sidewalk pedestrian &gt;  upcoming car + parked passenger


&gt;Moreover, it is just a generally good idea to look before opening a car door and stepping out of a vehicle into the an active roadway. I learned how to do this when I was 4 - in rural America where street parking wasn't even a thing.

""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.""

Sometimes, bad things happen not because of people having bad intentions, but because they didn't think it through properly. Poor design choices are often made due to negligence and human error, but asshole designs are specifically engineered to exploit the user for profit. Try to think what the designer would gain from deceiving the user, and if it's likely to be an oversight on their part rather than an intentional design.

"fasting","t5_2s9dh","This is definitely not what you want to hear, but at your age the draw backs outweigh the benefits. You have to understand your body is still growing and developing. There is no shortage of data supporting the know fact that youths who suffer from poor nutrition have weaker endocrine systems, poorer brain function, and a predisposition to health complications later in life.

Personally, I would not recommend anyone under their mid-twenties to fast, as the frontal lobe can still be developing up through that point. And I do not know any responsible adult much less medical professional who would advise or allow a minor to water fast. You have to understand that fasting not only deprives your body of calories but also of nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and the like, which your body is in constant need of while in a developing state.

If you‚Äôre worried about your body composition, weight,or general health try learning and follow your macronutrientritional needs. Cook using whole, fresh ingredients. Practice mindfulness while eating. Learn a new sport or physical activity. Follow along with youtube workout videos. Just turn on some tunes and dance. And please understand that your physical needs as a teen are not the same as the physical needs of a fully developed adult. This is not a case of ‚Äòyou‚Äôre a kid so you‚Äôre not allowed to do this‚Äô the issue here is that your body is not a fully developed body and you are doing it no favors by fasting at this point in your life.",1598918459

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history.

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma.

My two (2) favourites are \[\[Unesh, Criosphinx Sovereign\]\] and \[\[Marwyn, the Nurturer\]\]. Both of them tap into my love for big but not infinite numbers.

Unesh gets ridiculous amounts of card advantage (especially when you get \[\[Spark Double\]\] out with Unesh to discount all your Sphinxes by 4 generic and two (2) Fact or Fiction-esque triggers per Sphinx). Win by crushing fools with big flyers or the typical mono-blue self-decking (\[\[Atemsis\]\] can get in on the action occasionally).

Marwyn gets ridiculous amounts of mana (since it is built around power boosting and untap cards to generate absurd amounts of mana with power-matters card draw). Win by stomping fools with the world's biggest elf or by showing people that mono green is the master of burn (with \[\[Hurricane\]\] or \[\[Squall Line\]\] plus \[\[Glacial Chasm\]\]).

I also have a \[\[Captain Lannery Storm\]\] deck but it gives me big depression because a dedicated Treasure matters deck is outdone by any deck with white in it, which only has a single Treasure-related card but it just so massively blows out all the other Treasure cards that I want to cry.",1598918461

"overlord","t5_2tvlr","&gt;If the greed kings can defeat the entire species of dragon lords, many of which who had powers like the dragon emperor who can summon entire realities, than So you really think the new world has more powerful entities than even a single player or two?

As Cure Elim Los Malvar is ranked below him, this highly suggests that the Dragon Emperor himself is higher in levels than that level 95 Dragon Lord(from the wiki).

Yes I believe there are entities more powerful than max level players by at least 5+ levels(if ECDL were so close to DE in levels the title would be meaningless).

The Greed Kings had max 3 WCIs:  Ainz Ooal Gown has eleven world items in their possession. Compared to other guilds, there was quite a gap, since the guild after them only had 3(from the wiki). 5 of them(at least) at any given moment were not immune to Wild Magic. PDL has not seen a Guild possessing two WCIs and he lives in their Base, meaning they very likely had only one.

&gt;This is a world where most of the dragons have been eliminated.

We have seen ONE continent and not the wider world, I could be right, you could be wrong. I choose to believe the world is richer than what we have seen.

&gt;You are making assumptions now.  
&gt;  
&gt;The greed kings did die from infighting the author confirmed it.  
&gt;  
&gt;You are making too much headcanon assumptions.

Yes i'm making assumptions, '(some of this is speculation)', as seen previously, you do not read the intention of the author. I hope this settles the confusion.

The Eight Greed Kings simultaneously killed each other, left no heirs(God-kin) or NPCs to manage their Base? I'd like your honest to God opinion on how that happened without outside interference.

&gt;They six players died to old age,  
&gt;  
&gt;The rest died to old age most likely, or were low level as we see with the DDDL.

You do not read properly. Surshana was an undead(ageless) killed by The Greed Kings. 'The rest who?'. Where is DDDL's level. Please read clearly.

&gt;The whole BS when infiltrating Nazarick no matter how much intel won‚Äôt get past a level 60+ summon.

What? 'A powerful frontliner, advanced knowledge of the New World and insider information on Nazarick from a turned Shalltear. How are these not loss conditions!?' No one is talking about infiltrating Nazarick, I am talking about NPC fighting styles, levels, strengths, weaknesses, hard counters, equipment, numbers, plans, goals. Information Shalltear is privy to. If they know how many WCIs are available and the NPCs Ainz favours they can plan hit and run tactics on vulnerably NPCs like the Pleiades. And after all you have said about Shalltear do you believe she can't handle a level 60+ summon???

&gt;Shalltear would swat Zesshi aside just like the captain it‚Äôs not the level that protected him, it‚Äôs his gear.

In one of Maruyama's tweets, he stated that Zesshi(level 60+) is stronger than Lupusregina Beta(level 59), one of the Pleiades(from the wiki). According to Clementine, it was stated that Ainz's superhuman physical abilities (without the use of 'Perfect Warrior' spell) were second only to Zesshi's and the Captain of the Black Scripture(from the wiki). As a level 100 magic caster, Ainz was quite confident that not only in terms of stats but skills and even tactics too, he estimated himself to be closely the equivalent of a level 33 warrior in comparison. Ainz is physically weaker than Zesshi. Ainz wasn't swat aside neither would Zesshi have been. 1 to 10 seconds more of guarding Kaire. Thats all it would have taken for complete domination.

&gt;Nazarick won‚Äôt be effected as it‚Äôs literally immune to wild magic and world items from within and the outside.

WCIs provide immunity to holders and protect Nazarick from divination they do not completely nullify other WCIs in their vicinity if so Ainz would not need to equip his orb to see through PDL's barrier as he was in Nazarick which you surmise is invulnerable to WCIs.

Ouroboros: It has the power to alter YGGDRASIL's game mechanism, in more ways than Five Elements Overcoming. This item once prevented Ainz Ooal Gown guild members from entering a certain area(could close off Nazarick, could weaken tier magic) .

&gt;Climb with the club would need to kill powerful opponents to level it up, so he could just be one shot before that happens.

World Savior: A club-shaped item, which is very weak in its initiatory stage, but gets stronger with time. It can become so strong that it could even conquer Nazarick with all the members of Ainz Ooal Gown combined(from the wiki). Go tell them you have figured it out and they are actually wrong. And it doesn't have to be Climb, it as well be ECDL.

&gt;Again, it‚Äôs doubtful most dragons know what world items even do, can use them

PDL as of volume 14 was stated to know of them, how they work and he possesses a book of all the known spells in the New World and Yggdrasil

&gt;How would Shalltear be a threat? Compared to Nazarick she is just climb, with better armor.

Ainz stated that if Shalltear attacked with her Einherjar, magic, skills and then blood frenzy, he would run away without second thoughts. Shalltear's character build and equipment place her in the lower portion of the top tier. His skill as a player aside, Ainz's character build could only be considered to be in the upper portion of the middle tier of all players. If Shalltear was fully equipped with divine-class items, she would be in the middle portion of the top tier. If Shalltear could change her gear to match her opponent, she might even be able to fight evenly with the upper echelons of the top tier. The Theocracy has the equipment of the Six Great Gods, they could customize her loadout. A fully prepared Shalltear will kill Ainz 1 v 1.

&gt;Albedo even with her squad or betrayal would be nothing in power compared to the full night of Nazarick, many features of which are in Ainz‚Äôs control. So her betrayal is useless; even then she would probably still fight the new world, capture and torture the dragon lords and essentially win in place of Nazarick.

The NPCs learn Ainz gave his approval to Albedo, Pandora's Actor and Rubedo to kill the other supreme beings and they would not mutiny? Their loyalty goes first to their creator then to Ainz. Ainz cannot confess to the NPCs that he was deceived and knew nothing. They would attack him and or Albedo. The Greed Kings fell to infighting, Nazarick is not invulnerable.

i'm not sure thats an apt comparison though. those racial and. homophobic slurs are inherently profane, or aggressive or offensive. the words ""all lives matter,"" are about as whole and moral as. you can have in a phrase. 

&gt;To ""commandeer"" the phrase, that means that people would first have to disassociate the phrase from the pain it causes them.

As far as I know, tape storage mediums are specially used for backing up (archival) purposes. They don't necessarily provide the speed and ease of use of the other two options.

Now since the offline options are out of the way, I would suggest visiting [PrivacyTools.IO](https://www.privacytools.io/) and checking out their recommendations for a good cloud service provider. Nextcloud is an option that pops in my head since it similar to what you're currently using.

Personally, I would encrypt the photos that are being backed up online. No matter which service it is, I prefer to have my data backed up.

Also, while a cloud service could be a good primary backup option. Consider having a fallback backup to an off-site location. For example, having monthly snapshots of the backup in a local HDD that you can remove after the backup so as to not induce unnecessary RW cycles.

Hm, interesting to think about. How does Inception compare to Minority Report, if we're talking about complexity.

I thought Minority Report definitely dealt with a difficult to understand topic (nothing crazy or unseen before, but it needed you to think along). However, the film did a really good job imo to keep the viewer informed without over explaining. 


I really liked Inception and I kinda like exposition dumps (weird thing to say, I know). But even given that, I wonder if Inception was harder to follow than Minority Report because the topic was more complicated or because it wasn't explained as well. Inception definitely was convoluted, by design too.",1598918464

"pics","t5_2qh0u","The Wisconsin law on self-defense that keeps you from using it while committing a crime does basically say that the crime has to be dangerous/threatening to others. So stealing a laptop from Walmart would probably not stop you from being able to use self-defense if someone then pulls a gun on you. But in this case his crime was the possession of the firearm itself, so its hard to say how the Wisconsin courts will decide.

This is why it is not cut and dry in this case. Arguably just possessing the rifle was not threatening to others, and so he may have a slight out... But I am just pointing out that he made it a lot harder to claim self defense because if someone legally able to possess the rifle did the exact same thing there would be no question whether this misdemeanor applies. Now there is a serious question, and if the courts say it does, then he won't succeed in his self-defense claim, and since that is an affirmative defense he will have already admitted to committing the crime, so he will be convicted.

As to your example, sadly it really depends. Check out this article on basically this topic:

Getting assessed and treated for ADHD can be such a painful process (and really very ADHD-unfriendly), and it sounds like they handled your case very gracelessly. They should have let you know up front if they don‚Äôt take patients with depression, or referred you to another practice that could help you.

TBH, I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôd be all that confident in an ADHD treatment center that isn‚Äôt equipped to handle anxiety and depression anyway. Like, I get, in general, declining to treat patients with conditions that you‚Äôre not qualified to treat, but ADHD is so commonly accompanied by anxiety and depression it seems bizarre to me that they would not treat patients with comorbid depression.

What are you looking for for treatment? Do you need to get a formal assessment? I have heard good things about adhddiagnosis.com, and I think they do medication-management too (though you probably should also look into CBT or something, since you probably have a bit of a backlog of traumas to process and coping mechanisms to unlearn).",1598918467

"SubSimulatorGPT2","t5_121sso","There was an article recently posted on reddit that said, ""Ayn Rand is dead but her ideas live on""

I think this documentary is as good a testament as any.  The film was incredibly well produced with a great storyline and is a good watch.  There are some people who would like to do what she did and make money off of her work but they are too ignorant to ever do the work to do it.

The fact is, no one can be an absolute authority on anything.  This film shows you how a person who came up with the philosophy of Objectivism has been used and abused by her followers.  The way she treated her employees and also treated her children is so horrible that she would have killed her own child and herself if she had not been killed by one of her employees. 

The film shows the power of money in the hands of those who think they know what's best for others and it is sad to watch.  

This film is not for everyone and there are some that don't want to watch it.  But it is a powerful documentary and I think it is a much needed wake up call for those who believe that capitalism is the best way to run a country.",1598918468

Further, are you rolling it exactly the same way with your hand 100% of the time? Are you rolling it on the exact same surface? Is that surface perfectly flat? I imagine all these things can affect the outcome of the die roll and there is simply no way to compensate for them.

"django","t5_2qh4v","Generally for this kind of thing, I use the User model to mean ""an account that can log in"", akin to a unix user where it's not synonymous with ""a person"". I've seen trying to overload the responsibility of the User model cause an inordinate amount of technical debt in a few different companies I've worked at.

So in your case, I'd model User, Employer and Applicant as independent models, with Employer and Applicant probably having an `associated_user` relationship. Also consider whether it truly makes sense for this to be a required field or one-to-one, or whether it's a temporary reality based on your current feature set.

Example of what I mean. At one job, we sold motor insurance, initially it was 1-1, so every user in the system was also a person being insured. Very quickly we realised that we couldn't handle scenarios such as buying insurance on behalf of other people, or getting quotes for people who hadn't yet registered an account. The problem is, by this point so much code was dealing with users when conceptually they just wanted a ""person to be insured"", that the task to clean it up became a 6+ month project.

Another example. A short term holiday rental company, we modelled every guest as a user, even though only the ""primary guest"" was someone who actually logged into and used our systems. Again, it created a big pile of technical debt that was a nightmare to clear up later.

There's the common wisdom to avoid over-engineering; but in my opinion, giving a lot of deep consideration to the semantics of your data model up front, doesn't fall into this category of engineering don'ts.",1598918469

"Pathfinder2e","t5_gkc60","One of my players is rolling up an Eldritch Trickster Rogue, and is going with the Ancestor Oracle path. Our question is, just how much is he affected by it's curse? 

On HeroLab, the summary says, 'You gain a mystery and it's minor effects.'

The dedication feat itself says, ' You gain the mild, constant effects of the mystery‚Äôs curse described in  its first paragraph, but not other effects the mystery usually grants'.

Going to the Ancestor's feat, it says the following under Curse:

 Curse of Ancestral Meddling:

 The ancestral spirits you commune with haunt you and meddle with your  belongings and actions, either out of a well-intentioned (but ultimately  detrimental) attempt to assist you, as punishment for your audacity in  circumventing the traditional means of achieving divine power, for their  own amusement, or a mixture of the above. Your hair, clothing, and  belongings constantly shift and stir, seemingly of their own volition.  


Minor Curse

 One of your ancestors becomes predominant in their meddling. The first  time you gain this effect each day, roll 1d4 on Table 2‚Äì4: Ancestral  Influence on page 75 to determine which type of ancestor becomes  predominant. This predominant ancestor guides you to use their preferred  type of action. When you try to use one of the types of actions listed  for the other ancestors, you must succeed at a DC 4 flat check. On a  failure, you spend the action but gain no effect (though you don‚Äôt lose  the spell if you were Casting a Spell). If your action would take 1  minute or longer, it‚Äôs long enough that you can overcome the meddling,  and you don‚Äôt need to attempt a flat check. During combat or another  tense, round-by-round encounter, other ancestors wrestle for control of  your actions. When you roll initiative, and then at the end of each of  your turns during the encounter, roll 1d4 and change your predominant  ancestor appropriately. Once the encounter ends, you return to the  influence of the ancestor you first rolled for the day. 

&amp;#x200B;

So does that mean he gets the minor curse, and has to roll a ton of extra dice (he has no problem with this if it turns out to be so), or is the first paragraph that the dedication feat refers to the fluffy description paragraph, and his Tengu just gets a mysterious air about him with constantly ruffling feathers? Which also works, as he's going for a ninja personality, and he can just say that Sakura blossoms blow past him during tense, dramatic moments.",1598918469

"TheOwlHouse","t5_g53v4","1.) From a meta perspective, Amity‚Äôs character arc for this season was concluded at the end of episode 17. She transitioned from a lonely bully who didn‚Äôt feel like she fit in anywhere, to a person who finally had a place where she felt unconditionally accepted. There *will* be further development for her, particularly regarding her relationship with Luz/Eda/the Owl Crew vs her parents expectations, but *that* is something that needs a lot more room and time to develop and explore, which will be next season. 

2.) Also from a meta perspective, the finale was focused on specifically mirroring the premiere episode and how the core ‚Äúfamily‚Äù of Luz/Eda/King has developed. This is made even clearer by returning to the Conformatorium, and mirroring lines (‚ÄúUs weirdos need to stick together‚Äù). It also contrasts the found family against Lilith, the blood family. It is wrapping up the curse and Lilith storylines. 

3.) Luz is extremely clever in how she applies her glyph magic, and it‚Äôs clear she‚Äôs been practicing a lot off-screen (as you would expect from the strength of her desire to be a witch). We consistently see her getting stronger and more resourceful with her glyphs every time we see them. Plus she was *extremely* motivated by her anger this episode. 

4.) She was never anything close to a match for Belos. He was toying with her the whole time, not really providing a serious challenge, and she was barely holding her own. He had an end goal in mind - he wanted the portal key from Luz. He didn‚Äôt care about ‚Äúbeating‚Äù her. He was wasting her time, waiting until Eda was about to be petrified to ‚Äúforce‚Äù the decision. He *did* manage to be overconfident and that was what allowed Luz to damage him slightly. But it was about the level of all the Avengers going all out and only managing to slightly injure Thanos.",1598918469

"VaushV","t5_10to4u","TL;DR: It was a short distance from Channel Awesome to Lindsay Ellis to philosophy tube and then to Vaush, it only took about 4 years lol.

So it‚Äôs actually kinda similar to my descent into chuddery. I became very interested in online reviews and started watching Channel Awesome and the like, but similarity in the subject matter being reviewed lead me on to The Bible Reloaded (now Hannah and Jake) and YMS and it was from there that I started watching Armoured Skeptic, Shoe, TJ Kirk and Chris Ray Gun (I was a hardcore edgy atheist att). From there I started watching Sargon, Teal Deer, Blaire White, Christina Sommers and Jordan Peterson. The Red Pill doc existing also pushed me in. I think what eventually pulled me out as the fact that I was becoming outwardly edgy in unfunny ways and downright bigoted at times and there was social pressure for me to cut that shit out. Also, as time went on, Sargon and Teal Deer just came across as boring windbags and I unsubbed. 

To make it clear I was always a Bernie guy and I never went alt right, although I would engage in apologia for them. I was always interested in media critique, though. And I started watching more and more of Lindsay Ellis‚Äô content, I cringed at the ‚Äúwoke stuff‚Äù but I eventually started actually listening to the things Ellis had to say and that pushed me leftward. Quinton Reviews and Sarah Z were also a part of that, but to a lesser extent.

My change from being permissive of the alt right to being actively against it, surprisingly came from Kraut (formerly Kraut and Tea). He started doing science debunk videos of ‚Äúrace realism‚Äù and even though he still talked about the ‚Äúdangers of antifa‚Äù this was a good jumping off point for me.

Also, this is going to sound cringe, but Bill Maher and John Oliver actually helped push me leftward. Bill was how I knew about Sanders before he‚Äôd announced his run in 2015 (I actually called him running back in 2014, but I digress). And Oliver always has good research.

Eventually what got me into leftism was the Philosophy Tubes videos on Abortion and Sex Work. I already agreed with Ollies conclusions, but it was my first introduction to lefty argumentation. The nail in the coffin for me was his video on the Ideology of Antifa.

I also had to research Marxism for an AP Econ class and I learned about the labor theory of value. I then started wathing Vaush vods bc rational wiki said that he was edgy, I shit you not. Vaush then filled in the blanks on what socialism could potentially look like and the virtues of anarchism down the line.

I‚Äôve also somehow written this pile of words without mentioning my involvement with the online Magic the Gathering community and the effect of the ousting of the Quartering from the game as well as my slow radicalization by Rhystic Studies (particularly in regards to the male gaze) and particularly Spice8Rack.

I‚Äôm now an Econ student at University known for its neoliberal Econ dept (kill me) and I hope to research worker co-ops. Either that or write music.",1598918470

"Braves","t5_2s0ok","I agree with you. It looks to be a case of ""perfect is the enemy of good,"" where AA wants an absolute no brainer fleece of a deal when he could easily get a deal that somewhat favors the Braves. No way in hell should we have given up Waters and Anderson. If that was the ask, kick rocks other Native American team.




But to say we have ""at least 7 [starting pitchers] waiting in the wings"" is looking to be an overstatement. If guys were close, this would be the time for them to get starts and show they're close. Between Touki, Wright, Ynoa, and Wilson, none of the group has looked ready. At some point, you have to decide enough is enough and try to maybe salvage some trade value. For every Mike Soroka and Max Fried, you're going to have a few Kolby Allards, some Sean Newcombes, and a bunch of the other Braves pitching busts we've seen in the last decade. Good pitching staffs are hard to draft and develop yourself, that's why the recent trend among MLB teams is to develop hitters and sign pitchers. Just look at teams like the Nats, Astros*, Cubs, Red Sox, and Royals who have all been successful recently with FA pitching.",1598918470

In the game universe, the way the black market works is probably that the pirates know where to *get* the items, and will acquire them for you (for a suitable price), but don't *physically possess* the items themselves. They fall off the back of a hovertruck, wink wink, when you pay to have them acquired.

('The pirates' probably also serves to elide the extreme disorganization of the various bandits and warlords and petty crooks who range from 'have sometime access to a few barely-functioning mechs' all the way to 'have taken over a small moon'. The churn has to be huge, with unsuccessful bands and gangs being wiped out and replaced regularly, successful bands laundering their Periphery criminal pasts and becoming bonded mercs if they get enough good hardware and the techs to run it together.)",1598918471

When I was younge I was involved in a massacre, I wasn't in the massacre itself, it just happened around the area we lived at back in my home country. I saw people die in front of me, bleed and cry and shout. I was 13 and I couldn't really understand what's happening and I don't remember much. One thing I do remember was the feeling of being uselss and unhelpful how these were hurting so much but I couldn't help or share the pain. Rather I was inside my house and my mom had us just sorta sit there and not move because she was scared of bullets coming flying inside our apartment. Even though she was scared she let people into our house to escape the shootings, and after a while she went out to donate medical supplies when the shooting dwindled down. She took me with her, I still don't know why she took a 13 year old boy with her. But I think my mom was traumatized and she thought she was going to die doing that, I guess she wanted her son along side her? She herself was a pharmacist so I guess she couldn't bear to just watch. We went and we found a safe route to get close to give supplies to the temporary hospital that was set up.

Disclaimer that this might be a little subjective but I personally think that the album [Face](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL29xIKnF2tHEd_yp8k6G76I9fMCoEWKHr) by Key has some songs with similar vibes. Specifically speaking, [Chemicals](https://youtu.be/eLhf-SuH7ZY) and [Honest](https://youtu.be/Z-45NMi41CM) (imo)? I'll also add that even though [One of those Nights](https://youtu.be/TZWSW90lybM) and [I Will Fight](https://youtu.be/rVb1T42Yrs4) doesn't necessarily have a sound similar to Troye's, they're absolute bops and you could definitely recommend (I Will Fight has a couple of rap verses so just a head's up if your friend doesn't vibe with rap).

Avocado oil under a hair cap (8-10 caps per pack at dollar tree!) every couple of weeks will help as well.

It might be the salons I frequent, but I am very picky about going to an inclusive salon.

&gt; WASHINGTON - A former friend and adviser of Melania Trump says it was &amp;quot;The worst mistake of my life&amp;quot; to work for President Donald Trump and his family, lashing out at the first lady for not defending her over questions about costs for the presidential inauguration she helped produce.

&gt; Wolkoff, a New York-based event planner, said the pair first met in 2003 in the hallways of Vogue magazine, where Wolkoff worked.

&gt; Wolkoff also offered an explanation for widely viewed Inauguration Day footage of Mrs. Trump smiling - then sharply frowning - after Donald Trump turned around to smile at her on the platform.

But... but...but my mother did some social work... Cool. But who cares?

A bit, but at the end of the day they are still unemployed and living off 70$ a month. Do you think they are scared of a disease? They are scared of having no food, no electricity or water and thats why we see buses with 40\~50 people, many times with no maks or using it wrong.

"gay","t5_2qhef","Honestly most people fall somewhere in the middle of the Kinsey Scale. He may have some same sex attraction leanings. This doesn't mean that he would want to act on them, just that there is a part of him that enjoys intimacy whether a person is a boy or a girl. The only way to know for sure is if he tells you or increases to more sexual actions. My main caution would be to not do anything sexual with him while he is drunk. Alcohol lowers peoples' inhibitions and people will do things drunk that they wouldn't do sober. If things go too far, it could make him very uncomfortable when he sobers up and ruin your friendship. If you start catching feelings, it might be a good idea to discourage him from getting too intimate as it can really hurt to have some intimacy from someone you want without being able to go further. 

Otherwise, good luck and hope things work out one way or the other.",1598918476

It sounds like the type of life she was living wasn't her own and she wasn't recieving meaning or happiness from it, along with what I see as an unhealthy and nihilistic fear of death, so she left and found a sense of community and belonging somewhere else. I don't think she was wrong to do that, people should be able to choose not to live a gay lifestyle if they don't want to. BUT, likewise, someone should be allowed to live a gay lifestyle if they want to without being condemned for it. 

And if God is opposed to it then God should answer their prayers to ""take the gay away"" when people come to God on their knees, humble before God and begging for redemption. But God doesn't do that. People don't get to choose to not be gay, not even with God's help. Not everytime. But, even if you're right and being gay ends in hell, which I don't personally believe at all, your condemnation is still just judgement on your part (which is condemned in the bible many more times than homosexuality is) and it's cruel.

Since Mikyx interview said that they pretty much figured out how FNC plays this week, and so they already know what to do in final game, he says it will be a quick 3-0 once again against us. 

I can only hope we can cheese them. If they ban Evelynn/Hecarim (which they will) I hope we answer well with Gragas/Elise/Sylas/Taliyah (even I am thinking Vi/WW/Shyvana would be viable and surprising for G2 maybe).

There is no evidence that Trump colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election. There is no evidence that Obama colluded with Russia to win the 2012 presidential election. Though there was no investigation into the 2012 election, there was an investigation in regards to the 2016 election. 

The baseline standard I want to talk about is how things are represented. The standard of evidence proving a crime is obviously being upheld by the people performing investigations into such matters. If you were to look at the news or reddit there is a different standard being presented. This leads to news articles and social media posts titled...

""As it turns out, there really was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia""
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/08/19/yes-there-was-collusion/

""Senate Russia report proves Trump collusion was very real. But do voters care?""
https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/senate-russia-report-proves-trump-was-wrong-mueller-was-right-ncna1237743

""Oh, Wait. Maybe It Was Collusion.""
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/opinion/donald-trump-russia-collusion-cia.html

And many, many more.

In my opinion, if Trump were to make that same statement caught in a hot mic this week to Putin what everyone digests on the internet would be a very, very different story than it was in 2012. Will we ever know? We won't. The point I am making is that if anyone doesn't raise their eye brows over an interaction caught on video and recorded like we saw, but raises hell about Trump colluding with Russia then their opinion is moot. Equality, fairness, standards, transparency. With what we know of the accusations aimed at Trump in regards to collusion, and what we know and saw of the interactions Obama had with Russia during an election year in my opinion one is more egregious than the other. Especially considering any person that ""dig around geopolitics as a hobby"" would know that Russia wasn't totally benign when it came to interfering with our democratic policy up until 2016. 

In fact, on r/conspiracy I find it interesting that the Obama administration policy during their last four years in office in regards to Russia isn't analyzed deeper. In the beginning they make a mockery of Russia being a threat. Their administration stretched our military further and cut it deeper than any other in recent memory. If we just talk about funding cuts than Clinton would be part of the discussion. The fact that during the last four years of Obama they were not only cut but pushed to a breaking point operationally is interesting, considering the warning calls during that administrations last year in office of near peer adversaries.

All that aside. Knowing what we know, that Russia hasn't been a benign actor during the American democratic process and presidential elections since the 1950's, it is amazing that one President can literally tell the leader of a nation known to interfere with our elections that he would have more ""flexibility"" if he won the election, and escaped a single collusion aspect. 

The comment I was responding to was, ""This doesn't make a big difference. The emails leaked, the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia exists, so what if the source was an internal leak?""

What were you implying with that statement? To me it appears that this response in regards to the subject matter being discussed is to imply that Trump colluded to win the election. When there is no evidence beyond having a relationship. If we were to use the same standard of ""having a relationship"" equaling collusion, with no actual knowledge of the content of that relationship and apply it to the administration that cried wolf about interference and collusion (Side note, how come the incumbent administration didn't do a better job of preventing a foreign nation from interfering with our elections? It isn't a big deal until the wrong person wins the election?) then I would say that tiny interaction we're talking about exponentially shows a higher degree of evidence of ""collusion"" than people meeting in a hotel. 

""The relationship exists"" If I am mistaken in my interpretation please feel free to clarify what you were implying. What does the relationship existing prove? Why doesn't it matter if the DNC (a private entity, not a government organization) was hacked or if there was an internal leak merely because there was a ""relationship"" between members of Trumps campaign team and Russians? 

Where does the baseline end? How low does it go? How come we don't hold every candidate or incumbent to the same standard? What degree of interference in your opinion should nullify election results? What is the baseline evidence you require before collusion exists? Do you apply your opinion of the standard across the board equally?",1598918477

All of them.

&gt; You look past the blood and the cut on his finger.

I don't see how this speaks to intent at all. Could be equally true of murder or manslaughter.

&gt; You look past the lies. 

Ditto.

&gt; You look past the violent history. 

A criminal background is incredibly weak circumstantial evidence of intent.

&gt; You look past the odd way he arranged her arrival. 

Giving the owner's name wasn't odd, so I guess you're talking about the call block? Again, incredibly weak circumstantial evidence to show he intended to commit murder.

Yet, again, you think someone signing a document off half a decade isn't proof they intended to sign the document off half a decade. How can you possibly believe that is an equal standard?

Can you honesty tell me a 17 year old with a history of Anti-BLM and far far right media consumption illegally acquired an assault rifle and crossed state lines without the intent to Intimidate and Threaten the protesters? 

Let me ask you this: if you had a pistol for protection, and there was an immature, conservative wack job waving a gun in your face you wouldn‚Äôt feel the slightest bit intimidated? There is precedent (set by fucking cops of course) to use force preemptively if you feel your life is in danger. Rittenhouse went to Kenosha with the intent of stirring up protestors, and when he threatened the wrong person, he weaseled up like the pathetic teenager he is, and killed them crying ‚Äúself defense‚Äù.

He's also had about 40 years in the Senate which of course is a huge amount of power. We're supposed to believe that I guess in year 50 to 54 of his political career somehow everything is going to change and get better. The same exact thing can be said for Kamala Harris. She was one of the most powerful people in California and California is going down the drain rapidly. It takes a skilled politician to light a house on fire and then claim only they can put it out.

* Aftertaste: long - a large part of the enjoyment for me is the way flavors evolve from the first sip through the aftertaste
* Flavors: earthy, nutty, unsweetened cocoa, floral, vegetal 
* Astringency: high
* Sweetness: low
* Bitterness: I don't shy away from it but it isn't too important

I think there is some merit in the idea that someone is using a non-trivial (but still clumsy) rewriting tool - compare the Bestway News article [here](https://bestwaynews.com/2020/08/31/police-kicked-first-aid-kit-away-as-patriot-prayer-member-died/) to the Daily Mail article [here](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8682399/Portland-SWAT-team-kicked-volunteer-medics-aid-kit-away-dying-Patriot-Prayer-member.html) and you see ""right-wing"" in the Daily Mail source being variously translated as ""appropriate-wing"" and ""suitable wing"" in the Bestway copy.

The Disclaimer page linked in the footer goes to ""Terms and Conditions"" text that sufferes from exactly the same issue - thus putting to bed any notion that they are actually doing this to provide news, because you imagine that they would at least take that seriously. I think it is likely that even that text has been lifted from somewhere else.

I looked through each of the ""header"" areas to see if there were any trends:

* **News:** A variety of content, no clear trends

* **Politics** Seemed to lean rightwards but that may be because a big proportion of the articles are lifted from FOX (they don't even remove the ads for the FOX app from the text and use the FOX-branded images). Not exclusively though - I found at least 1 Reuters article in there as well.

* **Business** and **Financials** look pretty similar, a variety of sources including Bloomberg, Reuters, NY Post

* **Exclusives** is mainly celebrity news with the odd domestic crime story (maybe classification errors from whatever system is copying the stories)

* **Technology** is weirdly a mix of regular news article copies but also copies from sites which have hybrid news/tech support content

* **Health and Biotech** is basically a list of stock alerts for various unheard of biotech companies - feels like the feed was hooked up to those autogenerated articles on some ""investment"" sites that basically convert the public trading data for a company into an article.

I still don't have a much clearer idea of what the site is for. Perhaps recycling content so that people can share articles via SM but launder it under another media brand? So articles don't get quickly shot down on Twitter for coming from FOX news etc.",1598918479

"pics","t5_2qh0u","The interpretation of ayat is a process of its own that has rules, if the aya in question is not explicit, then it is the turn of Sunna to ezplain it, what did the prophet do or say about it, or in Parrallel to it, or adjacent to it, in a way that will explain it and take off the ambiguity from it.

I am sure that you are not an Islamic scholar, nor do I, nor do the Imams that take liberties in explanations without making a distinction or reference to the strenght of the hadith or the riouaya of Sunna concerning it. 

Yes, in the same book, yet the same book has a classification of strenght and does mention also weak hadiths and why they are weak, in order to avoid confusion. So having it in the same book is still not synohmous of veracity.
Note also, that the variations of weak hadiths are more often than not, numerous, even more than strong hadiths. (the prayer and ablutions examples).
For foundations of Islam like prayer, the prohet Mohammed always took care of being explicit in his sayings and doings about them, so there will be no door open for interpretation, which further down the line, is conciliation with the principle and practice of Naskh.

If no mention in Coran then there is no need for interpretation, explanation, desambiguation, nor clarification.

Because interpretation is a full theological practice, not a belief practice, it has a hierarchy of rules, on the top of the hierarchy is the Coran. If something is mentioned in Coran, the interpreter have to look for the interpretation in Coran first, in another aya, or another soura. If nothing is found then Sunna, a deed reported by trusted contemporaries ( rule here, a group of people that cannot agree on anything false nor wicked and attribute it to the prophet), and the process continues until hitting on weak hadiths for hints and a circling of the interpretation sphere ""i7ata"". 

Concerning the studies at schools, and Imam opinions, to the extent of my knowledge and experience, any male scholar can become an Imam but not every Imam can become a scholar. And because Islam is one of the most politicized religions on Earth, interpretation is starting to get lost to political opinion. 

To go even further, in respect of Islamic theological principles, analysing a religious text, practice, or belief is not a linear process, more of a multidimensional one, hence the diversity in outcomes, in doctrines, and ways ""tari9a"". The assumption of Muslims that the Coran haven't been altered is stemming from this strong tradition of rigourous interpretation of Islamic texts, from Coran to *sahih* or book interpreting Sunna, and the codification of the results, and cross examining the results between reputable scholars that cannot agree on something false or wicked. 
A simple example would be something clear in the Coran, everybody agrees on it, but still will go and check the Sunna and its interpretation, and the sahih for the interpretation of one of the four Imams about the same subject, so nothing will remain loose. That is for something clear that everybody agrees on, so I let you do the math for something that has little to no consensus. 

Also, since it is a complex categorization, there are still subjects in gray areas, or dismissed but finding a new life in our contemporary times, which leads to reinterpretation, or reconsideration for a new theological debate/research. 

I didnt say its litterature, I said without conciliating the foundational requirements of being mentioned in the Coran, which speaks extensively of the judgement day, but strangely omits any mention of the return of a protagonist that will play a major role, aside of the prophet Mohamed that will have the privilege of ""chafa'a"" which is asking god to forgive all Muslims of their sins, and the other principle of being adressed directly and without ambiguity by the prophet Mohammed himself during his living. 

Concerning the perceived aggravation, its more of a  reaction I have when a conversation moves from the subject to an *ad hominem* analysis and subjective generalizing rhetoric. I am not always right, and when I am wrong, I like it to be about the *proper* subject, not my person, or the interlocutor's person.

One of his early books suggested companies stop paying for office supplies and give staff a bonus in their pay check to let them buy their own.

Sure it‚Äôs great that I get an extra $10 a check, but then it turns out that Bob won‚Äôt share his post-it notes so screw useful interaction like planning our team schedule for the year on a wall. Not to mention that companies can bulk order stuff.

In the years since I read that book I also went through a company that didn‚Äôt buy office supplies and now work for one that just has a cabinet of the stuff.

Ned knew of the debts and to who they were owed, yet somehow the Iron Bank kept lending to a king deeply in debt, whose own family holdings were paltry to the sums he was taking out.  Why?  Because they counted on the Queen's family paying for Robert's excess, and Tywin knew it.  He couldn't control Robert's spending.  He couldn't prevent the Iron Bank from lending more and more gold, and yet, if he let Robert or later, his grandsons, default, and the Iron Bank chose to back a new claimant, House Lannister was sure to be annihilated due to Cersei being the wife (if it's during Robert's reign), or mother (in Joffrey or Tommen's time on the throne), of the defaulting king.   Heck, Tywin even paid off Aerys debts a few times when he was Hand of the King.

My general suggestion is to focus on building your emergency fund and ensuring that you can get through university with as little loans as possible. Remember that nobody plans for things like family troubles or whatever to cause them to lose financial support, and having enough money set aside to ensure you are set is a huge thing to your piece of mind.

"Wreddit","t5_2sq92","A little bit of fantasy booking regarding the Shayna/Nia  tag team championship. Hear me out, tell me what you think....

Shayna has been saying for about a month now that as soon as there was a definitive Raw Women's champion, she'd be coming after them. Asuka took that title, literally and figuratively, and Sasha shouldn't be on Raw anymore now that she is no longer Tag Champ, so I'd say we've reached that point. So what now? Do we have to sit through another tag team champion reign that is focused more on the singles title? I don't think so. 

With how hyped up Nia is being a champion, and how cocky Shayna is as a whole, I can see one or both of them laying out an open challenge in the coming weeks, maybe even tonight. They may get through the IIconics or Riott Squad or an NXT team just to prove their resolve in staying together, but I think there's a team a lot of people are sleeping on right now that can really tie this storyline together.

Marina Shafir and Jessamyn Duke. They made their debut a couple weeks ago as part of Raw Underground, showing their might before being run off by Nia. And before that happened, they were seen backstage talking to Shayna. What better way to get Shayna out of the tag title picture while keeping her strong for the singles title than having her just pass the titles on to her running Mates. Have her abandon Nia before the match to defend herself, and ultimately lose.

Shayna eventually wins the Raw women's title, which could lead to some interesting Horsewomen stuff down the road depending on if/when Ronda and Becky return",1598918482

"LoriVallow","t5_2eiusg","Good question.  

The term ""mental state"" is a legal term of art, so in this context, it has a specific definition.  ""Mental state"" refers to the element of a crime (something that must be proven) that requires some level of consciousness.  The required mental states are usually, words like knowingly, intentionally, and willfully. Mental states with slightly less culpability are things like recklessly or negligently.  

In most states, mental disease or defect is used as a defense - the same as something like self-defense, or alibi.  In other words, but for the existence of the defense, the defendant's actions would have been a crime, but because of their mental disease or defect, the crime is excused.  In those states, the attorney would say that the defendant's actions were excusable because they were unable to understand the consequence of their actions or were unable to conform their conduct to the law.  

Idaho doesn't allow mental disease or defect as a defense.  In Idaho, the only way to use mental disease or defect is for the attorney to say that their client is so mentally ill that they lacked the ability to form the necessary mental state to do something knowingly or intentionally or wilfully.  It may seem a little like angels dancing on the head of a pin, but Idaho law does narrow the opportunity for the defense.  I think it's a lot harder to prove that your client couldn't have ""knowingly"" committed the crime rather than to say yes, my client committed the crime, but he was unable to understand the consequences or to conform his conduct to the law.   I hope I explained it. It's admittedly a nuanced part of legal theory.  Please let me know if you have other questions.  Cheers.",1598918482

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","I'll chime in here with some of my favorites.  1.  I know this isn't little known but you have to track your calories.  Some people might call this obsession, but with today's technology it only takes a second and really just opens your eyes to how much you are really eating.

2.  Meal prepping is a godsend.  If you are serious about your weight loss put in the time to prep your meals.  Take the things you love to eat, find ways to make it lower in total calories and make a bunch of it.  this rolls into my third tip.

3.  Be comfortable eating like a dog.  Dogs eat the same thing everyday and they are always happy to eat it.  Find the foods you like and fir in your caloric windows and lean on them.

4.  You don't have to love what you eat every meal of every day.  When i'm going down the rabbit hole of when i'm gaining weight it seems like i'm treating every meal as if i'm on vacation.  I don't want that oatmeal for breakfast, I want a waffles and sausage!  One meal leads to the next and your down the rabbit hole.

5.  Lastly, I've found that the first meal you eat really sets the tone for the day.  When i eat a shitty breakfast, the rest of the day follows suit.  I like to do three scrambled eggs for breakfast or 2 eggs and 2 slices of bacon.  This fills me up and keeps me full past lunch and the total is under 300 calories.

6.  Bonus food tips:  Mission carb balance soft taco wraps (70 calories each) simply white cheddar cheetos (160 calories per 32 peices), put 6 chicken breasts and a jar of salsa in a crock pot, low for 8 hours shred and serve over brown rice.  Easy chipotle bowl for around 300 calories.  Sugar free jello and low fat reddi-whip for sweet snacks when needed.

"WorldOfYs","t5_36gbb","Ys VI basically established everything that the modern series stands on today, such as the ""Three Elements,"" that to this day is much loved and adored;

* The Three Swords of Napishtim
* The Three Bracelets of Felghana
* The Three Artifacts of Darm
* The Three Attributes of Altago, Celceta, Seiren, and Balduq

Even after the solo system was canned in Seven in preference to the party system, the Three Elements System got integrated as The Three Attributes that works impressively well. Lore-wise, I feel that VI sets as a base for the Clan of Darkness to expand through Ernst, a fact that permeated through subsequent remakes and releases.

If you really want to go through Adol's adventures in order then I'd suggest.

* Ys I and II - Where everybody should really start.
* Ys Origin - This can be played at any point to be honest, but I suggest that you'd play this just to flesh out I &amp; II and should serve as a flashback of sorts.
* Ys IV Memories of Celceta - Literally happened right after I &amp; II
* Ys III The Oath in Felghana - A few years after Ys IV, my favorite and the best one IMHO.
* Ys V The Lost Sands of Kefin - No remakes yet, although the bump system was replaced by the hack-n-slash mechanic. Has one of the best story there is, be careful of its pacing though.
* Ys VIII Lacrimosa of Dana - Happened right after Ys V
* Ys VI The Ark of Napishtim - They were on their way to Ys VII but you know what happened.

This is an interesting problem.  Pinging /u/enchantedmangoicepop, who might be able to chime in.

&gt; I do believe i‚Äôm at risk for developing an eating disorder

If you feel comfortable doing the research, I wonder which eating disorder you think you might be at risk for, and why.

&gt; But i think that I will talk to a doctor because this isn‚Äôt healthy at all and if it gets worse that‚Äôs even more concerning.

Agreed.

For now, I would suggest:

*  Take a **daily multivitamin**, together with the highest-fat meal of each day.  Adult multivitamins are better than child multivitamins. Chewable or swallowable tablets or capsules are much better than gummies; but gummies are much better than nothing.

*  Book an appointment with **a doctor**.  They might refer you to a specialist.

I'm curious when was the last time that a doctor weighed you. I'm also curious whether or not they were concerned about your weight at the time.

Oh yeah.  Also.  Many people with disordered eating are younger than age 20.  If you are, too, please always use a [young people's BMI calculator](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/bmi/calculator.html), not an ordinary BMI calculator.",1598918482

What if your life was similar to the life of a typical farm animal? They in general live horrendous lives, and are treated merely as a means to an end. Cows on dairy farms are often forcibly inseminated, and bulls are sometimes anally penetrated with a device called an electro-ejaculator, which is shoved inside their anus and used to give them an electric shock, forcing them to ejaculate via prostate stimulation. The sperm is then used to forcibly impregnate cows. The cow's offspring is taken away and used for veal, and when her milk production slows down, she will be slaughtered at about a quarter or a half of her natural lifespan. These are all easily verifiable matters of fact, not my opinion or idea.

"CoronavirusUK","t5_2f3oes","The often repeated line about young people now getting the virus seems to be fairly accurate but it's an oversimplified assessment of it, as young people were always getting the virus. They weren't being tested, sure, but I don't think the disparity between 'cases' and 'deaths' is the interesting - and potentially hopeful - point. The thing which is intriguing, and somewhat of a mystery, is why deaths are falling to such an extent.

Could it be the case that old people are better protected? I think it's doubtful on a large scale as families are mixing fairly freely. I think it's more likely to be a combination of factors such as mask wearing reducing the viral load, a greater degree of immunity, the sad fact that many of the most vulnerable have already succumbed to the virus and, quite probably, the virus mutating to become weaker.

Hopefully we see more on this but I don't think highlighting that young people are getting it now really explains the issue. Obviously they themselves are less likely to die from it but as people are mixing more freely today than anytime since before lockdown, what's stopping the virus from being just as fatal as it was before? There has to be other things at play here than it merely being about age. 

Hopefully there is more evidence to say that the virus has mutated. That'd be the dream scenario.",1598918484

*****
&gt; USPS is facing an effort to force it to make public its performance data, with the aim of demonstrating the depths of the current mail delays that Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has admitted have accelerated in recent weeks.

&gt; The effort to obtain data comes as the Postal Service is fending off at least a dozen lawsuits around the country looking to block changes DeJoy has put into place, including one states-led effort that has been fast tracked in federal court.

&gt; The Justice Department, arguing in support of the Postal Service and against expedited discovery, had said much of the information would be coming out &amp;quot;Imminently&amp;quot; anyway and the plaintiffs&amp;#039; request was overly broad. The court rejected those arguments and gave USPS 10 days to produce its data.

"sissyology","t5_3d635","Sissies are fairly niche. Observing the ratios on the most popular hookup app (Grindr) we can see that ""feminine presenting"" accounts are fairly rare. They're further subdivided into: trans, crossdressers, sissies, and femboys. 


So sissies are a sub-group of a sub-group. 



What is a sissy? I think the easiest definitions are these,


1) A sissy is a boy who wants to be sexually seen as a girl. 


2) A sissy embodies the caricature of a feminine submissive slut. 



Having met quite a few sissies/crossdressers/trans girls/femboys/gay bottoms, I feel comfortable saying that sissies are an unique group. Right, some crossdressers still want to be seen as a man. Some trans girls do not their femininity/womanhood to be fetishized.  


But some trans girls (like my girlfriend) think of themselves as sissies. 


Think of all the sissy pornography. The captions, the hypnos, the PMVs, the erotica.  Sissyhood always has a strong focus on being ""A good girl"" a submissive, easy access hyper sexual slut. 


The mantras are easy to recall,


***Dress up***


***Put on your makeup***


***Suck cock***


***Be Sexy***


***Suck cock***


***Be pretty***


***Suck cock***


***You're a faggot***


***Suck cock***



Sissyhood is that admixture of being a faggot cocksucker/anal whore who dresses up and becomes a girl. Not necessarily trans but definitely a girl.



Some sissies want to be emasculated boys. They want to be seen as a boy *but* treated as if they were a girl. Have the patheticness of their position pointed out, that kind of thing.",1598918485

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","This is the complicated part, and I'm sorry your family had to endure that. This is the only good reason for wanting it taken down. 

His actions here are indefensible, but IMO he is important enough to warrant a statue. My reasoning for this is complicated, it basically comes down to what was acceptable, common practice/knowledge, and other social ideas of the time. We can't say for sure if he would have turned out the same if had the same thoughts if he was indicted with modern social behavior. He is seen as had a positive impact on the country because he helped create it, and that is enough to have people celebrate him. To some his actions warrant the removal and to some they warrant the keeping.

I think the bigger question is how is Canada supposed to honor its history. The answer to this is going to differ quite a bit, but IMO his statue, should it be surrounded by the good and bad he did, should remain up. To me it is a symbol of how Canada began and where we are now, point out how we have evolved and changed our social behaviors. I don't celebrate him, I celebrate his action of creating and expanding Canada to what we are today, and I don't know what other kind of statue to use  to represent that. 

While I think you could make some comparisons to Hitler, in terms of being racist, I don't think its a good comparison. Hitler's goal was to eliminate anyone he deemed lesser, and to do that he had to expand his borders. I don't believe that was JAM intention, he expanded out into, what at the time, was considered empty unowned land. His goal was to make the nation of Canada stronger. If he was like Hitler he would have wanted it invade the US and slaughter all aboriginals, which he did not. I really can't defend JAM actions, they were horrible, but I wouldn't make the comparison to Hitler.",1598918485

The first choice is the community complaining about the community. The second choice is the community complaining about design. The problem with healers DPS'ing is not a community problem, it is a design problem, that the community wants to yell at the community about.

Instead of complaining about healers not DPS'ing, why not instead complain about a system which makes healing so uninteresting and boring that queuing for healer is just saying ""I want to be a boring DPS?""

The problem with healing isn't that healers want to, or don't want to, DPS, it's that it's boring. Healing is so easy that you're expected to DPS, and you're given completely uninteresting DPS options. Telling a healer to DPS is expressly telling that player to do something he doesn't want to do. The problem isn't that player not wanting to do it, the problem is that the game forces him into doing something he doesn't want to.",1598918485

I comment because it's a strange phrase to some, many hearing people use deaf only for profound deafness, whereas deaf people would use it for anyone who is severely deafened (and definitions of severe do vary, but a common definition is inability to understand speech without lip reading or signing or subtitles)

For anything less severe than that deaf people prefer hard of hearing.

I'd like to begin by thanking you for giving your time to help other navigate this difficult process. I recognize you from your previous post regarding doing well on the LSAT and am grateful for the contributions you make to this community.

Formalities dispensed with, I did have a specific scenario I hope you would be able and willing to offer insight on. In 2016 I was arrested in Az for allegedly running a marijuana farm with over 1000 plants. In 2018 I plead guilty to a single felony charge and was sentenced to 3 years probation (great legal team and got lucky with a Brady's list issue).  So, I'm definitely what would be referred to as a ""justice impacted individual"".  I'm 35 and basically the entirety of my work experience is in growing marijuana illegally.

 However, in 2018 I returned to college and will graduate in the spring with a bachelor's having majored in Accounting and taken some graduate level course in that discipline. My GPA is around 3.7 and I have attended a state school for the entirely of my education. I'm currently consistently scoring in the mid 170s on the timed 4 section practice tests which I've been taking. I'm registered to take the LSAT in October and am confident I will do well. I plan on having all my applications in by Thanksgiving.

Assuming I score a 176  which I think is quite realistic, in your opinion do I have a shot at Y/H/S? 

Is there a specific strategy which I should take to addressing  my addendums with regards to my personal and scholastic history? Obviously I will be expressing my sincere contrition my actions and the wild ways of my youth. Further, I intend to be open about my struggles with learning to accept authority, and my desires to help other people avoid my fate. Beyond that however I am somewhat lost. 

Should I explain the circumstances behind everything I've ever been arrested for? Should I mention why I dropped out of school the first time? 

Any insight you could offer would be greatly appreciated as I am totally unfamiliar with super exclusive higher education in general and of course, the finer points of applying to law school are new to me.

Thank you in advance for your time, and if your schedule permits it I'd be very grateful for your input.",1598918485

"ZonaEnts","t5_2tgcl","TruMed sells their own flower (top shelf only) and from that top shelf flower, they make concentrates under the brand name ""Drip"". You can get other brands of flower at TruMed, but their flower is consistently the best in AZ. Grow Sciences and Potent Planet are close, but they lack consistency throughout their lineup of Strains. Then, you have Tru Infusion, which is a brand and a dispensary, as is Abubdant Organics. Another good brand is Nectar Farms. 

All the brands I have mentioned produce excellent, top shelf flower and concentrates, from said flower. There are at least a half-a-dozen other brands that produce very good flower, and a lot of dispensaries have their own grow, some of which are very good. I think the thing about Tru Med and  Grow Sciences, in particular is that their strains are grown well and they are consistently good. Tru Med is just more consistent than Grow Sciences, in my opinion.

A couple of years ago we did not have near the selection and quality that we have now. It should just keep getting better. My advice would be to go to Tru Med because that's the only place you can get their flower. You can also try grow sciences and other top brands there as well. You'll see what I mean.

*****
&gt; USPS is facing an effort to force it to make public its performance data, with the aim of demonstrating the depths of the current mail delays that Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has admitted have accelerated in recent weeks.

&gt; The effort to obtain data comes as the Postal Service is fending off at least a dozen lawsuits around the country looking to block changes DeJoy has put into place, including one states-led effort that has been fast tracked in federal court.

&gt; The Justice Department, arguing in support of the Postal Service and against expedited discovery, had said much of the information would be coming out &amp;quot;Imminently&amp;quot; anyway and the plaintiffs&amp;#039; request was overly broad. The court rejected those arguments and gave USPS 10 days to produce its data.

Yes, there are other examples, the First Step Act, which Trump supported and signed. That was one of the first things his administration got done.

To reassessment my original statement, I suppose what I was saying is that calling it self-indulgent in this instance is. . . well, it seems to remove from oneself the necessity of giving it a chance, I suppose.       
Peradventure someone is recommending a book to you.        
""Is there a paragraph describing a vista?"" You ask.        
The person recommending the book finds the question strangely specific, because who would care about something like that, yet at the same time very general since almost every book is likely to have at least one paragraph describing a vista, but he says, ""Yes.""        

You then dismiss the book because paragraphs usually have 20+ words and this one is confirmed to be describing a vista, so it must be self-indulgent.        

If this seems like a silly example, that's fine because it's meant to be, but you have to acknowledge that it holds to the parameters you yourself set. I just think the idea that one cannot do a paragraph describing a vista well, or meaningfully, is erroneous.  

Again, I'm not attacking you, I feel no malice toward you. I hope you live well, love well, eat well, experience life as you want, and are able to achieve all of your dreams. I'd buy you a drink if we were in person.        
I promise that I'm just *discussing* this, and I would be fully willing to hear your perspective.

I personally bought the Vastar watch repair kit from amazon for about $17-18 I think and it‚Äôs served me well, but I didn‚Äôt get a crystal press, hands remover, or little air-squeeze thingy. If I were to start again, I‚Äôd probably get the kit you linked. It seems to include everything you would need to start modding. For the bezel, you only need two of the prying tools included in the kit. For the hands, you‚Äôll need the hands remover included in the kit (you might want to get dial protectors in case you don‚Äôt trust yourself to not scratch the dial). The crystal will need the press and fittings included. Then, the dial will need everything else removed first, but most likely just tweezers and patience once it‚Äôs ready, which are also included in the kit.

"ShouldIbuythisgame","t5_2ud8h","Honestly, both are good and both have their strong points, so there's not a 'wrong' answer so much.

XCOM 2 is a little more sci-fi and a little more over-the-top, with glittering sci-fi cities patrolled by snake aliens with plasma rifles while ragtag guerillas infiltrate under their snakey noses.

If you start with XCOM, do get the expansion pack (Enemy Within). It's the same game, just with some minor but well-thought-out addiitons. If you start with XCOM 2, again, get the x-pac (War of the Chosen). It's largeish, but the additions are great. In both cases, do **not** start with the Long War mod. Long War is great, and veterans will all tell you it's wonderful. I play with Long War myself. But Long War and Long War 2 are emphatically for veterans.

If the DEA pushed too hard someone at the top would get a vague warning not to mess around with a CIA operation from someone who was told by a chain of 10 people.

For example, when Kennedy was assassinated the KGB had to launch a multi day investigation on itself to make sure they weren't the ones who did it. They were so fragmented and every handler was doing their own thing that the head of the KGB couldn't be sure they didn't kill Kennedy. The CIA was much the same.

I mean, this is just a ridiculous statement. Let's just ignore any cases, any recent events, etc. Ignore them all.

If someone is coming after you, it is in no way unreasonable to assume they mean to take your life. Someone running and *lunging* at you? Like, how do you know they don't have a weapon? What if they tackle you and get ontop of you, how do you defend yourself if they are stronger and heavier than you?

I'm as Anti-republican and anti-white supremacy as the next guy, but i'm not lying when i say i would 100% shoot someone dead if they came running at me with the intent to attack me.

That being said, Kyle Rittenhouse is a piece of garbage that definitely deserves to spend the rest of his life behind bars.

"childfree","t5_2qtwb","I mean, the reason I compared denmark to other european countries is that that is the most like comparative thing to measure against. We don't measure denmark to USA because the US has a significantly higher rate due mostly to immigration, if you take that out it becomes much closer to european countries. Sorry, I was imprecise in my terminology the whole point is to increase pop by increasing kid quality, pro-natalist was probably the wrong word choice. 

Personally, I'm willing to try things that increase quality of life for kids and immigration because I feel like not having any large increase for only immigrants would make certain strata of the population (cough,cough..conservatives) afraid and they would try to force certain demographics to breed more via some sort of policies that are just shy of the handmaid's tale. I also agree with you on better quality, but if we can also eke out better numericity we have a more robust future economic growth in store. I try to keep in mind what's politically achievable, though I agree that the TEKS argument for direct cash payments to potential parents might not be as wholly effective as other things might be. It is effective at curbing extreme poverty, but that is generally not the class of people talking about not having more or any kids due to economic reasons. These from personal experience tend to have parents that were middle class but have had less success themselves as inequality in the US has deepened. I don't know though, direct economic transfers may push the fencesitters in a direction where they now marginally have just enough economic stability to raise a kid or an additional kid. I'd tend to say more systemic things would be more helpful like universal childcare but the way the US political system is structured currently disincentivizes policy creation. I don't know where you get a million dollars from, I think it's kind of a reduction to absurdity. Like, you don't need to claim that the entire financial requirement for a kid must be paid upfront. Change happens at the margins and just a little increase in the fertility rate per person has huge demographic implications",1598918490

Told me he was closer to one of my girlfriends than to me and felt like they had more things in common. Would make comments all the time about how attractive other girls were. Made me very insecure and honestly if it becomes a habit just know it is pretty toxic behavior and not sustainable.

Insecurity in a relationship is extremely damaging and needs to be addressed early - talk to him about it now. His reaction to your feelings will tell you a lot - if he gaslights you I'd say ditch him.

Right off the bat I thought it was odd that their phone booth was just weirdly there in the middle of that long bridge - although it was a nice little detail for Ted to wave goodbye to the hologram. Death's home was decent once you got more inside but the huge floor-to-ceiling windows on one side of the room made it feel a bit fake.¬†

But their hospice care room looked like it was filmed in an ikea - it's bizarre to me that by 2060 we'd still be decorating like it was 2018. It reminds me of how the 'future' in the previous movie still looked very 90's.¬†

Story decisions were weird too. In the entire time they've been together, the dad never thought to ask either of the princesses if any of it were true? Why were people surprised the robot went to hell when the van also made it? I also completely thought the robot was Nick Swardson. But to end the movie that abruptly felt really cheap. Kinda felt like the writers didn't want to have to worry about what happens after the entire world deals with a cataclysmic time displacement problem.

I think it was obvious from the get-go that it'd be about passing the torch onto the daughters but meh. Ted's daughter was pretty great but ultimately they felt like two SNL actresses impersonating surfer boys. They looked the part but really didn't feel like they were using their natural speaking voices in the same way that Keanu &amp; Alex were in the previous films, so their voices felt really forced to me.",1598918491

Also the ""reactive"" part of the smoke and well, Haze can run in the smoke as if he was with Warden's glasses, Haze's smoke is in fact not even a bit lethal, meaning it won't deal any damage at all... Worth mentioning that Haze has 6 SG pellets... But Nomura is pretty ok...

This is because leftists love to play word-games and if I don't do this, they WILL try to disingenuously bend my words.

"aspd","t5_2zfm9","I have found that creating, combining, or finding a philosophy and set of guidelines is helpful in the lulls. That and as you said the occasional chemical bridge. I am a huge fan of psilocybin because it helps the way weed does but without needing to use it as often and without the lazy sleepiness.

My own rules and philosophies that I created in my teens and twenties overlay at the intersection of Taoism, Buddhism, Stoicism, &amp; Epicureanism. By instituting daily activities as a form of meditation (laundry, dishes, gardening, etc) I am able to reinforce my practice more regularly. This keeps flare ups at bay. These philosophies and rituals keep me from ritualistically engaging in less acceptable activities.

That and I do lots of research on different topics and look for patterns and overlays in human philosophies, physiologies, religions, politics, and societies. I guess I consider it an abstract search for a universal human subconscious. I don‚Äôt know if it exists, but some aspects of human society suggest it may. If it doesn‚Äôt exist I have a never ending existential quest that acts to continually improve my understanding of myself and others.

Better living through chemicals... and existential inquest.

Edit: Also cooking approached as an art as much as a science.

As I continued thinking I wanted a better way to relate how I use different daily activities as a manifestation of meditation. For context consider the Mudras used in Hindu, Buddhist, and other traditions. While seemingly mystical (another debate entirely) they do have very concrete manifestations in human physiology and psychology. Each Mudra represents a different meditative or prayer focus that is supposed to focus the individual practice to a purpose. So every time the student holds a certain mudra all of their attention and energy is focused on a very specific goal. Over time it becomes like a macro in a piece of software. You no longer have to go through all of the intro and ritual to achieve piece while holding the mudra because you have conditioned your mind to react to a physical condition. 

It might be easier to think of it in terms of Pavlov and his dogs. Through ritual torture of these animals he was able to cause them to salivate in response to a bell instead of the food. In a similar way you can condition your mind to become at peace through the ritualized practice of folding a shirt while reflecting on your chosen philosophy or psychological goal. Over time you wont have to do as much mental work because the ritual itself with engender the psychological response.

For one more context consider the cliche of comfort felt when an individual catches the scent of the perfume of their grandmother (assuming she wasn‚Äôt abusive or terrible). Human brains, even ours, love ritualized practice and mystical thinking. I leverage these lizard brain mechanism to condition my brain out of dangerous places and climb back into the raft so to speak.

I know that got really deep there in the end, but we are talking about existential dilemmas dealing with boredom as a potential trigger for homicide. Hope that helps, and I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions.",1598918493

And what is it that mage never seems to get any good board clears for more than 8 mana or any powerful spells for a high mana cost? We had Power of creation and Deepfreeze, both of which are kind of too weak. Meanwhile priest are drowning in board clears.

Maybe we could find a way to hold the passengers in stasis (like in the movie Passengers), or alternatively just make the ships last long enough for generations to thrive independently along the journey.

2) Just travel very close to the speed of light. Time dilation would mean that the trip could take an arbitrarily short amount of time from the passengers' perspectives.

2. These two weeks the community have been building up a lot of anticipation and excitement to see her come back. A lot of dedicated artists and memers have been prepping for her return, even making a whole website for it, and its so damn sad to see all their effort get thrown into the void

3. What little we did see of her was pretty unique. She had an interest in more electro house type music, her stream transitions were clean, and the way she spoke and carried herself was pretty original and it would have been fun to see how she wouldve interacted with everyone.

4. The image of a young woman acheiving their dreams, and then instantly getting thrown into the dirt and getting harassed at her own damn house by lowlifes just saddens me to no end.

&gt; Wisconsin Republican leaders convened a special session of the state Legislature on police reform for less than 30 seconds on Monday as the state deals with simmering tensions after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, and the killing of two protesters in Kenosha.

&gt; Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, had called the state Legislature into special session to take up police reform measures.

&gt; The special session comes after players on the Milwaukee Bucks called on the state Legislature to tackle police reform following their walkout of an NBA playoff game last week to protest the Blake shooting, which the Wisconsin Department of Justice is investigating.

I completely agree, and personally, I don't! With that said, ignoring a deep-seated cultural association and rectifying that association aren't the same thing; conversely, recognizing a deep-seated cultural association and perpetuating that association aren't the same thing. You don't fix a problem by hiding or lying about whether it's a factor.

&gt;It's often the case that women can't celebrate anything but femininity without being accused of internalized misogyny

Hmm. My personal experience and observation has been that women engaging in or expressing enjoyment of masculine-gendered things is generally approved of in both straight and queer circles (obviously, usually for different cultural reasons; e.g. straight world = ""relatability"" as opposed to the unrelatability of feminine-gendered interests and behaviors, queer world = yes please let's just discard these bullshit gender expectations). 

I don't say this to discredit your apparent experiences, and to be clear I absolutely don't see a ""masculine"" aesthetic or behavioral tendency as necessarily a manifestation of misogyny, any more than I think a ""feminine"" aesthetic or behavioral phenotype necessarily precludes internalized misogyny. I'm just explaining why I think it's still important to acknowledge the role of misogyny in gender semiotics, and be thoughtful in how we express approval and identification. Gender association is a complex issue and far from universal, but to me, it seems clear that there is still an overall problem with how masculinity is framed as default, relatable, and cool versus femininity being other, unrelatable, and irritating, and it also seems pretty clear where this originates and which gender is historically the protagonist.",1598918497

‚ÄúOn September 18, 2016, during the Gold final start we experienced an accident involving our F1 racer, ‚ÄòHot Stuff‚Äô and a fellow competitor‚Äôs airplane.

We were number four on the starting grid, which was the middle inside position with three aircraft on the front row, one to our right and three behind. Upon running the engine up in anticipation of the start, about 20 seconds before the green flag drop, the engine was not running well enough for flight, as you can hear from the audio, never mind racing. I made the decision to shut the engine down to signal the starters to halt the starting process. The flagman on my row put his hands in an ‚ÄòX‚Äô over his head, as our procedures prescribe, and I opened my canopy to make it clear I was out of the race and so everyone could see me. The alternate airplane was signaled to taxi on to the runway to replace my entry. I felt confident the communications had reached the appropriate people and waited for personnel to push me off the runway.

However, much to my surprise, I saw the flagman run out on to the runway waving his hands over his head as if something was wrong. The aircraft to my right started rolling and a few seconds later the number six and eight aircraft flew by me on either side. All I could do at that point was hope the number seven (center) aircraft would clear me on the centerline to my right.

The impact was violent and loud. His left leading edge shaved off the top several inches from my vertical and skimmed the turtle-deck without touching until it impacted my right hand holding up the canopy, at well over sixty miles an hour. The left landing gear hit the top of the gull-wing center-section, blowing a hole in the top skin and impacted the rear face of the front spar so hard that it broke the landing gear clean off his airplane. The propeller sliced three evenly spaced gashes about mid span of my right wing, about a foot apart. The right landing gear sheared the wing off just short of the right wingtip. The impact spun me around nearly 180¬∫, like a teacup ride at warp eight. The other aircraft came to rest several hundred feet in front of me with a folded gear, damaged wing and sheared propeller facing the other way as well. That pilot received no injuries.

Three things immediately came to mind. Make yourself as small as possible to avoid further injury until things stop moving. Once the aircraft came to rest, DON‚ÄôT MOVE! And since I was not on fire, wait for help to arrive. I knew my hand was busted and was not looking forward to removing my glove. But it was more important to make sure I had not been struck in the head or hurt my neck or back. After assessing my situation I realized I did not have any further injuries and proceeded to shut the switches off and assist with un-strapping myself from the wreckage. Help was there very quickly, including my flagman.

Then I proceeded to ask the condition of the other pilot and how this had happened. The video should speak for itself. My next concern was to let my crew know I was OK. The one thing any spectator looks for in an accident are the correct number of flight suits walking around the wreckage after any crash, I made sure I did. Everything else can be fixed. Reno EMS quickly patched me up with a splint and had me walking back to my pit in no time. They really are good at what they do.

Hot Stuff suffered severe damage. It‚Äôll be several months before we figure out what to do with her. I‚Äôm not the slightest bit upset over the accident. I, in fact, consider myself a very lucky man. Another four feet to the left and I would have been minced meat. Literally dodging a bullet. A busted up hand is a small price to pay. I‚Äôll take it. It‚Äôll heal. Though it is difficult to type one-handed.

I‚Äôve said many times before and I‚Äôll say it again, there‚Äôs risk in everything we do. But the counterpart to that is reward.

"popheads","t5_39nwj","*Future Nostalgia* was incredibly cohesive, if you want to exclude ""Good in Bed"" and ""Boys Will Be Boys."" The tempos of those songs are completely different, ""Good in Bed"" features a totally different singing style than the rest of the album and sounds like a Lily Allen B-side, and ""Boys Will Be Boys"" feels like a lecture, not a pop song.

As for cohesive album cycles in recent history? Well...

*What's Your Pleasure?* is singularly cohesive as a dance-pop statement. The most you could say is that ""Save a Kiss"" is more electro-pop than disco-pop and that ""Remember Where You Are"" is more of a soulful reflection than a dance song (which is to say, it's a slow dance song).

*Fever, Aphrodite,* and *Confessions on a Dance Floor* are all dance-pop statements in the 00s that were extremely cohesive.

Beyonc√©'s self-titled and *Lemonade* eras wouldn't have normally been sonically cohesive due to their constant genre switch-ups. However, both enjoy full audiovisual accompaniment which reveals the depths of the stories at hand. They are in service of a wider narrative, and in that context they work splendidly, probably more so than any other person I've already named.

There's only another girl and myself wearing a mask at all times in the office and we're mocked for it. Everyone else just doesn't feel like wearing it.

Mr. Rittenhouse turns toward the sound of gunfire as another pursuer lunges toward him from the same direction. Mr. Rittenhouse then fires four times, and appears to shoot the man in the head.

Its mainly there to get newer players to not quit and help them learn without too much consequence. Good example is how when your low lvl you can consume more items without as big of a negetive effect (except for some mid to late game consumables like alcohol ) .You just have to be more careful and keep a eye on your HP, AP , and any status effects of any kind. The game just gets harder as you progress. Ex is givin over time so to balance the constant xp your skill points and perks are not directly tied to your xp but your time spent on a specific tree .thats why there's lvl 18s with more skill points than lvl 30s and remember you can lose skills if you never use them. some you never forget like the bike riding skill but others need to be trained like the backflip skill.the best thing to do is to spend a good amount of time getting skills amd parls for the fitness and wellness trees.those skills can help with any build as they have many quality of life improvement perks.",1598918499

*****
&gt; Wisconsin Republican leaders convened a special session of the state Legislature on police reform for less than 30 seconds on Monday as the state deals with simmering tensions after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, and the killing of two protesters in Kenosha.

&gt; Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, had called the state Legislature into special session to take up police reform measures.

&gt; The special session comes after players on the Milwaukee Bucks called on the state Legislature to tackle police reform following their walkout of an NBA playoff game last week to protest the Blake shooting, which the Wisconsin Department of Justice is investigating.

They are just starting to find out that it's possible to get sick from Covid again (though I think 4 cases so far), It's possible to spread it you are not symptomatic...say to your students, friends, randos at the grocery store.

I don't doubt the many teacher are not prepared or are under prepared. Teachers are expected to do everything on their time and dime, and where decisions about school plans were made so close to open--I don't blame the confusion. It doesn't help the the week before open is non stop trainings that are on everything other than what is needed (for the most part) instead of lesson planning. I am also young, but I care for my parents and in-laws, not to mention the long term effects for mild cases feels like a gamble I am not willing to take.

"lfg","t5_2rcvr","Heyo  
This seems like an interesting idea and I'd love to try out for it.  


1. I haven't done much voice acting yet, but I went to a high school of arts where I studied acting and been working as an actor on and off ever since. I've been mainly doing theatre work with some music videos and short films here and there. I should also mention that I made the change from acting to dancing professionally a few years back so since then I've only done a few appearances as an actor. (Not because I don't like it though. I love acting, just haven't had much time with all the dance work I've been getting. But I'd difinitely like to return to it!)
2. A lot of experience. I've been playing 5e for years and I can get very into it. I like to do accents for my characters and creating playlists for them that help me get in their headspace before game. I love the creativity and the shared storymaking elements of it, the way a group bounces ideas off of each other, building on each other to make this infinitely enjoyable and incredible tale. I love the little moments between characters, as well as the epic battles.
3. I'm quite flexible on time right now and could easily dedicate that amount weekly to this.
4. I actually do have experience with that. Mostly video editing and I've recently been starting to learn 3d animation.
5. Not podcast, but I do watch Critical Role.

I should add that I'm originally not a native English speaker. But I've only ever played TTRPGs in English, been speaking more English than my native language for years (due to having a lot of international friends), worked in Texas for a while as well as studied acting in Glasgow (at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland). I am very confident in my language skills and that I would be able to act without difficulty. :)",1598918500

As Coronavirus cases are surging in many areas we remind you to excercise an abundance of caution. Pay attention to your local and national guidelines, continue practicing preventative safety measures, do not meet anyone if you have been exhibiting symptoms, and ideally get tested beforehand if able. If you do not feel you can safely meet with someone then it is best not to do so at all. Your actions not only affect yourself and your partners, but also those you care about, the ones that will have to care for you all, and everyone for that matter. Be safe.

"Python","t5_2qh0y","There is no need to convert a list of strings again into strings. So you can just remove this line.

    def rec_dig_sum(n):
        n_string = str(n)
        n_list = list(n_string)
        n_int = [int(x) for x in n_list]
        n_sum = sum(n_int)
        if n_sum &gt;= 10:
            return rec_dig_sum(n_sum)
        else:
            return(n_sum) 


Also there is no need to convert n_steing to a list, as the ""in"" operator can also operate through strings.

    def rec_dig_sum(n):
        n_string = str(n)
        n_int = [int(x) for x in n_string]
        n_sum = sum(n_int)
        if n_sum &gt;= 10:
            return rec_dig_sum(n_sum)
        else:
            return(n_sum) 

Then it's better to change the list comprehension to a generator. As you don't really need the elements in a list first, to calculate the sum of it.

Also you can directly out the string conversion into that generator:

    def rec_dig_sum(n):
        n_int = (int(x) for x in str(n))
        n_sum = sum(n_int)
        if n_sum &gt;= 10:
            return rec_dig_sum(n_sum)
        else:
            return(n_sum) 

Last: wrap the generator directly with the sum() function.

Also you can leave out your else-statement, if you reassign n_sum instead. But that's just a personal taste in my opinion.

    def rec_dig_sum(n):
        n_sum = sum((int(x) for x in str(n)))
        if n_sum &gt;= 10:
            n_sum = rec_dig_sum(n_sum)
        return(n_sum)

My Dad is pretty text book, but my mom's brand was sneakier and it took me longer to see it in her.  Weight and body image issues are a struggle for me and she has sabotaged me in many ways as well.  Not only bringing me food but then shaming me for eating it.  I was doing really well in Weight Watchers for a while and was seeing some success when she wanted to do it with me and she came to my meetings and started to break down my connections with that support group until I stopped going. My NDad treated my weight loss success as what I ""should"" be doing anyways never gave me any credit for it .... So all of that to say I understand how you feel.",1598918502

I'm not ""average,"" and the [We-Nova 2](https://www.peepshowtoys.com/products/we-vibe-nova-2-ultra-flexible-rabbit-vibrator#oid=51006_9873) is really amazing for flexibility (the clit stimulator outside bends *a lot*), and it's nice if you like to thrust the internal portion. Plus the vibes are really rumbly. Honestly I think it's the best pure rabbit vibrator out there. 

[Womanizer Duo](https://www.peepshowtoys.com/products/womanizer-duo-air-pulsation-clitoral-stimulator-plus-g-spot-vibrator#oid=51006_9873) is amazing if you like the Womanizer kind of clit pulsation. (Most clits do a lot, with occasional exceptions.) It took me a while to get used to, and it is expensive, but it's also the only insertable toy I will squirt with and generally gives great orgasms.

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Someone said it years ago, it stuck with me:  
&gt; The primary difference between Raiders and Non-raiders has nothing to do with skill and everything to do with attitude.
&gt; 
&gt; Raiders start raiding. They don't make excuses for why they can't do it. They don't give up when it's hard. They put in the effort to find or form a group and keep making that effort until they are successful. They start early and don't expect anybody else to tell them what to do, they learn it themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; The resources are available. You can find a guild on /r/guildrecruitment. You can find guides on Dulfy.net and Youtube and a million other places. You can find builds on metabattle.com and snowcrows.com. You can run training raids with a bunch of guilds that are donating their time to help you.
&gt; 
&gt; If you aren't self-motivated or get easily frustrated or have real-life commitments or whatever else, raiding may not be for you. But that's not ArenaNet's fault and it's sure as hell not anybody else's fault.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I need to spend time with my family"" is a totally valid reason not to raid. But it's your choice and your prioritization of your life. Don't blame others because you can't set aside a few consecutive hours.  
  
Which basically means: If you keep trying, you'll get it done. If you don't find a group, create your own. If you need something to raid, then get it, etc. It's all about attitude.",1598918502

The largest shop is 1750 sq ft of just front of house, doesn't include production or our offices.  It's way too big.  If you're making your ice cream 1900 sq ft would be fine.  We also have a party room but it rarely got used before the pandemic and now it never does.  We use it for meetings.  It's a waste of space and we are eventually going to turn it into more production space.  

I wouldn't say you're crazy but I would just think long and hard.  We almost walked away from our third shop because, even though we loved the location, the owners wanted us to take 2000sq ft.  No matter how much we loved the location that's too big.  

What kind of ice cream are you planning on selling?  I wouldn't say it's a good time to open most businesses but our shops have done well through the pandemic.  We took a big hit in April but then recovered strong.  Our price point is low, family of 4 easily in and out under $20 which I think is very important if you're going to be opening in the current economy.

"succulents","t5_2smnv","Watering twice a week is also way too much water for succulent.

And the soil made it even worse, because it is too organic.

Doing that will overwater the plant and then rot it.

Wait for the plant to tell you when it to water.

&amp;nbsp;

How it tell is by the leaves; leaves will be wrinkles and feel softer.

If you do not see those signs, then the watering of the plant is not needed.

&amp;nbsp;

Highly recommend to make mix of 50% perlite and 50% succulent/cactus soil.

The succulent soil alone is not good enough for water drainage.

Without extra perlite, water stay in soil for too long.

&amp;nbsp;

The soil should dry out in a few days.

After the soil dries, still do not water the plant.

Remember what I type a few lines above on when to water.

&amp;nbsp;

For your middle picture, you could have probably saved it at that time.

What you have done would to take plant out of pot and remove soil.

This would be to let the plant rest and not take in any water.

And cut off the lower part of plant if it was needed.

The last picture is how it is now.

It is too late now, the rot happened and went up high.",1598918504

She was apprehensive the first time she came over to our house. After some treats and some praise, absolutely the sweetest dog I've ever met.

She'd charge up the stairs to our apartment when they came over, absolutely overjoyed to see my partner and I, and spin around and run around all over the living room before leaping into our arms. 

We wound up pet-sitting for her for a day or two when her owners were out of town, and even though her people were away, she was totally calm, and took great joy in rearranging our blankets to create a Dog Cave, and would just whimper occasionally because she wanted us to come over to her blanket cave and give her a full-body scritchin.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Your attempts to spin rhetoric in order to obscure the huge jumps in your argument continue to fail. Let's take it point by point.

&gt;Friend, I return strawman for strawman... You claim that I think that God demands gays be killed. I return it and say... Maybe you can't determine the difference between different religious perspectives.

I claim no such thing nor anything like it. Ironically, your accusation of strawmanning itself strawmans me.

&gt;More than ignored, you deny my validity... If I don't follow *your* plan for *my* faith, you actually term me illegitimate. What was it you said, ""These are not suggestions."". Because there is no difference in practice from 1000 CE to the present, I guess.

Once again, I term you nothing of the sort. In fact, if you'll recall my comment 2 steps up the thread, you'll remember I said whether these laws and practices apply in the present is entirely irrelevant.

&gt;You... I don't know, went to EvilGodBoys.com and found something done for sanctity at the Tabernacle before the Babylonian Exile and claimed that was me.

I found something a majority of believers in your religion, as well as all Abrahamic ones, upholds as part of its holy text and pointed out its indefensibility, as an example. The point I was making is that your desire to continue improving morality is *necessarily hindered* by any sort of sacred text. To repeat my statements, since the point remains unchanged and you did not address it: ""If you want to continue bending the moral arc towards justice, if you want to better realize the importance of love and justice, perhaps you should stop trying to shoehorn nonexistent entities and ancient superstition into your morality, and move past the chains of religion that continually bind you to the fixed moralities of the past. If you did, you wouldn't *have* to reinterpret old verses because ""they don't apply anymore"", you wouldn't *have* to cherry pick the bits you like and ignore the ones that don't match your values, you wouldn't *have* to continually justify doing the opposite of everything God says and wants because you know it's wrong. You could just cut to the chase, and give yourself license to be a good person because it's good.""

&gt;But you, of course, are the proud inheritor of shared *human* values. Because, I suppose, us religious people are not human.

I don't know how to even respond to this. Is it even possible to be more blatantly fallacious than this??? I mean, jumping from ""you support human values"" to ""you think religious people aren't human""? This is more than dishonest. Literally the only thing these two statements share is the word 'human' - they're not connected at all in any logical respect. This is like me looking at this quote:

&gt;Shall we greet our new philosopher-kings with flowers or blood sacrifice?

And responding, ""oh, so you're saying we should make blood sacrifices to our religious leaders?""

&gt;And of course shared human values aren't represented by us poor brainwashed masses, ridden by gods like ants with fungus.

If you recall, I specifically said that shared human values *are* represented by the masses (which for some reason you see the need to insult as poor and brainwashed). I said these shared human values account for the very commonality you point out in the OP, and that religion is a barrier to them, not their originator.",1598918506

"uklaw","t5_2qonh","So typically.... if you have a car accident, it‚Äôs optional to have legal expenses cover in the insurance. The insurance company will always have a list of panel solicitors that they wish to instruct on their behalf as the insurance company of the insured if it proceeds to litigation whether there is legal expenses cover or not as they will always need to protect their own interest as they will be the ones paying out.

However if the insured doesn‚Äôt have legal expenses cover, a lot of times, there will be ‚Äúreferral companies‚Äù or ‚Äúclaims management companies‚Äù which will refer to you a solicitor to deal with the litigation on the insureds behalf. They typically act for the insured rather than the insurance company.

This all depends on what the claim is for and who the claimant sues. The claimant can sue the insured and the insurance company if they wanted to however, it is usually rare as the insurance company are generally responsible for the claim unless the insured purchased the insurance under fraud.

"moderatepolitics","t5_2s6h3","Thing is, the eastern hemisphere may be OK if they quarantine the western hemisphere, possibly excepting Canada. Pity Europe couldn't swap Sweden for Canada.

Had there been a REAL nationwide lockdown in April, there would have been a much better chance of reducing infection rates. That couldn't happen in the US because of free-dumb, the apparent right to freedom of asinine behavior. Sadly, too many Americans ready to defend to the death their right to be asinine.

Masks and 6-feet separation from others would be a start if EVERYONE complied. I know they won't. In the last week, walking my dogs at night (without a mask, but few others out walking after 10:00 PM), I've seen what I assume to be 3 dinner parties ending, with people leaving other's homes, getting into cars and driving away. As long as that sort of thing continues, natural selection may be all we can reasonably expect.

Just to be clear: herd *immunity* means once expose and with antibodies, one can't come down with the illness. Too early to determine whether COVID-19 can recur. If it can, herd *resistance* is the best for which we could hope, and that would indeed mean a persistent death toll for a long time to come.

&gt; No one is going to tolerate social distancing and mask wearing for years.

OTOH, as long as it doesn't affect them, their families or most of their close friends, death tolls would be what they'd be. Ah, well.",1598918506

The general rule of SP builds is unlocking parameters, damage passives, and added attacks if any. There are exceptions to this depending on the unit, and the rest of the SP options usually depend on context. You may find recommended SP builds for each unit in the wiki.


You may read up about DBB in the [wiki](http://bravefrontierglobal.wikia.com/wiki/Bonding).


As for which units to prioritise, there are too many to list. I recommend referring to the [Raise Priority List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tfl596Y3U7Qh5FfTqGFv4EkK987ASfeYgzAIYgYykzY/edit?usp=sharing) for guidance on that.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules

&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

(read the full context here) 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/ijgewf/the_followup_manifesto

The fun part of being a destiny fan is knowing the backstory and watching all the misinformation firebombs being tossed around LSF and other communities and trying to debunk all the bullshit but getting buried by hate boners by people who wont read a book past reading the back cover.

His views when these things happen are just like when Hasan said america deserved 9-11. Obviously that sounds bad, but the American governments actions are what lead to it being ""deserved"".

Destiny is so fucking sick of playing this game he just unloads when he knows hes right but people are misunderstanding he seems to quadruple down on the inflammatory comments and buy the real estate around the hill hes prepared to die on.

I know its really messy and hurtful to his own message but theres nothing i can do about that.

The main takeaway from all this is that absolutely none of it matters and everyone needs to get out and vote in November",1598918508

Hi /u/NovaVes!


Your submission was removed per Rule 4:

&gt;####RULE #4 - NO UNVERIFIED OC

&gt;* Do not post yourself unless you are prepared to verify with us.

&gt;* Don't post or claim to know someone in the photo unless you can verify permission to post the photo.

&gt;* Don't post someone you know from Facebook or Instagram or any other social media platform. If we find out, it violates this rule.

#**PLEASE NOTE:** New and low karma accounts cannot be verified (See rule 8 of the subreddit rules). If you've only been on reddit for a short time, have low karma, and/or you haven't done much NSFW self-posting on reddit, you'll be asked to build up your posting history for a couple weeks before verifying here. Posting nudes isn't for everyone, and we want you to ""get your feet wet"" by posting in some smaller subs before you jump into the deep end of the pool.

---

[Please message the Moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmateur&amp;subject=Verification%20Request) with proof that:

`A.  You are actually the girl in this photo`

#**-or-**

`B. You can verify that you have the girl's permission to post this photo.`

**Any further submissions by you, without verification, will result in a ban.**

---

#**[\*\*READ THE FULL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS HERE\*\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amateur/wiki/verification)**

#Verification must follow these simple rules:

Please provide `3+` photos of yourself, from `3` different angles, holding a paper sign with your user name, today's date, and /r/Amateur written on it.

* The paper should be crumpled and smoothed, yet still readable.

* Your hand(s) should be visible holding the sign.

* Shoot the pics from as wide an angle as you can manage. Photos cropped in close will be rejected.

The photo does not have to be artsy or nude, but please show as much of you as possible. If we can't match the body depicted in your verification pictures to the body in your past and future posts, then it's not a meaningful verification. So while you do not have to post your face, we do need to see a good amount of your unclothed/clothed body.

---

Thank you for your cooperation!

As for the next part:
‚ÄúThere is literally a guy who fires a gun right behind him. So a kids being chased hears a gunshot behind and turns and shoots. Completely justified to think his life was in imminent danger. But keep getting outraged over a pedophile and domestic abuser dying.‚Äù

Kyle himself is an abuser. Dudes who punch girls from behind in their sides and back of their heads tend to not be the type of people who should be patrolling streets with ARs and firing multiple shots in crowded areas. 

Still trying to find out if it‚Äôs true about him pointing his gun at three black teens and demanding they get out of a car just before this as well.

"BokuNoHeroAcademia","t5_34a0h","Understanding Momo's quirk, it's evident that she was using a very specific sedative that she was familliar with. When she's explaining how the sedative is administered, it was very clear that she had a very good understanding of how it is supposed to work. Because of her clear knowledge of the sedative, it's not unlikely that she would be able to correctly estimate the most effective doseage she could give Gigantomachia. As for why she didn't increase the doseage, when Midnight gave her the direction to sedate him, Midnight acknowledged that their action would be against the law.  Remembering that heroes must work within the confines of the law, sedating him without his consent is already illegal in the first place, but using a higher doseage of the sedative could potentially kill him. It's possible that in the MHA universe, heroes are not allowed to kill villains, and these restrictions are probably even more strict on those with provisional licenses. So, my guess is that Momo couldn't increase her doseage because she would risk killing Gigantomachia which is likely against the law.",1598918510

&gt;Unmarried partners may enter Germany from third countries which are not on the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù list for short-term visits to the partner living in Germany (Germans, EU citizens, nationals of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom or third-country nationals with a right of residence in Germany) when the general entry requirements (passport and visa, if applicable) are met, under the following conditions:

&gt;The couple is in a long-term relationship/partnership and both partners have met in person in Germany at least once or the couple had a previous shared residence in another country until recently.

&gt;Appropriate documents are to be produced on entering Germany as evidence of this (not in advance):

&gt;&gt;an invitation from the person living in Germany, as well as a copy of the identity documents of the person issuing the invitation,

&gt;&gt;a declaration of the existence of the relationship, signed by both partners and including the contact details of both partners, and

&gt;&gt;other suitable evidence of previous personal meetings, in particular passport stamps, travel documents / flight tickets or a shared residence in another country; additional documentation such as photos, social media posts, postal/email correspondence etc. may also be provided.

&gt;Regardless of the criteria stated above, the decision on whether to permit entry is at the discretion of the officers conducting border checks.

&gt;All travellers must still follow the quarantine requirements of the relevant federal state of Germany.

"CompetitiveHS","t5_31ns2","I literally just took this deck to legend and it was great. I can try shed some ideas on why it may not be working as well for you. 

First of all, I dislike **Polket** for the same reason as you. But you don't have to play it on curve - you probably are better off playing it as you run out of resources, not blindly on curve. 

**Hyena Alpha** can be tricky to maneuver in this deck. I try to combine it with Freezing Trap on turn 3 if the opponent has nothing on board which should almost guarantee pulling off the Hyena on turn 4. It's a fine turn 6 play as well if you have a secret in hand. I also don't like pulling it from Scavenger's Ingenuity so I am on board with cutting it, although I didn't feel Polket was strictly better.

**Phase Stalker** is too good not to run 2 of, but you need to shift your mindset from it being a 2 drop to it being a 4+ mana play. Although you pay 2 mana to hero power to pull a 2 mana secret, the value you generate by thinning out your deck is not worth nothing. I always toss Phase Stalker in the mulligan unless I also have Tour Guide in my opening hand. 

**Voracious Reader** is also much needed for this deck. You don't need to wait until it draws 3 for you, you can often play it for the single draw, or sometimes even no draw. The reason for that is now your opponent is incentivized to remove it, possibly at the cost of removing your other minions. That misdirection, coupled with the draw power makes it a must include in the deck.

General Tips:

- Play minions over using your Hero Power. 

- Take optimal trades, don't blindly go ""face"" just because it's a face deck.

- Play to the secrets you have in play. I would usually try kill my opponent's random 1/1 if it has the potential to proc my Freezing Trap when I would much rather Freezing hit a better target. Similarly with Pressure Plate, especially in the Libram Paladin matchup. If you clear their board of buff targets, when they invariable play a minion and buff it, Pressure Plate will kill it, essentially deleting their turn. But this can falter if you left their 1/1 up which might absorb the Plate hit rather than your preferred target. 

- Be aggressive in the mulligan. I generally only keep 1 Wolpertinger (if I have 2), Intrepid Initiate (especially on the coin with another 1 drop), Phase Stalker (only if I have Tour Guide), Dwarven Sharpshooter, Demon Companion.

You can't hear Cass tell Rapunzel she loves her at the end of the series and think that it's not just sisterly.

Calling them sisters is honestly kind of wrong. Rapunzel was raised by Gothel, yes, but this does not make Rapunzel Gothel's daughter, and this does not make them sisters. If we go by that logic, Cassandra is the captain's daughter. Remember the fact that Cassandra angrily rejected them being sisters. It was never brought up again.

I ship Cassunzel. It is my OTP. It's freaking adorable. I don't ship it platonically, but if you do, feel free.",1598918511

Somebody isn't gaining, because someone will need to pay for it! And they won't.

I thought money was something that I earn. You think money is something that someone else should earn for you. That's radical.

1970 had tremendous inflation, so I wouldn't pretend the 70s were the gold standard of economic policy. Government is expensive and they always take their cut. Believe it or not, nothing is free.

Prices aren't based on cost, they're based on what you have to spend.

The heart of the economy is producers dumbass. More spending isn't going to suddenly make things affordable.

You can't make everyone richer with political policy. It's impossible.

We avoid sales taxes all the time! You don't get to increase prices globally. I'll just buy my shit elsewhere, the same way I already buy labour elsewhere.

I suppose it depends on your perspective, though. Maybe since games used to be bought on physical media, you may not feel like a launcher is particularly important, but the vast majority of PC game sales these days are digital so I imagine the typical gamer who uses Linux will want to use the service that most supports the workflow they already know.",1598918511

In my novice practice, it seems more like I'm seeing peripheral awareness ""through"" my object of concentration, or even like I'm seeing the object *with* or *from* or *in* peripheral awareness. I feel like the concentration object (the breath) just rises up out of the periphery and sinks back down into it. Like I don't actually need to hold concentration in place.

Another thing I often tell clients is that they need to re-learn to trust their instincts. At the end of the day, we're all just animals. Animals all have survival instincts. In humans, jt looks like intuition. Over millennia we learned to identify what behaviors and types of people put us at risk. Even if you can't put your finger on why, your animal brain has begun to recognize that something with your mom is ""off."" That's what's happening when you have these thoughts about whether your mom might be abusive. Your instincts are trying to protect you!!! People who grow up in abusive or manipulative homes are taught an additional instinct: to ignore your survival instincts in order to perpetuate the dysfunction. So if I can only give you one more piece of advice, it's this:

Always trust your instincts- except for the one that says to ignore all the others. If a part of you ever feels scared, uneasy, unsafe, manipulated, or belittled it's because you are. Listen to that instinct and behave accordingly.",1598918513

At some point art and literature become a part of our collective cultural fabric and allowing companies to exclusively hold the rights to our cultural heritage effectively in perpetuity is absurd.

If a newcomer chucked a pan on hot and put some of the thinner bacon in, it'd overcook to the point of crumbling and snapping fairly soon after turning perfectly crispy. 

Personally I much prefer cooking it from a cold pan on a low-medium heat and do other prep while it slowly renders and eventually sizzles. Gives somewhat floppy bacon that is still super crispy and melt in the mouth.

"astrology","t5_2qi4c","Thanks for answering! Is the person you have interest in also a Taurus? My interest is a Sag rising. She lost her virginity at 16 and she's always been the type in my opinion to not lack for male attention. She's a deeper soul than I think she realizes though, but it isn't something she's really confronted and I believe I was the first to kind of awaken that in her. We didn't see each other for super long, but, in between the days we spent in-person we'd chat for 3-4 hours over FaceTime about everything (love, sex, marriage, astrology, religion, race, family, etc.) and it all felt natural. She shared with me she's never done that to the level she did it with me and how quickly we started talking about all that. Hell, I hate FaceTime but I *loved* chatting with her 3-4 hours on end. She noted that I was a deep, probing, semi-unorthodox thinker (my Venus is in Aquarius) with substance. She knows I can teach her a lot of things beyond the physical, and I know she can teach me a lot of things also. 

We'll see how the future goes. I'm not counting on her coming back but a part of me knows that this connection is real (she said it too) and connections like these just don't get immediately and forever discarded, they just take time sometimes to fully blossom. The universe may bring us back to each other at a different time. Perhaps the same is with you and your 5th house sun and Mars Aries gal ;)",1598918516

 Life is easier in the USA. It's more comfortable, it's easier to make money, and it's a consumer's paradise. As long as you don't get sick or have good health insurance then it's amazing here. The stereotype that all Americans eat is fast food is also nowhere near reality. I love French and Italian cuisine, but I can get (almost) everything that's offered in Europe back in the states. On the flip side, finding s decent gourmet hamburger involved a 4.5 hour car trip across a national border (Schengen zone, but still)@

On the other hand, I like being in Europe. There's less stress, there's less of a rat race (unless you live in London). The architecture is more to my liking, and cities from before WW2 are much more walkable than the ones stateside. Public transport works (I think maybe 3 major American cities can say the same thing). Also, I enjoy being ""the American"". European money doesn't register as real money to me, so I'm much more likely to enjoy myself without worrying about a budget. Spending EUR, DKK, PLN or CZK feels like spending fun tokens at an amusement park. Even if I'm working, I still feel like I'm on vacation when in the EU.

"QAnonCasualties","t5_1g87gi","\&gt;Finally, because of the QAnon conspiracies there is also a held belief from several born again conservative Christians that believe this is the end times. I think Christians are seeing some of these theories and tying it to end-times just around the corner-- the vaccine being the mark of the beast-- that maybe QAnon as well, anyone know? My wife and I are Christian and heck Jesus may return tomorrow but the point is no-one knows and they thought he would return after almost every big world event.

I'm a Christian too, just not a conservative one. I grew up in a fundamentalist church that was obsessed with the rapture and supposed end-time prophecies. We went the whole ""Thief In The Night"" and ""Late Great Planet Earth"" route. 

We were routinely taught a lot of things that I no longer believe including that Revelation is primarily a coded book of prophecies about what will happen at the end of earth's history, that Bible clearly teaches that ""the rapture"" is a thing, that the modern state of Israel's founding in 1948 started a prophetic clock ticking that would inevitably lead to the formation of a one world government, the rise of the anti-Christ and the defeat of the world's armies in the battle of Armageddon.

What's worse is that we were taught that these things were core doctrines, believed by any Christian who in good faith read the plain teachings of scripture. I now see that most of these are very late innovations that are really only believed by a certain strain of American evangelicals (and those churches around the world planted by 20th century American missionaries).

We grew up hearing bizarre conspiracy theories that were not exactly endorsed by our church, but were permitted (encouraged?) to flourish to the degree that they enhanced our commitment to the idea that the rapture was absolutely imminent.

Let's see. Here are a few I can remember:

* Gorbachev is the Anti-Christ, about to sign a seven year peace treaty with Israel that would lead to the Battle of Armageddon.
* \[Bar codes/microchips/credit cards/CD players\] are the mark of the beast. 
* Jesus would definitely return in \[1976/1984/1988/2000...\]
* One could line up bible verses in a grid and derive some sort of a word search ""Bible Code"" that proved something or other about prophecy
* Blood moons and other astronomical phenomena pointed to the dates of the rapture
* Daniel 7 could be decoded to predict specific end-time sequences and events
* There's a computer called ""The Beast"" in Austria, and it's tracking every human being alive
* There's a hole in Siberia that is an opening to Hell; it smells like sulphur, and you can hear people screaming
* The earth was created 8,000 years ago and scientists are conspiring with public schools to plant false evidence for evolution which is, of course, from the devil
* The European Union is the direct precursor of the predicted one-world government
* The Catholic Church is the whore of Babylon, and the pope would be the predicted ""false prophet""

Nearly every major news event was presented as fitting in perfectly with biblical prophecies. 

For a group of people who claimed to believe ""the Bible, the whole Bible and nothing but the Bible,"" we sure were heavily invested in extra-biblical teachings, driven by some weird gnostic impulse ‚Äî¬†WE had the secret knowledge. We were the insiders.

It's not at all surprising to hear that conservative American evangelicals are falling for new (and lightly repackaged) conspiracy theories. All it took was a few Bible verses and an appeal to a deep sense of persecution.

I'm sorry to hear it, but not at all shocked. You probably already know this, but I'll say it again: this isn't Christian doctrine, and conservative white American evangelicals are an aberration at the fringes of global (not to mention historical) Christianity.",1598918518

"dxm","t5_2r7ak","If you wanna tell people what you do, but diminish the stigma, then just don't be specific. You can broadly tell people that you ""use dissociatives."" If they're like ""wtf are those"" you can just explain that they're a category of psychoactives, and what the effects are.

Way better than telling people ""yo I chug cough syrup and trip balls"" lol. If they get nosy you can also always just say ""I use dextramethorphan."" Most people don't know what DXM is or that it's in cough syrup. Maybe they'll think you get it from a dealer.

As far as dissociatives themselves go, they'll naturally progress to be more culturally accepted over the next 5-10 years. Since Ketamine is undergoing clinical trials, once it becomes clinically available that'll help people to realize ""oh wow these drugs can be good?"" And since DXM is a dissociative, it'll get a buff in reputation by association.

As far as more recreational availability goes, consider that Robocough is still fairly recent. While I don't think it's sold in stores (anymore), it's still pretty available and the most palatable way of using DXM straight from a product. I mention this because Robocough may not be the end-all-be-all, as we may continue getting innovators who release DXM in more tolerable products, with the veiled intention of recreational use. I.e., something way better than Robocough may come out soon. Then maybe something after that. (Obviously I'm not someone who's concerned about DXM getting banned).",1598918518

3. Think of things as metaphors.  There doesn't have to be literal ""energies"" because using that language as a metaphor is still useful.
4. Science is sooooo important, but it still has limits on what it can explain (for now?).  Try coming to terms with that idea first, and maybe your rational mind will cut you some slack.
5. Humans evolved to develop stories, myths, religions, etc. Even though we have better forms of knowledge to explain the world, we are wired to have ""spiritual"" experiences. It can help us stay mentally healthy and balanced. So even if that is the only purpose witchcraft serves, than it is good for you.  Just like exercise and vegetables.

Yuqi is everywhere in variety (very popular with C-fans), Soojin has great popularity too with fancams and with other idols always shouting her out, Minnie has been gaining a ton of traction too due to Queendom and how charismatic she's been lately. Shuhua is great in their variety stuff for Neverlands but that's a bit different since I think with most people she might be overlooked if they're not a GIDLE fan. 

Soyeon's had an advantage due to how she's built up her reputation in PD101 and Unpretty Rapstar 3 but even given that the rest of the group is by no means falling behind at all. It's good that she had eyes on her before GIDLE's debut maybe it helped with their popularity at the start.

 I get that she leads the group, produces/composes their music but while I haven't watched much of their content lately due to IRL stuff, Soyeon is usually the one who does the least amount of Vlives and appears the least in their behind the scenes stuff so people usually get happy when she has a section. So I honestly think the group is actually well balanced and not too far off from each other.

GIDLE is still young and they've come out swinging upwards in trajectory recently so I think they'll be fine. 

I can't speak about the other groups you mentioned because Miss A is pretty far back from when I started listening to Kpop and I'm not familiar with Gugudan at all. I know people like to compare their situation to 4minute as well but I don't think GIDLE is like that.",1598918519

Liability waivers and informed consent cover the rest, but sometimes people do get sued over unusual injuries or extreme and unsafe conduct.

The dog will instinctively doggy paddle, keeping it's head up, and the vest will ensure the dog never goes below the water. 

Overall seems pretty harmless. Dude was on top of getting the dog and if he hadn't I'm sure it all would have ended well.

Where I disagree with you is when you say water isn't that dangerous. In this example, yes the water is pretty safe. Try telling the people who lived through Katrina or the T≈çhoku tsunami that water ""isn't as dangerous"" as you think",1598918521

Suffice it to say, bats have hella unique anatomy in so many ways, and while I can't definitively say what sounds they CAN do, I know they cannot do rounded vowels or bilabial consonants, not counting [m] because usually they can close their ""lips"" completely.

And my definition of orientation is identical to yours, which is precisely why I'm struggling with this label. I really want to understsnd it, and I get how people who don't know what they feel want to feel included in *some* orientation group nowadays. Labels are cool, fluidity is even better. I just don't think there is an actual need for a label that basically tells the other person ""I don't know what I feel towards you"". If you say you're aromantic then you don't ever feel romantic feelings for someone, if you're demi, you feel them only after having established a strong emotional connection. If you're quoiromantic you know you might feel something but aren't sure.

"NoFapChristians","t5_2ysnf","Definitely not. It has always been this way, we're just more aware. People have always been doing each other before marriage. Even the majority of people, it just wasn't talked about as much. The old testament even has a way to legally rectify this if two couples don't wait until marriage. 

Paul even says in the new testament ""If you can't wait. Get married"" essentially. Which definitely indicates a culture that is aware of sex before marriage.

In Victorian England, ""No sex before marriage"" was only enforced with rich women who had to maintain their ability to inherit something. Men could romp around in brothels with nothing more than a slap on the wrist or a disapproving look.

Each generation has their own way of covering up uncomfy sexual things nobody wants to talk about. And all it does is perpetuate the exact problems that make those sexual things uncomfy. Much like the problem with porn addiction and it's vicious cycle, cultures and people create generational cycles, beleiving that this time, if they withhold sexual information from their kids, they can be proud of their sexual restraint. 

It's just not realistic. No culture, no government, no religion, etc. will ever stop people from having sex. it is a basic human instinct. What we can do, is educate young people so things like teenage pregnancies dont happen. Also to educate young people so they don't normalize sexually abusive behaviors and relationships in their lives. Thats it. That's all we can do.",1598918522

"zen","t5_2qhmf","I think this relates to one of my favourite sections from Huangbo's Transmission of Mind:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Q: Knowledge cannot be used to destroy knowledge, nor a sword to destroy a sword. \[The questioner seems to have coined a paradox of the kind Huang Po was fond of using, perhaps as an indication of some fancied advancement towards the truth.\]  
&gt;  
&gt;A: Sword DOES destroy sword - they destroy each other - and the no sword remains for you to grasp. Knowledge DOES destroy knowledge - this knowledge invalidates that knowledge - and then no knowledge remains for you to grasp. It is as though mother and son perished together. \[This passage is especially profound. Transcendental knowledge invalidates relative knowledge, but the former is then found to be no knowledge in the ordinary sense, for knower and known are seen to be one.\]

So often we see the sentiment 'the eye can't see the eye' - I think this is a great one to avoid that nest. To me it goes with the quote you gave: ""Mind does not see mind; to get it, you must not see it as mind. "" Also master Yantou (Treasury of the Eye #2):

&gt;When being as such, you equally break through all affirmation and negation: as soon as it is as such, then it is not so, immediately changing, round and round. If you do not see through 'this,' as soon as someone sticks you in the eye you'll stare one-eyed, like a slaughtered sheep that hasn't yet died.",1598918522

"manhwa","t5_2th0f","I just finished this manhwa yesterday and I loved every part of it!!! Susan and her maid was a total asshat.

I get what you‚Äôre trying to say but don‚Äôt forget that from the beginning Adelaide was never one of those 100% rainbows and sunshine girls.

She had a great personality from the start but everything she did was to benefit both the duke and herself. If you look at the maid who was about to get kicked out, it‚Äôs clear that Adelaide had the capacity for manipulation, there are other schemes where this can be seen but that‚Äôs where you can see her manipulation clearly.

As for why she treated the duke like that in the last few chapters; there were a lot of hints that she is a jealous woman when it comes to the duke but she‚Äôs never doubted his love from the beginning. Adelaide is from the modern world so she was probably thinking how people don‚Äôt know how precious something is until it‚Äôs gone.

This is happening in a medieval time setting so a lot of politics goes into relationships especially since she‚Äôs going to marry a duke. You can probably brush this off by thinking ‚Äúshe‚Äôs from modern world so politics shouldn‚Äôt matter‚Äù but she was also raised in that setting as well so she knows a good deal about how things works and so long as rumours about how the relationship was Saint vs Adelaide to be with the duke sticks around, some people will always assume their marriage is a sham. Pretty sure the people around the duke and Adelaide understands this as well and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre kinda on board-ish with the plan

When choosing between two books, do you pick fiction or non fiction? Most people choose fiction cause it‚Äôs more entertaining, that‚Äôs basically how rumours works.",1598918523

More recently I have had better conversations with non-medics who come from medical families and have medical friends so they have a better understanding of my career compared to a complete lay-person but are generally nicer people than the medics I have spoken to from muzmatch/minder/ [shadi.com](https://shadi.com) etc.

I'm selling this watch to help contribute to a house downpayment.  We recently had a new addition to our family and we're busting out of our apartment.  Given that I am a first-time seller, I am happy to FaceTime, meet in-person, or sell through Paypal G&amp;S for a 3% fee.

[Pics and Video](https://imgur.com/a/Vp2JDMo) | [Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/vZHFB7T)

Longtime lurker, but first-time seller.  I am selling a ***Tudor Pelagos LHD (""LHD"")*** with the full kit, which retails for $4,575.00.  Along with the watch, the buyer will receive the original rubber straps.  The LHD line is individually numbered on the back making it highly collectible and unique.  The crystal is in perfect condition and the watch bracelet has minor desk-diving marks.

Considered by most avid watch collectors as one of the best modern dive watches for the value, the Tudor Pelagos is the first titanium watch released by the Rolex-Tudor family.  This is by far the most comfortable watch I've worn due to the light titanium and micro adjustments.  I purchased this watch in February 2020 and it runs smoothly (+/- 2 seconds).  

**Movement:** In-house MT5612-LHD COSC certified (+/- 2 secs/day)

**Power Reserve:** 70 hours

**Dimensions:** 42 x 50mm

I can imagine it being frustrating and even our own projectors have limits(if we can't correct it to actually fit the picture, the problem is literally the DCP and the ratio format we were given).

There is also one more thing to account for and that is Scope vs Flat. Scope WOULD allow us to adjust a lot more but Flat can squeeze the picture back in.

I can imagine the hundreds of complaints coming in now and they've probably already requested a fixed DCP to correct it. It might have been sent as a mistake too hence the issues.

To perform the base-12 method you use your thumb as a pointer while counting off the pads of your fingers. Starting with your thumb touching the top of your pinky you move down, continue with the top of your ring finger, and so on. This allows you not only to count higher but also allows for quick mental math as your fingers are already divided into 3 down and 4 across.

Canadians would get more money if they undercut American businesses. But you are right in one way: they could make more money *per unit* if they sold at US prices. The problem is that if you sell only 100 units at a x, but you could be selling 1000 units at .8x, you would make a lot more money selling the 1000 units than the 100 units.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","Source that Trump consistently had more media coverage than Clinton:
https://shorensteincenter.org/news-coverage-2016-general-election/

Obama was also getting more press than Clinton in 2008:
https://www.journalism.org/2008/03/03/pej-campaign-coverage-index-february-25-march-2-2008/

And here's a data-driven analysis of how news coverage and polls affect each other.  The basic takeaway is that there's a feedback loop where news coverage causes a bump in the polls, which then causes news outlets to pay attention more, which then causes the candidate to gain in popularity...and on and on, but the bumps in popularity are not affected by whether the coverage is good or bad.
https://www.niemanlab.org/2016/01/how-much-influence-does-the-media-really-have-over-elections-digging-into-the-data/

The rest was observation from when I was actually there and watched the winners dominate the news cycles and the conversation.  Obama was at the head of every news cycle, even with the negative press about William Ayers and Jeremiah Wright.  McCain struggled to get anyone to pay attention to him, even his scandals.  Michael Moore made a freaking documentary about George W. Bush in 2004.  The most John Kerry got was a swift boat commercial.  In 2016, I was BEGGING people to stop talking about Trump because I knew it could help him win.  They didn't stop, and I was not surprised when he won.",1598918527

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","Here's the reality:  


You passed the skills test, you got the interview. They know you can do the job. In this area you're a success. A lot of people don't get to that stage.  


Now the difficult part that you don't want to hear:  


The interview process is a social test. They want to see if they like you as a person, will they want to talk to you on a frequent basis, will you be easy to get along with or will you be difficult to deal with? This is where you are failing. I'm sure you're a nice person, but I'm taking an educated guess here (remember, I deal with this all day) that you're oversharing somewhere in the interview process. This is what's turning them off.   


On the next interview try a different approach. Say little to nothing about yourself, ask a lot of questions, and every answer should be as positive as possible without actually saying much of anything. If you've watched a lot of YouTube videos about interviews you've probably noticed how many of the answers are given in meaningless phrases. This is what you should aim for, it's about demonstrating that you can be pleasant as possible while really just interested in what the other person has to say. If you've mentioned any of the things you mention above (such as ""homeless"" ""special needs"" etc) this is going to be a red flag for one or more of the people interviewing you. This is about going in and faking it. I'm sure this may be hard to hear but I see it all the time and I really want you to succeed, so please take it to heart and think about how to best approach this before your next opportunity.

If you enjoy sports, ask your friends/group out. Be it swimming, gymming, badminton etc. Usually people bond over activities. 

For me, I use humour to make friends. I will memorise jokes/memes and share them (10/10 works). If you are  a gamer (pc/mobile), can jio people to play together. Can go some sushi/pizza place where the waiting time is long, then play the game (if mobile) to kill time, bam friendship. 

If you like supper, can ask them go run together then get food. Everybody loves food (as far as I know). 

All in all, you also must know where is your limit. Is your social battery enough to hang out once a week? Bi weekly? Once a month? If you are schooling, you get more chances to eat lunch/dinner with your friends/group. 

Be courteous to everyone, don‚Äôt look/sound desperate. If people ask if you looking for girlfriend/boyfriend (don‚Äôt know which way you bend), probably can insert ‚Äúwhy, you got someone to intro me ah?‚Äù then laugh it off.

"TheLastAirbender","t5_2rybx","I think because they have the most trouble with the element that‚Äôs most opposite of their personalities/their first element they learned. 

Korra had trouble with Air for her lack spirituality in the beginning.

Aang had the most trouble with Earth or Fire depending how you look at it. Because he‚Äôs not a rock headed person who stands their ground, Airbending is all about defense and moving around. Then Fire he has only been super aggressive when he‚Äôs been pissed and I don‚Äôt think he likes being angry. And again Airbending is all defense, not offense. 

And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that both have been the last element in the chain because the 2 elements they learn before the last one help them understand the last element. 

And tradition, I think the order became tradition because of the above. And the last Avatar becomes their primary Avatar mentor because again the whole ‚Äúthey are from the last element they have to learn‚Äôs culture‚Äù.

Whether condo or house, you'll continue to have expenses even once the mortgage is paid off. Taxes, insurance, HOA/POA, maintenance, etc etc. 

Sounds like a condo could be for you. Be sure to budget for the HOA fee to rise with not only inflation, but perhaps more than that based on what it covers and how solvent they are.

Not really. Whole-body, like the RR, typically does the same thing from session to session.

When routines switches between exercises, it is to preferentially target different muscles, and is usually not important in a complete beginner routine (which is what the RR is).

&gt; I believe this helps me perform better as there is more rest between exercises

Not how this works. The muscles worked need rest, not the exercise. That's why the RR has a rest day between sessions.

If you're doing squats in A and B, you're still working your quads, even if the movement pattern is different.

&gt; and I'm also enjoying the variation.

That's fine. If you prefer it this way stick with it.

&gt; At the same time, I'm worried that it might just mean I'm progressing slower than necessary. 

What's more important, being motivated to work out because of variety, or progress? I'd adjust based on which is more important.

"AskTrumpSupporters","t5_3cr3o","Warning, I‚Äôm going to be using you in a general sense here as part of a thought experiment of sorts. Please don‚Äôt take it personally.  It will make sense, I hope. 

Plenty of troubled areas have loosened non violent crime laws, it hasn‚Äôt stopped the violence. When it comes to policing, I find that the BLM narratives, and things like it, to be clearly arguing from a conclusion. They say police are the problem, that black men are the victims, and then they go and cherry pick things to support that. 

The other approach would be to look at crime and police broadly and then look to see where the biggest problems and opportunities for improvement are, and then focus on those. If anyone did that, they wouldn‚Äôt come to any of the kinds of conclusions that are being popularized today. 

First you would see the violence that we know is happening. Right there you would see that the crime and poverty are linked, but of course areas that are chaotic and violent are poor. There can be no other improvements when violence and trauma reign. Social workers and the like aren‚Äôt magically immune from crime. 

So, you deal with the crime, and first you would look at where crime is happening, and where it is but where you can‚Äôt see it. Right away violence against women would stand out, especially when you take into account how much male to male violence revolves around women and how much organized crime and drug dealing revolves around exploiting women. 

So, you would want to make women safer. There is no amount of welfare that can make up for being beaten and raped on a regular basis. You would want to impose gun laws that allowed women to protect themselves but that put a check on dangerous men. You would want law abiding men to continue to be able to bear arms because they will contribute to an overall safer environment. 

You would then want to improve police, so that they were better at catching criminals, better at treating women right, better at self policing, and better at understanding sexual trauma. You would be concerned about the women who are raped by police, about the women who aren‚Äôt believed by police, and about the women who are failed when police aren‚Äôt used to stamp out violence. 

Right now the left should be refining their theories on rape culture to deal with actual violence. They should be loudly pushing back against a gangster culture that celebrates violence as against women and even views it as a form of reparations, encouraging racial violence and hatred. Look at the rape happening in this country, and the murders, and then look at the racial breakdowns and the under reporting of sexual violence. 

We are experiencing a mass of hate crimes against white women and their families and then we complain about tiny amounts of racism (which obviously isn‚Äôt the answer to anything, but we have encouraged the restarting of a cycle of racial mob violence and it isn‚Äôt worse because most people are good people regardless of race and don‚Äôt want this). These same white women have to turn to a system that is very political for help, they are ignored, and they are far more likely to be raped by a cop than a man of any race is to be shot by one. 

It‚Äôs not just white women getting hurt, it‚Äôs a lot of women, in a lot of places, including in our inner cities. This personal sexual violence traumatizes families and leads to more crime. Things like rape, divorce, sexual abuse, domestic abuse, witnessing violent crime, being a victim of it, or even having to defend yourself from it are all far more likely to have dramatic effects on you long term than having a certain skin color. 

The reason so many blacks are struggling in this country is that so many are traumatized or otherwise struggling from the effects of crime, trauma, and serious family dysfunction. 

We should be looking at the ugly reality of violence in this country, we should be addressing that, and we should be protecting women, which would mean making all of our communities safer and working to deal with this issue long term because it‚Äôs a big issue and there will be no immediate cheap fix that comes in flowery packaging. 

We should not be ruining a women‚Äôs life for threading to call the cops and give a description when a man is being inappropriate and threatening to her. We shouldn‚Äôt be outlawing women from making such a call. We shouldn‚Äôt be celebrating a man who broke into a woman‚Äôs house with a gang of thugs. We shouldn‚Äôt be rushing to attack police whenever a man who is threatening or who has a history of violence to women is shot in a domestic violence call. We shouldn‚Äôt be encouraging women to go to riots where they could be raped, and we certainly shouldn‚Äôt be trying to defund police or focus reform efforts solely on protecting violent men. 

BLM is the new misogyny. It‚Äôs hurting women, it‚Äôs hurting the black community, and it‚Äôs hurting America. It‚Äôs also an outgrowth of the attitudes of the left wing academic, the social worker, and the Democrat politicians who have spent decades failing to meaningfully help women or blacks live safer, less traumatic lives, and who have instead came up with things micro aggressions, defunding the police, and teaching men not to rape, as if that was the problem. We don‚Äôt need more delusional narratives to justify past failures, or to maintain the narcissistic sense of superiority and victimhood that is shared widely amongst criminals and those who enable them.",1598918531

"popheads","t5_39nwj","For me, currently it's a tie. 

Allie X, Cape God: This album is a conceptual masterpiece. The persona this album exudes is fully embodied from start to finish. I haven't seen such commitment, such a flat out creative turn in pop like that in a while, probably not since Born To Die. Allie plays a character throughout, that takes the shape of the song she's in, but managing to stake each song lyrically and production wise, both the personal and fiction, to the root of the album which centers around addiction and disease. 

Jessie Ware, What's Your Pleasure?: This is how it's done girlies. Jessie Ware isn't just coopting disco, 70s pop elements, she is living in them, yet managing to bring a modern day longingly sensual sophistication to each track. This album is a perfect mix of mischievous sensuality and late night passion. It captures a feeling so effortlessly and longingly, it's an album I'll long be playing into the future. 

And then there is Donna Missal with Lighter which is not my favorite album this year, but comes pretty damn close. A brilliant follow up, and a superb evolution. No slips or skips on the album. This point deserves its own distinction, her voice is singular in pop. 

No other way to say it. Period. Her lyrical point of view is ASTOUNDING and she should have far more attention than she does.",1598918531

Lose a leg, get a prosthetic. You have now accommodated yourself to be able to walk.

Lose your hearing, well there's other options besides giving you hearing. Why do we need hearing? To talk? Ok, there's sign language, text, writing, the occasional creative gesture. To drive? No, driving is all visual. To listen to music? Turn it up till your already broken eardrums burst so you can feel the vibrations. 

There's no need for accommodations when a lot of solutions already exist. They're not against hearing aids. A lot of folks use them for ambient noise.

There's a thing called Deaf Pride. They don't think they're broken because they're not. Yes, communication is more challenging but it's like that with CIs, too (they're not perfect, it takes a while to get them just right and it's not the same as regular hearing. It's robotic.)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prizes_for_evidence_of_the_paranormal

There are *many* reasons why a person might think they are experiencing something paranormal. Let's just take seeing/hearing weird things as an example. Look here at all the different reasons a person could have hallucinations:

https://www.healthline.com/health/hallucinations

https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hallucinations/

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090113203901.htm

We have minds and the ability to use them. Let's not simply chalk up everything strange to spooky ""paranormal."" I understand the conditioning, Watchtower pounding this stuff into peoples' heads for hours per week, every week, ever year since they were children in most cases. It's something that needs to be actively undone, it doesn't go away on it's own. A person needs to prove to themselves the facts, and it will undo Watchtower's conditioning bit by bit. Save the things that make sense to you, so that you can go back and read them if/when you start feeling unsure again. And don't let that fluctuation make you feel like you're not progressing, one day you won't even bother asking yourself ""what if JWs are right"" because you just know they're not.

It was about time Yagoo learns that the usual ""sweep the controversy under the rug while the talent is suspended and it will go away"" approach from the idol industry is not going to work every time. It's as he doesn't understand how different internet idols and internet in general are from the usual ""3D"" world and industry. It's a shame that Mano had to fall for that to became apparent...Now we have to wait and see if Yagoo learned from it and found a better way to deal with antis.

Also, the agencies should really learn to put the foot down and openly stand behind their talents when they are targeted by haters. Bowing down before them will do more harm than good in the long term. Dealing with their crap is not something idols should do on their own, they need a clear, open support from their agency and if that includes showing teeth at potential payers who create more trouble than their support is worth, then be it. You stomp some troublemakers, and gain many more supporters in return.

I know Cover is still relatively fresh in these waters (just like any other vtuber agency, this whole thing is just taking off), but boy, they need to learn *fast* before more of this crap happens. This Mano incident is a big stain on Cover...",1598918533

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I've seen tones of shows like that too, and I wish they could focus on other cases because of how graphic they are.  Either that, or make a show that is dedicated to those rape and murder case.  I hate to say it, but no one would watch it, or I don't know.  Those cases piss me off too because of all the stuff they do to the women when they are done with them.  They basically kill them and dismember them and bury them in the woods.

There was an arm bone found in the northern part 9f my state and they took DNA and found out that she was a prostitute from my local city in the early eighties.  So someone's out there that definately knows who she is and how she got there.  The whole skeleton was revealed buried near by.  It was really scary and eye opening.  There's no way to tell if some of these killers have done it once or multiple times.  Many of the crimes remain unsolved and forgotten under loads of files on a computer.  Police would have to connect the murders to one person, which is what it usually ends up being.  A lot of the times too, the murderers confess to the murders as part of a plea bargain.  Better conditions in jail and loosening never being housed with the general population because they would probably be murdered or maybe on death row.  That's the point of the plea bargain, telling them the location of many of the women to have closure of the case, just so the murderer has better conditions in jail.  It works, even though they don't really deserve it, they basically confess to the murders that law enforcement might not have even known about.  Finding different kissing people.  It's their strategy and they would not have the information any other way.  Serial killers probably know this as they are being charged.  They probably research the punishment for such crimes and will always opt to confess because it lessens their charges.  

I don't know why I got off on serial killers, but you mentioned true crime, so I thought I'd tell you.  They also call in forensic psychologists who specialize in diagnosing them as psychopaths, which isn't a definition that is easy to make.  A lot of crimes are still done under pure hate and anger, those are the ones where the victim knew the assailant.  

Just last week I was listening to the radio and it was reporting about all the sex offenders that can't be found.  They had previously registered and failed to re register, so they couldn't be found.  You have many of them that are out there that no one really knows because they can't track them.  Once they become absconders they flee to another part of the country and are found years later living in a different state.  Law enforcement is way behind on that.  I think numbers are as high as 40%, as many of them simply can't be found.  Usually what's supposed to happen is they are supposed to go to jail for not registering again, but sometimes they don't.  A man that raped his step daughter years ago was found in a retirement home in a different state.  I think it was actually a veterans retirement home, which is really fucked up.  He has been around a bunch of people that don't know who he is or what he has done.  Cops are way behind on this.",1598918534

"nba","t5_2qo4s","People always say he gets a ton of respect and honestly, he kind of does, but imo Dirk is seriously underrated. In today's NBA he'd be a KD-level player, there's zero doubt in my mind that Dirk would absolutely crush the League. 

His ts% has been consistently around 5-7% higher than league average, even with his somewhat inefficient shot selection (Dirk made those shots efficient though). A top 3 scorer in the league shooting that much better than his peers is All-Time great level of play and people are quick to forget that Dirk put up 23-26ppg on a relevantly slower pace (between 10-20 fewer possessions per game in the 2000s). 

In the era of gritty defensive-minded teams Dirk managed to shoot with elite efficiency all while teams took around half the 3p fga compared to today. Dirk is a career 38% 3p shooter and had 7 seasons (rounded) where he shot 40% or more from 3. Yeah he'd be fucking the modern league up. Dirk lead the league several times in win shares, win shares per 48 and had the best offensive BPM rating several times, he did all of these things in the playoffs as well.

Before LeBron took over with the Heat Dirk used to regularly win the vote for ""Hardest player to guard / Player you have to prepare the most for"" in the league polls. IIRC executives and coaches voted for this particular question. In the 2000s Dirk ""won"" this poll a lot. Says a lot about his actual play imo.",1598918534

1. The 40 Year Old Virgin - the three OG's in Bill, CR, and Fennessey talking about one of the funniest movies ever made and giving a lot of context to the movie and actors' careers

1. The Town - it's been discussed enough on here, debatably Russillo's podcast apex other than some Throne Games episodes during last year's playoffs",1598918534

"techsupport","t5_2qioo","It's not unusual at all.  Different games will require different amounts of CPU power.  Unless you have some technical work you do with the PC like 3D rendering or video editing, games will use more CPU than anything else.

There is no terrible downside to it.  Higher usage will cause the CPU to run hotter, and after a time, and I mean many, many years if not a decade or more, it can shorten the life of a CPU just as heat shortens the life of anything electronic.  Chances are no matter how hard you use it, it will be long since obsolete before it actually quits working.

The only real CPU usage problem is when it goes to 100% and stays there.  In that case that means your game may not be running as fast as it could because your processor isn't powerful enough.  The only game I own that could approach that on a 9400f is Far Cry 5 and it is by far the most CPU intensive game I've ever seen.  Still it probably wouldn't max out a 9400F.  (It pushes all 8 cores of my 9700K up to 70% or so at times with spikes even higher).

So, unless your CPU is actually overheating, it's nothing to worry about.  It's designed to run at 100% and it won't hurt it.",1598918534

I don't see this as much of a problem.  A lot of the reason we haven't achieved the type of wealth that Ayn Rand dreamed of is because people are too fearful of ""the establishment"" to do anything different.

That's basically what the charter school was for, the kids whose parents didn't want them bused to the black school and weren't assigned to the good elementary school.  Slowly the city started making the colored schools into ""magnet"" schools, which sort of diffused some of the anger.

That said, they may have bused black kids in, but I remember that in first grade not being allowed to walk across the cafeteria to say hi.  I'd gotten to school early so the kids from the bus and I were the only ones there.

I had to sit at a table and they had to stand or sit along the wall.  True to the teachers' words, none of them were still at the school a month later.

They took a couple of the ideas, and most just flopped.  In part because they wanted everything all at once, rather than develop it more organically over time; they weren‚Äôt interested in building relationships and a presence within the local community; and they wanted to charge money for services that Pitt State did for free, considering it a service to fans and the community.

If you are doing this private party (which I assume because a dealership at least a reputable one won't do this) then you could do it if you are only borrowing up to the bill of sale amount. Potentially a bank may fund you beyond the purchase price if they really believe the car is worth more.

That being said, the DMV will review what you disclose and pay tax on and if they think it's too low they will just assess you tax on what they think it is worth, which you will need to pay unless you can prove the car is worth the bill of sale amount.

‚ÄúOn September 18, 2016, during the Gold final start we experienced an accident involving our F1 racer, ‚ÄòHot Stuff‚Äô and a fellow competitor‚Äôs airplane.

We were number four on the starting grid, which was the middle inside position with three aircraft on the front row, one to our right and three behind. Upon running the engine up in anticipation of the start, about 20 seconds before the green flag drop, the engine was not running well enough for flight, as you can hear from the audio, never mind racing. I made the decision to shut the engine down to signal the starters to halt the starting process. The flagman on my row put his hands in an ‚ÄòX‚Äô over his head, as our procedures prescribe, and I opened my canopy to make it clear I was out of the race and so everyone could see me. The alternate airplane was signaled to taxi on to the runway to replace my entry. I felt confident the communications had reached the appropriate people and waited for personnel to push me off the runway.

However, much to my surprise, I saw the flagman run out on to the runway waving his hands over his head as if something was wrong. The aircraft to my right started rolling and a few seconds later the number six and eight aircraft flew by me on either side. All I could do at that point was hope the number seven (center) aircraft would clear me on the centerline to my right.

The impact was violent and loud. His left leading edge shaved off the top several inches from my vertical and skimmed the turtle-deck without touching until it impacted my right hand holding up the canopy, at well over sixty miles an hour. The left landing gear hit the top of the gull-wing center-section, blowing a hole in the top skin and impacted the rear face of the front spar so hard that it broke the landing gear clean off his airplane. The propeller sliced three evenly spaced gashes about mid span of my right wing, about a foot apart. The right landing gear sheared the wing off just short of the right wingtip. The impact spun me around nearly 180¬∫, like a teacup ride at warp eight. The other aircraft came to rest several hundred feet in front of me with a folded gear, damaged wing and sheared propeller facing the other way as well. That pilot received no injuries.

Three things immediately came to mind. Make yourself as small as possible to avoid further injury until things stop moving. Once the aircraft came to rest, DON‚ÄôT MOVE! And since I was not on fire, wait for help to arrive. I knew my hand was busted and was not looking forward to removing my glove. But it was more important to make sure I had not been struck in the head or hurt my neck or back. After assessing my situation I realized I did not have any further injuries and proceeded to shut the switches off and assist with un-strapping myself from the wreckage. Help was there very quickly, including my flagman.

Then I proceeded to ask the condition of the other pilot and how this had happened. The video should speak for itself. My next concern was to let my crew know I was OK. The one thing any spectator looks for in an accident are the correct number of flight suits walking around the wreckage after any crash, I made sure I did. Everything else can be fixed. Reno EMS quickly patched me up with a splint and had me walking back to my pit in no time. They really are good at what they do.

Hot Stuff suffered severe damage. It‚Äôll be several months before we figure out what to do with her. I‚Äôm not the slightest bit upset over the accident. I, in fact, consider myself a very lucky man. Another four feet to the left and I would have been minced meat. Literally dodging a bullet. A busted up hand is a small price to pay. I‚Äôll take it. It‚Äôll heal. Though it is difficult to type one-handed.

I‚Äôve said many times before and I‚Äôll say it again, there‚Äôs risk in everything we do. But the counterpart to that is reward. I choose to cross the street because the risk of crossing the street is worth the reward of getting to the other side. Same thing with air racing, I‚Äôll be back. Of course there‚Äôll be a review of procedures, how to prevent something like this from happening again and a thorough investigation. I‚Äôve used up another of my nine lives, but why would you have nine unless you plan to use them?‚Ä¶ We live, learn and race on.‚Äù

The skyscale however only costs a minimum of 35g if you make everything needed yourself and didnt buy anything. You need 6 lws4 currencies at max, 250, 1500 i believe trade contracts, then 250 volatile magic with the 250 map currencies.

Given he willingly came out from another state and was antagonizing (thus escalating tensions) and creating a situation where force was involved may affect the ruling quite a bit. At the least I imagine the prosecution will bring it up. A lot of people dont realize that many state's stand your ground laws dont apply if you willingly put yourself into a violent situation. It is ""stand your ground"" or ""back to the wall"" not ""Time to create excuses to shoot people.""

I feel like its really difficult to nail down if you don't accurately express yourself to them, requiring a huge amount of self-awareness.   


They mainly disagreed with the therapist because I never show any signs of mania. I honestly don't even know what that really means and what it is defined by. I just know that for the last three months, I have been able to document a week in each month that I had a mood swing lasting about a week where I'm deeply depressed. Online for bipolar type 2 you have to have a depressive episode for at least 2 weeks in order to be diagnosed with bipolar type 2. Mine only lasts one week. So that's why they didn't diagnose bipolar type 2.  


Before that I wouldn't have ever considered bipolar type 2, nor did I ever catch the intervals between times where I had this mood swing, although I have had this type of mood swing for a long time over the past ten years. I just never documented the intervals between them",1598918539

Like much of the rest of the report, it appears to be motivated by a grudge, as opposed to any actual substance - all that is said is Lansman scored higher on the pre-interview matrix. How much higher we don't know, but who's to say Matthews didn't come across better in the interview? If you're always going to pick the person who scores higher initially - why bother interviewing at all?

I asked our industrial design team about this and here's what the team director (Shin) said:

&gt;This is definitely one of those situations where there's a distinct trade-off, we could re-orientate the logo, but once you have the RAD installed on the top, the logo will be upside down. We could change the logo orientation on the cable bar, but the ideal vertical orientation is when the logo is facing upward instead of facing down. I guess it's also more of a standard industry practice to have the logo facing up.  
&gt;  
&gt;We actually thought about making the logo removable to address issues like this but it's just added cost.

"BravoRealHousewives","t5_2v6dk","Yes, it was Denise's fault the season was cut short. A singular storyline is fine. Look at NYC season 9. Imagine if Bethenny sent a C&amp;D. There would be nothing going on.

This sub loved those seasons too. If Kyle sent a C&amp;D and got the season cut short this sub would be rallying to get her fired.

At the end of the day, the season was cut short because of Denise. BH had a lot going on early on the season it just so happens Denise became the center towards the end.

The Night Hag can't deal much damage for its CR, but, like the oni, it can disguise itself. It can also shift to the ethereal plane at will and, while there, if it touches a PC for an hour or longer (which it can do from the ethereal plane), their hit point maximum decreases until it's restored by greater restoration or a better spell. There's really nothing that puts dread into players' hearts like knowing they can't sleep safely. Oh, and the hag can planeshift if they somehow manage to catch her out.

Definitely. The point that I was maybe not clear enough earlier is that a long usage session(4-5 hours) is just enough *day one brand new* from $250 Airpod Pros out of the box before you have to charge again.

The cheaper Airpods yeah I guess but for $250?? They should last long enough to be able to handle almost every realistic scenario you throw at them for several years like competition even WITH battery degradation like cheaper can competition in my opinion. (Buds+ vs Airpod Pros). 

The Samsung alternatives to Apple's accessories(Buds/Watches) generally last longer by a decent amount.

"TorahChristian","t5_30w81t","So Jesus is the final product of the law of righteousness. That makes sense, because the Crucifixion was the final blood sacrifice. Verses 6-9 seem to me to be a profession that only God can redeem fallen Mankind, that the righteous in faith proclaim that Jesus redeemed our fallen natures. Verse ten drives this home: if you believe rightly, then you proclaim Jesus as the Redeemer. Jews and Gentiles are equally redeemed.

To me, verses 1-4 are clearly against anyone who says Jesus was not the Messiah. The [Leviticus 18:5 reference](https://www.biblestudytools.com/kjv/leviticus/18-5.html) in verse 5 is about Torah Law, and so verse 6 draws a clear comparison between the letter of the Law and the spirit of the Law, justice not in works but in faith. So, I don't think Paul is making a statement for or against Torah Law here, just asserting that the only way it could have been fulfilled was for a perfect sacrifice, the new Adam and unblemished lamb of God, to be offered to God. I think all Christians, Jew or Gentile, confess that Jesus, and not the old order of the Law, saved them, and that's what Paul insists on in this chapter: the rest of Romans 10 discusses the urgency of all peoples to hear of their Redemption, [whether people obey the Gospel or not.](https://www.biblestudytools.com/kjv/romans/10-16.html) Have I understood poorly?",1598918547

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","I'd like to take this chance to reach out to people wondering what to do with this broken oppressive system, no matter your country and share the book ""the most dangerous superstition"" by larken rose, where the author talks about how the myth of authority is one of the main reasons why we as a planet have become enslaved as a whole, the many under the control of the few, effectively a slavery system held in place by our belief in the myth. He goes to great lengths to explain why government is actually the slavemaster who allows or denies what we can and cannot do and and commands what we have to do while we are the slaves who's freedom has to be begged and granted by the slavemaster

He explains how it is morally and logically imposible for individuals to have the right to do things that others cannot do just because a ritual was made, that's is, passed into law, like killing, taking money without consent and kidnapping. 

Maybe the real option could be to wake up and completly stop believing in the myth that there should be a higher power ruling over us and imposing its will on us, putting us in a one way agreement contract that they force on us the moment we live until the day we die. To take back our liberty and work for ourselves and not for slavemaster. 


Overall it's a book that might wake you up from the illusion of authority and make you see that the idea of ""government"" is one of the biggest mental prisons we have been put into and it is us who give it the power and resources to allow it to exist and enslave us.
You can buy the book or find it for free in many places, here's a free audiobook version

Economically speaking, fascism was Keynesianism on steroids mixed with imperialism. [Goebbels and the rest of the Nazis were economically inspired by FDRs new deal. ](https://youtu.be/sb1LaIEQ240) 

To add true fascism, all you need to do is rid yourself of democracy. That‚Äôs the only thing that America, or any other allied power wouldn‚Äôt remove. To be more specific in regards to America, the American empire has always been built on soft power that‚Äôs backed by the military. Instead of direct control it‚Äôs outsourced to corporations. Does that mean America is fascist? No, fascism is an extremely loose terminology/ideology. All of the allied powers have gotten their feet wet with aspects of fascism, but very few of them, outside of soviet countries, rid themselves of democracy. 

To get to the point of context that is referring too where OP said most of the allied powers would be considered fascist **now** - he‚Äôs absolutely right. As said above, fascism is said pretty loosely in comparison. The bar for most being labeled a fascist is insanely low. Making what I said above contextually correct.",1598918547

Wisconsin is a Constitutional Carry state, and has no licensing for firearms.  It's not illegal to carry a loaded firearm in public.  The law restricting gun carrying by minors only applies to specific weapons, rifles being one of the exceptions.

Most of the dissipative components are mounted to the heatsink, the only thing that can really get hot is the sense resistors, and even those are limited to some degree because the drive signal to the current source is zener limited, hence the maximum dissipation is. Only in case of an opamp failure would the unit ever fail to give the correct output voltage, something i have not seen in any of the dozen or so modules i have assembled sofar. The little 25 turn however has proven unreliable in the field, so i am thinking of replacing that with a string of resistors that can be bypassed by solder pads to give the correct output voltage.

I am thinking of building a kit of these modules that is through hole, so people can build their own units. I actually have a design for that kind of unit ready to go. DM me if you have interest in a kit, if there is enough interest i will order some boards.",1598918549

This is Theodore (we called him Teddy) and Martha, my grandparents! They grew up in Germany but came to America during WWII and eventually had my mom! Unfortunately, both have passed, 2008 and 2012 respectively. I would like to do something nice for my mother and a colorized photo of this would do the trick! I will also attach a link to more photos of them for reference cause I would assume that helps. Also, he had blue eyes and dark brown hair and she had green eyes and light brown hair. You guys always do such a great job, I am obsessed with seeing your restorations on here! Thanks sooo much!!!

Mostly because I been hooked on to a screen. absorbing information. NOt dealing with my issues.

IT is hard to recognize you want to change and you are scared to. and even more hard to realize you want to speak to your family but they really don't want to speak to you. and having rage. Well this only complicates the issue. So in an effort to hear your post as completely as I can. I acknowledge that I have been in all of those categorizes and still likely exist to varying degrees in the for mentioned categorizes but those are not my being. Just aspects of the self that has to be addressed. 

I am honest. 

&gt; Represent yourself as proficiently as possible bc it gives people the ability to make more well informed choices. Your fear is your best teacher‚Äîpush through it, and you‚Äôll be indestructible. 

You don't get to decide what is proficient for someone. They do. because it is them speaking if I speak illogical at times it is because I don't care how I look to others and I find value in being truthful to myself first and fore most. so at times you may see this perticular being seemingly being very odd. But that is my authentic feeling and i'm doing a data dump often times. I will express my thoughts and specifically say I'm talking to me. Sure this can be seen as unhealthy. BUT Something triggers a response and instead of articulating thoughts in the mind it is rendered in a comment.

I know it can be frustrating to deal with people like me. But in an effort to not make excuses. People heal on their on time table no one elses. And some don't even get to choose that time table. It kinda just happens because they become aware of the issues they need to address.

I generally agree that people are more important than things.

Perhaps it is a result of your past trauma consolidated into a single event that causes intrusive thoughts to come more frequently? In that case, I'm afraid I cannot be of much help as this is treading into the realm of psychiatry, a field that I am neither well-equipped nor certified to handle.

I suppose I can say that we can no more accelerate our own deaths or of others' deaths by thinking about it. That is, however life decides to play out, it will do so of its own accord.

Since you are familiar with Stoicism, I take it you understand negative visualization? In case you don't, it's more or less a voluntary train of thought about death and loss, rather than it being involuntary. You could give that a shot? Though for you, I wouldn't jump straight into the deep end as you explained that sometimes it spirals out of control; you could start off with small manageable losses, like ""If I lost my phone right now, how would I react?"" and go from there, building up until you're able to rationalize scenarios that you're familiar with during intrusive thoughts.

And listen, you don't need to be sorry. Mental health is a personal battle that very few outsiders can understand, despite your efforts to explain it to them. You came to this sub seeking advice and guidance. I should be the one apologizing as you were probably seeking something more substantial. But my advice above still stands, and it is really all I can give you at this moment.

Generally speaking, the higher you fly, the more efficient you are, and the faster you can go without stressing the aircraft. The Cessna CJ4 has a service ceiling around 45,000 feet, so flying up at that kind of altitude is the way to go. That said, at that altitude, you're meant to fly using instruments rather than visual references. 

Clearly, this is a game, so have fun above realism, and don't be afraid to look for the limits and play with the performance characteristics of the aircraft. The worst that can happen, after all, is you get a black screen saying you crashed. When you get more comfortable, or decide you want to learn more about flying ""realistically"" there's plenty to learn from watching streamers on Youtube. You can also look for checklists for the planes you like to fly, which will usually have useful instructions on what performance limitations exist in certain phases of flight.",1598918552

The other I heard (which I think was John Lovett from Crooked media?) was ""capitalism is an efficient way to distribute goods and that's enough sometimes, but we need a compassionate way to distribute goods and our capitalism right now isn't.""

Now, personally, I think GDP growth is a sham and we're mortgaging our children's future, but also that if we do a good enough job with the time we've borrowed, maybe it will be worth it.

Your property manager or landlord can also change the locks for you which may be an important step as well.

An order of protection may serve to keep you safe following this dispute and with any additional retaliatory measures he may take against you. You can include his threats in the police report as well as your photo evidence of bruises.",1598918553

"AskConservatives","t5_2yb8u","&gt;They were concerned the Executive would be beholden to the Legislative.

Another thing to keep in mind here is the changing power of the executive branch throughout our nation's history. Think about who's generally considered our greatest presidents: Lincoln, FDR, Teddy, Washington. All (aside from Washington who's a bit of an outlier) presidents who greatly expanded executive power. This isn't an inherently bad thing, but we're left, especially from 1970 on, with an executive office now that oversees a *huge* administrative state that wouldn't have been contemplated at the time of the Framing. 

One of the flaws of the office that we see now is the rise of partisanship. The Constitution was never intended for the Senate and President to act in unison like we see now in great part because Congressmen were expected to serve the interests of their state *as if it were its own independent government.* Now the opposite is true, the legislative is in many ways bound to the executive.",1598918553

On one project in South Dakota he told me the same story every day over lunch, despite me telling him he'd literally just told it to me the day before. Later on he'd rather unethically work to cut me out of projects I invited him and his wife (who is also an American historian) to work on. He also liked branding people who disagreed with him with various bad names.

Biggest mistake throughout this whole process. It really speaks volumes.

To give you an example: the author of the book is a back doctor who would see patients all the time with all sorts of back issues (herniated discs very common). 

One of his patients was an Olympic weight lifter who had never been able to set a world record before he wrecked his lower back and messed up a few discs. 

The techniques and postures and mechanics the doctor recommended him not only healed the weight lifters back and rehabilitated him, he returned to weight lifting and set several world records. 

It really spoke to me on how even as dark and depressed you (and I) might be right now, with proper technique and the right movements, you can 100% manage your herniation, and it CAN reabsorb, getting you almost back to 100% pain free and living your normal life again. üôÇ",1598918553

*****
&gt; Louisville, Kentucky resident Jamarcus Glover was reportedly offered a plea bargain that would have required him to say the late Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police officers this past march, was part of his &amp;quot;Organized crime syndicate.&amp;quot; Initially revealed by Taylor family attorney Sam Aguiar, the plea deal, which Glover declined, would have seen him admit that he and other co-defendant, including Taylor, had trafficked drugs &amp;quot;Into the Louisville community.""

&gt; Police have maintained that they believed Glover had stored drugs at Taylor&amp;#039;s apartment, despite the fact no drugs were found at her property after the shooting.

&gt; &amp;quot;In an interview with the Louisville Courier Journal last week, Glover said that police have tried to blame him for the death of Taylor.&amp;quot;The police are trying to make it out to be my fault and turning the whole community out here making it look like I brought this to Breonna&amp;#039;s door,&amp;quot; Glover told the outlet.

But anyways, I didn't give cantrips for this one, instead giving them an eldritch blast replacement in the form of weapon attacks dealing force damage. The spells known column seems impossibly small but only because I thought it was thematically appropriate for the Pactbound to learn all the extended spells rather than placing limitations on what kind of spells they could learn. So total, they will know 12 spells, as opposed to the EK's 13.

This impotence is becoming so evident to all; the faults of parliamentarianism, and the inherent vices of the representative principle, are so self-evident.

 It is not difficult, indeed, to see the absurdity of naming a few men and saying to them, ""Make laws regulating all our spheres of activity, although not one of you knows anything about them!""

Fallout and Words Darker Than Their Wings are my personal favorite songs off this album. 

Fortress was were they decided to go a bit heavier and Myles tried different vocal styles for the softer songs like Water Rising and Peace is Broken.

As Coronavirus cases are surging in many areas we remind you to excercise an abundance of caution.

If you do not feel you can safely meet with someone then it is best not to do so at all.

Ok ? I don't know where you think you're going with this, that's not an excuse for strawmaning people.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; You did not setup early on you lack of discussion of morals 

It's not up to me to disclose what I'm not talking about. It's up to me to be clear about what I'm talking about (and I was, I only spoke about consent since the beginning), and it's up to people that wish to answer me to not strawman my position or invent things I never said.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The way you stated what you did appears to be the same tried and true moralistic argument that animal abolitionists have tried for a long while.   
&gt;  
&gt;I have read your exact argument more or less many times over the last 10 years I have been involved with abd paid attention to animal rights. 

Again I don't care how my argument looked to you or what arguments you're used to seeing, that's not a reason to strawman people.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To move away from a moralistic argument is good imo but to do is fighting an uphill battle by the road the moralistic arguing people have setup over a long while. 

I'm not ""moving away from a moralistic argument"", since I didn't even try to make a moralistic argument. We only argued about whether or not some beings can consent.",1598918555

But yea, the guy I replied to just yesterday said he's still having problems after another update...

And I replied saying I already dropped the game 20+ days ago.

Meaning I won't be returning, because I pretty much already missed out on loads of event rewards, especially ones that has to do with specific characters. (which itself requires Gacha/ rerolls to get in the first place and you can't get those without going heavy on PvP to get enough shop-currency to do Gacha or do multiple rerolls to get the best characters) (I am not that big on PvP, so requiring PvP to do PvE is a turn off for me, if they have a PvE way to obtain shop-currency that would have been good, but apparently it's PvP only, since clearing maps only gives you a one-time deal, no repeats)

(I originally planed to do reroll for 2~3 days, but was only able to literally do 3 rerolls in 5 days (of about 6 hours a day trying to actually just launch the game)... it's not worth my time)

Thanks for the Bluestack updating tho.",1598918557

&gt; I had an opportunity to work with him way back in like 2002. It‚Äôs was actually an awesome experience but he is a bit high strung. We saw his true colors shine when we revealed that we replaced a member and added a member 2 weeks before recording with him.
&gt; 
&gt; We were in the process of demoing with a few major labels and he was picked by one of the A&amp;R guys we were working with at the time to write and record with.
&gt; 
&gt; Day one we show up and meet with him and he takes us out to lunch so we can get to know each other a little better and discuss plans. After like 30 minutes we were out in the parking lot feeling like this was not going to be fun at all. He was a complete prick right out of the gate. Tells us how great he is and how much awesome shit he‚Äôs done in the past. We kind of had to reel him in and let him know that shit didn‚Äôt matter to us at all. Day ends and we are set to enter rehearsals the next day to start writing and pre production.
&gt; 
&gt; Day 2 we get set up in our rehearsal spot to start the jamming/writing process. During the set up we made some mention about how we recently went through a line up change and added a second guitarist because a previous member was just not cutting it anymore and wanted to focus on college at the time.
&gt; 
&gt; Well he flipped his shit. Dude went on a full on kicking amps and slamming shit around fit. He acted like a total Kyle... it was absolutely terrifying and hilarious at the same time. He decides to call the A&amp;R guy and yell at him for not letting him know about the changes within our group. He then looks at us and says something like ‚Äúwell you amateurs are on your own... I fucking quit‚Äù and storms off the premises.
&gt; 
&gt; We decided that since the label had put us up and paid for everything that we would hang there for a few days and write music and see if we could bring in another producer/engineer to work on the songs. We had several new songs in the bag with the new members already waiting to go so it was no big deal to us. We were just happy that maniac was gone. This literally just unfolded in the first 24 hours of this adventure.
&gt; 
&gt; Well after about 6 hours of jamming and coming up with a new song we decided to call our A&amp;R guy and get things squared away. Well our boy Rick comes stomping back in to the rehearsal room with a blank look on his face and says ‚Äúok since you guys think your good enough to replace and add musicians to your band and write great songs all in a couple weeks then let‚Äôs hear one of your great songs.... hurry you dipshits got the length of one song to impress me... roll!‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; We laughed and said that we just wrote something that day and had it pretty refined so we could play that song. He agreed to listen and then he would be gone.
&gt; 
&gt; We clicked off of ripped through the track pretty good and he stayed for the entire thing. He then asked that we hurry up and play him another song so we did. After the second song he smiled and said ‚Äúguys I‚Äôm sorry I stormed off earlier... let‚Äôs write a better bridge to that new song you guys wrote today then tomorrow we write a 3rd track collectively... how does that sound?‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; We ended up writing a really nice song with him and it all worked out great in the end. But it still never changed the way I looked at that guy. At the end of the day he is just a angry little man and I feel if he could let that go he would go much further in his career other than being the ‚Äúdemo guy‚Äù for major labels.",1598918561

"AreTheStraightsOK","t5_26qkg5","Absolutely perfect explanation, but I'd like to add details and explanation so people can now understand modern usage.

1. A lot of Kanji and Hanzi are different. This is due to 4 reasons; A. Over time the meaning changed, B. The Kanji is Traditional, the Hanzi is simplified, C. The Kanji was simplified differently to the Hanzi, 4. The Kanji doesn't have a Hanzi equivilant.

2. You can just make-up Kanji very simply. To explain the Logic: Â±± is 'yama' or 'mountain' and È¢® is 'kaze' or 'wind', Âµê is 'arashi' or 'storm'. Like how a ""Storm"" can be written as ""Mountain-Wind""; more complex words can be dervived from simpler characters. If they needed a new Kanji, they can just make one up, which they often did.

3. Hiragana is mostly for Grammar, Kanji is mostly for nouns and verb roots. The Kanji È£ü can be read as 'shoku' and mean 'food/meal' but it written as È£ü„Åπ„Çã it's read as the verb ""taberu"" meaning ""to eat"". È£ü is Kanji, but „Åπ„Çã is Hiragana. Say I said ""I eat rice"" that'd be ÁßÅ„ÅØ„ÅîÈ£Ø„ÇíÈ£ü„Åπ„Çã: ÁßÅ is 'watashi' or 'I/Myself', „ÅØ is the 'wa' topic particle, „ÅîÈ£Ø is 'gohan' or 'rice/lunch' (the „Åî part is mostly done to indicate politeness) and „Çí is the 'o' subject particle. As you can see, each noun/verb uses Kanji, where the grammar, particles, and inflections, are written in Hiragana.

4. These days Katakana is mostly used for emphasis to represent nouns that don't have common Kanji. This tends to be loanwords and SFX. You might know „Ç±„É≠ or ""Kero"" the noise a frog makes. Similarly there are phrases like „Ç≥„É≥„Éî„É•„Éº„Çø„Éº or Konpyuutaa, meaning Computer.

In short, like the above comment states, both historically and in modern usage, Kanji and Hanzi are quite different. The seperate language structures, the seperate cultures, and the long history, have onlu increased the distinction. It would be foolish to ever confuse Kanji and Hanzi.",1598918562

Having it shaken in the shaker with ice cools everything down and gets it all icy cold (that's why they shake cocktails at bars!), and adds a really nice frothy foam that makes the whole thing pleasant to drink.

It's not unbearable unshaken, but is really a lot less pleasant. I can honestly say that the iced teas taste better when shaken, as well. Although I don't know if shaking them is the standard anymore? For a while, Starbucks was on a ""Shaken iced tea"" kick, and it was dope. I get that it's an extra step for the baristas and kind of a pain in the ass, though.

I‚Äôd say they‚Äôd be ready to sell in a couple months, so the whole process from beginning to end would be about 3-4 months.

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.

So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.

But there‚Äôs a lot of gods I find anti-fun. Anubis is one example. He‚Äôs a noob stomper and he‚Äôs not actually that good in the meta. However, it just takes one mistake and he‚Äôll destroy you. Before anti-heal is online, he‚Äôs oppressive. After it‚Äôs online, he‚Äôs a free kill. Neither options are interesting or fun imo.

Another example is Zeus. He‚Äôs bad because he lacks mobility and he needs the whole team to work around him. His kit is oppressive so they never buff him to make him viable in Conquest. To me, that‚Äôs broken because he is both oppressive and mediocre at the same time.

Similarly, we have Loki who‚Äôs getting revamped. I remember when he was more effective at what his current version does and it was aggravating. He‚Äôs been nerfed so he‚Äôs just not effective at what he‚Äôs supposed to do (kill you before you have time to react).

"Coronavirus","t5_2x4yx","&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to manage this pandemic certainly over the next year, but certainly it may be planning for the longer term on the next two to three years during which the vaccine may play a role,‚Äù said Tam, whose comments come as new polling suggests some are wary of the potential shot.

&gt;Howard Njoo, deputy chief public health officer, offered similar words of caution.

&gt;‚ÄúPeople might think that if we get a vaccine then everything goes back to normal the way it was before. That‚Äôs not the case,‚Äù he said.

&gt;‚ÄúAll of the measures we‚Äôve put in place now will still have to continue with the new reality for quite some time.‚Äù

https://globalnews.ca/news/7249803/coronavirus-vaccine-restrictions-theresa-tam/

&gt;The COVID-19 vaccine candidates being developed by Moderna Inc. and BioNTech and Pfizer Inc. will require stringent standards for refrigeration, and that may hamper how they are distributed to the hundreds of millions of Americans expecting to receive them.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moderna-and-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-require-ultra-low-temperatures-raising-questions-about-storage-distribution-2020-08-27

&gt;The company said Monday the vaccine, should it work and be safe, would be available to Canadians as early as the second quarter of 2021. 

https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-1.5706067

&gt; this will allow the two partners to produce millions of doses in 2020, which would be increased to hundreds of millions in 2021.

https://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Article/2020/05/11/Pfizer-scales-up-COVID-vaccine-production

The scale of ""pre-orders"" for these vaccines is near 1-2 billion doses, regardless of the companies promises to deliver millions by early 2021, the reality is their production is limited. They haven't started producing yet from those new facilities, they're building the infra-structure for the production. The commissioning of mega plants takes a lot of time, and then they need to certify that this new production rout produces the same quality as the smaller production units. 

The hundreds of millions of doses might actually still fall short of the necessary billions of doses necessary. What is it, 2 hundred million, 5 hundred million? Because that's not even the US and EU combined. 

I don't want to be a Debby downer, but the fact is, there might not even be enough river sand glass for the vials necessary to store the vaccine in ready by 2021. This is going to take time, people are frenetically working to bring these vaccines as fast as possible to market, but the infrastructure for it isn't all built. I don't want to take away any of the hard work people are putting in this, but vaccine deployment is usually a very slow process.

We will start vaccinating in 2021, those at risk in winter, the rest starting through Q2 as the supply comes in. It'll take months to effectively deploy. If it turns out that the vaccine requires a booster it'll take longer. We won't know if it requires a booster until well into 2021 as we continue to track those who received it in the clinical trial this summer/fall.",1598918565

"WebtoonCanvas","t5_2cscdf","! You did a good job for a first try! My recommendation to you, as I see a pattern, is that you copy other people's art styles. This is not a bad thing and is a very useful skill as an artist, since art styles are flexible. Having one style you stick to all the time is actually a hindrance, not a good thing.

I suggest you draw a character in like, as many art styles as you can find that you like. I'm talking 10, 20. Goof off, find stuff you like, and emulate styles that you find aesthetically pleasing.

Then, just sorta draw the aspects of those styles, whatever you found most fun or helpful or appealing, of those styles, in different combinations. Do that a bunch.

If you do this, you'll have a lot of fun experimenting, get your feet wet with different kinds of proportions (I also recommend drawing from videos and life, too) and find yourself finding your own style. Because tbh

Styles flux a lot and change and your style is really just what you like visually. And you are very good at utelizing that skill already! I think you might just be afraid to draw often and badly, but trust me when I say this: your confidence will sky rocket when you start drawing all the time and stop worrying about how it looks.

Good luck!",1598918565

ON THIS DAY

**3 years ago**

**Poster 1**

I am probably going to hell... reason #14,652.  Standing in line at McDonald's holding Chloe and this elderly gentleman asks if we are in line.  I clearly say yes and I'm clearly right behind the dude getting his order taken.  Now i am holding a chunk of a toddler who is in crabby patty mode and . I guess the old bastard must of wanted to make sure he got that last mcmuffin in case he craps out this morning cause the old bastard cuts in front of us when the cashier asks me what I wanted.  So my asshole self (yes this in front of my daughter and not a proud daddy moment) takes his folded newspaper from under his arm and pops him in the back of the head with his own newspaper.  The looks I got was worth it.  What was even better is the cashier dude was laughing his ass off and when I finally get to take my order the cashier kid says to me.  ""That was epic you made my day""

"SelfAwarewolves","t5_3g3zk","I post things like this frequently where I try to challenge someone to actual consider their beliefs, and put themselves in the shoes of those they dislike so much. Invariably, I get responses like this, which don't address anything and attempt to character assassinate instead of respond.

Seriously, go through my responses then look at the comments I get back. Every, single, time, it's a character attack... you'd think if what I was saying was so wrong, it wouldn't take much to point out why I'm wrong? I have, and always have supported gay marriage, Basic Income, Legalization of drugs, environmental protections, protections of minority groups, the breakdown of harmful societal norms, and many other liberal viewpoints. I also enjoy challenging people who hold ""liberal"" viewpoints but fail to consider alternative, conservative perspectives. People are getting to the point where they view conservatism as simply ""evil beliefs held by evil people"" and that's a terrible, terrible direction to head. It's going to lead to less understanding, and more angry, more violence. If WE, as liberals, can better understand conservatives, we can start to build bridges towards a better world. 

With that out of the way, lets go through my comment, because I don't think there is a single piece of BS in it.

Paragraph 1, point 1 - conservatives feel Trump has done a good job, I'm going to base this on polling numbers as we can assume you wouldn't vote for a person if you didn't think they were doing at least an OK job (This was hilariously hard to find, despite multiple various searches, because the results continued to just be articles pointing out how bad he is): https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-claims-higher-job-approval-among-republicans-than-recent-polls-have-found/2019/08/23/0e6c68c8-c599-11e9-9986-1fb3e4397be4_story.html

Point 2 - most of the coverage is negative: In my search for a source for point one, I thought the google results were pretty fucking funny - all negative, none answering my query ""trump polling among conservatives"": https://www.google.com/search?q=trump+polling+among+conservatives&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t

Paragraph 2, Point 1 - Negative bias exists: Try typing in some middling, or positively slanted queries into google and tell me what you get. It's ALL negative. 
https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk01teg6mhs_QOcOQKy8QVo8vIbl2OQ%3A1598916912133&amp;ei=MIlNX6HGB86l_QbW6JGgCQ&amp;q=conservative+reasons+for+supporting+trump&amp;oq=conservative+reasons+for+supporting+trump&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIECAAQRzIECAAQRzIECAAQRzIECAAQRzIECAAQRzIECAAQRzIECAAQRzIECAAQR1AAWABgj4MZaABwAXgAgAEAiAEAkgEAmAEAqgEHZ3dzLXdpesABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihnsrUzcbrAhXOUt8KHVZ0BJQQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5

Trying to find why someone may support Trump? This is what you get.

Furthermore, articles often cite people, organizations that go against things he's done, but rarely would you ever find quotes from people or groups that support the made changes: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-bans-transgender-people-us-military-army-chelsea-manning-lgbt-rights-gay-president-twitter-a7861196.html

In the whole article, the only supporting comment is at the very end with 2 sentences:
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-transgender-ban-us-supreme-court-military-army-serve-injunction-a8740686.html

It is an undeniable fact that most coverage is negative. You say as much in your post.

Point 2 - conservatives/republicans distrust most media: https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2020/2/9/21120429/republicans-media-untrustworthy-fox-news-polarization-fake-news-trust-msnbc-bias

Again, this is a fact. 

So, what are my main assertions?

Biased reporting has led to a right-wing group that distrusts the media and its reporting, and it's almost totally rational. Their attempts to use technologies to find positive coverage, and being unsuccessful, further cements their currently held beliefs (confirmation bias, a real thing) leading to large groups of people seeking alternative forms of media that will report things in a manner they see as correct.

It wasn't always like this in the Muslim world. When Christian countries burned the scientific texts of Rome and Greece during the middle ages, Islamic countries kept the texts alive. In the 50s, 60s and 70s, many younger women in the Muslim world wore typically ""western clothing"" even Iran and Afghanistan. The extremism is a recent issue. The West propped up extremists to stall the economies of the Muslim World. Only the economies that suck the West's dick (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, Jordan) are stable.

Metallic compounds: these form when large climbs of metals are together. Basically because metals grip their electrons really weakly the outer electrons will dissociate (technical term for leave their atom and wander on their own). Essentially metals are just happy if there are electrons near by they aren‚Äôt overly possessive of them. The result of this is that large chunks of metals are basically positively charged metal ions (metal atoms which have lost some electrons) floating in a soup of free electrons. This soup of free electrons is what makes metals shiny. This is also why metals conduct electricity well (more free electrons makes it easier for a current of electrons to flow). This is also why metals are strong solids yet also malleable: the atoms within don‚Äôt really care where is the electron soup they are so long as they are near some electrons, for this reason metals can be bent and deformed easily but will resist breaking or being torn apart.

Ionic compounds (salts): these form when metals meet nonmetals, as I already mentioned metals don‚Äôt grip their electrons very strongly, nonmetals are the opposite. As a result of this when metals meet nonmetals the nonmetal will steal electrons from the metal. The story doesn‚Äôt end there though because now the nomental atom has a negative charge (cuz it gained electrons) and the metal atom has a positive charge (cuz it lost electrons). You may remember from physics that opposite charges attract and the closer they are the stronger the attractive force. At atomic scales this attractive force is quite powerful. This means that the moment the nonmetal starts stealing electrons it will be attracted to the metal and stick to it. When large quantities of metals and nonmetals all the atoms will interact as described then arrange themselves such that each metal is only touching nonmetals and vice versa. These structures are called ionic crystals and because they are held together by electrostatic attraction they very tough. Ionic crystals make up most rocks and crystals you know of and are very hard, they also have very high melting points. They have one weakness tho: shattering. If you hit a crystal with a hammer it shatters, this might seem counterintuitive because I just said ionic crystals were very strong but let me explain. If you hit hard enough you are able to momentarily push one layer of atoms out of alignment with its neighbor. Now this means that nonmetals are suddenly next to nonmetals and metals are next to other metals. Because all the atoms are charged (metals are positive and nonmetals are negative) this means that the atoms which are suddenly next to like charges repel and the crystal literally blows itself apart along the seem where you forced the crystal out of alignment. This is why crystals shatter and rocks split. I should also add ionic compounds are soluble is water.

Covalent compounds: these form when nonmetals meet other nonmetals. Because nonmetals are greedy and hold tight to their electrons nonmetals will often form covalent bonds. This basically means there are some electrons between the atoms which both atoms are holding onto as if they were their own. Because bot atoms are holding onto the same electrons they are stuck to each other, this is known as a covalent bond. Through this process of covalent bonding nonmetals often gather is clumbs of strange shapes to male sure every atom has the amount of electrons it wants. These clumbs are called molecule. In most cases molecules are content as they are and interact weakly with other molecules. For this reason most molecular compounds are liquid or gases at room temperature. In fact all room temperature liquids and gasses are made of molecular compounds (the lone exception being mercury which is a metal but is liquid). The fact that molecular compounds make up basically everything that isn‚Äôt stone, crystals, and metal makes me feel like maybe you don‚Äôt want to include them in the dwarven magic because things like water and CO2 don‚Äôt exactly scream earth to me lol. However not all molecules are content on their own, some molecules end up still wanting electrons and some end up having more than they want. When molecules like this interact they act exactly the same as a metal atom interacting with a nonmetals atom: one molecule gives electrons to the other and they stick together. These ionic compounds which are made of ionized molecules are actually very common and make up most types of rock and stone (‚Äúsimple‚Äù ionic compounds made of metal and nometal atoms interacting tend to form translucent crystal which are significantly more brittle. They are more brittle because molecules are bigger than atoms so you have to displace a layer of ionized molecules much further than you have to displace ionized atoms to cause shattering).

Bonus info: Magma/lava suddenly forms when the ions are so hot (aka vibrating so fast) they break away from the partners and start moving freely. Magma/lava is liquid because the ions are no longer bound in place but very viscous because the ions are still strongly attracted to one another. In contrast as metals are heated the metal atoms vibrate more and more and slowly become less and less stationary until they are completely free to move, this is why metals become more and more flexible as they melt and transition into a liquid state. This increased flexibility is why blacksmiths heat the metal before trying to mold it.

Ok let me give you an example. Lets say for whatever reason, it became some sort of meme to drink Pepsi. The meme was like Pepsi is the drink of right wingers or something. (the parallel here is people thinking TST is a fake ironic religion for fun) The idea that when you do the thing you are doing, everyone around you is perceiving you differently because of it, in an undesired way. You would probably think twice before drinking Pepsi in public because in the back of your head, you know people are judging you by it.

In recovery, Gabriel Martinelli targets Sele√ß√£o in 2021 and a chance to face Messi: ""It would be an honour"".
Arsenal striker uses reference centre in Campinas for treatment after left knee surgery; return is expected early next year


A meniscus injury to the left knee during a training session brought forward the end of a promising first season for Arsenal striker Gabriel Martinelli. At 19, the young Brazilian charmed England with 10 goals in 26 matches until the pandemic of the new coronavirus came to a standstill.

While recovering from surgery on 24 June, the ""Golden Boy"", as he is now called in London, also makes plans for when he returns to the pitch - the return is expected early next year. Martinelli spent the month of August in treatment in a reference centre in Campinas and embarked on Sunday to the Queen's Land.

- The deadline is six months for the return. It is to wait the time. Even if I feel good in four, five months, we have to wait to come back even better. I'm pretty sure about that. I am now continuing my recovery in England.
Martinelli's main expectations for 2021 include the chance to play for the senior Brazilian team and the possibility of facing Messi in the Premier League, since the Argentinian wants to leave Barcelona, and Manchester City appears as a possible destination.

Martinelli has already defended the U-23 national team in friendly matches last year, but has not yet played an official match with the senior national team. As Italy are also keeping an eye on him, as the striker has citizenship from his father, the CBF has ""surrounded"" the player so as not to lose him to another country. The striker is not the one who has already made a decision, but he reinforces his desire to wear the yellow one.

- Every player dreams of playing for his country's national team. Of course it is my dream and that of my family. It all depends on how things go. I'll give my all next season, working hard for recovery and waiting for the opportunity, if Tite thinks I'm ready. I have a dream to play for Brazil and I will do my best to be called.

On the possibility of having Lionel Messi as adversary, Martinelli believes that the presence of the Argentine would brighten up the ""most difficult league in the world"" even more:
- The Premier League has many extraordinary players, it is the most difficult league in the world. It would be a pleasure, an honour to face Messi, who is one of the best in the world.
""I had no idea it would be this good"".

Martinelli's start for Arsenal was so positive that he overcame names such as Thierry Henry, one of the greatest idols in the club's history. The Brazilian scored 10 goals in his first 21 games for the Gunners, while the Frenchman scored six times with the same number of matches. The promising striker, by the way, has already had the chance to meet the Arsenal legend.

- I met him once at the stadium, but I didn't say much, as I was entering the locker room for the game. He's a super humble guy and good people who have an incredible track record for Arsenal. I mirror myself a lot in his history at the club, because he is a player that everyone loves. I'm going to give my best also to build my history at the club.

Martinelli also won the most beautiful goal of the season for Arsenal, with a midfielder's start against Chelsea.

The performance, above the player's own expectations, yielded a contractual extension with Arsenal of four more seasons.

- To be quite honest, I didn't think it would be that good. At first, I would have played for U-23, but I participated in the pre-season with the first team, I played good games, and the coaching staff preferred to hold me in the group, so I could adapt faster. It was sensational. I also had the goal against Chelsea, which was the most beautiful of my career so far.

**Reports every 48 hours**

With almost daily monitoring of Arsenal's medical department, Martinelli used the facilities of a centre of excellence in Campinas to continue the recovery.

In four hours a day of treatment, he did pool work, conditioning and also proprioception (balance training).
- We worked with him in the six weeks after surgery, with a spreadsheet in conjunction with the medical department, passing on reports every 48 hours on his condition. The surgery was performed more

So you think violent situations beyond the scope of EMTS are rare? Lol, you're really betraying your privilege here, because people who actually live in dangerous areas disagree with you, which is why most black people don't support less police. 

&gt;cops do not improve them.

If you think cops don't tend to improve violent situations beyond the scope of other first responders because of the small minority of cases you see on the media you're only somewhat better than the Trump supporters who claim BLM is violent because that's what many media outlets focus on. All people like you do is flood the narrative with dumb bullshit that alt-righters can latch onto and pretend is the mainstream narrative to deflect from actual, substantive progress.

I'd recommend it, if you can't bear the look-at-the-camera style, let it play in the BG and do something and listen in, but it's best if you pay as much attention as you can. I myself didn't stop picking stuff up til like the second or third view.

As far as finding the skits cringey, I don't know how to help you with that. Her humor tends to be used to punctuate in between heavy topics to give a breather, and also self-deprecate (so basically specifically addressing the problem you mentioned of sounding too smug and self-important)

The video itself has lost quality unfortunately but watch Rittenhouse as he approaches the car where the initial shooting takes place and watch as Rosenbaum gets on top of him.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules
&gt;
&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Art critique is really weird in that there are at least two camps, those who understand the creative process of the medium, and those who are viewing it subjectively for pleasure. There are so many snoozefest films that get called cinematic masterpieces by those who know all the ins and outs of film making while people like me look at them like they're crazy.

The worst part is that those in the know tend to fall for tropes that the layman would probably completely miss. I loved the low angle shot of the protagonist showing his strength against adversity! Wait, what? You can see his strength of character based on the fact that the cameraman was assuming the position? I just thought he totally had a thing for the dude'a crotch...

Although stagnant art is probably the worst offender (paintings, sculptures, etc), motion picture artists seem to have the biggest set of convoluted rules. Like, I understand some of them when explained, and some of them do work at least some of the time, but it's very easy for a director to do a thing that does not work at all on the casual viewer but a movie buff will go nuts over it. I've also heard at least a few of those people claim that the more they know about the process, the more films become ruined for them.

&gt; The huge explosion in Beirut which killed and injured thousands of people caused up to &amp;pound;3.4 billion in physical damage, the World Bank has said.

&gt; The country&amp;#039;s debt currently stands at around 170% of GDP. The World Bank said the overall damage of the explosion is in the range of &amp;pound;2.8 billion to &amp;pound;3.4 billion.

&gt; The governor of the capital, Marwan Abboud, estimated earlier that the losses caused by the blast to stand between &amp;pound;7.5 billion and &amp;pound;11.2 billion.

"thebachelor","t5_2tj74","Yep for sure! Jason Stanley (PhD from MIT, now full professor at Yale University) wrote a book entitled ‚ÄúHow Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them,‚Äù ([link here if you‚Äôre interested](https://www.amazon.com/How-Fascism-Works-Politics-Them/dp/0525511830)). It puts Trump‚Äôs attitudes and policies in a really informative global and historical perspective (because the rise of populism isn‚Äôt limited to the USA.. which is sometimes comforting, albeit sad, to remember). This book has been summarized in many media outlets if you do not feel like reading it, but you didn‚Äôt want media sources. 

Enzo Traverso (PhD from EHESS, currently professor at Cornell), wrote a book entitled ‚ÄúThe New Faces of Fascism: Populism and the Far Right‚Äù ([link to book](https://www.amazon.com/New-Faces-Fascism-Populism-Right/dp/1788730461/ref=nodl_)). This also nicely explains how ‚Äúneo-fascism‚Äù (again, not just DT but around the world) isn‚Äôt an exact replication nor departure from what we‚Äôve seen in the past, rather a new form of 21st century fascism. 

[Here‚Äôs ](http://www.americananthropologist.org/2020/03/23/everything-is-permitted-trump-white-supremacy-fascism/) a piece written by professor De Genova at the University of Houston, explaining how white supremacy and fascism are related. 

Aside from the term ‚Äúfascism‚Äù which I understand can be perceived as a stretch by some people (including scholars as well!) it is undeniable that Donald Trump‚Äôs impeachable offences and the lack of consequence he faced are counter to the principles of this nation.  So in addition to three scholars I cited above, please read the open letter signed by 878 law professors around the country describing Donald‚Äôs conduct as ‚Äúprecisely the type of threat to our democracy that the Founders feared when they included the remedy of impeachment in the constitution.‚Äù Full letter [here](https://medium.com/@legalscholarsonimpeachment/letter-to-congress-from-legal-scholars-6c18b5b6d116). Please see bi-partisan [senate report](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume1.pdf) on Russian interference in 2016 election for confirmation of these accusations.",1598918576
"fightporn","t5_2u5un","Yes and no...

They share many features, but are more hated than rednecks.

Most rednecks are seen as dangerous and stupid, but somewhere else.  Gypsies are seen as sneaky, violent, dangerous and thieving, and prob living not too far from your home, wherever that is.

Neither of these stereotypes are accurate or fair when talking about all the people of either group, but they arise from the history of poor people doing what it takes to survive in life, despite what rich people think or do.

And a lot of gypsies do like fighting when they have had a drink, or before a drink.

We have a lot of the slightly more criminal types in my city (where I grew up was farmland and the gypsies were known as hard working, and fighting, casual labourers, window washers, mechanics etc, not so much into crime) and they are one of the reasons I own extremely large dogs.

The lads like to drink in a nearby pub, and then try to fight people in the park during the day.

If you have 2/3 Bullmastiff sized dogs with you not only do they leave you alone, and act very respectfully while leaving, but they accept it when I say ""No fighting in the park while my dogs are here lads, it annoys them"" and suddenly they want to head off and have a fight somewhere else.

They local ones to me have featured on here before, but ages ago, and I don't have the link.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","This is a REALLLYYY messed up situation, fabricated by a insecure female that probably had feelings for your ex.

Regardless, you need to ask yourself 2 questions:

1. Are there still significant feelings for your ex, and if so, can you ultimately forgive him? Ie. Do you think you can be happy again in that relationship?

2. Are you still in need of closure? If so, it is probably best to meet in a neutral location, with the premise that you are open to talking, but make no commitment to any continued relationship.

Realistically, it's sad that the person you loved and devoted yourself to was so easily manipulated, and ultimately gave you no opportunity to explain the fabricated lie.  Strong relationships are built on a foundation of trust and communication.  He chose not to communicate when he packed your stuff; quite frankly you really owe him nothing.  Your name and reputation has been completely tarnished in a very public way, an experience you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy (well except maybe the child that started all of this).  

If you choose to follow the path of reconciliation, you should ask yourself if you can forgive the friends/family behavior as there's really no way to avoid them.  This relationship (most likely) now has too much baggage to salvage, unless your heart is telling you otherwise.  It takes a very BIG person (and mature) to forgive something like this, but it can be done.  However, I question the way your ex will react - should you reconcile - the next time your relationship is challenged.  Will he choose to fight for your relationship or will he catch the next flight out of dodge??

Follow your heart, and don't let anyone else say different. Just make sure you make a decision that is BEST for YOU (BE SELFISH AF) and then put 100% of your effort into it, regardless of the outcome.  

Best of luck!

PS - If you choose to reconcile, I don't see any other option other then him deleting that vile female friend from his life, anything else lacks commitment to you.",1598918578

What this looks like is:

**Far**: My partner and I make sure to bring food/snacks for up to 2-3 hours of riding, usually at a 13.5-14.5mph pace. We enjoy conversations, climbs, exploring, trying new routes, and if we‚Äôve landed around 30-40miles we‚Äôre pretty happy. These are usually taken on shared days off from work and we ensure we rest/hydrate well the day before. 

**Fast**: These occur on weeknights or windows where we‚Äôre short on time. Goal is to go as far as we can in 1hr. Usually end up around 18-22 miles done where we‚Äôre totally wiped out afterwards. 

For the ‚Äúfar‚Äù rides, we choose a pace that we feel like we could ride all day at. This has slowly improved from 12mph &gt; 12.5mph &gt; 13mph and so on. We treat our pedals like they‚Äôre made of glass while focusing on being smooth and spinning. 

For the fast, it‚Äôs basically an all out effort until our bodies give up, slow down to breath, then do it again. This used to get us ~16miles and now we can go much farther/faster. 

Hope this helps.",1598918578

Perhaps try a DC of 14. And I would change it from 4 successes to 6 and lower the failures to 3. Still challenging and this way they feel like they are succeeding more often while still remaining a challenge. 

Last thing I would do, since it is their first skill challenge, give them a specific encounter that they have to navigate. For example, getting over a ravine that has a now broken bridge, escaping a narrow mountain pass as an avalanche occurs around them, navigating across a thin frozen river, something like that.

impact does explode, if fact it blows up bigger and since impact setups are often super-compact schematics you're looking at a lot of damage. and PLEASE explain why you don't just place the cryo-mixers next to the thorium reactors and use vaults as a buffer for when the titanium line gets destroyed. if something comes close enough to destroy the titanium distribution belt or the mixers themselves, then it can just as likely destroy the impact in question.

by your logic we should delete our core since that thing is super explosive. to put it simply, it's not the dynamite's fault of you let somebody blow it up in your face. you should've put it in a safe spot

The Spantik is a great boot, but I would not recommend them because the G2SM‚Äôs are an even better boot, and they weight almost a pound less. A pound on your feet is absolutely massive. I‚Äôve known people who have both and pretty much everyone agrees the G2SM is better. The spantik was king for a long time but, there‚Äôs simply better lighter double boots now. They‚Äôre also stupid warm. Like even at slightly below freezing they can be too warm. That said they absorb sweat very well and if you follow basic foot care principles you shouldn‚Äôt have an issue. I‚Äôve climbed Shasta and Whitney during the late season in spantiks simply because I didn‚Äôt have any singles at the time. So it‚Äôs doable but not recommended. The reality is if you do this sport long enough you‚Äôll need two pairs, a single and double boot for different seasons / objectives. With all that said, spend the extra $50-$100 for G2SM‚Äôs. If you can wait till March or so timeframe the G2SM Evos are being released which are refinement and warmer while also being lighter than the current version. TLDR; if you need a double boot don‚Äôt buy the spantiks, get the G2SM",1598918580

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

A lot of stores and restaurants are open.  Mask use in the stores seems pretty good except for the occasional moron with it down below their nose.  Obviously people aren‚Äôt wearing masks while eating or drinking - some restaurants have enough space between diners that I‚Äôd maybe feel comfortable; others have seats jammed pretty close together where even if it‚Äôs outdoors I would not feel comfortable sitting for a 30-45 minute meal without a mask.

I personally don‚Äôt spend much time on Main Street except to walk to grab pickup because it‚Äôs not worth the risk for me, but if you‚Äôre smart about which establishment you go to and diligent about your own mask you could probably safely enjoy a quick outing.

"space","t5_2qh87","The thing is that there is the wait calculation to consider:

\[..\] incentive trap of growth that shows that civilisations may delay interstellar exploration as long as voyagers have the reasonable expectation that whenever they set out growth will continue to progress and find quicker means of travel, overtaking them to reach and colonise the destination before they do. This paper analyses the voyagers' wait calculation, using the example of a trip to Barnard's Star, and finds a surprising minimum to time to destination at a given rate of growth that affects the expansion of all civilisations. Using simple equations of growth, it can be shown that there is a time where the negative incentive to travel turns positive and where departures will beat departures made at all other times. Waiting for fear future technology will make a journey redundant is irrational since it can be shown that if growth rates alter then leaving earlier may be a better option. It considers that while growth is resilient and may follow surprising avenues, a future discovery producing a quantum leap in travel technology that justifies waiting is unlikely.

- Rhino on Venus
- Hydroid on Earth
- Excalibur on Mars
- Frost on Ceres
- Mag on Phobos
- Valkyr on Jupiter
- Nova on Europa

(Personally I recommend Rhino. Takes very little modding to be effective, and extremely tough with his Iron Skin. Some people find his playstyle boring but imo he's a good ""workhorse"" frame, a solid, reliable frame that will take you to the end of the starchart if you want it to.)

I wasn't intending to tackle my rape trauma when I started seeing her, but an incident with a friend triggered me a few months into our sessions and caused it all to surface and I was finally given the strength and encouragement to start processing it. Yeah, a lot of our conversations online were on AIM. I don't even remember which handle I was using and I also deleted convos after my dad started reading them. It's funny you mention the kickboxing thing because the guy I've been seeing is a martial artist and he wants to teach me how to spar so I can defend myself. I'm super excited about it.  

His father committed obstruction, i.e. he withheld police records that were supposed to be publicized. He was chief at this point so I had the same thought, it must've been very serious if he was ousted over it. The newspaper articles are very sparse because he waived his right to a trial by jury, which is some sweet karma because he's obviously embarrassed to face a jury of his peers.  

Gosh, you are very sweet. You're so welcome. It's no problem at all, it happened to me so long ago but it's only recently that I've been given the courage to even think about it, let alone speak out, and I'm honestly extremely glad I could help somebody who experienced something so similar. I have to thank you for talking to me too, because for so long I felt so ashamed, and so alone, and it's bittersweet to know I'm not. I hate that this happened to you too, and countless other people, but it's honestly beautiful that we can come together and support each other like this.

"SmartThings","t5_2uug7","I've attached a video of my setup. Now, I want to say that for starters, I intentionally didn't record any identifying or personal information. My config.yaml, one of my tabs, the logbook, and some other pages are intentionally not shown. I have no problem doing so, but in a more controlled atmosphere. 

[At any rate, take a look!](https://youtu.be/ff_yvHGQ33I) 

1. The first page is statuses, like are the windows open/closed, manual vacuum and thermostat control, and weather. NR automatically controls the air conditioning, as well as the vacuums, but this is just really an overview.
2. The second page is security. My cameras and home protection. NR automatically controls the home/away armed status here too. 
3. The third page is all of my switches. You can see that they can either be controlled one by one or in a group (and I can set whatever groups I want in the lovelace config). Also, the dimmer has a slider, but the fan switch is selectable. 
4. The 4th page is for temperatures. The kids bedrooms are using window sensors to report temperature, so they're reporting higher here than what they really are. Everything else is accurate though. 
5. The pool is on a schedule, but I have manual controls. I'm also using stateful pictures - so when the pool or spa changes to on, the image shows it on, as well. 
6. Irrigation timers are not entirely accurate, but they're close. I have to do a lot of templating and math and found an issue. I use rainmachine irrigation controllers. When the schedule is on, it marks ALL of the valves on, even though only one is on at any given time. This is why the outrageous run times. They're like 10 min each, really. You can see the stateful images in action here. 
7. The media tab is the most finicky and that's because I use GH and spotify integration is difficult. I didn't demonstrate it, but I programmed 2 buttons on each speaker to play my weekly new music and my liked songs. TBH, I don't use it much at all, but it's for future integration when I eventually mount a tablet on the wall. 
8. The system page shows my crucial systems. The Hass instance on the rpi, along with network and memory configs. Anais is my NAS and houses my DB for the Hass instance. I also run a speedtest every 30 mins...mostly because I can. You'll also see the theme change here. It's pretty damn neat. Right now, it goes from light @ 6a to 8p and then dark any other time. Not gonna lie, I like dark more, but meh. 
9. My last tab tracks battery status. Yeah, I know it's a little heavy on the gauges but it's really just a quick view to what isn't working (you'll see that one of my sensors is dead. I've been having issues with it for some time and need to pull it off the window and figure out what the issue is. Problem for another day). 
10. The history pane is a broad overview on ALL of the things going on. I skimmed through it quickly because the data is overwhelming. 
11. I have the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS) installed to allow user created content and lovelace configs. You don't realize how much in here is custom until you start building your own. HACS is going to be a requirement. 
12. Ahhh, the NR tab. So I have 9 different flows - each doing something a little different. 

&gt; 1. The first is an easy presence detection. I could do this inside HA, but this is an easy way to export it. It's tracking both my and my wife's phones. 
&gt; 2. The next one is our bedroom fan. If the fan is on after midnight and before sunrise end, it evaluates the speed based on the temperature. I burned a switch out the first time doing this, so I had to rewrite it. It's much more robust now. 
&gt; 3. The next tab handles my thermostats when we're not home. Basically, we both need to leave for the t-stats to adjust their temps and if we come home, only the downstairs turns on (unless we *go* upstairs, but that's in another tab). 
&gt; 4. The TStat Nodes flow controls whether or not the tstats are on. If we open a window, the tstats are off, but if we open a door, I don't want the AC cycling, so it waits 3 mins and then turns off if the door stays open. Good for letting the dogs out or bringing groceries in. 
&gt; 5. The next tab handles the upstairs air. If there's motion upstairs, then we turn the air on. But if the motion stops, it waits 10 mins and then shuts off. I did 10 mins because the kids frequently go back and forth and I don't want to break the units by constant cycling. You'll see that there are also manual triggers just in case. 
&gt; 6. The vacuums are set to run when we're not home. Period. However, Iv'e scripted an override - which disables the timer, delays, and then turns on the vacuum. I needed the delay in the event the enabled trigger was happening at that exact time. You'll find that BigTimer runs evaluations once a minute and I found a 15 second wait is a good duration. 
&gt; 7. The presence detection tab handles the ""alarm."" It's automatically armed if we leave, but also at dusk. The nice thing with BigTimer is that it takes into account the day of the year, and your location, to give you an accurate time for dusk. 
&gt; 8. Vacation lighting is just that. Pretend I'm home when I'm not home. There are tons of custom nodes for this, but in the end, writing my own was the best. What I did was created a function that only evaluated true 25-30% of the time. Then it selected 2 random switches and turned them on (I have two because zwave devices are considered switches and zigbee devices are considered lights). Then it runs a random, basically roll of the dice, and turns off after a period of time. Each time it's evaluating if we're home every 5 mins  between certain hours before the flow even runs. 
&gt; 9. Finally, my kids keep leaving one of the garage doors open. So now if the door between the garage and the house is closed and one of the garage doors is left open, both my wife and I get notified. If it's at night before bed, all of the google assistants broadcast a message (incidentally, this is how you get google or alexa to say fuck. I used to have it tell my wife, ""Welcome home, it's about fucking time!"").

*numbering got messy here, it's supposed to be 13 &amp; 14*

13. The next shows my zwave network. It's really just a toy to show how devices are connected. 
14. Finally, my supervisor and add ons that are installed. 


And to round this whole thing out - I did not include any of my lovelace, where a VAST majority of the actual yaml is. If you want to see, let me know and I'll get it to you, but it's really not going to be relevant until you start building your own config.",1598918582

2.  It was not a mistake to make a small choreography modification as long as everyone made the change as per Son Sung-deuk.  

3.  As far as K thinking that he is a professional who has seen so much more dance than Heeseung et. al.  Why is he trying out for KPop rather than JPop?  That statement he made did not even sound logical to me, considering he was talking about someone who had trained with Big Hit for three years.  It made him sound delusional.

"KanojoOkarishimasu","t5_izi65","&gt;  I read some material saying they have only two tenses...

Kind of. This comes from using a rather strict definition of ""tense"" based on conjugation (which is a fair definition, but you have to be aware of that). If you use that definition, then yes, Japanese only has two tenses, the past and non-past tenses. However, if you apply that same definition to English, then English as well only has two tenses, the past and non-past tenses.

This is because verbs in English are only uniquely conjugated for the past (*I ate*) and non-past (*I eat*). There is no separate conjugation to express the future tense in English, instead we use a modal verb, *will* (*I will eat*), and the main verb, *eat*, takes its non-past form. This is basically the same as in Japanese just without the use of a modal verb, since the future meaning can usually be inferred from context.

Anyway, in the sentence above, the verb is *ËÅû„ÅÑ„Å¶„Çã (kiiteru)*, which is derived from *ËÅû„Åè (kiku)*, which means *to hear* or *to listen*. *ËÅû„ÅÑ„Å¶ (kiite)* is the connective form of the verb, used to join it with other verbs, and here it is followed by the helper verb *„ÅÑ„Çã (iru)*, which adds a continuous aspect to the verb which is basically the same as the present progressive form in English (*I eat* vs. *I am eating*). (Note that in speech the *„ÅÑ (i)* in *„ÅÑ„Çã (iru)* is nearly always dropped, so it's rendered in the speech balloon as just *„Çã (ru)*).

This verb form in Japanese means basically one of two things:

1) It indicates an on-going action, basically identical to English's present progressive, e.g. Èü≥Ê•Ω„ÇíËÅû„ÅÑ„Å¶„Çã (ongaku o kiiteru), I am listening to music.

2) It indicates a past event that continues to affect the present. This is the sense Chizuru is using it here. This is most similar to English's present perfect tense. So a more grammatically accurate literal interpretation of what Chizuru said may be *I have heard from his mouth* (non-past conjugation of *to have* + *past participle of main verb* == present perfect).

So basically, Chizuru is talking about something that happened in the past and isn't expressing any kind of wish or desire with that sentence.",1598918583

The lab reports are done in pairs, so the class of 82 meant 42 reports (always some pairs that split up) every two weeks.  Each report takes me about an hour to grade.  I also graded the quizzes, but that only took 2‚Äì3 hours a week.  So my grading load that year (2018‚Äì19) was about 24 hours a week, combined with about 11.5 lecture+lab hours, and 2 hours of office hours.  Unfortunately, the load is not uniformly distributed over the quarter, so the light grading load in the first two weeks was compensated by a crushing load in the last two weeks.

This fall I have an unusually small class (only 32), so I'll have only about 16 reports to grade.  But all but one of my undergrad group tutors and graders have graduated, so I may end up doing more of the homework grading, which will bring the grading time back up.  The cohort that I would usually be hiring are taking the course this Fall, because it was delayed from Spring in order to work out the logistics of at-home labs.",1598918584

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I'll start this off with saying that I've been a pianist for 24 years, so I know the struggle. 

As already stated there is the problem of advancement: if the training wheels never come off, you'll never learn to ride without them. But this isn't just a matter of sight reading. Its a matter of tonal theory, what it means for one tone to be in relation to another tone. If you skip over this and are always hand-fed your sharps and flats, you're never getting at the heart of why they aren't there in the first place.

Thats not to say that one can't benefit at least initially from the redundant marking of sharps and flats. But this *should* be on the student to add into the score. When a piece is written down, it is not simply a set of instructions for playing on an instrument. One should be able to look at the sheet music and understand the score harmonically. Adding the symbols in distorts this. The interval of P5 is constant regardless of instrument, notation convention etc. The musician should be able to see this on the notation. 

Additionally, there are times when it is necessary to go out of key, that is the marking of a sharp or flat is necessary based on the key youre in. When one sees this on sheet music it should be register that you're stepping our of your key even if only for one note.

Is it absolutely necessary to understand all of these matters harmonically to play a piece? No. But serious musicians desire to understand a piece, not simply play it. And understanding a piece facilitates playing it better than you otherwise might have.

The best advice I can give is to practice your scales: major, natural minor, harmonic minor, and melodic minor. Ascending and descending with both hands over four octaves. Play these not until you get them right but until you can't get them wrong. But always be aware of what key you're in. And don't think in terms of sharp or flat, think in terms of intervals relative to the tonic note. If you practice at that, playing in other keys will be loads easier.

Failing that, you can always write your own symbols into the score.",1598918584

*****
&gt; Aug. 28, 2020, 8:06 a.m. ET.MEXICO CITY - Gearing up for a key election next year, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has wielded corruption as both a stick with which to beat political adversaries, and a lightning rod to deflect criticism from his record in office.

&gt; Now, videos of his brother receiving cash from a political ally have cast doubt over Lopez Obrador&amp;#039;s upright image, undermining his argument that entrenched corruption has fed chronic gang violence and held back Mexico&amp;#039;s misfiring economy.

&gt; His carefully cultivated persona as a scourge of corruption suffered a blow last week with the publication of videos from 2015 showing one of his brothers receiving cash from a man who later served in Lopez Obrador&amp;#039;s government.

The best keepers in the world are predominantly in the 6'1""-6'4"" range which Kepa fits into. It's not his height that makes him a poor keeper aerially.

"Residency","t5_2t8qv","Hi, RD here (background in behavioral health and acute clinical care). I'd like you to take a moment and reflect on why it's not okay for your coresident to teach their philosophy that all bodies deserve positivity, but it is okay for you to teach your philosophy that fat=bad. In telling your patient they are obese and that it is not okay you are telling them that ""they are not okay"" and ""they are less than YOUR ideal."" Please stop projecting your internal bias onto your patients and perpetuating the stigma that weight is the ultimate determinant of one's health when science has proven otherwise. 

A great place to start being a more compassionate healthcare provider is testing your own implicit bias, which you can do here https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatouchtestv3.html

Body positivity is not the glorifying of ""fat"" as it's portrayed in media and by health infuencers (cough cough Jillian Michaels), but rather helping the patient to have a positive outlook about their body and treat their body with the respect it deserves regardless of size. You cannot expect a patient to enact on healthy habits when they are unable to respect their body enough to feed it nutritious foods.

 All bodies deserve respect. Do they walk daily and work a taxing job? Awesome! Can their body birth humans? Super badass! Telling your patient the size of their body is disgusting is akin to going for a pap smear only to have your OB/GYN pinch their nose in horror as you lay vulnerable in stirrups. Weight is vulnerable, exercise the same compassion you'd expect of your own providers. 
 

We also know that health behaviors are associated with improved health outcomes regardless of body weight. BMI is an outdated and inaccurate statistical model never intended to be used as a measure of health. To the patient, harping on BMI and weight leads them to believe this is the only part of health that matters, which can have detrimental effects on mental health, thereby worsening the cycle through anxiety, stress, and pertepually elevated cortisol levels. 

Projecting your implicit weight bias onto your patients is not only ignoring the advancements of scholarly research, but is downright unethical.",1598918586

I noticed you dropped 4 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","Hey, figuring out your gender is not easy at the best of times.

For what it's worth, this is pretty close to how I felt when I was a teen. I didn't know what being trans was until I was in my twenties, but the feeling was still there. That doesn't necessarily mean you are trans. But it might be worth exploring those feelings a bit. You might be trans and just having a tough time working through what that means. Nothing wrong with that. 

It's also possible that you are a guy who just happens to be more effeminate than masculine. There is also nothing wrong with that. 

Knowing you are trans is.... a complicated thing. I'm two years into my transition, living full time, and even I have moments where I wonder if I'm not just making it all up. Doubt kinda comes with the package deal. But it might be a bit more helpful to put aside the question of whether you are trans for a moment and instead think about the concrete things you want.

Are there certain kinds of clothes you think you might prefer if the idea of 'boy clothes vs girl clothes' wasn't a thing? Are there certain activities or hobbies you might want to try out if there wasn't a stigma around guys doing those things? Is there a way you want to talk? Is there a name you might prefer (maybe you even like your current name just fine)? Close your eyes and imagine your ideal body. The one you could have if you could just wake up in it and nobody would ever know it had been otherwise unless you told them so.

Imagine what you consider to be the ideal man. Imagine what you consider to be the ideal woman. Consider what you consider an ideal person who might not look like either. If you could pick one of the three to become, which one would you pick? Would it be a hard choice or an easy one? Would you prefer to be able to move between them whenever you wanted?

Find a place where you can say the following out loud. Not just in your head if you can. Say each line with as much conviction as you can. Pause between each line and try to examine your feelings. Maybe do this whole exercise a few times:

1. My name is (your current name) and I am a guy. My pronouns are he/him.

2. My name is (pick a feminine name you like) and I am a girl. My pronouns are she/her.

3. My name is (whatever name you prefer at the moment) and I am not a boy or a girl. My pronouns are they/them.

You don't have to literally answer any of these questions. Think of them more as thought experiments to give you a starting point to work from as you explore your gender a bit more intentionally. Whatever your answer happens to be, that's fine! You can be something else entirely. You can even change your answers to any of these questions whenever you want! Don't feel like you have to figure all this stuff out as fast as possible. You have so much time to work through it and be comfortable with your answers. Best of luck!",1598918587

"IDontWorkHereLady","t5_341k1","I don't know if it works the same way in Europe, but in the US property owners contract with builders to work on their property for a FIXED sum. 

So if it were here in the US I'd say the property owner is making a simple mistake. It would appear she thinks she is paying the workers by the hour. Instead, she most likely is paying by the job. 

If the workers work efficiently or they sit around half the time doing nothing she would pay the builder the same amount. It is the builder who stands to lose profit if the workers are goofing off. 

The owner will pay the same amount regardless.

"SportingKC","t5_2secp","We use him as an attacker, yet looking this year and last year, what is his goal and assist numbers against his shots? 1g- 1a with 46 shots. I know this is over simplifying it, but it‚Äôs awful and under this system, that matters. It is nearly equal to everyone else currently on the bench (and recently departed Seth). His speed is Notoriously slow. As a defender, this becomes more difficult to quantify. Anybody know how many goals scored against SKC that he played a role, or from the right?  When‚Äôs the last time he was POtW? Transfer market has 36 other right backs listed higher than him, I‚Äôm sure we could find an upgrade...and I‚Äôm at the point I would just appreciate an attempt...or invest in the future and put Lindsey there to perform on his natural side.

For me, it‚Äôs clear to move on as he has rightfully done with Matt. I am forever a fan of theirs and appreciative of their leadership and the trophies they helped us lift...and that time they both repped USA. Just awesome. But, the time is now to move on.

I guess the real issue is less about zusi or Matt and more about a failure to adjust a system that  appears to not be working, and not for a while. I expect the best from SKC, I expect we have a team that a league fears. 

I‚Äôm not a fan that is OK with mediocre. Our product right now is mediocre at best.",1598918589

"writing","t5_2qh2n","The way I handle exposition is through three ways:

1. Movement
2. Clever dialogue
3. Trusting the reader

Breaking up exposition with movement gives the illusion that there's progression. That what's being told is a part of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I clicked the button and the motor whirled to life. The screen on the wall flashed and revealed an image of a girl. Alice! It was her. I rapidly pressed some buttons on the keyboard and pulled up her information. Alice was the leader of the resistance. I even found a picture of her with a resistance rifle in one hand.

As I'm launching into some exposition about Alice, I'm surrounding it with movement--with my character doing something.

You should also use some clever dialogue to avoid exposition.

For instance, I was reading someone's book, and during a trial hearing, the author wanted to let the reader know about some fantasy law he had in his world. So the judge said to the attorney:

""Alice, as you know, your client isn't allowed to speak up during cross-examinations.""

I forget the law, just making something up. But of course the attorney knows this. The judge is simply giving exposition for the reader's benefit.

To which, I suggested changing the dialogue.

""Alice, your client is not above the law! Silence him, or I will!""

This signals to the reader that the client did something wrong in this world, without the judge specifically saying those words.

Which falls into the third point.

Trust your readers!!!

They're smart. They pick up clues. You don't need to detail every little thing, fearing they won't understand. This is also where beta readers come in handy :)",1598918589

"dating","t5_2qhb1","You aren't too nice. You are probably just insecure or lonely/desperate. Which makes total sense if you are a kid. I used to be a ""nice guy"" before reddit even existed. Most nice guys are just super insecure and desperate for external validation. They generally invest a great deal of themselves into how others perceive them and desire the love they can't seem to give themselves. I think their main problems are that they are entitled and that they put women on a pedestal, you and a person need to be equals for a romantic relationship. I also did the whole being a dick thing and it worked a little bit. I credit it mainly to the fact that I stopped being so anxious about how others would perceive me (which I could have just solved by being confident and expressing my authentic self), but it also worked because there are a bunch of equally traumatized insecure women out there. 

Ultimately it comes down to who you want to be. Do you want to be you? Or do you want to be a shittier version of you and slowly come to dislike who you are, all just to increase the chances someone MIGHT sleep with you. I woke up one day and realized I didn't like who I was anymore. Then I realized I had wasted years of my life playing this other person and that I had to relearn all over again how to treat people.

Properties are a mixed bag - apartments have got neighbours and conditions like noise control and the usual red tape. Of course most people rent, and as a renter you've a shed load of rights. Properties for sale are also an option but again you need to be 100% certain its what u want. Also bear in mind Austria is expensive, some folk there think nothing of paying ‚Ç¨10 for a cup of coffee and a mohnschnecke(plain bun).

Indeed, I definitely see where you are coming from. I hope my comment before wasn't insensitive. If it was, I'm sincerely sorry. Because you are totally right- there is no ""best"" way to go.

What you say about having anger- if you have anger during your grieving for your friend, that makes perfect sense. If you are speaking of other things, maybe this quote that helped me will help you too:

""*Holding* on to *anger* is like grasping a *hot coal* with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned."" So, I agree with you, anger often does us no favors. I just hope you don't beat yourself up if you feel any anger over the death of your friend.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","100% your laner's responsibility for the wave to be in a good spot for you to gank. I actually just had a WW game yesterday where I straight up said I was going red&gt;blue&gt;gromp and would be at bot lane on their cannon wave. When I finished my gromp they were actively tower diving the enemy at level 2 and the adc died as I showed up after getting nailed with a tower shot.

Needless to say, the game went downhill from there.

If you find yourself having issues with this kind of thing I highly advise trying to work with your top lane more than your bot lane, purely for the fact that there is only one person to share ideas with instead of two. That top laners are more likely to know how to manipulate their wave state at low elo than the bot lane collective is... probably subjective information, but damn if it doesn't feel right.

Counter ganking is your responsibility, but again its up to the laners to help set it up. Unless you're really in the enemy jungler's head the only way you'll know his pathing is with proper vision control. If you notice one side of the map has better ward coverage than the other, it's almost always better to play around that side even if it's away from whatever objective you want to control. You can give up the first drake (or two)/ herald if it means getting to mid game in fighting form.

As for ganking a weak or losing lane... unless you cross-role a lot or have enough game knowledge to identify the lane state at a glance your laners probably know their matchups better than you do. Most of the time you won't have the time to get a detailed breakdown from them in chat, but if a losing lane starts back pinging PLEASE LISTEN TO IT! More often than not they're signalling their lane opponent will kill you both if you show up to gank, and desperately trying not to die themselves. Only wander into a situation like that if you are SURE you can kill the enemy laner(s) on your own.",1598918591

-Of course they wont listen to the legal orders, so tear gas comes out

-Most people leave, but this tough guy stays even though they have been legally ordered to disperse.

So at this point what are the cops supposed to do? Give him a pass because he is such a nice guy? The protesters fucked up and stopped being peaceful so they need to regroup and try it again.

 They know that the power difference dicted by insane titan forging number and later ridiculous corruptions was a defect of their new random approach to gearing, and they knew it would absolutely destroy any chance at semi-fair pvp, but instead of trying to create a gearing system compatible with pvp (separating it from the pve pool if they had to), they decided to quick fix it and hope it works. 

There is not a single chance that a band-aid fix on a design flaw has received anywhere close to the attention it deserved (it wouldn't be a band-aid fix otherwise).

"flying","t5_2qm1t","Yes, I think they'll be much cheaper.  The initial costs (called non-recurring engineering costs)  will be *very* expensive, no doubt.  The engineering design, software code, testing, etc. will be incredibly expensive.  The initial capital costs to purchase the equipment to retrofit or outright buy automated trucks will also be very expensive as well.  Much more than a traditional truck cabin. 

The operating costs however should be much, *much* lower than what we have today.  Self-driving trucks will be safer.  So lower liability costs, and lower loss costs (less accidents and less damage to cargo).    Productivity will be much higher as they can drive 24/7 and can go coast-to-coast in a couple days where it takes a human driver 4-5 days to do the same.  Reliability will be much higher.  Automated trucks won't get drunk, get sleepy, get distracted, and will have infrared, Lidar, and other sensors which will be allow them better situation awareness than humans.  

So to amortize those non-recurring costs over many years compared to a less productive, less safe human driver who's getting paid ~$50,000 a year you can recoup those costs pretty quickly.  Technology gets cheaper over time.   Human labor gets more expensive over time.  Once it becomes more economical to automate a driver, its gonna happen.  Economics *always* wins.",1598918593

If you want true pvp. You gotta find the unmoderated, community servers. A lot of these can be found in the Africa server network, and in the Middle East server network. Their pvp is 10x better than the moderated servers. 

Even better, these servers often lack resources so transferring a character from your stock server usually will allow you to quickly rank up. You can even unlock some classes that are normally blocked by region such as the warlord or arms dealer classes.",1598918594

*****
&gt; The Trump administration is looking to tighten oil sanctions on Venezuela in the near future, top United States envoy for the country told Reuters news agency on Monday, by potentially removing exemptions that allow some oil companies to exchange Venezuelan crude for fuel from the OPEC member.

&gt; The sanctions have already deprived PDVSA of most of its long-term oil customers, reducing oil exports to below 400,000 barrels per day, their lowest level in almost 80 years.

&gt; A handful of European and Asian customers have continued taking Venezuelan oil under specific authorisations granted since last year by the US Treasury for transactions that do not involve cash payments to Maduro&amp;#039;s administration, but rather exchanges of Venezuela oil for diesel.

R1: Posts Must Abide by Hanlon's Razor.

""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.""

Sometimes, bad things happen not because of people having bad intentions, but because they didn't think it through properly. Poor design choices are often made due to negligence and human error, but asshole designs are specifically engineered to exploit the user for profit. Try to think what the designer would gain from deceiving the user, and if it's likely to be an oversight on their part rather than an intentional design.

My girlfriend and her sister came up with a new pattern and made me two this time. The new style fits closer to my head so it doesn't fog up my glasses as much.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","Yeah CSP For PG course work needs to be completely reviewed, mind you I think you can afford to cheap out on PG program unless you are moving into a 'connections' based program like an  MBA or something research focused where you need the Go8.

&gt; I do wonder how many students are gaining employment in their chosen fields and how secure that employment is. After my under grad a lot of people I know we were working in low paid, casual or contract positions.

Median salaries have been growing quite steadily (even industries like comms posting numbers like $55k), it's unlikely there is a huge proportion of underpaid grads out there - especially given they are posting numbers much higher than Diploma grads from VET schools. 

&gt;There are pay also differences between male and female graduates in the vast majority of industries.

Gender pay gap in new grads is something I haven't looked a lot into in a few years, although in the first instance I'd point to the huge proportion of female graduates of small regional universities as being the factor.

Graduating from a uni in small regional area = poor graduate outcomes compared to metro counterparts (due to a mix of lack of local opportunity, lack of graduate mobility etc.)

Proportion of female graduates from small regional unis = as high as 70% female in some cases.

Males are more likely to be at city universities with stronger employment outcomes, hence the gap.

I'd bet a tallboy that if you cut graduates of your average Go8 by gender lines and reviewed that data you would get very little difference in median starting salary.",1598918596

"hockey","t5_2qiel","Webster's defines racism as: 
prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.

People are rude, or hateful or discriminatory toward white people, but white people are the overwhelming majority when it comes to positions of power in this country, whether it's politically, financially, professionally, or in criminal justice.

People think that white racism in America isn't a thing because of the power dynamic that inherently defines it. Like, as a white person, there really isn't a minority person that can use their prejudice to hinder me financially or professionally. There aren't stereotype that white people are lazy or uneducated that will prevent a hiring manager from really looking at my resume based on my name sounding ""white.""  Like, yeah, some random person might say I smell like pennies when I get wet or call me a cracker but ""racism"" involves marginalized people and I'm sure as hell not going to be marginalized because of how I look in almost any place on this planet let alone in this country.

If you want to learn about making scripts, and get an overview over all the commands in Nucleus I recommend checking out the pinned FAQ post. In that post there should be documentation on how to make scripts. Also for keyboard and mouse support specifically you should check out Universal Split Screen's guide on [Untested Games Setup](https://universalsplitscreen.github.io/docs/untested/). NucleusCoop uses the same methods for MKB support as USS, but it look slightly different in the scripts.

"Aquariums","t5_2rc6i","Could you share what size the tank is and what fish you have stocked? I'm not sure how big your tank is, but I see several issues. Not trying to be a jerk, but the way to fix this is educating yourself on what your fish need size-wise and social group-wise, even finding out what sort of neighbors of other species they can tolerate. Gouramis generally don't like to be kept with multiple fish at the top half of the tank competing with them (like other species of gourami and angelfish).

One species of gourami per tank is a good rule while you are gaining experience with this group of freshwater fish. You might not even have the room to have more than one individual, depends on the species and size. So say your tank is 29 gallons (just making something up to show a point), then you could have a colony (5 or 6) of honey gouramis, OR a trio of pearl gouramis (1M, 2 F), OR one Kissing Gourami. 

Gouramis can be very sensitive to stress from tankmates, and bossy and territorial as well, so it doesn't surprise me that one of your Kissing Gouramis is being chased off of it's food. Often these incompatibilities just show up ""out of the blue"" when everyone was getting along ok. Maybe a fish matured sexually, maybe some plants moved/grew, maybe the tank water quality went down, who knows? Some things work until they don't, and it's not working anymore. Your poor fish will starve slowly, or develop an infection from a bite, or develop dropsy from the stress if you don't take action.

Rehoming a fish is as easy as the aquaswap subreddit, online marketplace, craigslist, local fish rescue or friend, and some local shops take fish in as rescues. Or you could get another tank, and shuffle the fish deck.

Good luck!

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; By this logic we can‚Äôt say the argument from evil is evidence atheism is true.

It's useful to distinguish global atheism (denial that there are any gods) and local atheism (denial of a specific god). The problem of evil may warrant local atheism about a tri-omni God, but it does not warrant global atheism.

&gt; The only obscure part happening in this argument is he uses eliminativism to represent naturalism. But it‚Äôs not obscure or unreasonable to say naturalism can‚Äôt account for intentionality, it‚Äôs a common argument. It‚Äôs also not obscure or unreasonable to say atheism can be equated with naturalism, which is also a common argument.

If Craig wants to argue for those connections, he needs to do so logically rather than pointing out that the connections are commonly asserted. Assertions are cheap, and I think these two assertions mostly come from Christian apologists anyway.

&gt; You asked for the logic. Based on what he does say in that short paragraph it seems plain that is the logic Craig is proposing.

I don't see any textual evidence for your reading of Craig. The closest thing to textual evidence you've presented is Craig's use of the phrase ""his atheism,"" which is ambiguous evidence at best. 

Nowhere does Craig explicitly say that he is only criticizing Rosenberg's atheism. On the contrary, he explicitly and repeatedly says that he is arguing for the existence of God, and he presents the argument from consciousness as one of eight attempts to meet that goal.",1598918599

Well... maybe male Kakas *are* as cat-like as Jubei, but we've never seen one.  The image of Tao's face Plague recalls most certainly comes from [this old manga](https://m.blog.naver.com/jgwkrrk/120182454528) that, while official, is just comprised of gags, and even then Tao's face is put into a thought bubble to signify speculation.  As for Tao's sleeve interiors, Plague is thinking of her [electrocution sprite,](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/blazblue/images/2/28/Taokaka_%28Sprite%2C_electrocuted%29.png) which is obviously played for comedy.  Like Tao's face, we don't actually know what her bare hands and feet look like either, but I think it is reasonable to suspect that they are very cat-like, especially given [the legs of Kaka Kittens](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/blazblue/images/d/dc/Taokaka_%28Continuum_Shift%2C_Story_Mode_Illustration%2C_3%29.png) and Tao's strange shoes having her stand on her toes with no heels.

I had my usual doctor's appointment and he offered to sweep my membranes and I said yes. For those who have never done that before, it's not a gentle process! It was very uncomfortable for me. Afterwards my OB said some cramping and spotting was normal so I want really paying attention when I started spotting and cramping. 

Flash forward a couple of hours and those cramps REALLY started to hurt but I still thought it was just from the membrane sweep. It wasn't until my husband secretly timing them told me that this was it, they were coming every three minutes like clockwork and lasting a minute each. Since we live 30 minutes from the hospital we decided to head over there. Once checked in I was 2.5 cm dilated which the nurse said usually isn't enough to admit me, but since I had just had an appointment she saw I was progressing fast. She had me walk around the hospital for an hour and oh my God it was the longest hour of my life. I was in so much pain from contractions by that point! It paid off though because afterwards I was 4cm which was enough to get admitted and get the epidural. Once the epidural was in I felt SO MUCH better. I got to sleep for a few hours until I was fully dilated and it was time to push. The nurse waited for me to push until my epidural wore off so I could feel the contractions and the urge to push came. 45 minutes after that, she was here!",1598918600

But customers never coming back is **more** expensive.",1598918600

Also, the second page has ‚ÄúHe simple wrote back‚Äù which I think you mean as ‚Äúsimply‚Äù and ‚ÄúAt Tomorrow‚Äù which should not be capitalized, and probably should be ‚Äúfor tomorrow‚Äù.

I have lung damage and haven't been up for risking getting COVID just yet...I have a lot of indoor hobbies that I had to take up because I'm on blood thinners and can no longer do all of the outdoor sports I loved in the past. One of my biggest fears is annoying my roomies by always being here. I know 2 of them don't mind, but the 3rd one who just moved in has made comments that make me feel like she's annoyed even though I literally never go upstairs whenever she's there. She also likes to sneak down into my space though and use it any time I'm gone, so I think the main reason she wants me to leave is so she can take advantage of my space without permission. (I've told her numerous times not to use my space because she leaves it dirty and she also goes out and parties a lot and I am still trying to stay healthy as much as possible...I found her with her SHOES on my couch once and I about lost it!)

All that being said, there's nothing wrong with staying home, unless a person is monopolizing a common space that you feel you aren't getting fair share to, such as the shared tv or dining room, etc...if they're in their rooms or if they share the spaces equally with you fairly when you're home, there's not much you can do.",1598918602

I lost my dad in a motorcycle accident when I was three, and I've dealt with pretty severe OCD regarding a fear of my own death (and a fear of other people in my life dying) since I was a little kid. I still struggle with it all the time, and I probably always will, but therapy has made the feelings a lot more manageable. I know it can be annoying as fuck when people tell you ""Just go to therapy!1!"" like it's easy or something, but that is the only thing that has made my life actually somewhat manageable. 

I've always been terrified of losing my mom as well - it has been my biggest fear ever since I can remember. The realization that came with both time and therapy was even if I did, I would survive. It would be the most horrible thing, and I would never be the same again, but I would still be here. 

I hope you don't take this as me trying to relate to something I can't relate to - feel free to ignore my comment if you don't find it relevant to your own experience! I would never want to make you feel that way, I just know that after losing my dad I've felt a lot of the things that you're describing in your post. 

I wish you the best!",1598918603

*****
&gt; Right from the start, we can see that the pattern fall forecast has La Nina written all over it.

&gt; Drier than normal conditions are forecast for the western United States, amplifying the concern for the wildfire spread. The wetter than normal conditions are forecast over Canada and northern Europe, where the amplified jet stream brings unsettled weather.

&gt; FALL FORECAST SUMMARY AND WINTER INFLUENCE. Reading images and descriptions can be somewhat confusing.

"Alienware","t5_2r5rg","If you want prebuilt computers like Alienware, spending a bit more is doable for convenience sake, then upgrade to the following on the system builder.

16GB RAM 2933Mhz Dual Channel

1660 Super or 1660 Ti 

550 watts with CPU liquid cooling

But will end up around pretax $1099.99 or $1149.99 before the IGN17 coupon (17 percent discount) is applied and any other discounts that you may have.

1650 is good but if somewhere along the lines you decided to try other games, then at least you have some wiggle room with the 1660 Super or Ti.

The only performance difference between SSD and the 7200 rpm HDD is the boot times on Windows as well as menu navigation on games. It does mot affect frame rate.

If you want to be adventurous...

Leave the 8GB RAM and buy from hyperxgaming website the 16GB(8GB x 2) DDR4 3200Mhz XMP HyperX Fury, last time I checked it was only around $67(-ish).

Buy an upgrade from the 7200rpm traditional HDD to a Hybrid Disk Drive like Seagate FireCuda ST1000LX015 that is partial SSD and partial traditional HDD. A sweet compromise between the traditional HDD and the faster SSD. Amazon lists it as $57.99.

But you have to open the Alienware case and swivel the power supply unit case holder to replace the 8GB RAM 2933Mhz with the new 16GB(8GB x 2) Dual Channel 3200Mhz HyperX Fury DDR4 XMP.

Since the FireCuda ST1000LX015 is a 2.5‚Äù drive you can use the drive brackets under the GPU. But be sure to use the SATA 0 port on the motherboard, usually blue, to connect your FireCuda as a primary drive. You can either just disconnect the 7200rpm drive and leave it unused so in the future if you want to gift it or sell it to someone else, then you have the original 7200rpm drive intact and kind if untouched.

You do need to create a recovery disc from the original 7200rpm drive and use it to install Windows on the new FireCuda.

If you want to avoid all those adventures, then just select 7200rpm as you originally planned and upgrade the 8GB to 16GB 2933Mhz Dual Channel (not the single channel 16GB) plus upgrade to 550 Watts CPU liquid cooling.

If your finances allows you to spend a bit more, then upgrade to 1TB NVMe ($1329.99 before the IGD17 coupon code is applied) or 1TB NVMe  SSD plus 1TB 7200 rpm HDD ($1579.99 before the IGD17 coupon code is applied).",1598918603

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","Things we know:

* Overwatch was already watching the Shimada clan before Genji was brought to them. Thus they asked Genji to help them take down the Shimada clan (he likely had valuable insider information, even if he wasn't actively involved in running the clan) in exchange for his cyborg body.
* Genji's life being saved and Genji being made into a cyborg were two separate events. Mercy was responsible for saving Genji's life; we don't know who was responsible for building his new body, although it's probably not Mercy (she's a surgeon, not a cyberneticist) and definitely not Moira (as you pointed out, she joined after Genji's cyberization).
* Genji isn't the first cyborg in Overwatch - Sojourn has as much or maybe even more of her body replaced by cybernetics, and she has been a member for at least 20 years.
* Genji was around 25 when he and Hanzo fought. The first time we see Genji as a cyborg is in Retribution, which is 8 years ago. Conservatively, I'd give 2 years for his surgery and recovery to get to where he was physically at that point. His current age is 35, so 35 - 10 is 25.
* It's never said outright, but it's implied that Genji met Zenyatta after Zenyatta left the Shambali, since Genji's bio describes them as ""crossing paths"".",1598918604

It's all about my boobs &amp; bum.

My father is not a great intellectual. He is a good, kind, curious, and honest man. One day he found a copy of Frank Herbert's 'Dune"" on the bus. Typical of my Da, he thought no use wasting a book, and began to read it. It became his favourite. He caught me wallowing in my teenage angst one day and we had a long chat about my fears and insecurities. The next day, I returned from school to find he'd copied a passage from Dune in his scraggly hand on the back of a paper sack and tacked it to the inside of my bedroom door.

It read:  I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total oblivion. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. - Frank Herbert - Dune

That lunch sack is now framed and hangs in my front room. It is one of my prized possessions.

"centrist","t5_2qx8j","&gt;&gt; You stated no facts. Your opinion that ""Republicans do everything they can to sabotage our government institutions"" is an opinion and obviously false. 
&gt;
&gt;Well when they actually name the policy (""Starve the Beast"") it's hard not to believe it's real. Republicans love privatization, no? There's a clear incentive for them to privatize anything they can get their hands on. And that's one way of going about it.

Privatization isn't ""sabotaging government institutions"" unless you believe government = communism. 

I've worked extensively in government, and for that reason I'm a libertarian. Government is generally terrible at everything and should do as little as possible. 

&gt;&gt;Do you deny that Democratic politicians are trying to sabotage police forces in many States with moves to defund the police? The police agencies seem to think so. 
&gt;
&gt;Sweet christ man, is that a real question? *Of course* I deny that. They aren't trying *sabotage* anything. They're trying to divert bloated police budgets towards things that would actually prevent crime in the first place. 

What prevents crime is police arresting criminals. Do you understand the concept of deterrence?

&gt;And I don't give two shits what the departments say. They're proven liars. 

And you're not a proven liar? 

&gt;The Post Office doesn't ring a bell? Public education? Social Security? 

All of the above are incredibly poorly run and should be privatized. 

&gt;The IRS? We can't even collect the proper taxes because the IRS doesn't have the funds to audit all the bastards stashing their money in offshore accounts or moving it around in questionable ways to avoid paying their share.

This is just nonsense. The IRS has plenty of resources, my father in law is an IRS auditor that specializes in foreign audits. The issue is not the IRS or the devil Republicans you so fear, but international trade law that makes it easy to move money. Law that has created more wealth in the last 40 years than the rest of human history combined. The very device you're using right now couldn't exist without it. The benefits outweigh the disadvantages. 

&gt;&gt;You also don't seem to grasp the concepts of ""small government"" and ""privatization"". 
&gt;
&gt;The first one means cutting funds to things that don't benefit me personally (surely you're aware of the numerous instances of Republicans taking advantage of ""big government"" when it suits them) and the second one means overpaying my campaign donor's company to do a job that used to be done by the government. 

You are really delusional if you actually believe that. 

&gt;But I digress. I don't *need* to talk to Republicans or libertarians and, quite frankly, I don't care to anymore because most of them are ignorant to reality (do you want examples there, too? Cuz I got 'em). I care about the policies of the people they vote for more than I care what the average voter thinks about what his representative *says.*

Then talk about actual policy promoted and voted on by actual real Republican legislators rather than the nonsense you're spouting. 

&gt;And I could ask the same question of the numerous Republicans who seem to think every Democrat shares the views of the most obnoxious SJWs.

The obnoxious SJWs are very loud and have powerful voices in media and academia. They are very prominent in tech companies, I live in the Bay Area and have worked for many of them, and their voices are amplified because of that.",1598918606

A huge amount of people write stuff like ""omg harassment and doxxing, this man who spread sh*t about Aloe is a bad person, poor Aloe"". But for what reason hololive exists, if it cant provide guard to their streamers? Just to take x percent of income, sell merch and accept any caprises of its inadequate fans? Nice goal.

There is nice quote of Russian president - ""We don't speak with terrorists, we kill terrorists"". And it is amazing position - any rumours are rumours, and every time you pay attention to them, you just make everything worse. Just go in the police and send to the jail all of the inadequates who spread sh*t, leak personal info and etc.",1598918606

"ufo","t5_2qnw6","There's A Lot more to this than I described. For example, the Bible's Book of Revelation describes a War in Space - - similar to Star Wars  - - between God's Extraterrestrials and Satan's Extraterrestrials who are defeated in the end time and thrown down to Earth. After that happens it says,

 ""Therefore rejoice, you heavens
    and you who dwell in them!
But woe to the earth and the sea,
    because the devil has gone down to you!
He is filled with fury,
    because he knows that his time is short.‚Äù

This passage in Revelation 12 indicates that some UFOs that people have seen are controlled by God's Extraterrestrials; and others are controlled by Satan's Extraterrestrials. (And while the Bible doesn't allude to this, its possible that there are other Extraterrestrials who aren't aligned with God or Satan).",1598918609

(pretty much spending 1/3 of the month on sick pay at home), but i digress.

What i described above was the only time that ever happened, I was flabbergasted and speechless, and just left. Besides that I was jumped by a gang of teens back when I was new in England and had no idea it's more dangerous than CE country where I grew up. Avoided them and managed to finish the delivery, then never returned to that shithole again. Recently got almost ran over by a biker going in my lane head on.

This allows me to act as if and soothe my anxiety about the manifestation because I reassure myself that ‚ÄúI give it all to God.‚Äù It is one of my favorites because the surrender feels very beautiful and tender and the focus on my love for God and gratefulness to even be alive to acknowledge God instantly puts me in a wonderful state.

Again, look at Jamal Khashoggi as an example of what happens when you try to protest your government. 

When Hungary, a country with similar levels of median wealth, executed its citizens in a similar fashion as Saudia Arabia AND gets as much support generally and specifically to cover up those executions, I can understand your argument. 

But if protesting in Saudia Arabia means I‚Äôll literally be cut into tiny pieces and no one will do anything - in fact, the U.S. government will help deny the fact that I was cut up into tiny pieces - maybe I‚Äôll be less incentivized to protest.",1598918609

"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","I'll explain the contents so that you can make a decision based on your own investment levels. I'll just say that right away, I think the idea that ""All of it is grindable in game"", fundamentally isn't the point. You can probably finish the entire story and game without summoning once and just using the base characters, but people still will pay for new characters. There is nothing in this pack that you can't get in game by grinding, but these you didn't need to grind for. Either way, it is up2u, don't feel bad for spending on stuff you enjoy, just don't ruin yourself by doing so  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 

Acquaint Fate √ó2 - This is the normal summons. You can summon on the beginner banner or the standard default banner twice with these. This is probably one of the more useful resources in the bundle and the main reason why I'd consider it. After 10 summons on the gatcha, either in singles or at one 10 pull, you get a guaranteed 4\*+ unit. The beginner gacha for Noelle needs 8 of these. These do not go towards limited banners and are each 160 primogems in raw value.

Mora √ó150,000 - Money, pretty straight forward. Later on, upgrades are *expensive* so this is never bad to have excess of. Not sure if enhancement costs will change on the full release from the beta, but money is never bad lmao.

Adventurer's Experience √ó80 - Exp to level up your characters' main levels. This is the second tier of hero enhancement items and 80 is quite a lot for the beginning of the game.  

Fine Enhancement Ore √ó50 - Exp to level up your weapons. This is also the second tier of weapon enhancement items and is pretty decent considering we're getting a free 4\* weapon to invest onto.

Northern Smoked Chicken √ó10, Saut√©ed Matsutake √ó10, Sweet Madame √ó10, and Tea Break Pancake √ó10 - These are all food items. I'm unsure of what exactly some of them do, but from what I remember, the Northern Smoked Chicken is a 2 (or 3 idr) healing items for 1 unit. These seem pretty decent for the start of the game as healing items since you won't have a healer in your party.

Bonus Rewards: Hero's¬†Wit √ó15, Mystic Enhancement Ore √ó20 - These two are your Adventurer's Experience and Fine Enhancement Ore respectively, but the 3rd and highest tier of experience. 

I don't have any numbers for experience from the beta and even then the scaling could've changed, but either way this bundle is pretty decent to start out with. None of it is worthless and just filler. ~~Unless you're a god at dodging in which case the food is situational at best.~~ 

The selling points for me are the hero exp and the Acquaint Fate as the former will really quick start leveling your characters and the latter is two extra summons to go for Noelle sooner. Is it worth 10$? I don't know your financial situation and investment into the game. I would get it, but I'm not playing on PS4 so rip lmao.",1598918610

Now there are a couple of Walmart polices that kind of attempt to "" prevent "" this sort of thing

* Rules on breaks: Walmart policy is no break first/last hour of your shift, and not an hour preceding or following a lunch. So basically if you clock in at 1, you cannot take a break until 2:01, and cannot take a lunch until 3:02.

* Rules on lunch: You cannot go 6 hours without a lunch punch. Meaning, using the previous example, if you clock out for lunch at 3:02, you get back at 4:02, the LATEST you are allowed to punch out is 10:01pm. 

So in theory, yes they can tell everyone lunch at 3:02, back at 4:02, clock out by 10, and are within their right to do so.

"AskAChristian","t5_2s79d","&gt; Because we are stiff figuring things out.

Are ""we making progress""?

&gt; Satan is the spirit of deception and is required for us to take a step back and see I AM. We need to first understand what isn't to see what is. Imagine everything being perfect light. You could not see anything at all. We need some darkness to provide contrast to the light.

Eyyy the first person to respond to both posts! Darkness can help us appreciate light. The antagonist can help us appreciate the protagonist. The book of Job for example its kind of confusing who the protagonist actually is. It's not necessarily clear how the supernatural intervenes for or against people. 

&gt; Each of us must decide this for ourselves. Satan's original deception was far more complex and sinister than ""you can be like God."" This was more in the vein of ""when did you stop beating your spouse."" Stating that we could be like God presumed that we are already spiritually dead and separate from God. Regardless if we think one mind could be equal to God or if we cower in pathetic submission to God we are still considering ourselves separate from God, confirming our spiritual death.

Can we really decide for ourselves? I can decide and declare to God right now, hello, I would like truth and do NOT want to be deveived. I don't want to sin. Does that intention/decision help me? Not sure where you are deriving the stop beating your spouse comparison. We don't even know for sure that Satan was that talking snake. Humans and snakes were cursed forever in lieu of more constructive behavior correction to the guilty parties involved. Why should I be held responsible for the original fall that was 5000 years before I was conceived? 

&gt; Christ's faith and example was unity with God. He called us to follow him and have his faith. Instead, we built many religions, golden calves, to destroy the truth and worship idols. An idol is an attempt to distill all existence into a focus point who which we can relate in our state of separation. This reinforces the lie that existence is a series of disparate objects and beings controlled by a separate deity.

Other religions are a result of us figuring stuff out. Billions of people are going have billions of ideas unless they are forced to accept something that is clearly objectively observable such as gravity. I have never met someone who does not believe in gravity. We can't agree on uniting so we divide. Can we survive in society without ""idols""? Does it separate us from God to do anything that is not worshiping him? 
 
&gt; Jesus is the Word, the Son of God. He contains all things. God created the universe by ""speaking"" and that Word spoken is Jesus. Confining Christ to a single idea is another form of idolatry.

I like that response, never really thought about how Jesus is a wider form of communication with God. 

&gt; I do to go shopping and an occasional drive with my family. I have a job I can do from home, but it's been hanging by a thread.

Do you enjoy your work? 

&gt; Prayer is a method to align your will with I AM. You are not an inert object to be moved by God; you are part of that motion. You must believe what you pray to for it to be effective.

I get a little caught up on the intertwining of faith and truth especially because faith is not always a reliable path to truth. If a Muslim prays to Allah 5 times a day and believes in it for example, what happens to that prayer? I like the concept of us having to be in motion though I get that.",1598918611

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

I respectfully disagree. Lamden is quite different than anything available in the top 100. It's the only blockchain written in Python that has smart contracts. Most other blockchains use obtuse and difficult to learn languages such as Solidity for example. Lamden integrates Python which is one of the fastest growest languages in the world and is easy to develop for. It took a few years for the team to develop Lamden, but now that they paid their dues in that regard, they'll have an advantage on all other blockchains moving forward. Think about all the people who know how to code in Python and how appealing it will be to them to be able to code in Python on Lamden without having to learn a new language. The barrier to entry is lower with Lamden than any other blockchain platform to date.

Lamden is attempting to reach Python devs outside of blockchain, so their scope is bigger than most.

"patientgamers","t5_2t3ad","When hordes turn up, it‚Äôs often better to just let them raid and do their thing if you aren‚Äôt strong enough to defeat them. You don‚Äôt have to hunt them down and kill them, you can just take the loss and let them wander.

Who are you playing as, because honestly I don‚Äôt remember having too much trouble from beastmen, but it depends where you‚Äôre located on the map a bit I think. Certainly not chaos and beastmen together early on. That‚Äôs pretty unlucky.

As for movement, it‚Äôs mainly an army stance thing. Use underways a lot if you‚Äôre playing as something that can use them, it‚Äôs quick and allows you to bypass threats to get where you‚Äôre needed.

As for heroes, I agree they‚Äôve got a bit too much health. Even when they‚Äôre not doing that much damage they take too long to kill. I tend to ignore them until I‚Äôve got much of their army routing and then just throw everything that counters them at it.

On foot, run them down with cavalry or monsters, on a mount use spears. And just set all ranged units to skirmish then when they flee.

Magic is also a big deal. Use your debuffs on them, make sure when you throw units at them you‚Äôve buffed yours with a hero and debuffed them.

Actually heroes aren‚Äôt that big a deal, it‚Äôs Lords that give the most trouble, and when you kill them, it‚Äôs really just wounding them and they will come back after a time.

You could also just try for assassination and really focus on building up a hero, but that‚Äôs a long road.

I think the main thing I had to change thinking about compared to previous TW games was just to let things be messy. I like to keep my settlements upgraded and protected, and then expand slowly. In Warhammer, it seems to work better if you just accept losses to cut the heart out of enemies rather than a slow expansion. Charge in and take their main settlements even if it means losing some of yours as they sneak around behind, then come clean up once they have no resources to rebuild their armies.

"mtgfinance","t5_2vv1m","I did a rough calculation of my EV, it came out to \~$125 per VIP pack after selling fees and shipping. This includes $6 for the UPC and $5.50 for the set of 10 non-foil lands but doesn't include tokens or bulk (any single card under my B/E price).

If this EV was for a normal Standard set where you might have, at most, a $50 mythic that's skewing the EV then I would have no problem dropping $100 for an EV of $125. I can do this because I know I have a 1/121 chance of pulling that mythic from any given pack or \~30% (36/121) for any given booster box so I know that if I buy \~4 boxes then I should have a pretty good chance of pulling that specific card. Even with one box, that $50 mythic should only represent \~$15 of the total box value so I know that excluding it will still have a rough EV of $110 so it's not make or break depending on a single card.

However with this VIP product \~$25 of this EV is tied up in 4 Mythic Box Toppers. Which means I want to buy enough to have a relatively high probability of getting at least one of these box toppers the probability of pulling any 1 specific M box topper is 1/30 per pack and we're looking for 4 specific box toppers so the chance to pull one of these box toppers is 4/30 or 1 out of every 7.5 packs so at a minimum I'm looking to buy 8 packs, half a case, to give me strong odds of pulling at least one of these box toppers. So unless I have $800+ to invest in 8 VIP packs of 2XM I'm probably going to pass.

Cracking packs for value is all about understanding EV, only going for products with positive EV and making sure that you can afford to buy enough product to give you good odds of hitting that EV.",1598918613

Unfortunately I don t know what you can do to make him stand up more. I don't think he gets the bigger picture of not standing guy for you and resolving the dispute. When you have your baby, will she be allowed to see and be with the baby if she does not apologize?  He has allowed her to do what she wants. If he loves you, he needs to let you do what you feel comfortable with your baby and NOT let your baby be with someone you do not feel comfortable. Bring this up to him as an issue that will definitely arise if he continues to let her belittle you and not apologize. It will tear your friendships apart. Sorry. 

For my wife and I, the stance has always been us two TOGETHER as one, against the world. We chose each other over parents and family.  And definitely over friends. An attack against one as an attack against both. I hope he changes since if he wants to get married, he should put wife and kids first, over everything else.

And we had frequent meetings so we were all able to have time to say things like, ‚Äúhave you noticed ____ acting off lately?‚Äù And then we could discuss or keep a look out together.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Let‚Äôs look at the last four because those are the most recent (we can definitely go back further if you‚Äôd like). 

We had Jacob Blake in Wisconsin. In the immediate aftermath, the Democratic governor called for the state house and senate to act. The senate majority leader, a Republican, has basically done fuck all. 

We had Breonna Taylor in Kentucky. The governor, a recently elected democrat, immediately moved to change laws in Kentucky. He‚Äôs also being challenged by republicans in his state. 

We had George Floyd in Minnesota. The governor there, also a democrat, called on his state house and senate to act. They‚Äôve proposed a bill that would require a social worker to go along on calls for welfare checks and on calls for the mentally impaired. It would also create an independent arm to investigate police shootings instead of allowing the police to investigate themselves. That bill is pending because the governor has to work through things with the police union, but I think they‚Äôll get it done. 

There‚Äôs Ahmad Arbury in Georgia. The republican governor has chosen to do nothing. 

I see one party trying and I see another not taking things seriously. It takes time to work through these things, so I don‚Äôt expect immediate change. The police unions in many of these cities have their own police bill of rights. It allows them to be held to a completely different standard than most citizens. There is also qualified immunity in most states, which is also trash. 

Speaking of qualified immunity, I know of two states aiming to curve the blanket protection it provides police. That‚Äôs Colorado and Connecticut, both of which are led by Dems. Again, one party is trying while another is sitting on its hands.",1598918615

Let's say you wanna choose a number between 1 and 9.
And let's consider two events:  first event (called B) the number you choose is either 1 or 2 and  second event (called A) which is choosing number 1.
We can clearly see that event A  is part of B (means A C B).

So now, if p(B) is the probability of the first event which is the probablity of choosing either 1 or 2. It is normal that this probability of this event is superior than the probability of choosing exactly one. 
In other word, you are more luckier that your random choice is 1 or 2 than 1 only. Which implies P(A) &lt; P(B).

You can use the same example in your way to understand the other parts.",1598918616

I've played Narik into High Terra a few times, and you can find other people that have as well.  There's a few ways to go about it from what I can tell, but the way that has worked best for me was also based on Perturabo's Wrath and a *lack* of troops.  Narik is going to make the troops you're going to win with.

So my deck was based on controlling the enemy board with early game troops, tactics like Precision Bombardment and Superior Firepower, and cards that stall like Logos and Bitter End.

I would drop Iron Circle, Tyrant Terminators, Chi-Mu, Dominators, and the Predators.  The only big troop I had included was the Legendary 8e IW guy who makes frontline troops every turn.  And that wasn't well until 3500 games.

See also Pearl Harbor, Nanking, the Palawan Massacre, Unit 731, and many others.

US planners estimated the invasion of Japan would have resulted in over a million allied casualties. Nearly 500,000 Purple Heart medals were manufactured in anticipation of the casualties resulting from the invasion of Japan; the number exceeded that of all American military casualties of the 65 years following the end of World War II, including the Korean and Vietnam Wars. In 2003, there were still 120,000 of these Purple Heart medals in stock. There were so many left that combat units in Iraq and Afghanistan were able to keep Purple Hearts on hand for immediate award to soldiers wounded in the field.

its heavily dependent on the design of the spout and the rest of the pot as well, such that when a user begins his pour, turbulence in the water reservoir is minimized.

you can design this in a few ways. for example, one of the middle pots that is shown is actually very flat compared to the rest. because of this, you dont need to tilt very much before flow begins, thus reducing the chance/amount of turbulence you introduce.

alternatively, a pot that is very spherical can also minimize disturbing the water reservoir. imagine having a perfect glass sphere 2/3 filled with water. if you rotate the sphere in space without displacing it in any direction, the only force exerted on the water is at the boundary of the glass contacting the water, and as you rotate the sphere, basically the water will move very little.

the very last tea pot shown has a flat base but is quite spherical otherwise.

the size of the spout on the inner side will also affect turbulence within the spout. you want the flow of all the water to be as aligned as possible once its in the spout. if the inside of your spout goes from very wide then converges to the exit nozzle, there will be more turbulence in most cases than if you had a perfectly cylindrical tube as a spout.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

does the laminarotensitisity of your tea pour significantly affect flavor?

im gonna say no.",1598918621

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","Last week I finally got a 1tb nvme because I quickly realized how silly I was to think a 250gb was going to be enough.  Stupid me didn‚Äôt pay attention to the bios settings when I installed to the new drive, also I thought , this is 2020, it‚Äôs ok to be lazy and just put the new drive in the empty slot without disconnecting all the other drives. Apparently csm is enabled by default on my mobo ( I assumed the opposite w/o checking)

So that meant that after install, when it rebooted, the bios couldn‚Äôt see any drives. Boot repair couldn‚Äôt find anything to repair.

It was educational. I learned about going to notepad from recovery command prompt and using the save as dialog to be able to copy paste  to rescue files. One at a time because it runs out of memory easily. 

It took re install back onto the original drive, so I could re-burn the windows installer into a stick but this time with csm off and no other drives connected. So I could then finally see proceed to install again onto the larger drive in such a way as it would be able to see itself after reboot. Sheesh.

"NOLAPelicans","t5_2vppf","The fact that everyone keeps harping on about us getting a 3&amp;D wing still kinda confused me. We have Hart and Didi already to fill in that role. The only way I can see us needing one is if we trade Jrue, in which case I'd hope that we are trading for a 2 guard. Even if that trade is for a centre then we slide Hart or Didi into the starting line up and pick up another wing to pair with the one 3&amp;D remaining in the reserves.

In this draft I'd ideally go for Poku or Deni Avdija. 

Poku is a massive risk/reward situation. At best he is a slimmer Jokic who is worse (but still really good) at passing but a much better defender. At worst he is out of the league pronto. But at his best he is a perfect fit with our team as yet another ball handling option, with great passing ability, a rim protector, and a floor spacer.

Deni on the other is a safer pick with a much lower ceiling but he gives us massive flexibility. He is a playmaking and ball handling 3/4 who I would have coming off the bench. So our main bench mob would be NAW/Didi/Hart/Deni/Melli/Hayes. That gives us a lot of flexibility to go offense, defense, big, or small depending on the matchup. It would also give us someone to put in a the 4 if we slide Zion to the 5 for limited minutes. Deni just bring souch flexibility to our roster. The big worry about Deni is his shooting from 3. He has good form but for some reason it just doesn't click. Given the improvements from Zo and BI in those areas I hope that can be corrected by our development staff.

Obviously if Vassel fell to us for whatever reason I'd hope we take him, because you take the best talent available in that sort of situation, but outside of that I'd want Deni or Poku.",1598918622

"aggies","t5_2qyds","For some reason, I can‚Äôt seem to find any figured for number of cases by age, but the CDC reports that there have been 125 ‚ÄúCOVID-19 Deaths‚Äù, (which just means infected with corona at time of death) in the 15-24 age group.

The most relevant data I can find shows the IFR (Infection Fatality Rate) by age and sometimes country, but it only shows data for huge age groups for some reason. The IFR for ages 20-29 in Spain is 0.01%. 

The predicted percentage of a population that need to have immunity to achieve ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù for Covid-19 is 60-80%. If every student at TAMU was ages 20-29 and 70% of the population got Covid-19, 5 would likely die. 50 times less than will likely die from car accidents this year. Considering the age group is actually about 18-24, That number would not be 5.

If you believe the majority of sources that claim the IFR for 24 and under is 0%, the number would be 0.

TAMU 
-Student population: 68,603 (with many of those not even in CS/Bryan
-Vast Majority under 24
IFR: &gt; 0.01%
-Predicted deaths (assuming 70% infection): &lt;5

UK 
-Population: 66.65 Million
-Median age: 40
-IFR: 14.13%
-Predicted Deaths: 6.592 Million

Sweden
-Population: 10.23 Million
-Median age: 41
-IFR: 10.27%
-Predicted Deaths: 735,000

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I mean, on a factual level, it sounds pretty straightforward. Presumably someone did something sexual with him (either another child or a predator), then he acted it out on you those three time. That's not right but it's a pretty common sequence of events. Then he got older and developed a fuller understanding of what he'd done, and he distanced himself from you. Chances are he felt ashamed of it, and felt bad/angry whenever he saw you you because it reminded him of how ashamed he was. Then he grew some more, owned his actions and stopped blaming you for him feeling them, and gradually you grew closer again. Before he died, it sounds like he reached a point where he was willing to have a conversation about it. I'm sure there are many unique and personal details to you and him about this, but I'm pretty confident that if that conversation had happened, he would have told you more or less what I've said here. And I'm also pretty confident that he did love you, that was why he worked on himself enough to get to the point of being willing to have the conversation.

The thing you really need to work through here, IMO, isn't the mystery of what he might have said. It's on how to get resolution and go on with your life. I think you would still be having this dilemma even if you'd spoken, but instead it would be agonising about details he left out or wasn't articulate enough to explain adequately. The real heart of this is that there are no do-overs. Even when you understand why a wrong happened it doesn't go back and make you or your relationship like it never happened. We struggle to accept the permanence and un-do-ability of hurt. We want to think that if someone can say just the right thing, explain it well enough, apologise perfectly enough, everything will be made perfectly whole and right. That's what the search for closure often is. But healing isn't like that, it isn't perfect healing. It's more like a scar. It heals imperfectly. *That's okay.* Imperfect healing is more than good enough for you to move on and have a good life. You're going to drive yourself crazy if you keep looking for the perfect healing that you think you could have gotten from him (you wouldn't) and thinking it's the missing piece in your life.",1598918625

I think best scenario is keep qualification the way it is, but make msi matter more. Maybe send 2 seeds from every region to make it longer and more impactful. Then make it so the finalists (or winner) gets an auto qual to worlds or something like that. 

The main reason spring feels shit now is that msi really doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs a glorified rift rivals pretty much. But if it actually meant something and had stakes then spring would matter. Because now best case scenario even if you win spring and make finals at msi (or win msi), nobody cares because once summer starts all that matters is worlds.

You see Chicago, better known as Chiraq post 9/11, was heavily in need of a savior. A warrior who would triumph amongst the rest and really show the world how to let hang their genitalia.

Fortunately our Astrophysicist Aztec Warrior Tekashi, Daniel Hernandez for short, has been assisted by many who are seeking the truth. 

Donald Trump has publicly said ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs a great individual and wish him well‚Äù and Tekashi has shown his loyalty by not speaking out against the president. 

Let‚Äôs not forget who the real genius is as Einstein remained public to keep Daniel secret.

If you want to handle the topic *appropriately,* it would best be done by writing your story how you want to write it but include moments where both characters have to acknowledge and confront systematic and personal racism in their lives. Even better, have the characters confront *their own* racism and deal with it. A more interesting story than making a ""not racist"" cop is making a cop who is human and who confronts their own racism.

Yet again, there was zero grounds on using lethal force for someone lunging at him.

But at your age as a male you are at the very bottom of the sexual market place.  While the girls your age are going to be at the top of their sexual market place value.  The good news is that those positions will gradually switch as you age.  A woman's value will drop off a cliff after about 35 while a man's can continue to rise most of his life. 

Start to develop good habits now though and it will pay off down the road.  Particularly get really into lifting weights.  Other than that you should read and watch everything you can on Game and learning female nature.  Read books on finance and investing too. 

The trap that most young men fall into is that because they are young and struggle to get women they wind up settling with the first woman that will have them.  But if they stayed single and worked on developing themselves by the time they are in their mid 30's they could get just about any woman they wanted.

At 14 you might be a little too young but if I had it to do over again what I would have done as a young man would be to focus on just dating older women.  I am talking cougars here.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Non-official servers of many other games are silimar (garry's mod, rust, dayz) and full of shady practices for cash-grabbing too, ranging from mildly exploitative practices to full-blown casinos. Most profit goes to big servers.

In some games developer may make a server IP blacklist (garry's mod), require account linking (CS:GO) or straight up modify client code to prevent people from getting (=buying) cosmetic items on custom servers (team fortress 2).

But for those games most servers are legitimate and perform an online-check so you can't play with a pirated client.

Games I know with a lot of pirated servers are CS 1.6, CS Source and Minecraft, and most shadiest practices are happen on those servers. Most pirated minecraft servers offer pirated minecraft client download straight from their website (and it is usually required).",1598918628

Dear /u/Toonation!

Thank you for posting on /r/resumes. Please, let we mention some important information (probably you know it).

[Wiki Guidelines about Posting a Resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/wiki/index#wiki_posting_a_resume)

Please, remember to add a **flair** to your post.

Due to the extremely increasing amount of spam/scam on the sub as posts, comments, in PM, and via GoogleAds on Reddit, we have to warn everyone about it. Unfortunately, such offers imply low-quality service - and actually, they are. Such scammers were banned, and there was some feedback on their work. So please, do not trust shady offers.  
One can find trusted professionals on the wiki - there is such a list.

We wish you get support from the sub in many ways, including reading it, top posts, wiki, and searching. There were many answered questions here, please, feel free to check that.

Besides, this subreddit is better looking in the old Reddit design on the desktop in the browser with adBlockers (FireFox/PaleMoon with uBlock Origin + uMatrix): https://old.reddit.com/r/resumes/

"Stellar","t5_2t9ha","I've been going through a bunch of coin metric sites trying to update some information on Stellar related sites. If anyone sees little or just outdated/wrong information, I recommend you send a message with the correct information so they update it. You can also ping me if you don't have the time.

Aside from the SDF re-branding, I think it's paramount that the Stellar community 're-brands' itself too and constantly revisits the information it has to make sure they're up-to-date for everyone to fully understand. Not just for new people but those in the space that never researched Stellar fully. 

We don't always have to 're-brand entirely' just to get a fresh face. We just have to re-analyze and look over the current information and see how we can make it more relevant for today's readers. 

Fixing errors in learning guides, updating old information and removing 404 links leaves a much better first impression. **If you see anything, let me know ASAP!** (if you find something big, I might even pay you out of my own pocket : ^ )",1598918630

But, and the end of the day, isn‚Äôt it technically still rape? Like, all of the justifications given for it not being rape don‚Äôt seem to hold up if you applied them to a human.

For example, ‚Äúits only done when the animals are in heat and looking for a mate‚Äù. Ok. But what if you did that to a human while they were horny or something? It would still be termed rape.

And ‚Äúanimals don‚Äôt have the mental capacity to understand that it‚Äôs a violation or they don‚Äôt have the emotional capacity for as much trauma as humans do‚Äù. Ok.

Oh, this is the big issue?

&gt; Have you read the GAO study that outlines the differences in promotions and discipline for POC? You should read it.

Yes I have. I think there's going to have to be more than one study to really investigate this problem, but ultimately this needs to be looked at closely and a better way needs to be paved. However... this study is missing a ton of unknowns (things we can't and don't know). We probably need to do a better job standardizing discipline and penalties. I've seen Airmen get DUIs and literally get a slap on the wrist, where others lost rank. Sometimes different command, different circumstances determine this. Sounds like there's some bias, but unless these penalties were handed out where there was no wrongdoing, how can we really say that the punishments should line up? We can't estimate the infractions committed by non POC Airmen based off of the infractions that were documented. 

We need to get to the root issue behind that study, but there's absolutely gaps in it that we need to be honest with ourselves about.",1598918632

"sexover30","t5_34cdl","That might be something to talk with a therapist about, one on one and/or in couples counseling. 

Here's some ideas I have, take what is useful and leave the rest. 

I would start by identifying if the bad feeling is mostly coming from your partner or from you. Does he guilt trip you or express a lot of disappointment or frustration with your lack of enjoyment, and not reassure you that he still loves and cares about you? If so that's a relationship issue. 

Or is it more of an internal issue, where even if he is accepting and reassuring, then you still feel bad? If so that might be learned from previous relationships or family and could fit more with a one on one therapist. It could be coming from fears of being abandoned or rejected if you don't ""buy"" love with sex. 

Do you feel like this is an issue where you are at odds with your partner, or can you frame it as a challenge that you are facing together, on the same team? Like is it your needs vs his, or can you frame it as both of you collaborating to figure out a way to get all of your needs met?

You could also try empathizing with him without feeling like you have to ""fix"" his discomfort. Try to understand how he feels when you don't have sex the way he wants and what that sex means to him. Does he feel stressed because sex is how he relaxes? Or is he sad because it's how he gets his needs for connection and intimacy met? Or does he feel guilty or embarassed because inside he's beating himself up for not being a good enough lover? 

I suggest then trying to find other ways to meet those needs, to take the pressure off of you meeting those needs for him in one very specific way (PIV). If it's his way of de-stressing, maybe you could give him a massage instead, or you could go for a hike or do gentle yoga together or soak in a hot tub. It's also his responsibility to find ways to relax that aren't hurting you, as you say PIV is. Maybe he needs to reduce stressors in his life as well. 

If it's about connection and intimacy then again couples counseling might help. You can find other ways to nourish that intimate connection, like using the Longwalks app together. Learn each other's love languages (you can look that up) and if his primary love language is physical touch, see if he has a secondary love language. And see if he is willing to be proactive in speaking your love languages as well. 

If it's the last one and he's feeling embarassed or guilty about his skills as a sexual partner, which may be the case, then it's something he will have to work on without blaming you for it. There are a lot of resources out there now for men to learn how women's bodies work. There's a site that has instructional videos based on research...I don't remember the name right now. He may have to humble himself a bit but also realize that he wasn't taught this stuff and has probably received a lot of misinformation from porn, but it's never too late to learn.",1598918632

I'm not saying they couldn't do it (they def could), but if they did do it it would take a lot of work and potentially alienate people who had very specific characters in mind for their Wardens. I know one person who made his Warden a coward, the dialogue options were all there, trying to wuss out of fights, backing down from some confrontations, letting companions be the spark that ignites some fights, etc. Some of my Wardens (I've had 12 so far lol, and I'll probably do another after we get a release date for DA4 and are getting close to it, then I'll redo all of the games) have been racist against humans, or against elves. Some have been stick up their ass mages. The fact that DAO had no VA meant you could really, really detail your Warden's personality, in a way that just isn't doable with Voiced lines (at least not without having the VA record every line in a few different tones, and doing 6+ options for every dialogue choice lol). Having your Warden return would be very weird for a lot of people if they weren't properly represented, and that's all but impossible.

I think, the best we can hope for is to have a DLC for a game focus on him (similar to Leliana's Tale in DAO, where we got to play as her). Bringing him back as the PC is the only option, but bringing him back as a full game's PC is too restrictive. Having him be the focus of a DLC on the other hand gives enough room to bring him back without giving us too many options that could seem out of character for our Warden.",1598918632

"CoDCompetitive","t5_2tvg8","That's not how it will go down for non-starters/elite talent

1. The value of an individual player just went down by 20% due to 4v4.
2. Considering the talent in challengers and the rate 18 yr olds come out of the woodwork, teams aren't going to want pick up their option on player (and pay them) to control their rights for just 1 additional year. If the time frame was longer it would make sense, but 1 year is short enough for opposing orgs to just wait it out rather than pay an excessive buyout. If you look at other sports, teams get virtually nothing for players without term on expiring contracts.
3. These games change enough year to year where players' value isn't necessarily guaranteed aside from elite talent whom will be retained regardless.

What you're going to see is a drastic reduction in roster size. Almost every current sub, aside from a few exceptions, will not have their option picked up. 5ths that aren't perceived to be initial starters next year will become subs, and the 6th roster spot may not even be signed until the season starts to give a team flexibility to truly judge talent.

In hindsight, a lot of these teams had far too many player's on their roster. It's a lot easier to start the season small with room to sign a breakout player (mack, drazah) than to tie yourself up to players that will just be payroll drag.

You mention Dashy, Gunless, Octane and the Twins...all of whom have proved they're worthwhile assets, unfortunately that's not going to be the case with the majority of the league who are on the bubble.",1598918633

"nanocurrency","t5_4br49","&gt; I was given a identifier. Every month I pay with bank transfer to the account of the company with my identifier. There is no invoice every month, there will never be any QRcode

Okay? The analogous process with Nano is to do a direct block hand-off with your identifier attached. You are the originator. What's the problem? This is a direct drop-in replacement for bank transfer. It's just that the identifier doesn't end up on the ledger.

&gt; Internet came, only thing changed, is internet banking, but its still one account and many identifiers.

I was not referencing the internet in terms of how it changed financial transactions, but that it is an example of a complex protocol that companies had to adapt to utilize. And most of them (that survived) went through the effort to do so, because of the benefits it offered. Nano is a similar protocol, and if it offers enough benefits then smart companies will go through the effort to integrate it into their service. Some will adopt it earlier than others, and the earliest adopters will have to put the most effort in to pave the way for others to adopt it more easily.

&gt; Nope... creating receive accounts per payment, change of payment identification in internal systems ... that are not easy things, especially while you want to continue use old payment methods.

But we are (or at least I am) discussing direct block handoffs with associated off-chain identifiers and any other transaction info. Seeing as this is something that doesn't exist yet, neither you (nor I) can speak to exactly how easy it will be, but it will certainly be easier than initially utilizing the internet was.

&gt; I know only handful of people who do backups. All others ignore it and failures blame on tech. That's just as it is, that wont change.

&gt;But yes, for companies it will become standard process.

They don't even have to do backups. Their wallet will probably do this for them on the cloud. It would be like switching between apps for music or fitness or whatever.  They would try to change wallets, realize their transaction descriptions don't show up, and google ""how to export transaction info from Natrium"" or somesuch. Anyway, for people who don't care enough to backup this information it's probably not that big a deal if they do lose it. How often do you check your credit card statements from a few years ago? It would be a much bigger deal for companies, and as you agree they will certainly make this a standard part of enterprise software.

&gt; trustless means, that I don't need to trust any one, to be able to trust the ledger. It does not mean that I can not trust ledger.

I know what it means and I meant what I said. Accounting is currently centralized, and the only thing stopping people from manipulating their own records is the legal ramifications. I'm just pointing out that nothing would change from the current situation if identifiers and other payment info are not stored on the public ledger.

&gt; Any information contained in such signed ledger is inherently trustworhy, and could be used even in legal procedings.

Yes.

&gt; That means that reference number in the block... can be paired to invoice for the purpose of accounting, tax, audit

Which means you still have to trust the the invoice that the company stored in their own centralized database regarding all the other auxiliary information about the transaction. This is no different from the company storing a block number in their centralized database to make the pairing.

&gt;&gt; Unless you are suggesting we store on the ledger all the plaintext information legally required by every government...

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","Others have already spoken about how your twin's identity doesn't mean anything about yours. So let me kind of suggest a different meaning for you.

You mentioned that you're already questioning your identity. And the short answer is - that's good. And fairly normal. People question aspects of their identity all the time, especially through teenage and young adult years as we find ourselves and put together who we really are.

Gender is just another aspect of that searching, but it's one that most people don't think to reflect on, or can't find the framework to consider it. It's a difficult thing to take apart, and sometimes even more difficult to put back together once you've examined all the pieces.

Consider it an exploration like any other aspect. Let yourself think on it. Read up on it, when you like. See where your mind takes you, what it focuses on, what questions you find yourself asking over and over again, and what trends you find in the answers that you come to. If you're cis, cool! You've got a more thorough understanding both of your gender and the processes that trans people go through. If you're not, congrats! You've taken some vital first steps towards figuring that aspect of yourself out.

Questioning is good. Questioning is healthy. Questioning is enlightening. Embrace the questioning, and try not to focus on where it's leading you - pay attention to where you want it to go.",1598918635

Like I couldn‚Äôt imagine watching my favourite franchise and not seeing someone who looked like me, it‚Äôd suck. I personally loved the movie, I loved seeing black people be excited to be represented in such a big franchise.

"ethereum","t5_2zf9m","Ok, i have come across your Burner wallet before, but wasn't aware of the factory / modular idea until now. Looks like an interesting idea.

But i guess what i'm trying to do with this redesign is to open source some answers to the problems caused by lack of UX focus in this case with MetaMask, but it equally applies to MEW/ My Crypto.

The main problem i see is the economics of open source crypto wallets. Doing projects that rely on grants or occasional funding is fine, but good product design work is kind of a grind. It takes time, persistence, focus &amp; quality control. Which requires money, as well as dedication to put design &amp; user experience on an equal footing with security &amp; features.

Without which, these default Eth wallets like MM &amp; My Crypto look &amp; feel  well below the standards that prevail in web 2.0 products, or in solid projects like Argent, Matcha or Ledger Live.

What frustrates me is how these apps have become de facto standards, because they reflect poorly on the whole of the crypto ecosystem.

So how to lift the standard for these apps ? Directing funding to designers as well as devs is perhaps one answer, because without it, designers will choose other projects. But i certainly don't have all or perhaps even any of the answers :)

I did this redesign at least partly out of frustration, because i'd prefer to take concrete, positive action than just complain about these problems. But yeah, how to solve this problem, i'm not sure.",1598918636

"detrans","t5_3pyg0","Hey again. I never really thought of ‚Äúthe leap‚Äù as being an internal thing so much as external - in ways of social presentation and pronouns, names, and surgeries and hormones. I‚Äôm at a point where the next ‚Äúbig leap‚Äù for me is either re-starting hormones, or undergoing surgery, or coming out full time to everyone (work place especially). Those are massive leaps that I am too afraid to take. (I‚Äôm afab by the way) The things I‚Äôve already done in regard to transition are kind of maxed out. I do all the things possible to ‚Äúpass‚Äù and cannot without the next step, which is something more drastic externally. I‚Äôve done all the other things afab to ftm/transmasculine do. I think I look quite nonbinary naturally, but it‚Äôs not enough to really take that next step to transitioning... and I‚Äôm too hesitant to take any of those steps. Building up confidence is something I struggle immensely with. I had a massive identity crisis early this year that threw my entire life off balance, and I think my confidence is worse than ever. Everything about this is confusing and consuming. I don‚Äôt even understand the whole internalized transphobia thing, I guess.

"politics","t5_2cneq","They're not trying to appeal to people with half a brain. Those aren't their demographic. They're trying to write headlines and paint a vague picture in uninformed people's minds.

There's a reason the right is 0% substance and 100% smear. It doesn't matter what republican policy is as long as you scream loud enough to convince your voters that the democrats are EVIL SATAN-LOVING SOCIALIST COMMUNIST DEEP STATE NAZIS!

And the worst part is it works. Look at Hillary Clinton: Decades of smearing took a toll, a lot of people disliked her and didn't even really know why; they just had this vague sense that she was corrupt and up to no good because GOP had worked tirelessly to make her name synonymous with corruption regardless of whether it was true or not. You ask any republican voter why they hated Hillary and all you'd get is vague answers about corruption and Benghazi and emails and that'd be about it. 

And that's how we get president Donald Trump. Scream loud enough and long enough and it doesn't matter if what you're screaming is bullshit, a nonzero percentage of people will take it as truth and that's enough. So if they scream that Biden is a radical rioter-loving socialist for long enough, it'll stick.",1598918636

Godless lightning strikes from mindless grey clouds;  
A fire in the rain a smoke signal

A whining beg for numbing elixir;  
Cry not for help, and always look behind ‚Äì  
The head leads the hand to white-out killer.

To limp is to die so I close my eye;

"sousvide","t5_2rzyz","Honestly tuna is not something I'd recommend for SV as a more traditional sear method prevents overcooking, I find. I definitely prefer my tuna rare though, so it might be doable for medium rare. Try it out, but you'll probably want to ensure you have a long cool down time between pulling from the bath and putting in the pan.

I was also thinking salmon, trout, or bass (if trying to sear the skin after), as it will have a tendency to be very moist and tender, so both tough to get good browning and tough keep it in one piece. 

If you want flaked salmon for salad though where you will be discarding the skin, SV is fantastic.",1598918637

So, a 57 year old male runner, recovers in 6 weeks to full running from double hernia operation (which was a story in itself!!!).  Now I wasn't  doing any PRs but it felt good to run.

"RoverPetSitting","t5_3jryc","Okay, so that I don't begin rambling and talking too much myself, I'll just try to answer each concern individually:

‚ÄúThe whole thing is a liability.""

Well that's the thing about sitting through Rover, both the sitter and owner are protected via the website for the majority of the scenarios he listed. Is it perfect? Absolutely not, welcome to life I guess? They tend to favor owners over sitters, definitely. But I personally have not had any issues dealing with Rover during difficult situations, and *most* other sitters have seemed to not have grave issues. Rover will not sue you, we've all done it for years just fine.

""What if the dog gets in a fight with another dog?""

There are many ways you can go about this. For one, know that dogs fight. It happens. Big whoop. Two, vet dogs well and don't agree to sit dogs that don't get along with others, especially if you're sitting for more than one. Three, as I do, don't sit for more than one owner at a time. It's honestly pretty simple. When I'm walking a dog and can't control variables, I walk in areas where I know dogs don't roam as much (pretty common where I live unfortunately), and again, I typically take dogs who I feel confident won't fight another. I have told owners that I will be driving their dog to another location to walk -due to knowing there is an aggressive roamer nearby, and they've 100% backed me up and thanked me for being so proactive. You are also allowed to say no if you don't feel comfortable with a dog...

""What if you can‚Äôt break up the fight?""

Overexaggerating. Most dog fights aren't a dire situation. Should you take them seriously? Absolutely. Yeah, don't put a bitey Chihuahua with a defensive Dane.  But as I said, dogs fight, it's part of how they communicate. *Obviously* I don't condone it and avoid it at all costs (which is one of many reasons why I don't mix families), but it's not the end of the world he's making it out to be. My dogs fought growing up and yes there was blood. One dog was affectionately nicknamed Mike Tyson after biting off another's ear (this was late 90s lol) They also cuddled and us small children made it out just fine without a scratch. We also learned pretty quick what warning signs to look for because we know our dogs and know that dogs are not these random overly aggressive completely unpredictable monsters. They *always* have warning signs and triggers. Idc if someone claims it was ""out of nowhere,"" it wasn't. They just didn't see the sometimes admittedly subtle signs.

""What if the owner sued you?""

Again, pretty much protected under Rover and their contracts, it's what attracts people to using the website instead of just opening up a business. If anyone has an issue with you, typically it ends at them getting a refund. I mean, *technically* I suppose an owner could sue you, but so could any random Jo Schmo on the street. You would have to really fuck up and them to be pretty petty for it to get anywhere. This is starting to sound like my Aunt who doesn't shovel the sidewalk in front of her house because she believes someone will sue her for thinking the sidewalk is safe and using it, falling, and then claiming she set up an unsafe environment. People suck. But *most people are good.* 

""What if the dog bites you?""

Congrats you just joined an elite group of Rover sitters XD Again, not really that big of a deal. Do I want to get bit? Eff no. Have I been bit? Many many times. By dogs, cats, and things WAY WAY worse than dogs. Have I ever been bit by a ROVER dog? LMFAO. No. I've never felt safer than with my Rover pups. Don't be dumb. Only accept dogs with vaccines, know a dog's warning signs. Don't piss off the dog, don't take aggressive dogs.

""What if the dog takes off on you/runs out of the house?""

Don't leave the front door open? Like idk, this sounds like HUMAN error, likely to occur on his part for not being careful. I mean I get it, accidents happen, I had a dog run off once too. You go get it. It's not that big of a deal.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Having stayed in US and talking to lot of people in US, this is my opinion. The reason of all these goes back to the constitution and one thing that Americans held dearly - second amendment, right to bear arms. ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

The amendment was written in 1789. That was a time when the government was not established properly, people had to bear arms to protect themselves, police system was less and most importantly there was no automatic weapons.

In today‚Äôs world, the amendment needs to be updated to reflect current times. When you have a well established police system, you have to make them the authority to maintain the law and order. But it seems the police do not trust the citizens as the citizens can bear arms and so the police themselves feel threatened by the citizens and draw weapons seconds after meeting a suspect. To them, everyone is a suspect who can have guns. This affects the most vulnerable citizens of the society - the poor. As a result, the citizens do not trust the police as well - trust needs to be mutual.

So Americans, if you want to solve the problems of your land - wake up to 21st century and update your constitution.",1598918637

"HaloStory","t5_2vomh","Omega Team‚Äôs appearance in Halo Wars 2 is non-canon. And even if it were canon, I would argue that Spartan 025‚Äôs T-58 plasma cannon is his own custom modification, and not evidence of official mat√©riel development by the UNSC. 

And as far as that goes? that‚Äôs already been done. Jorge‚Äôs Etilka, Kelly‚Äôs Oathsworn, Linda‚Äôs Nornfang. So there is evidence that the Spartan-II‚Äôs customized their own weapons, and the weapon modifications in Guardians imply that Spartan-IV‚Äôs do the same. 

The M6 Grindell/Galilean is the only weapon designed as supplementary mat√©riel for the Spartan-II program. And the logistical problems people keep mentioning on why creating weapons specifically for Spartans are mentioned in the Spartan Lasers lore. They are incredibly expensive, the batteries drain quickly, and the recharging unit is often not fielded for logistical problems; which could probably be related to their size and their own power draw needs. They simply aren‚Äôt practical. 

Other oversized weapons would likely suffer the same problems. They would divert munitions production away from weapons that could be used by the other 99.9% of UNSC forces. The weapons themselves would also be more expensive simply because they are only making a few hundred of them. It‚Äôs just a very bad idea. 

Now that the Covenant war is over, and Spartan-IV‚Äôs are becoming more ubiquitous, is it possible that the UNSC may steer weapons development to cater to Mjolnir clad soldiers? Maybe. But it‚Äôs unlikely. The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines still vastly outnumber the Spartan branch. 

Producing weapons that can be used by everyone is just a better investment.",1598918639

Yea. They were slightly mocking it (although not entirely, becuase it may very well be the only form of FTL travel that is possible outside of a wormhole traversal).

There is a very possible scenario where percieved FTL travel will not be possible without wormholes or an Alcubierre styled-Drive.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole

Insofar as I understand...those are the only two forms of physics (assuming engineers can exploit the possibilities that allow FTL travel).

"Naruto","t5_2quts","&gt;That was a fatigued Pain.

A fatigued pain just meant his intervals were longer than 5 seconds. He still showed a 5 second interval when he fought Kakashi and he wasn‚Äôt fatigued.

&gt;Itachi's genjutsu can't be stronger than Jiraiya's because they aren't the same type. Jiraiya has an auditory Genjutsu. Beside, Itachi never used that against Nagato and Pain can senses Itachi's chakra anyways so he knows when he uses a Genjutsu. Also applies to Amaterasu. So since Pain can act before Amaterasu is launched initally, he can ST it. Even if he get hit by it, he can ST it like Nagato did.

Headcanon. Itachi‚Äôs genjutsu is superior than Jiraiya and the Uchiha clan is a clan that is superior in all forms of genjutsu. 
Itachi has genjutsus that affect all 5 of your senses so what are you trying to argue here? Sensing chakra has nothing to do with avoiding a genjutsu, Kabuto is a superior sensor yet he fell pray to Itachi‚Äôs. Nagato is a sensor, yet he fell to Jiraiya‚Äôs genjutsu. Being a sensor doesn‚Äôt mean you can automatically avoid a genjutsu, we seen sensors get caught all the time. So he‚Äôs not going to sense Itachi‚Äôs genjutsu and Itachi‚Äôs genjutsu does not give off pressure like Amatestu. So all you‚Äôre doing is speculating. Nagato couldn‚Äôt even sense Itachi using KA on Kabuto, he thought the pressure build up was Amatersu.
And Shinra tensei does not repel genjutsus, there‚Äôs nothing tangible to repel.

&gt;Pain keeping up with SM Naruto is actually more impressing than Itachi keeping up with KCM1 Naruto because SM Naruto has better CQC than KCM1 Naruto.

No, he kept up with [base Naruto](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0433-012.png) and then [Sm Naruto sent him flying.](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0433-015.png)

Sm Naruto is not faster than Kcm Naruto at all. That‚Äôs the dumbest thing ever said. Kcm Naruto beat Ay top speed. Are you telling me that Sm Naruto can beat Ay‚Äôs top speed?

&gt;SM Naruto CQC &gt;Third Raikage &gt; ~ KCM1 Naruto.

This is laughable. Kcm Naruto beat the 3rd Raikage‚Äôs speed.

&gt;As for Shunsin speed, none of them have notable feats.

They do. Edo Itachi blitzed Edo Nagato and he also kept up with Dsm Kabuto cutting off his horn.

&gt;No. That examples shows that even if Sasuke can react to Lee's attacks, he isn't fast enough to physically react to them.

That‚Äôs because Sasuke copied Lee‚Äôs speed and then showed his feats of being equal to Lee‚Äôs speed in the chuunin exam. You clearly don‚Äôt read the manga.

https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0112-005.png

https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0112-008.png


&gt;If A is as fast as Kaguya and B is as fast as Kakuzu, and B can react to 4x Kaguya's speed ,  B won't dodge it because his speed can't keep up with his Reaction speed.

This doesn‚Äôt make any sense 

&gt;Also I don't see how Itachi can counter ST or BT to Black rods.

I already said that Yata mirror counter black rods

Actually it matters a lot, and this is how I know you don't actually know jack about psychology, trauma therapy and are are still clearly damaged goods... each form of abuse has a different trigger that cause the person to act in a specific manner physical abuse is most common from people who were physically abused... normally a parent or guardian, they learned the behavior.... while emotional abuse like controlling behavior do to jealousy.. most often comes from personal insecurities which don't always have to be learned... these two different forms of abuse manifest in different ways, impact the victim in very different ways and for therapy need help is such different ways that if it's insecurity based your behavior can actually cause the abuser to become worse and not see therapy

And don't forget we don't even know what kind of abuse happened... he litteraly could have been emotionally abuse in the way of in arguments called her names... which while still dick move majority of people do this form of abuse... if I called every one of your exs how many could say you never once insulted them or called them a negative word

&gt;I think you need to go to therapy. It seems like you have a lot of unresolved issues you need to workout.

Says the one clearly projecting their trauma against the OP

&gt;Now vs. When the OP was abusing their girlfriend?

Ya if they was still abusing their girlfriend you would be right to behave the way you are but they aren't, they realized their mistake and want to change.. but youre so slow on this and lack the maturity to understand how to handle the situation.. You're blindly lashing out at the OP to make yourself feel better over giving constructive criticism

I'm also not sure how my parents are aware that ICSI (a type of assistive reproductive therapy) was likely the cause of my childhood epilepsy, but never knew (or never told me they knew) that ICSI has a higher chance of producing autistic children than IVF, which already has a relatively high chance. 

Also the fact that I once cried about eating a banana because I killed it. 

Or my pattern of getting in trouble because I'd hear other kids say inappropriate things, and repeat them around adults and not understand what I'd done wrong.

I could go on but I won't.

edit: okay I gotta mention the time at 19 when I was at dinner with my parents and they made comment insinuating I had done something I regretted and were wondering why I didn't feel remorseful... 

I exploded. Yelled at them saying ""I CLEARLY ALREADY FEEL LIKE SHIT YOU DONT NEED TO RUB IT IN"" And then got up mid-dinner, left the house, and ran down the street. 

Then my dad told me, if you're feeling something, why don't you express it on your face?

Apparently what I thought was very clear was non-existent to them...

This is 6 years ago (I waa 19 then and am 25 now) and I still haven't expressed to them that I do not understand how it is possible for other people to express emotions because when I am at my most emotional, I am so intensely overwhelmed by the internal emotions, that I'm unable to remember how to match them to my face and mannerisms... because making facial expressions takes extreme conscious effort in order to be correct. 

I can't be rational when I'm emotional, and in order to appropriately+accurately express what I'm feeling inside to NTs, I have to be rational. It just doesn't line up.",1598918642

C: Shen. He's a chonky boy, not very ninja-y. But at least he can teleport across the map and take opponents by surprise.

I got the Endurace, assembled myself (it was 90% assembled), loved it, got a pro fit, figured out exactly what measurements I needed in an integrated cockpit and ordered the ergo cockpit. I had to get the head tube trimmed because the new cockpit was more low profile and the head stuck out of the top.
