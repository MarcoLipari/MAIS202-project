"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","turnwheel is here to stay i think.

but apart from that overall for both games i think that the skill system is going to change, maybe they will go from skill scrolls to the regular class based skills, byorthm maybe will just go, or will be more easily to manipulate, maybe your supports could temporaly boost them, maybe a system based on food like in fates or 3h in which giving them a nice meal will send them stronger into battle.

PoR i think that maybe will get some minor stuff added to the story, nothing too big, but radiant dawn will receive bigger changes.

more units should be added to RD, in some levels you fight a lot of units and you dont have a frikin healer, also too much yellow unit action, they should add an option to acelerate NPC combat, they should add real supports, maybe cutting a lot of options but making supports with actual dialogue, probably also giving more paired endings, not all of them necesarily romantic just like in 3H.",1635724800
"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","It's a consistent problem of Chibnalls era, too many supporting characters. Every character should have a purpose and reason for being there, whether that's to provide a different perspective on the situation, to do something relevant to the plot, or just to be a victim. Chibnall seems to like just having a lot of people there, most of whom don't end up doing anything.

Let's look at one of his previous showrunner episodes where I think the supporting cast was used well, the Silurian two parter from Series 5. In that we had the kid Elliot, his parents Mo and Ambrose, her dad Tony, and his co-worker Nasreen. They each had a purpose in the story. Elliot and Mo were taken by the Silurians, Tony was poisoned by them, Ambrose was vengeful against them, and Nasreen was the scientific expert to help the Doctor. None of them felt unnecessary in the episode, which can't be said for most of the supporting casts in Chibnalls era.",1635724800

Im not saying Tesla sales are bad, they are impressive for what they are.

"Barca","t5_2s561","&gt;Well in my definition fitness coaches etc are also part of the medical and they literally are the ones responsible for the physique of our players. The medical team are not just doctors treating injuries, it‚Äôs the whole staff dealing with the topic of keeping our players fit and in shape.

I understand what you're saying and it makes sense, but it doesn't tell the full picture. For example coaches like Bielsa and Simeone have players who are incredibly fit, but it's a coaching decision, not one from their medical staff.

Also for players being greenlighted, it's a bad example, because it happens all the time with every club (and in every sport). The medical team has an input, but the final decision is made by the coaching staff and the players. Most of the time the medical team knows that the recovery isn't 100%, but the player is needed by the team for an important game so they take a risk and play anyway. Players are less often rushed out from injury for an easy game or when the team is doing very well precisely because it's not 100% about the player's health. 

I understand you're mad and it's frustrating, but we simply don't have enough insight to know if they're doing a good job or not. Something the correct thing to do is to simply not have an opinion.",1635724800

Student loan debt is also fundamentally different because all of society benefits from educated people capable of performing their civic duties and engaging in labor necessary to run and operate a complex modern society. We are allowing a complex of parasitic lenders to suck the lifeblood from our specialized workers, from our industries who must pay higher salaries to service that debt.

For profit lenders provide no service. They are a middle man between the treasury and funds for those that require them. Your mortgage and car payments are exploitative and should not be what they are.

"anime","t5_2qh22","It was cute (though a little heartbreaking) to see Irina [call out to Lev](https://imgur.com/JKXcxCg) like that!

I like how this show is kinda building up a potential romance pairing, but not being too forceful/obvious about it; Other than the line when someone asked Lev if he liked her, it's mostly just showing they're looking out for each other, perhaps more than what their duty would require! 

Equally cute [to see her all flustered](https://imgur.com/0q4IgVU) about parachute jumping, but still trusting him!

[*Not today, hooman!*](https://imgur.com/6xZYF0e) I also noticed that [they're showing her 'vampire' side](https://imgur.com/6ET7D4c) more and more; Of course there's her backstory and stuff that comes back more, but also, they're kinda just showing her fangs more, aren't they? Seems like they're setting up the growing conflict, both with her mind (how she feels about what happens in the past) and her body/nature (vampire fangs, shows she's not like them/one of them).

Harlova thinks [Irina's like an animal](https://imgur.com/FaPtYxx), and no doubt she'll be treated as such, whether she succeeds or not. [Lev keeping her as a pet](https://imgur.com/JiT0Fts) wouldn't be the worse fate she'd plan for her, I think.

(That being said, why is she so damn attractive? I swear, evil/ruthless women in positions of power always are, aren't they?)

[Irina's expression](https://imgur.com/0zOUZsm) at the end... I think she's sad about the dogs (more than if it was a human, to be honest) but there's also the fact that this is gonna be her in 2 weeks, if anything goes wrong. 

And now we know that even if things go somewhat 'right' but it's about to land in a different country, they might just detonate it before it touches the ground. Joy!",1635724801

They thought (or still think if they are stupid) that he would would deliver on his immigration promises and that he would have the best interest of ""americans"" (which they interpreted as white) at heart.

Clearly that isn't a case and considering the things he has done (or hasn't done rather) it is pretty clear that he was a monumental failure for anyone that had hopes of him being a actual far-right wing president like he sometimes made himself out to be during his first campaign for example. 

Trump is as far right as politicians are allowed to be in the west which ironically (or obviously) isn't very far at all. 

But even so there are actual communists that support Biden because of public healthcare and other left-wing issues. They are not ""liberals"" or ""democrats"" yet they support Biden. That obviously doesn't make Biden a communist.

But then again I guess the American redneck boomers call Biden a dirty commie so it all kind of makes sense. It's just utterly stupid and shows that any opinions the type of people that call Trump a ""fascist nazi"" or Biden a ""communist/socialist"" should be immediately discarded without any consideration.",1635724802

Some notes:

* [Takikomi-gohan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takikomi_gohan) is a type of dish where rice is cooked with vegetables and soy sauce directly in the rice pot
* ""Prewashed rice"" ([musenmai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_rice#Processing)) is a type of rice sold in Japan that comes pre-processed (as opposed to normal rice which you have to wash before cooking)
* The ""rice brand"" column on the right alters the cooking parameters according to the cultivar/brand of rice you're using (ex. [Koshihikari rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koshihikari))

(Edit: The fourth type of rice from the top is called Yumepirika, not Yumepikari)

It looks good to me, but I'm never able to conclusively tell by watching a full speed replay. Please let me know if you get a chance to try `mirv_pov`on another replay where you can tell the difference.

The way I check for correctness (such as with https://davidbdurst.com/blog/gotv_to_pov_media/gotv_vs_ping_vs_interp_and_ping_vs_live.png) is by doing the following with and without `mirv_pov` and comparing to a screen capture of live gameplay

1. Recording an OBS screen capture of the demo replay at 1/2 or 1/4 speed
2. Pausing the video playback and checking for correctness.

I need to take this approach (as opposed to pausing the demo replay) because CSGO's demo viewer seems to disable all interpolation when you pause. You can tell because if you pause during playback, your character will snap to their position in the server state without interpolation. If you play and pause demo playback with `cl_interpolation 0`, your character won't snap since there's no interpolation to disable.",1635724803

So yeah, realisticly/pessimisticly we could have two big ISS sized bases on the moon from 2035 to 2070. They'll be there for research and prestige mostly.

This is not the same situation. Bjerg is in no way a definitive upgrade over Jensen and Jensen is in no way a definitive upgrade over Tactical. Moreover there are clear monetary incentives to pick up Bjergsen due to the number of fans he brings.

Any human or youkai can easily waltz in out of here if they know where to look, rendering it useless. Along with this, we can literally help the humans when we have access to the outside world! We can literally be living with floating televisions and a cure for every flu by now if we were to just get rid of the barrier. There‚Äôs much more here then just youkai too, even some of the youkai like humans at this point anyway! Some exceptions are people like Rumia of course, but she doesn‚Äôt know any better, she barely even has a place to live I think‚Ä¶ along with this, the humans can help us with us helping them! Since Gensokyo is pretty old fashioned, if we can open up to humans, we can modernize the place if we needed to! 

We can‚Äôt really resolve the situation peacefully though, we already know the shrine isn‚Äôt having any of that. Like they ever will.

Lazarri is an amazing rb who can dribble, has pace, and with a sentinel has the defending capabilities to do a good job at RB.

I have used him and Cuadrado, and the only thing I like more about Cuadrado was the 5 star skills. Lazarri has 3 star skills but at RB it isn't really a deal breaker for me.

Also rulebreaket Arnautovic. I play him at CAM with ab engine which sounds unconventional but he has the most smooth dribbling I have ever used especially for a player his size. Decently quick and a good shot on him makes him a dangerous card to face. His passing with the engine chemistry style is also surprisingly good and better than his stats suggest. Also just simply because of his height he is a danger with corners.

"boulder","t5_2qyl3","No, this is based on exactly what I'm seeing that's sold over the last 3-6 months in a number of neighborhoods - including Martin Acres.

Houses in that particular community in particular often have egress windows on the back and sides.  It can be tricky on one side since there's typically a sidewalk also on that side.  And it can be tricky on the front since some models have a driveway that curves around there.  But it's absolutely done - and done with permits (I've got a friend who tried to avoid permitting, got caught, and went through the process with no problem).

I don't actually think there's any problem with adding egress windows, or rooms in a basement, or renting the basement to additional people.  My personal concern is if people go beyond a reasonable number per house - as in the examples I've provided.",1635724809

I feel like this hurts more than if the arc had been earlier and they'd at least had a few months together, but at the very least it really sucks because I was so sure she would end up dead, but instead it's like this. Imagining how long she waited, and her panic when she realized he wasnt coming back, ugh, pain

&gt;It was a small moment but I loved Naruto and Sai's leech routine in the forest

That was pretty fun, probably the best comedy in the show for a while I think, helped by how casual it was. I'm also quietly glad it was leeches and not something like spiders (although I had remembered it was snakes so the leeches was a surprise as well)

"diabetes","t5_2qhsj","Woah‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre right to feel alarmed and uneasy given the dietary changes that are being asked of you. I also have OCD and T2DM and that combination makes it so incredibly hard to approach food without losing control and going too far and ending up with an eating disorder. I didn‚Äôt make it but hopefully I can help give you some advice.

Above all the most important rule that you must never break is that you must never engage in a dietary change that you don‚Äôt feel 100% in control of. I don‚Äôt care how important your doctors or other diabetics tell you something is, if you feel like your OCD is going to run with it into an unhealthy place it will. It‚Äôs simply not safe.

It sounds like your insulin resistance is still at a pretty early stage. If that‚Äôs the case then it‚Äôs perfectly reasonable to start medications ‚Äúearly‚Äù such as metformin. If you start medication now it will slow the progression of your insulin resistance while allowing you to maintain an unmodified diet for a very long time.

I had to do this for about five years because I knew where this was going to go. I was even drinking several sugared sodas and candy bars for about five years while taking metformin and my blood sugars remained great the entire time and it took COVID-19 trashing my pancreas to mess that up for me.

Of course, that‚Äôs not the healthiest thing to do from just a metabolic standpoint but you need to remember that you‚Äôre not just your metabolism. You‚Äôre a whole person and what might be ‚Äúbest‚Äù for your metabolic health might not be the healthy choice for you as a whole person.

In terms of the symptoms that you‚Äôre describing since starting your diet those sound a lot like some of the symptoms I experienced when I had to go low carb to get my blood sugars under control before I had access to insulin. The reason I was feeling sick was because I wasn‚Äôt compensating for the fact that I was missing out on calories from the carbs I wasn‚Äôt eating. In other words check that you‚Äôre getting enough calories throughout the day even if you‚Äôre not feeling hungry.

In terms of specific advice on how to approach a diabetes friendly diet as someone with OCD:

- Do not ever cut a food from your diet completely. Always make a point of having that food once in a while. Even candy.

- Reduce by adding. For example if you are cooking garlic broccoli with rice fill your plate with extra garlic broccoli. Also add extra oil to the garlic sauce so that you get more nutrition from the broccoli portion of your meal.

- Never change your diet in any way that you aren‚Äôt 100% confident that you are in control of. If you end up in the position where you need to change your diet in a way that you don‚Äôt feel in control of reach out for help from a therapist or nutritionist who specializes in disordered eating to help you make the change safely.

Anyway, I hope this was helpful and if you need to reach out and talk about food you‚Äôre welcome to drop me a DM.",1635724809

also for noelle i would add a thorn ring spell that gives +3 atk/-3 hp to a monster but if it was DW noelle return it to your deck and turn it into snowgrave noelle which has a magic effect of spawning a Snowgrave spell to your hand with its cost reduced by 1 based on how many ally monsters died in the current game (base 30 minimum 10) and its ability is to wipe the field, dealing 3 direct damage to the opponent based on how many lanes were open on their side of the field (meaning it deals a max 12 damage to the opponent and it comes complete with special game over screen if this move was lethal)",1635724810

Her husband lived to be 81 though!     
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren_Bates       
&gt;Upon the outbreak of the Civil War, Bates joined the 5th Kentucky Infantry Confederate States Army, as a private in 1861. His ferocity in battle and imposing figure saw him quickly promoted to the rank of captain. Bates was severely wounded in a battle near the Cumberland Gap and was captured and imprisoned at Camp Chase in Ohio, although he later escaped.[3]      
      
After the war.....      
&gt;He returned to Kentucky after the war. Before the war, his first occupation was as a schoolteacher. While the circus was on tour in Halifax, Canada, the 7-foot-11-inch-tall (2.41 m) Anna Haining Swan visited. She and Martin soon got to know each other, and were married in 1871. The highly publicized wedding, at St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London, England, drew thousands of people to try to attend, due to both the uncommonness of the spectacle and the disarming good nature of the pair. Queen Victoria gave them two extra-large diamond-studded gold watches as wedding presents[citation needed].
      
&gt;Martin and Anna moved to Ohio in 1872, settling in Seville. On 19 May 1872, Anna gave birth to a daughter, who weighed 18 lb (8.2 kg) and died at birth.[4] The couple built a large house to accommodate themselves comfortably. He explains the next few years in his autobiography:",1635724810

""Some"". As in a fraction of a percent. Maybe a couple hundred cases of adverse reactions out of billions. You know what's more dangerous for a far greater number of people? The disease it prevents. The vaccine is significantly more safe than getting COVID. This is objective fact.


&gt; That's precisely why the J&amp;J one got pulled in many states


It got pulled temporarily as a precautionary measure, not because it was harming or killing people in any statistically significant way. 


&gt; Are they likely to cause harm? Not as far as we know


And COVID is likely to cause harm. Therefore getting vaccinated is an effective and safe way of not getting sick. Which means anyone discouraging others from getting vaccinated is putting others in danger.


&gt; but let's not pretend that nobody has gotten horribly ill or died from them.


I've yet to see a single report intrinsically linking any vaccine to a person's death. Billions of people have been vaccinated throughout the world. Over half of US adults are vaccinated. If the vaccine was at all dangerous, people would be dying/becoming severely ill left and right. Anecdotes are nit more important than statistics. Especially when the statistics have a sample size of roughly 3 billion+ people that have been vaccinated globally. Your argument is basically like saying ""people shouldn't go outside, because there's a one in a million chance they could be struck by lightning"".


You have a better chance of winning the lottery than dying to a vaccine.

&gt; And seriously, anyone who goes to a football player, or ANYONE on Twitter, for medical advice, is likely dumb enough to get themselves killed anyway.


Doesn't mean they deserve to die. And it doesn't mean anyone should encourage them to do things that are bad for their health.",1635724812

Accept that you have very little agency before 3 items, and by the time you reach that threshold everything has enough damage to kill you in half a rotation, so you must focus on improving your mid to late game teamfighting and not dying in lane. 

I wish I could give you laning phase tips but honestly I'm Gold I and every lane feels pretty much like a support coin flip so I just try to survive, only going in on fights with clear advantage, play to scale and pray my team has functioning braincells.",1635724814

What sucks is that not having the conversation isn't actually going to stop this stuff from happening. We're going to keep looking for greater understanding and you can bet your ass rich people are going to turn their babies into superpeople as soon as they possibly can with zero regard for the potential consequences. I'm not saying either thing is even bad, but we're certainly rolling those dice without thinking about the risks.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the actual discussion itself, it comes down to whether you think neurodiversity is worth the risk of (certainty of, on a larger scale) extremely disabled people. But again, look at how we talk about fat people. We apparently can't handle the nuanced position of ""fat people are less able and to many less attractive, but still people who deserve to live good lives.""

"transpassing","t5_2t5fu","EDIT: disclaimer here, I should state that I am a follower of the ""less is more"" school of thought when it comes to eye makeup. You may feel differently. I personally dread the thought of somebody seeing me and thinking to themselves ""wow they've got a lot of eye makeup on"". Even if it's well done.

I've got some selfies in my profile if you'd rather just look and see! But otherwise, here's what I do: 

1) Start with a light layer of foundation around your eye and on the lid. Helps the eye shadow stick to something. Also hides any natural blotchiness your lids might exhibit. 

2) Dark eyeshadow on the upper lid, toward the outside of the eye. Blend this lighter as you go inward and upward.

3) I do a smallllllll amount of dark eyeshadow just below the lower lash line on the outer corner of the eye. Very thin. Less is more here. Again, blend this lighter as you move toward the inner eye.

4) Nude waterline eyeliner

5) Once done with eyeshadow, bust out the black eyeliner and start with the upper eyelid. Outline the shape you like (I like the wing that's in style these days). Follow the curvature of your lower eyelid as it curves up to form the wing. Next, I basically draw a straight line from the top-center of my upper eyelid over to the tip of the wing to finish the outline. It'll appear nicely curved once you return your eye to a resting state. This should result in a shape that starts razor thin at the top-center of your eye, gets thicker, then tapers up into the wing tip on the outside of your eye.

6) Fill it in.

7) Set your eyeliner with a black or dark brown eyeshadow (light dusting). This will keep it from smearing and it'll stay better, longer.

8) I like to dust the inner corner of my eye with a reeeeally bright or sparkly nude shade of shadow. Makes your eyes pop like crazy!

9) Mascara if you want. I keep it light on the lower lashes. In general I'd rather it be too light than clumpy, so I err on the lighter side for mascara. But you do what you like!

Good luck bein' hot, sis! :)",1635724816

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","I'm a newbie and an enthusiast in mapmaking, any constructive criticism is welcomed. I used 2-Minute Tabletop's ""Cave Room Builder"" and ""Forest Floor Map Assets"" and Dungeon Scrawl for the base layout.

The intention behind this map is to run a quick encounter with blighted plants.

The story is that centuries ago a couple of elves died together here, ostracized by their clans for their forbidden love. Their anger and sorrow rooted and cursed the soil, where their corpses lay dead, a white especial flower bloomed and all around spiked vines give birth to blighted plants full of hatred for any trespasser. The corpses hold the only thing that remains of the couple's love: their rings, one of a black gem encountered only in the Underdark and the other made of white silver engraved with elven motives. The proof of their everlasting love for eachother, now enchanted by their everlasting sorrow.

The orange leaves in the back are covering an escape route dug by kobolds in case they need to lure anyone tracking or pursuing them.

I intend to use the rings ans a magic Item that can turn any plant arround in a Twig Blight controlled by the user. The effect would only work if the wearer is using both rings at the same time.",1635724816

&gt;No offense but this sounds like paranoia.

You're implying I'm paranoid, without addressing why the issues I've brought up are rooted in paranoia, rather than in reality - which amounts to an ad-hominem attack. You either address why what I've said is paranoia, or you keep such things to yourself.

Literally my point, I am realistic about how this technology will be yielded, because of the scope for abuse that I've already brought up, coupled with historical examples of companies and governments past abuses.

I say this often - I am not a pessimist; just a realist.

It would have been even better had she not revealed her reasons for breaking up with him and instead told him she didn‚Äôt think things would work out, and cut him off at that point. Either way, she needs to continue being careful because men like this (people like this in general) feel entitled and may act on their impulses with violent or emotionally destructive behavior.

"videogames","t5_2qhzy","I don't entirely agree. I'm glad that you are enjoying the indie scene, though!

Most of the indie games I've experienced in recent years were hyped up by word of mouth, but ultimately still feel like discount versions of other big-industry games. At worst, they make me want to give up and return to the older games.

Example: I'm a few hours into Hollow Knight. Although the presentation is obviously stellar, there are so many iffy gameplay design choices that make me miss Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. I'm one more frustrating part from giving up on it and having my daughter go it solo.

Further, I haven't even picked up the super-hyped crowdfunded games like Mighty No. 9, Bloodstained, or Yooka-Laylee, because they all look like lesser versions of the games they're trying to emulate.

Meanwhile, tried and true series have been cranking out some big hits lately, like Mario, Zelda, and Resident Evil.

I think what will end up happening is the more clever and innovative indie games will get scooped up by big publishers like Nintendo and receive high-production sequels down the line, and honestly I'm all for that.",1635724818

&gt;How often do you use it, how's the wear and tear? Have you dropped it? I wonder if it would hold up in a restaurant.

I don't have that exact sharpener, I have a cheaper off brand from amazon but even the one I have is steel framed and would easily hold up in a restaurant.  Basically the only way you could ruin it is if you  really went ham on it and bent the frame, which would be quite difficult since it is 1/4"" of steel.

I've been using it multiple times a week for years and it looks and functions like brand new.  I keep my knives in pretty decent order so I mostly use it in honing mode (almost no pressure with the blade flat), and my chefs knives and sushi knives are damn sharp.  Blade up it does a good job getting a neglected blade up to snuff, and blade down (which takes off the most material) it can put a passible edge on just about anything.   You can also hold pressure on one of the sides to sharpen asymmetrical knives or even serrated knives.

Anyhow, it's definitely the best combination of sharpness to effort that I've tried, but if price is no object I'd probably use a lansky to create the edge and use this style for daily maintenance.",1635724818

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

By the way, your edit isn't quite correct. Whether you can create them depends on the filesystem and the features it provides. For example:

If I remember correctly, the screen was either black or just a stadium shot. But it'll always be burned into my mind hearing Remdawg say ""this tastes like shit,"" and then NESN cutting back to commercial.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","OK, first up, this isn't false reasoning. There is a body of experimental evidence that shows driving while talking on the phone is just as big an impairment as driving drunk. 

I just did a quick search on Google scholar and found two studies, one from Japan and one from the US. They both concluded that driving while talking on the phone resulted in impaired driving. The University of Utah study concluded that it was as big an impairment as driving drunk. (I also found a summary of a report from the UK which found that people talking on mobile phones had ***worse*** response times than those driving drunk, but that wasn't peer reviewed research, and I think it only looked at hand held use, it's hard to tell from the summary.)

Both studies also concluded that it was the conversation itself that was the biggest impairment. People get involved in the conversation and don't observe what is happening around them. Scarily, the researchers used eye-tracking equipment and found that drivers can look right at a hazard, but not respond to it, because they are internally distracted by the conversation. 

While hands free might reduce the risk (less potential for driver distraction while making or taking the call, and hands-free drivers may adopt some safer driving strategies while taking the call), they don't eliminate the risk. (I acknowledge that it would be difficult to ban use of hands free sets in a car, because there are so many commerical uses for them as well.)

Secondly, that University of Utah group found that listening to books or podcasts doesn't have the same effect on driving performance. The researchers think it's because they don't demand the same attention as a conversation does, so isn't as distracting for the driver.",1635724822

"nashville","t5_2qimh","NBC will bring its nightly news broadcast to Nashville on Thursday, as anchor Lester Holt travels Across America in his recurring series.

Nashville is one of five cities hell visit throughout the week, along with Austin, Texas, St. Louis, Missouri, Washington, D.C., and Phoenix, Arizona. 

You might be curious about what local stories theyll highlight during their trip, but this is Music City, so first things first: is Holt bringing his bass guitar?

Im really glad you asked, he says with a laugh, calling The Tennessean from New York.

In case you didnt know, the award-winning broadcaster has played bass since he was 15 years old, from his schools jazz choir all the way up to his cover band The Rough Cuts, comprised of fellow NBC News employees. And yes, hell pack a travel bass for the trip.

It's just a little smaller, so I'm going to travel with it, if nothing else, just to plunk around with it in the hotel. And if the opportunity arises (in Nashville) to play elsewhere, I'm in.

Those opportunities keep popping up for Holt, whos served as anchor for NBC Nightly News since 2015.  

You may have seen him sitting in with Kelly Clarksons TV house band, or with The Roots on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During a 2011 trip to Nashville, he ended up onstage at the Grand Ole Opry, backing Luke Bryan on Country Girl (Shake It For Me).

That was a thrill to play with Luke, Holt says. I have great memories of that day.

Holt and NBC plan to put the Opry in the spotlight during Thursdays broadcast  specifically, Saturdays historic 5,000th performance of the legendary radio show. Theyre also sitting down with Brad Paisley and Kimberly Williams-Paisley to talk about The Store, a nonprofit enabling food-insecure Tennesseans to shop for groceries.

Holt will lead a piece about how Nashville is managing the fallout that kids and schools have been facing from the pandemic... that's a story we're going to tell through eyes of Nashville, but of course, the whole country has struggled with this particular issue during the pandemic.

This is the sixth installment of Holts Across America series, which began in 2017.

It's very invigorating for me, he says. Because I always want to make sure that this broadcast reflects that diversity around the country. And, you know, if you strap yourself to a desk in New York every day, every month, you risk perhaps losing some of that perspective.

Still, it sounds like it was more than a sense of duty that has drawn Holt and his colleagues back to Music City.

Our whole team are big Nashville fans, he says. Nobody comes back with a bad Nashville story.

""NBC Nightly News"" airs from Nashville at 5:30 p.m. CT Thursday, November 4 on NBC.

I can see this starting off as a heroic rock track, something akin to 'You Say Run'. Yet as the fight starts, there is a synth beat that begins to form similar to the Dangan Ronpa opening. I can see this being a vocal track where the lyrics could be how each character has so much riding on them that they can't fail, how they have been through so much and had so many friends suffer and rely on them so they can't die here. As the fight nears its end the style begins to shift between whoever is winning, with Izuku being represented by the more heroic rock style and Izuru being represented by the colder synth. When the last blow is dealt, it could either be something more triumphant for Izuku or a send-off similar to the 'execution' theme of the danganronpa series if Izuru carries the victory.",1635724823

"dayz","t5_2ty3s","It's your choice, of course. Hunting freshies on the coast when fully geared is generally considered a dick move, and a rather shallow and pointless one at that.  

&amp;nbsp;

There are far more interesting options to choose from:

- Hunting down heavily-geared freshie killers. At the very least, you're going after an opponent who will pose an actual challenge. Any geared fool can kill freshies like they are targets at a carnival shooting gallery, but taking out one or more murderous bullies on the coast is both a fair fight and far more rewarding.

- ""Reverse Hold-Ups"" - capture and restrain a freshie, and put a sack on their head. If they seem like a reasonably decent person and aren't being a jerk, while they are restrained and blinded by the sack, put some of your gear in their inventory. Then say goodbye and run off. When they free themselves and take off the hood, they'll be in for an unexpected surprise. 

- Just trying to befriend freshies is a risky thing. You may have the guns now and they may act friendly at first, but many may fall to the temptation of waiting for the right moment to make your gear their gear. Figuring out if they are cool or just acting cool takes some work. Test them in various little ways as you travel, and be on the lookout for suspicious/odd behavior. If you are pretty sure they are going to betray you, if possible, avoid just killing them suddenly and make what comes next interesting. For example: Tie/cuff them at the right moment, then confront them with your suspicions. See how they respond. Maybe you decide to let them live and part ways right there. They give you some sass? Take their shoes with you. They get mad? Take them out into the middle of town, put a bag on their heads, and fire a bunch of shots in the air to attract every zed around. Then leave him there to deal with the zeds, blind and restrained. Sure, you could have just put a bullet in their head, but that's rather boring. Make it interesting, and both of you have something cool to remember, rather than just another kill/death that's easily forgotten.     

- If you're lucky, sometimes you can collect a bunch of random freshies to run as a group. Go to a big town and see if you can get a car fixed up reasonably quickly and roam the land. 

&amp;nbsp;

Maybe you get killed trying this stuff or maybe it turns into something epic. Either way it goes, it's way more fun than just shooting random freshies on the coast for target practice.",1635724823

So they are living it up, laying 1/10th the taxes (percentage wise), that most Americans pay.

And when you can defer taxes on essentially salary, you have a massive tax advantage that others do not get.

Even in death though, that cost basis and the ‚Äúnon realized capital gains‚Äù isn‚Äôt charged the people who inherit it.  Instead, they are only charged when the stocks are sold by their children.  So theoretically, the kids could just simply ‚Äúborrow, and die‚Äù.

So you‚Äôre cool with taxes being paid many decades later, if ever?  Generational wealth as far as the eye can see?

Those teens and students just went in a mass to the metro and helped the people to not pay the fee. After a few days government got mad and shot cans of tear gas and some small lead bullets (not really bullets I think, just really small balls) at the said teens (no casualties, still a troubling amount of injured). People got mad at this and began a circle of the government suppressing protests and people protesting, they went in crisis alert and you couldn't get out of your home after 8pm or you'll get arrested, military in the streets and so on.

Pick a hero and stick with it and you'll likely be able to adapt it to all but the most harsh metas.

It feels lame to have that dumped so we can make sure everyone knows it‚Äôs ok to like raiden now cuz she‚Äôs a good girl deep down and she‚Äôs sowwy now. 

I like raiden as a character actually. The implied fear of the gods she has when she talked in her story cinematic was so good. I totally believe deep down she thinks stopping progress will ultimately protect her people. But the other people don‚Äôt know that at all. All they see is an oppressive leader who locked them down, snatched ordinary citizens to take their visions, and executions against anyone who wanted to object. People don‚Äôt just drop that.",1635724826

It‚Äôs easy to get a bit parrot obsessed once you have one, and that makes me feel extra protective of other birds. Every bird should have the best.

Im certainly not a Jewish State defender, I think their treatment of Palestinian's is abhorrent and they need to do significantly better. Given that, we should all be able to agree, that Nazi's are disgusting. There is no space for people intentionally waving nazi flags infront of synagogues. For this to happen in Australia is just simply offensive.

And for people to show support for such actions is just more offensive. Nazi's need to be shut down instantly at any point. Its not appropriate, in any way what so ever. I cant believe that it needs to be said, but the attempted extermination of a human race is NOT a good thing, and those who call for it, do not deserve to be part of society.

Haven't watched Arcane yet so no opinion. But, I already know Arcane will be shit cause it's Rito. Never produced anything original, everything is an imitation. They constantly change the lore cause it's shit.   


I agree. Rating has nothing to do with quality. However, it is fact that a show that is 14+ is gated in the themes, animations and scenes it can play. You can't deny this. To argue against this is to argue against the viewership rating in place which is standardised throughout a whole industry. It's a shame that a fantasy video game series will be limited.

  
DB is great. You're in the wrong subreddit if you're attempting to convince anyone otherwise. If you want to post about Arcane then go to the League subreddit.

- both live in very harsh and hot climates (The Nether and Tatooine)

- both are barbaric and stupid yet quite sophisticated in their lifestyle

- both tend to hunt in groups of similar sizes

- both live a nomadic styles though can be seen in a settlement structure (Bastions and Villages

- both use a long range weapon (The Crossbow and the rifle) and a melee weapon (golden sword and The staff/ stick thing) and utilize both to their advantages

- both are very quick yet ruthless when in combat, but can be quite clumsy 

- both use bartering  as their primary method of transaction

- both utilize a native animal for personal use (Hoglins for food and Banthas for transport)

- both have VERY memable victory dances

At the end of the day I do no believe there is such thing as good affordable healthcare anymore than there is such thing as good affordable lawyers. You get what you pay for.

Look at it another way, how many people want to be a doctor with all it entails unless it pays REALLY well? In most public healthcare system it doesn't pay enough for the expertise and work and what you have to endure required. Hell, in the country I left half the public doctors were imported from the Caribbean and Latin America not because we didn't train enough doctors but because the more competent half went to go work in the US or private practices across Europe.

Hell, we are privatizing garbage collection services because the government cannot even effectively run a public trash collection service. Honestly government bureaucracy is the most inefficient thing almost anywhere and to hand it something as big as healthcare sounds like just burning billions. Anything you leave to government government fucks up because smart people don't go work for the government and the government doesn't operate in the real world of cost efficiency.",1635724828

"thetagang","t5_27n9fl","The biggest problem I see is getting a buy-write order filled with a decent amount of extrinsic value. 

The other side of the trade is almost certainly going to be a market maker, who probably won‚Äôt fill your order with extrinsic value much (or at all) above the next dividend. 

If T‚Äôs next dividend is say 52 cents, you could *try* to place a buy-write limit order for 14.45 for example. If you get filled at that price, that‚Äôs great and you‚Äôre looking at a decent return. 

In all likelihood, you probably won‚Äôt get filled until the extrinsic value is lower than the dividend, and ROI could be similar or even smaller than receiving the dividend with buying the shares

If you do choose to place the order still, you will likely be early assigned before the next ex-div date, and your ROI will be based whatever extrinsic value was there. 

Note that there may or may not even be a point in choosing a date so far out as in all likelihood you will get assigned early and so who ever is on the other side of the trade may not be willing to pay much more just because the date is longer out.",1635724829

Yes, you can do all this voluntarily but it can be a lot to keep track of and it feels like less of an achievement when all the restrictions are completely self-imposed rather than actually requiring unlocking.

Look at 1 Corinthians 6:9

&gt;9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor [a]homosexuals, 10 nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor those habitually drunk, nor verbal abusers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.


The NASB translates the Greek arsenokoites as ""homosexual.""  That is a blatantly biased, false translation.  Homosexual refers to both male and female persons who are biologically predisposed to be attracted to members of their same sex.

And yet Arsenokoite can't mean that at all, in anyway shape or form.  Arseno means male. Koite means bed or the plural beds.  There is absolutely no possible way to turn Arsenokoite into homosexual.  It's impossible for that word to refer to females, whereas the English homosexual does.  We also know Arsenokoites is not referring to sexual orientation, which wasn't even a concept until the 20th Century, whereas the English translation uses the sexual orientation concept.  And no use of that word at any other point in history has referred to homosexuality.

Not to mention, the word following Arsenokoites in that verse isn't even translated into English, it's left out.

That is a blatant example of corrupt Biblical translation by conservatives with a social agenda.  And we know even more so because the first revisions of the NASB took place in the 60s and 70s, when the sexual liberation movement was taking place, and conservative denominations were trying to oppose that anyway they could.  

That proves to me, at least on the concept of homosexuality, the NASB is completely corrupted and biased, and not at all based on the original text.",1635724831

woah ! calm tf down .

The problem with too triggered people is that they are  dumb and can't comprehend well. you act like a dumb fuck here. So, I don't think you are worth shit.

Anyways , Gyan is Roma player &amp; will be here for the entirety of jose's tenure, without Roma having to spend a penny . Borja is on loan for whome Roma will have to pay 20 mil this summer. 

Borja is just another up and coming youngster who did half-decent for Roma last year , but guess what Tammy is way better. So ,the time jose provides to Mayoral is better spent on Gyan, who seems equally promising.




&gt;He is a player at your disposal you need to use to win games period.

Sure, Mayoral totally won Roma the league and CL last year so Jose must also follow the footsteps of Fonseca like last season and use all his systems and players . fuck off .",1635724831

And when I finally asked him the last time, he got annoyed at me and said I was really nagging him. I tried to explain calmly that I had asked several times, and that I didn't want to nag him, because I knew it would turn into a fight. I explained that it was very frustrating when I ask him to do something and he forgets and it never happens. He said he would do it eventually, I told him that when he says that it never gets done, then he completely shut down.

I don't want to be a nag. I don't want to ask four times for something that HAS to get done, and would only take him 30 seconds to do. I just simply don't understand why he can't just do it when I mention it. If it were a large, complicated task, I'd get that it would take time to do, but this is super simple. I don't want to ask you over and over (being very careful to phrase it neutrally and calmly every single time). I totally get that it's frustrating to be nagged. I don't want you to be frustrated, and I don't want to be frustrated either. But I have no idea what to do. Our communication is so broken.

Edited to add: Previous to all this, we had decided to get take-out tonight. About a half hour after the above argument, I asked him what time we should order food. He replied with, ""We're still ordering food? I thought after all that, the evening was over."" WHAT? We had a miscommunication, so that means we can't order food?

It just tastes bad, it's not inedible.

When in doubt, I just overcook, that way it should definitely be safe to consume even if the taste and texture get ruined. If your sense of taste is really sensitive, use it in another dish to mask its awful flavor/texture.

It feels very different from the rest of Edgar Wright's filmography but also familiar at the same time. All of his trademarks are here on display, but with a new coat of psychological thriller/horror paint. It's a pretty good movie that I mostly enjoyed, but thought it was kinda messy with the final act and the ending entirely. Still, some amazing performances from Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor Joy and it looks fucking incredible. Incredible color palette. 

On a technical aspect, it's a fucking great film. Some CG is ehhhh (some people have pointed out some bad CG I didn't notice ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø) but the real issues lie within the story, pacing and supporting cast. Will definitely rewatch eventually. Probably for the DVD release.",1635724838

"PlantBasedDiet","t5_2ud49","The standard of the WFPB diet is no added oils. And the results of the Ornish, Esselstyn and a few other trials in atherosclerosis really are among the best ever seen.

Personally, my take is that anyone with a diagnosis of heart disease should make a strong effort with the oil-free WFPB diet to see if they can tolerate it, and anyone concerned about heart disease risk should seek to reduce added oils as much as possible, to delay their  heart disease diagnosis until after something else kills them.

But I'm not 100% WFPB. I have some canola in a spray bottle for general saute, and use some extra virgin olive oil in Mediterranean dishes, sesame oil in East Asian dishes, and mustard oil in Indian dishes. Never deep frying, never more than a tsp or so (per serving), mostly as a flavor vehicle. On the scale of oil health effects, these oils are relatively benign, and they help keep me on the path of a 95% WFPB diet. I've tried oil free, and it can make one's food choices really unpalatable to others (though *not* as much as salt free). And a diet that can't be shared, that isn't palatable to self, isn't a diet that will be maintained.

&gt; La diputada Morena In√©s Parra acus√≥ que fue ‚Äúbloqueada‚Äù por su partido para no ser parte de la oradoras durante la entrega del Informe de Cuenta P√∫blica 2020 en manos del auditor David Colmenares.   

&gt; La diputada de Morena In√©s Parra, quien este mi√©rcoles¬†envi√≥ una solicitud al presidente de la Comisi√≥n, el priista Pablo Angulo, para citar a comparecer al auditor¬†debido al gasto millonario para remodelar sus oficinas, asegur√≥ que fue ‚Äúbloqueada‚Äù por su partido para no ser parte de la oradoras durante la entrega del Informe de Cuenta P√∫blica 2020 en manos del auditor David Colmenares.   

&gt; Sin embargo, aunque fue abordado por la prensa al terminar el evento de entrega, el auditor federal David Colmenares evadi√≥ explicar sobre las remodelaciones a sus dos oficinas en edificios de la Auditor√≠a Superior de la Federaci√≥n que implic√≥ un gasto de 5.5 millones de pesos de recursos p√∫blicos, y que tuvieron acabados de lujo y ocupa para ‚Äòdormir‚Äô.   

&gt; Animal Pol√≠tico¬†public√≥ el 18 de octubre, que el auditor David Colmenares¬†gast√≥ 2.6 millones de pesos para remodelar su oficina en el piso 12 del edificio de la Auditor√≠a¬†en el Ajusco, que ten√≠a apenas dos a√±os de construido.

&gt; Las obras ocurrieron en 160 metros cuadrados y tuvo acabados de lujo como zoclo de m√°rmol, recubrimientos de encino, regadera, cl√≥set y vestidor y hasta una puerta de vidrio templado con un sistema sofisticado de seguridad   Adem√°s,¬†tambi√©n gast√≥ 2.9 millones de pesos¬†para remodelar su oficina alterna en el edificio de la calle Morelos, a una cuadra de Reforma, inmueble que est√° en desuso desde 2017 para los empleados, pues hab√≠an sido reubicados al edificio del Ajusco.

Unfortunately, your post has been removed.

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

She‚Äôs now developing morals and deciding to live life like a mortal, so that she can decide whether or not humanity is worth saving or not, or if it‚Äôs only her companions that are worth protecting. This roleplay allows for any moral disposition, good or bad, since you‚Äôre playing as someone who lived hundreds of years morally dark and are now trying to see the other side. Meaning any quest you want to do and any outcome is viable, and you can place your own deciding factors on whether or not you care more about the reward or the morality.

"CTguns","t5_31jg5","The Kel-Tec Sub-2000 and any copy or duplicate of one is banned by name. Right on the Kel-Tec page [for the CQB](https://www.keltecweapons.com/firearms/rifles/sub2000-cqb/) they state; ""that‚Äôs exactly what this variation of the SUB2000 offers"". Its likely the CQB could be banned by name if it meets (answers yes) all three elements of the SLFU tripartite test (SLFU NUMBER: 14-37 COPIES AND DUPLICATE TEST FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS):

1. **Physical Appearance:** Does the ""action"" of the firearm look like that of a firearm specifically named in C.G.S. ¬ß¬ß53-202a(1)(B), 53-202a(1)(C) or 53-202a(1)(D)?
2. **Functionality:** Does the ""action"" of the firearm work like that of a firearm specifically named in C.G.S. ¬ß¬ß53-202a(1)(B), 53-202a(1)(C) or 53-202a(1)(D)?
3. **Interchangeable Parts:** Are the major components of the ""action"" (i.e., the bolt, the operating rod, the trigger and/or the sear) in its stock configuration interchangeable with that of a firearm specifically named in C.G.S. ¬ß¬ß53-202a(1 )(B), 53-202a(1)(C) or 53-202a(1)(D)?

Then of course there is the stupid single evil feature ban it faces if its transferred as a rifle. If rifle, pistol grip alone bans it. As would the folding/collapsing stock. Its OAL could be an issue depending on how it's measured (collapsed stock for example).",1635724842

Remember that different observers traveling at difference speeds will observe events in a different order, but no matter the reference frame, the speed of light remains constant.

&amp;#x200B;

If a beam of light travels at the same speed and traverses the same distance, regardless of the reference frame, then an observer in the near ""past"" relative to an observer in the near ""future"" are seeing the same beam. If the future observer is the one to collapse the wave-function with their observation, it would be pretty strange if the past observer saw an interference pattern created by that same light.

Cheating is almost synonymous but covers more stuff- for example win trading is often considered cheating, but not technically an exploit. 

You‚Äôre thinking of the term ‚Äúclever use of game mechanics‚Äù, which is when someone uses game mechanics in a way that wasn‚Äôt intended, and it gave them an advantage, but it wasn‚Äôt obviously broken.

At this point people doing things like machine gun staves or using the hatchet trait to hit for 4K are exploiting, because it‚Äôs clearly and obviously not intended to be done and is obviously broken.",1635724843

It is never right to steal or take what is not yours, but her thirst for attention is a calling card for people to help themselves to whatever she has that they want.

They had the privilege of being told what jobs they could have based on their ancestry.

&gt;If you mean political power then so were many other clans. But none of them rebeled because of that.

They were deliberately kept from having any other position of authority regardless of their skill because of the family they were born into. If any other clan in Konoha was treated the same way it isn't mentioned anywhere.

My advice would be to just look at the prompt and see what questions they want you to answer. Then set a word limit for your answers to those questions. Example: 

1. What inspired you to go into public health (possibly tell it like a story) - ~100 words 
2. What are your relevant accomplishments/achievements/experiences - ~100-150 words (optionally, you may address any obvious weaknesses or flaws in your application as well - make it clear you‚Äôre trying to improve on those areas) 
3. Your career goals/research interests - ~100 words 
4. Why is this school the best for YOU and how will studying there help YOU achieve your goals (don‚Äôt just suck up to the school!!) - ~100
 words 
5. wrap everything together in a conclusion - ~50-100 words

Further, what it does to a relationship is going to depend on the values of those in the relationship. If one partner grew in an environment that painted porn and sex to be taboo then of course porn is going to negatively impact the relationship.

"ModernMagic","t5_2xs5t","How critical are the keys? I think it‚Äôd be great to be able to be more defensive and/or more aggressive with the deck. I‚Äôd drop the keys, honestly, and play a set of chalice MD. I also think you could get a set of [[eldrazi temple]] in there and be on a playset of [[thoughtknot seer]] and [[matter reshaper]], which can help get the artifacts you need into play and keep you alive. A different approach would be to play [[karn, scion of urza]] due to all of the artifacts and your ability to make tons of constructs. That‚Äôs one angle that lets you win without the combo. I think karntgc is an absolute no-brainer, even if you want to be all-in on the combo. It‚Äôll help you make it happen for sure. Would playing [[arbor elf]] accelerate the combo as well as help you double-dip on some of those utility land effects? Being in green solely for the stirrings is worth it, but I have to imagine there‚Äôs something else good you can get out of the color. For one, I‚Äôd *absolutely* play three or so [[veil of summer]] in the sideboard. I don‚Äôt get ratchet bomb though? That‚Äôs a card that‚Äôs meant to blow up chalices and especially saga tokens, which is a huge part of your gameplan. Karntgc would also let you run only one in the sb and make just as much use of it, even in game 1. I just personally prefer a deck with a backup plan, and having karntgc to prison your opponents up with bridge and 3ball and chalice gives you so much more survivability. I‚Äôd also move chalices to the maindeck if you don‚Äôt mind losing at least one set of the keys. What about some [[dismember]] maindeck to help you stay alive? There‚Äôs also the route of going tron with the deck, which you don‚Äôt have to pay that much to do.

Finns tend to be terrible at saying the soft  ""th"" sound as in ""the"", ""thing"" and ""three"". These often end up sounding like ""te"", ""ting"" and especially jarringly: ""tree"".

Also intonation is a real hard concept to grasp. Finnish ALWAYS stresses the first syllable of a word. So we would say RA-dio, MIK-roaaltouuni, HE-likopteri. In English the stress is elsewhere, (radi-O, mic-RO-wave, he-LI-copter). And so a lot of the time that is the easiest way to spot a Finn speaking english. It just sounds a little ~off~.

I myself have spent years trying to get the intonation just right and to learn not to do this, it's real tough, and I've been speaking english daily for nearly 10 years. Sometimes I still get tripped up, ""radiology"" was a real hard one for me to internalize.",1635724845

They are dangerous? yes absolutely they are the ones with the most tanks. BUT they have a flaw, they are slow, they do not dodge, they are more fragile to blows.  
Most people use this class to break through enemy ranks, but their use is often limited to that.  
They are slow, to get to break your lineup they take time to arrive. therefore logically:  
1) In the open field they are not a danger, you see them arriving in advance facing them personally, so you protect the troops.  
2) In a closed battlefield they are very dangerous. But in closed field you have to use STRONG units and with shields. If you take a good shielded unit, and use defensive DOCTRINES, you should get by.  
The moul can destroy your units, but it is slow. Either think about units or think about you.  
When he enters the fray you EXIT the fray go around attack him from the shoulders then move away use your agility.

As with most TED Talks and most AI image recognition technology it didn't progress beyond that one tech demo. But maybe one day someone will be able to feed all the footage from the half-dozen livestreams into some tool that can generate a 3D model of the whole construction site at and time in construction process. 

While waiting for AI technology to catch up I'd like to see a timeline of major construction events. I've got a theory that the Wide Bay will be up in a tiny fraction of how long it took to build the High Bay but I have no stats on that.

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","Let me start by saying, I think your overall point has validity and the connections you identify exist and warrant examination. That being said, imo some of your wording is not in line with that of the programs I am familiar with and I think it is worth making the distinction because it is more than just a pedantic difference.

The 12 step programs I am familiar with, go to great lengths to avoid moral judgments and the idea that people have sinned and need to repent. A lot of effort is made to provide guidance in a judgment free way. In the same manner a mental health professional will. (Obviously these programs are not monoliths, with a ton of different people/personalities/opinions/values, so this will not always be the case). 

Being from New England, I'm super familiar with preachy moralization. Be it of the Fire and Brimstone, Cotton Mather  variety or the Irish Catholic guilt kind. Like I said above, 12 step programs make a point of avoiding this.

That is why they are so invested in ""the disease model."" Framing these issues as a medical/mental health issue. Allows for the problems to be addressed while distancing any treatment from moral judgment.

In the end, it still leaves them in a place where something is wrong that God needs to fix. Which is why I think your points are valid. However the problem is a disease and not that we are inherently evil, stained by orginal sin because eve ate the fruit. I think that distinction is worth pointing out.

I do feel that a lot of 12 step proponents make it seem like it is the only way. I don't think this is true and can in fact be harmful. Like you said there are other philosophies (scientific and others), that are just as valid. Their existence doesn't negate the value of faith based ones though, just as the existence of faith based philosophies doesn't negate them. In the end it comes down to the individual. There is no silver bullet and what works for some, won't work for others.",1635724848

I would recommend a couple of very minor things in the future when you're doing a cleaning or upgrade. The run from the top radiator to the cpu? Add just a bit more tubing on both those runs if you keep the 90\* fitting. On the run from the pump to the GPU I would recommend giving a slight bend to that horizontal tube so it runs parallel to the case lines. You can see how I did it in my run [here](https://preview.redd.it/19k8ymy2l9171.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3ff6f750a6929a2041dbc40b67b33986b642e9f), a little offset bend like that can do a lot to make things look much cleaner

How do refills work?
Published 08/17/2021 02:09 PM | Updated 09/10/2021 12:14 PM
At participating stores, you can use your registered Starbucks Card or Starbucks¬Æ app to purchase a beverage and then present that same Starbucks Card or Starbucks account in the app to get free refills of brewed coffee (hot, Iced Coffee or Cold Brew), and tea (hot or iced, not including lemonade) during the same store visit regardless of the original beverage. Customers without a registered account may purchase a refill at a reduced price. 

 

Once you leave the store, your visit has ended, and any subsequent coffee or tea refill thereafter would be considered a new purchase. Refills are not available in the Drive Thru.

"conlangs","t5_2red7","I find that monograph obstruent laterals, especially without diacritics, are a fool's errand, but there are some ideas that make vague sense. If it were just /…¨ tÕ°…¨/ you could ""trivially"" just assign them &lt;x q&gt; (scare quotes because while these are clearly the best choices, they look awful), but adding in the voiced pair makes this strategy infeasible. If it were just /…¨ …Æ tÕ°…¨/ you could probably get away with &lt;≈õ ≈∫ ƒá&gt;, but just as there's pain and suffering trying to easily account for a four-way set of post-alveolar sibilants, adding in /dÕ°…Æ/ immediately breaks this strategy. Anything that tries to account for all four sounds at once with monographs will be highly experimental and probably be aesthetically undesirable. In any case, the most viable one I can think of, assuming you have /l/ and spell it as &lt;l&gt;, is &lt;x ≈Ç q j&gt;. The problem here is &lt;j&gt;, but if there's no other voiced affricates you could spell /j/ as &lt;i&gt; or &lt;y&gt;. Some alternative options are &lt;≈õ ≈∫ ≈° ≈æ&gt; (assumes you don't have post-alveolar sibilants, very dubiously interprets &lt;≈°&gt; as &lt;sÃÄ&gt; /t/ + &lt;≈õ&gt; /…¨/ et cetera), &lt;≈° ≈æ ≈• ƒè&gt; (same assumption plus the relatively obscure T and D with caron), and &lt;≈õ ≈∫ ƒá »∑ÃÅ&gt; (requires a completely novel keyboard layout with &lt;»∑ÃÅ&gt;, which is not used in any natlang scripts).

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

That‚Äôs TOTALLY normal but you shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty. You need that time so you can be your best for your baby. Your baby needs a happy mom more than they need you stressed and unhappy.

"hamsters","t5_2sjcj","Congratulations on your new hamster.

For any new owners, please read the following, regarding cage size:

Hamsters need to have plenty of space to run around; and that doesn‚Äôt mean a lot of pipes, it means actual floor space.

A hamster should ideally have **a minimum of 80 cm wide by 50 cm deep by 35 cm high (2.5 ft. wide by 1.5ft. deep by 1 ft. high).**

You should always make sure that the floor of the cage has a covering of at least 6 inches (15cm) depth of suitable bedding as hamsters love to burrow.

Please be aware that most cages sold in standard pet shops do not meet this minimum requirement. These are known as novelty cages and should never be used as the hamsters main enclosure.

Regarding wheel size:

A hamster should be able to run in a wheel in which their back is not arched or bent. Their wheel should accommodate them as if they were running on flat ground. If you notice your hamster is bent or arched whilst in their wheel, please obtain a larger sized one as soon as possible to avoid spinal damage. If you do not have the height available for a large wheel, please consider a [flying saucer hamster wheel](https://www.google.com/search?q=flying+saucer+hamster+wheel&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBGB713GB713&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz5LCBiJPiAhUWRBUIHcOOAu8Q_AUIDygC&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=937) as an alternative.

*****

&gt; Dos personas detenidas por polic√≠as municipales de Ecatepec, Estado de M√©xico, por cometer faltas administrativas, contaban con √≥rdenes de aprehensi√≥n vigentes, uno de ellos por lesiones en el estado de Veracruz y el otro por robo calificado a tienda de conveniencia en la Ciudad de M√©xico.   

&gt; Polic√≠as municipales detuvieron a Alejandro ‚ÄúN‚Äù, de 32 a√±os de edad, por inhalar sustancias t√≥xicas en la colonia Villas de Ecatepec, por lo que fue presentado ante la Oficial√≠a Calificadora de Las Am√©ricas.   

&gt; Al consultar la Plataforma M√©xico, la Direcci√≥n de Seguridad P√∫blica de Ecatepec descubri√≥ que el detenido tiene orden de aprehensi√≥n emitida en mayo del 2021 por lesiones dolosas calificadas, en el estado de Veracruz.   

&gt; Jorge Miguel ‚ÄúN‚Äù, de 34 a√±os de edad, fue detenido por ingerir bebidas alcoh√≥licas en la v√≠a p√∫blica de la colonia Ejidos de San Crist√≥bal, quien tiene orden de aprehensi√≥n vigente por robo calificado a cadena comercial Oxxo, en la Ciudad de M√©xico.   

&gt; Con estas dos detenciones suman 30 las personas detenidas durante la actual administraci√≥n municipal por cometer faltas administrativas, pero que eran buscadas en distintas entidades del pa√≠s por su probable participaci√≥n en la comisi√≥n de delitos como robo, violaci√≥n, lesiones, delitos contra la salud y hasta delincuencia organizada.

Having unrestricted access to a vehicle you didn‚Äôt pay for, at 17 years old, is an incredible privilege. The only thing I will say you could have done better is fully prepared your daughter when you first got the vehicle that she will have to share with her brother once he‚Äôs old enough to drive. 

Your sons college classes *do* take priority over her daily hang outs with friends. 

If your daughter had a job and your son wanted to hang out everyday with his friends no one here would be calling you TA for putting your daughter‚Äôs job ahead of your son‚Äôs buddy time. 

Why doesn‚Äôt she just hang out with her friends after his classes are over? What if you split the schedule that way? He gets the car in the afternoon and she gets it in the evening. 

I think that‚Äôs a reasonable compromise. Some of these responses are bonkers. You‚Äôre daughter isn‚Äôt harmed in any capacity by not being able to use the car whenever she wants. She will not ‚Äúdesocialize‚Äù if she can‚Äôt drive her friends around town all the time. It‚Äôs completely ridiculous to suggest otherwise. 

You‚Äôre doing the right thing. Your daughter doesn‚Äôt want to compromise at all and she needs to learn to share or she can get a job and save up for her own car.",1635724853

"UnearthedArcana","t5_384bx","Hey! I think this is a fun class and I have some feedback if you want some. I hate to say it but I think some people might, this is close to the concept of the Blood Hunter class that Critical Role has created. But I don't think that matters really. Just wanted to say it so it is out of the way.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Blood Blast:** I don't mind that you can take it at level 1. It adds a little flavor and I like that it makes you prioritize constitution that is interesting to me.
* **Blood Blast:** I think these skills work and make sense but with *Blood Shot* I would make the that you add your constitution to the attack role. I can't see why you would add your DEX but CON could be fun. The wording for *Wrack* is a little awkward but I am not sure how to fix it. Maybe take a look at it and see if you can make sound a little less clunky.
* **Burn:** I really like this idea but I am not sure why it is called ""burn"". I think a different name for the points could add more to the flavor but that is purely aesthetic. I am a little confused about how you get rid of burn points once you are out of battle. Do they go away after a long rest? I love the concept of the AC boost when burn points are full. I think it would have to be play tested for sure but I like it.
* **Blood Splash:** This is totally unnecessary but I think it would be cool to specify that the grease you create with the spell is blood. Just a thought.
* **Blood Throw:** I like it. I am bummed that you can't throw them in the air but I know that would be OP it just breaks a little bit of logic for you to only throw them horizontally. Anyway my question is if a enemy is hit by another do they both go prone after or just one of them? 
* **Overcharge:** Great and simple.
*  **Twin Blast:** I think this is great but it is hard to fit the theme. Maybe add some fluff in the text to kind of justify why you can now effect two people.

Anyway those are my thoughts. Hope they help! This is an awesome start. Keep going!",1635724856

The primary colors. I then put this shirt in a tupperware dish big enough so it can sit even. I then put ice cubes on top of the shirt, so it is ice over dye. I wait for all the ice to melt, generally next morning. Then i heat up a mixture of water and soda ash on the stove to 120¬∞F. 1 teaspoon soda ash to one cup water. I use two cups of this solution per shirt. After the solution is 120¬∞F, i pour it evenly over the shirt. I let that sit for 1.5-2 hours. Then i rinse out in my sink starting with cold, to warm, back to cold. And then i wash it in the washing machine with synthrapol(detergent that takes out remaining dye in the shirt so it doesn‚Äôt bleed in to other shirts in future), then regular dryer.",1635724858

If youre paying for AC then I cant even imagine how expensive that must be. You have to sit them down and have a conversation about the temp, but come prepared with a few articles about what's commonly considered room temp (ik theres a few out there, I had to do this with my roomate). If youre paying for AC then straight up ask if they'll be paying  more since they're the one who insists on lowering the temp to absurdly cold levels. If all else fails you can always get someone to tap the electrical likes and install a master temp controller (rendering the one they use as nothing more than a dummy switch) my friends parents did this when they were in college and had psycho roomates who lowered the AC and left the windows open",1635724859

Yo vengo de una familia donde mi mam√° alguna vez tenia solo 20 pesos y quer√≠a apostarlo en la carreras de caballos para ver qu√© √≠bamos a comer esa semana. Se los dio a un t√≠o y el mejor le dio 100 pesos y con eso pasamos la semana, supongo. Despu√©s de eso, yo decid√≠ que hab√≠a que mejorar y me dediqu√© a estudiar para hoy tener un buen trabajo, con buen salario y prestaciones.

Pero‚Ä¶ yo no se si esa ‚Äúmala racha‚Äù se compara con gente que nunca tiene para esas necesidades b√°sicas. Nosotros ten√≠amos casa propia, llegue a tener un Nintendo (aunque fuera el √∫ltimo de mis amigos en tenerlo) y cosas as√≠ que claramente no son necesidades b√°sicas.

Nos empez√≥ a ir mejor eventualmente, mi mam√° consigui√≥ un trabajo mejor y a√±os despu√©s incluso una plaza administrativa en una escuela. Y pues de ah√≠ se pago mi carrera y la de mi hermana. A mi pap√° le iba bien a veces, mal otras tantas. Pero era mujeriego y pues obvio ten√≠a m√°s hijos y pues no le daba cuando le iba bien.

Como dije, se que no vengo de una familia acomodada ni mucho menos, tuvimos mucho apoyo de la familia cercana y dem√°s. Pero tambi√©n se qu√© hay muchos casos mucho peores que el nuestro. Nunca nos hizo falta comida aunque fuera con apoyo de alguien m√°s. Nunca tuve que trabajar por obligaci√≥n, normalmente lo hac√≠a en el negocio de alg√∫n familiar pero pues era dinero para mi. No tuve que estudiar y trabajar, como algunos compa√±eros de la universidad hac√≠an.

Sorry, that is BS. Zuck wants Meta to be in on the ground floor and to have an early hand in the creation of the technologies needed to build some form of metaverse so they can maximize profit. He does not want a monopoly, and he specifically states that a metaverse cannot exists without interoperability between experiences created and controlled by many companies. That is right in the keynote.

&gt; Teleporting around the metaverse is going to be like clicking a link on the internet. It‚Äôs an open standard. **In order to unlock the potential of the metaverse, there needs to be interoperability.** And that goes beyond just taking your avatar and digital items across different apps and experiences, which we are already building an API to support.

Interoperability is anathema to a monopoly. Sure, they want as much control as they can get, but they are well aware that no matter how many products they build like *Horizon Worlds,* it will not be a metaverse unit many companies are building content for it.",1635724861

"uqm2","t5_4px89h","* Every time you read a novel, you are adapting it to a different medium: the mushy pink stuff in your head. Everybody has their own mushy pink version of Dune in their head, and these will be different based not only on how closely the reader followed the text, but also what they brought to it. A lot of people have said Dune is unfilmable. A lot of people have said it's unreadable. In this sense, there may never have been a good adaptation of Dune. I expect a lot of people would hate my mushy pink version of Dune. My version of Foundation is going to be particularly different from yours because I have not read Foundation. My interpretation of how the fight in the topic title plays out is fun, but probably not book or screen-accurate. Still, mules are no joke: https://youtu.be/3lFG1ps3wak My pick for the winner is a secret.
* Reading the different views around the web about how closely or not the films adapted Dune is wild, because some of the takes on what the book is about are not only divergent from my own, but opposite (and also opposite from Herbert and just what's there in the text in many cases). Seeing people grumble about who is supposed to be what ethnicity or whatever - it's confusing but interesting the way people project their own ideas onto areas that were left either blank, or were implied but made deliberately complicated by other suggestions elsewhere in the book. The humans in Dune are debateably not even human in the way we understand that idea, so people that freak out that they're the wrong kind of human are very funny to me. Not funny 'ha ha', more funny 'boo hoo'.
* People can read a single line of text in totally different ways (see: topic questions on this subreddit!), so I try to make it a point to not get too worked up about differing views on something kind of complicated like Dune, unless it's really egregious. People will miss even the obvious themes in the book and on the screen, and there's nothing you can do about that. To be interpreted is to be misinterpreted, I guess. It's still hilarious to see total freaks online breathlessly and without irony talking up obviously cartoonishly evil villains like the Harkonnens as layered, misunderstood, or even heroic. At the other end you have people saying Dune is pro-colonialism and imperialism. Not all interpretations are equally valid lol.
* I was unimpressed with the Sardaukar uniforms in the Lynch version, and thought they looked more like something the Harkonnen would wear - I thought the new ones are much cooler! Then I remembered that's exactly what they're supposed to be - the Sardaukar are in disguise. Sometimes the problem is just that it's hard to fit all that book in your head and keep track of it all at once. Sometimes the problem is that I'm a dumdum.
* A cool movie might make more people appreciate Dune - it's not going to make less people appreciate Dune unless it makes the book redundant. But how could it do that? That said, movies are pretty different mediums to brains, but maybe more compatible with them than novels are. Also: there are some pretty corny aspects to Dune that it's ok to want to fix in an adaptation. People gush over the sophisticated worldbuilding and the unusual approach to a vision of the future - Herbert deliberately went in the precise opposite direction of what people expected of a sci-fi book (deliberately in the precise opposite direction of Foundation!) and it was richer for it. But ZenSunni? Buddhallah? Those terms are pretty cheesy, come on - and there are other aspects like that. 
* Some critics accuse Dune of Orientalism because it presents a different world from the standard white-guy-in-space sci-fi. Some critics have issues that because the future in Dune is so different from how people might expect, that the places where it's the same are all the more disappointing. I think these critics actually have points, but equally I'm not sure it's possible to address them - I think most ideas people come up with are going to be inherently imperfect in some way because that's what people are. Maybe you just have to choose the flawed approach that's right for you.

How this impacts on UQM2:

* People think of games as being a medium, but different game genres like strategy games, platformers, fighting games, shmups, adventure games etc. are about as different from each other as films, books, music, tv, painting, comics, interpretive dance etc. are from each other. It's more like interactive art and non-interactive art run parallel (ok, all art is interactive (see: first bullet point in the post), but I'm trying not to get too bogged down in detail here - he says in brackets that have other brackets inside them).
* People have wildly different ideas of what UQM is about, and what genre it is. This is going to make it seriously weird when it comes to setting expectations for how the sequel is going to play and I do not envy the devs one tiny little bit. The idea of what UQM is all about seems to be pretty different from person to person, and everybody seems to see themselves as the sole arbiter of that, or Speaker For the Devs. I have definitely been guilty of that from time to time (ok, actually a lot). Stay tuned: I do it in this post too!
* It's been 30 years since the last real game in the series, which was a multi-genre game that was a sequel to another multi-genre game built around a different genre (strategy). Some people have been quite adamant that the developers should do whatever they want and not listen to the fans, and have been equally adamant that what the developers really want is not what they say they want, but is in fact what one particular fan (them) wants. This is a call-out post, I guess, but I'm calling myself out too!
* There has been a lot of talk about Star Control 3 in this topic, which is weird but also somehow inevitable. The SC3 devs were making the second sequel to a series of indeterminate, shifting genre, and they were not the original creators. I read here someone giving them hell about adding in 4x elements ... but that's what SC1 had! Is it the 4x elements or that they just weren't that great? The SC3 devs listened to fan feedback, dropped the bits that players seemed less-enthused about, and hedged their bets by sprinkling a lil SC1 in. People liked it ok at the time, but it's a bit of a pariah now. I still haven't played it properly. Anyway, even though the OG creators are back, there still seems to be that same confusion over what it is people want from the sequel. This has only been exacerbated when the creators asked what fans wanted from them.
* What the die-hard fans want, or say they want, might not necessarily be what's best for the game, or even the fans. Thinking about the questions that came up early on about who the game is for, I genuinely think there are transcendent elements to design - some parts of a game are designed for the game itself, and not just about what X person wants or what Y person wants. Design is about solving problems. Coming up with ideas is about solving problems. If some die-hard fans don't want to accept that the 30yo game they like has problems to solve - that's a problem, because it means that cool new ideas and novel approaches are unwelcome. It's especially a problem when the reason the fans were drawn to the game in the first place were its cool new ideas and novel approaches to problems. 
* Making a sequel to a 30 year-old game for the fans that stuck around all this time has to be a hazardous occupation. Many of the fans are going to be attached to things that only were in the game due to limitations of the time, external restraints on the development process, and the whims of the devs at the time that they may not have now. Some of the things the fans love were probably mandated by the publisher, and only done under duress in the first place! Some of the things the fans love about UQM are things they would hate in a modern game - and would hate in the UQM sequel too if it it returned, even if they demand or suggest it here. Some of the things fans say they hate about modern games in general and don't want to see in UQM2 ... were present in UQM. Memories are funny things, even when they're fresh.
* I think the devs will know what these issues are better than anyone, that they have had a long time to come up with new ideas and solutions, and I guess I just want to reiterate that they should suit themselves and not be too afraid about slavishly following the design blueprint of UQM, or the demands of fans who see themselves as the sole living correct interpreters of what that is (including me).

"cityofmist","t5_3i33i","One thing I regretted in my group was that I didn't consider the player's tags and background carefully enough.

Some have way too broad tags that apply to nearly every move like ‚ÄúReporter‚Äù (always applies to investigate), others are way too specific and so can never be used, like ‚ÄúBest fruits in town‚Äù, and some others just can't come up in a move, like ‚ÄúSarcastic remarks‚Äù.

Second, make sure that they really do have a specific Mythos they're basing their characters on. I have a character in my group that's just a generic guy that happens to see the future sometimes. This is ok for a superhero movie, but City of Mist is about Mythoi wanting to use the characters to fulfill their ultimate destiny, which is not necessarily correlated with the powers they gain (for example, Batman wants to defeat all crime in Gotham City, but he gains capabilities like gadgets and athleticism etc).

The example characters are bad at the latter, because the creators of the system can't use people from stories written in the roughly last hundred years for legal reason. There are some rare ones based on Grimms' Fairy Tales, but that's about it. Your table has no such limitation.

Also, let the players create an origin story for their characters. People in the City aren't born with their Mythos, something traumatic happened to them that awoke it, and the situation is correlated to that specific Mythos (maybe a character's parents were killed in front of his eyes, which awoke the Batman Mythos in him).

"Bible","t5_2qqbz","I believe that birth is the single most frequently used metaphor for the end of the Age, in both Old and New Testaments. I haven't verified that by doing an actual verse-count, but I'm pretty confident it's true.

&gt; Wail, for the day of the Lord is near;  
&gt; It will come like destruction from the Almighty.  
&gt; Because of this, all hands will go limp,  
&gt; Every heart will melt with fear.  
&gt; Terror will seize them,  
&gt; Pain and anguish will grip them;  
&gt; They will writhe like a woman in labor.  
&gt; They will look aghast at each other,  
&gt; Their faces aflame.  
&gt; (Isaiah 13:6-8)  

[Many other passages](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=woman+labor&amp;resultspp=500&amp;version=NIV) use this same kind of imagery of a woman suddenly caught off guard by labor pains. When you follow the cross-references, there are even more passages than in this simple word-search.

[Revelation 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+12&amp;version=NIV) is arguably the *locus classicus* (primary passage) for this symbolism of the birthing woman. I don't want to melt your brain with too much symbolism but the basic concept is that the woman is the church (Israel) birthing the Messiah (in his first and second comings). Now, the paradox this creates is that we just said that the birth pains (God's judgment) are afflicted on the wicked who are taken by surprise by them. But this is not a paradox, it is a contrastive parallelism -- the suffering of the saints in the name of Jesus, in obedience to God, for the sake of the Kingdom, is *how* the Kingdom itself is birthed. This not to our credit/glory, it is to God's glory because he is the one who orchestrates this. But the point is that our obedient sacrifice (suffering for the sake of the Kingdom) culminates in the *true* Messiah (the second-coming), whereas the rebellion of the wicked culminates in the false-birth (judgment) of the Antichrist and, ultimately, their destruction when they are hurled down into the lake of fire.",1635724862

More, not less.  Consumption stimulates supply whenever there are those that are willing to create that supply.  Krangler make items more valuable to pick-up/farm **BECAUSE** people are feeding them into the krangler.  And since people are bad at evaluating their items, you'll see more variance from these new items, as long as they keep selling to people who're krangling stuff.

The only items for which that doesn't hold true are items which cannot be farmed much easier than they already are, such as headhunters or double-elevated custom rares.  And **THOSE** are not ""mid-tier"".  Also, almost no mod would ever brick such an item completely, only make it less powerful, turning it into a lower high-tier item or a mid-tier item.

There's also buttloads of krangled items that are perfectly usable, by someone **ELSE**, post-krangle, either because they can utterly ignore the downside or because the downside is cheap enough to ignore.",1635724863

We're really excited that you posted, but it had to be removed because it violated Rule 2 - our rules are what keep LBGW one of the top-visited NSFW sites on Reddit, so we need to ensure that our hot post providers always follow them.

Here is a good way to make sure you are following the rules:

Rule 2 means that all posts must contain at least half your face. We must clearly be able to see some of your features! 
I.e. (eyes and nose)/(nose and mouth)/(eyes and mouth). 

This means that we DO NOT allow text-only posts. All posts must contain at least one image which fulfills rule two.

I think we just need to get to the point where big institutional holders start to worry that we could DRS a whole float, and want to either make their holdings safe or prepare to take advantage of potential DRS arbitrage opportunities. If we convince Blackrock, Senvest, State Street, etc that it's worth jumping, then that could give us another 20m shares easily.

&gt; A Dutchman begs the public to take the vaccine after spending months being intubated and shocked at losing 8 toes to COVID. Out of fear of reaction from COVID-19 skeptics and anti-vaxxers, Eric, 62, requested that just his first name be published.

&gt; Eric claims that his muscles are now 40% of what they were before COVID-19, despite being immobile for ten months.

Where there are multiple joint tortfeasors who each contributed to plaintiff's harm, then plaintiff can seek recovery for either tortfeasor under **joint and several liability**. Where two independent acts jointly attribute to injury, plaintiff's can hold the defendants liable where: (1) each independent act by itself could have caused the injury where there they each occur concurrently. 

**Negligence** is where a defendant owes a plaintiff a duty and reasonable standard of care that was breached by the defendant's act or omission that is the proximate or actual source of the plaintiff's injury. Defendants must act to prevent a foreseeable harm against plaintiffs with the zone of danger. Reasonable care is the standard where defendant must reasonably act in a manner similar to another person in the same situation.  

**Res Ispa Loquitor** is where an inference of negligence is presumed where there is harm that would not have ordinary occurred but for the defendant's failure to act reasonably with respect to an instrumentality within the defendant's control.    

There is **strict liability** for engaging in abnormally dangerous activity that poses a significant risk to human safety or life and under a strict liability theory, defendants are held responsible for any degree of negligence. 

**Recovery schemes:** A plaintiff's recovery is reduced according to plaintiff's degree of fault. In some places, plaintiff will not be able to recover if his degree of fault is at least 51% greater than a defendant's degree of fault.",1635724863

I am a 25 yr old f who lives with my mom while I  goes to school and works to save up for a place of  my own. I just got back from being  out of town for 2 days (literally got in 30 mins ago) and my mom got mad that my room wasn't  clean. I'm  confused  by  this because  I straighten up before I  left because I  know she's  a neat freak . Either way I  listen  to her and she says my floor was absolutely disgusting and  wasn't  vacuumed and the following  conversation  goes  as such.
Mom: why  didn't  you vacuum your room before you left?
Me: Well you were  sleeping  and I didn't want to  wake you. (I left for my  trip early in the morning tand my  mom specifically told her not to wake her up)
Mom: Well why didn't you  do it some other time?
Me: I did... 
My mom proceeds to call me a liar which upsets me because  she knows I vacuum  the ENTIRE  house EVERY  SINGLE DAY.  Again she's  a  neat freak.  I try to defend  myself because again  I vacuumed  just not that early morning  and she starts screaming  that I am a liar and asshole. She then says ""she can't  believe  how I am throwing a fit over having  to be told that my room was messy"" Which was out  of the blue. I was upset  that I  was called a liar and calmly  explained  that  she was the one who started  screaming. If my room was not cleaned to her standards  then fine. Just  tell me that but dont ask me a question  and when  I honestly  answer  the question  call me a liar. She continued  to scream  through  and I raised  my voice  as well telling her she's  being  irrational. I also tried to use our ""safe word"" a word we have designated for huge fights to immediately  stop it (which surprise surpise  she didn't  stop). She then goes to hit me. I tell  her to NOT LAY HANDS ON ME. I don't  care who in the wrong I might be.  Don't  hit me. So she  screams at me to go to my room  which  I  yell at her no because  she's  being irrational and I just her to actually  listen  to me so she pushed  me. I  fell and slammed my head on the floor and got a golf ball sized knot. She yells at me to get up and  to go to my room and  I just cry ""what  is wrong with  you?""
... she claims I threw myself on  the floor.
I go to my room to get away  from her and she's  just screaming  from various  parts of the house that ""you ruined  my life "", ""you're  why I  am stressed "", ""i hate you sometimes"", ""f*ck you"" and calling  me practically  everything  but the  c u next Tuesday word.

should  i have just not tried to defend  myself  or get upset  for being called a liar?
I just don't  know what to do anymore. I'm  just so tired  of confrontations like this but am I the asshole  for arguing  with a parent?  I just want to be  listened to  especially now that I am an adult too.

1. Is there a preferred mount to adapt to fuji? I know right off the bat I have to use a mount with a larger flange distance (X mount is at 17.7mm) but are there any advantages to one over the other? A quick search shows the EF and F mount lenses weight the same.
2. is there a brand of adapter known to work better? Doing some searching on BH I see that Vello, FotodioX, and Metabones are all well reviewed. Any preference?

"r4r","t5_2rn0e","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/r4r because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

This doesn‚Äôt mean that *others* aren‚Äôt allowed to hate khaki. It‚Äôs only my personal experience.  A lot of people dislike khaki immensely and may choose to wear red purely because they hate it, and that‚Äôs okay. The point is that I don‚Äôt *have* to dislike one colour to prefer another.

I also read a lot the average salary (for international) is between 3.5m - 4m, is that right? I'm prepared for the 'pay cut', but not if it also means working more hours than really necessary (e.g. coming in to seem 'busy' even though I prefer to do my planning etc at home).

*****

&gt; De acuerdo con reportes¬†los indocumentados iban a ser ingresados a un domicilio, cuando los uniformados realizaban rondines en la zona y se percataron de que un tr√°iler obstru√≠a el paso en la calle Luis Donaldo Colosio, por lo que acudieron a verificar qu√© ocurr√≠a.   

&gt; Los migrantes relataron a la polic√≠a que eran trasladados a la frontera de M√©xico con Estados Unidos, por lo que llegaron al lugar integrantes de la C√©lula de Apoyo al Migrante de la polic√≠a municipal para brindar ayuda a los centroamericanos.   

&gt; Los detenidos fueron identificados como Luis √Ångel ‚ÄúN‚Äù, de 29 a√±os de edad, Gustavo ‚ÄúN‚Äù y Rodrigo ‚ÄúN‚Äù, el primero de ellos que afirm√≥ contar con estudios universitarios, quienes fueron presentados ante el Ministerio P√∫blico federal por su probable participaci√≥n en los delitos de transportar o dar albergue a extranjeros con fines de lucro para evadir las leyes de migraci√≥n, as√≠ como inducir, procurar, facilitar u obligar a ni√±as, ni√±os y adolescentes a cometer dichas conductas.   

&gt; Ecatepec se ubica en la ruta de migrantes centroamericanos en su paso hacia Estados Unidos, por lo que el gobierno municipal cre√≥ la C√©lula de Apoyo al Migrante para auxiliarlos.   

&gt; La Casa de Pernocta ‚ÄúPetra Herrera‚Äù es utilizada para brindar albergue y alimentos a los migrantes rescatados, algunos de ellos incluso detectados en otros municipios del Estado de M√©xico y trasladados a Ecatepec debido a que las instalaciones del refugio son aptas para resguardar a gran n√∫mero de personas.

"chemistry","t5_2qhf9","Keep the resume short, targeted and relevant.

Realistically at your skill level it's going to be max 2 pages in length.  First guess for omitting skills for you will simple be keeping the length on paper short.

If the job is &gt; 5 years ago it's probably not relevant.  Your current skills will be just so much more valuable.  90% of the time that is all I'm reading and the remainder is filler content.  YMMV.

Your PhD experience will be the majority at maybe 1/2 - 2/3 page in length of both bullet points and short 3 line length project summaries.  The PhD experience is so huge that you can realistically omit all other job history and nobody will say anything.

Should you feel you must include it or show a longer working period, a customer service job is maybe just 1-2 lines of year/location/title.  Different if are specifically targeting a job in customer service + chemical industry.  A chemical sales job I'd go 3-5 lines because working for a chemical company is relevant, especially the product, type of chemistry, size of team, your ops budget and any successes.  I do have jobs where I want to see evidence the chemist has a broad knowledge of supplier networks, but I also have jobs where I would ignore that skill.

Another aim is to remove any *negatives* from a resume.  If they job doesn't require customer service experience, remove it.  Maybe you worked at Dominos and the hiring manager hates that company for some random reason.  That may be enough to trash the application.",1635724869

"medicare","t5_2qp4d","So you have a lack of understanding.  As a licensed broker (having a state insurance license), i have a responsibility to write you on a plan that's ""better"" than what you have for you.  Sometimes the definition of better can be subjective.  If i lie and put you on a worse plan so i can get a commission you can file complaints with medicare and the state department of insurance.  They will open an investigation.  If i'm found to have done wrong i can and will get penalized and with allegations against me I could lose my license, get fined, or both.

I admit there are bad agents out there, very bad agents who just try to scam people so they can get their buck before they get caught, or take advantage of old people who are easily confused.

&gt;come back next year to tweak your plan so they can get another commission.

Our commission structure is a flat fee for a plan for every year the member is on the plan.   If you are on that plan for 10 years i get the same commission every single year for having only ever talked to you once.  If i meet you every year and swap you from plan to plan, i also get the same fee.  I don't want to see you every year from that standpoint.   

I WANT you on a plan that you will have for years instead of me having to rewrite every year.  Rewriting a lot of work to stay revenue neutral.  But a lot of us spend a lot of time doing it every year, because peoples health needs change or plan benefits on PDP and MAPD plans change yearly.

**TLDR:**

* My license is to sell insurance and if i screw up there is accountability with both Medicare/CMS and the State Dept of Insurance.
* I technically lose money every time i ""tweak"" your plan because i'm doing extra work to not make extra money.  
* I have no idea how an advisor you would pay holds any sort of accountability or if there is a separate license for that.  If they're a volunteer there is zero accountability.",1635724870

"SocialJusticeInAction","t5_3225u","&gt;	https://nogre.com/is-a-masters-degree-worth-it-this-expert-says-yes/

&gt;If you don't already know about the importance of getting a degree and the capital that it brings to the individual I'm not going to waste my time here.

‚ÄúPeople who benefit from you taking out outrageous student loans say going back to school is totally worth it!‚Äù

As you can see I‚Äôm totally [struggling](https://imgur.com/a/Cx1YlKy) here without my degree

&gt;	This isn't even a hot take either, nearly everyone knows that outcomes for one's life become significantly better with higher education.

You don‚Äôt need to go to college to be educated. That‚Äôs some pseudo elitist bullshit. The entity of mankind‚Äôs knowledge is on the web, most of it available for free. But sure, keep believing the racket that is the us education system. 

&gt;https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2019/article/high-wage-occupations.htm

Over half of the jobs on that list don‚Äôt require degrees‚Ä¶

&gt;	If you wanna get mad over the reality of the situation by all means, but the data is consistent here, you get more money on average when you have a degree, and like the original chart I linked, you're paying off student loan debt in 5-10 years depending on how much of a priority that is for the individual.

The college degree aside from a few specialized fields. Is worthless now. It‚Äôs the new high school diploma, but with an outrageous cost. Look I get it, if you just want to be a worker drone that‚Äôs fine. But your advice is for that, a worker drone life. Some of us aspire for more; enjoy your mediocre life.",1635724870

Real talk, however: I won't be keeping it out of warranty.

That said, anecdotal evidence, Doug's and even my data point, are meaningless.  The sales data speaks for itself.  The market has voted based on units sold, backorder, and share price. 

This conversation is like how I can't believe how people love A

If at all possible‚Äîand I know it might not be‚Äîfind a different provider for a one-time visit to address just this issue. Even if it means going to a free clinic in a different town.

"Supplements","t5_2qhb8","Thanks for the info.  

Edit: Please don't take this as slamming your choice of supplement or contribution. I'm sure it works great for you as you said. Am just providing some info you may not have been aware of below.  

Wow that supplement is full of junk. Look out for the Titanium Dioxide, it has already been banned in some countries as a food additive for genotoxicity; and it has been implicated in a negative affect on your gut bacteria and elevated inflammation.  

Aside from that; yes one would think a good complex of different chelates would be a great solution to this post.  
There is a [clean alternative to the one you posted](https://www.nowfoods.com/supplements/magnesium-transporters-veg-capsules), which I used to take. It's great. 
However, it is a problem precisely for the reasons I outlined in my initial post - but even worse - when you take these you don't actually *KNOW* what you are taking because they refuse to tell you the specific quantities of which magnesium forms are used.  

This means that if you have to stop suddenly perhaps due to supply reasons and swap in another brand, you actually *dont know* what to swap in.  

This can be dangerous, especially if one of the primary ingredients was magnesium citrate - which is a laxative.  

If you suddenly stop or change dose on a laxative which you have adjusted to after taking for some time, you can cause yourself damage. This happened to me with a magnesium complex.

It‚Äôs never too late. Think of all the famous ‚Äúolder‚Äù authors:

1. Mary Ann Evans, better known as George Eliot, published her first novel, Adam Bede, at age 40. It was an instant success and Eliot went on to write six more novels.
2. William S. Burroughs‚Äô first book, Junky, was published in 1953, when Burroughs was 40. Naked Lunch appeared six years later.

3. Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known by his pen-name, Mark Twain, published his first novel, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, when he was 41.
4. Marcel Proust didn‚Äôt publish the first volume of √Ä la Recherche du Temps Perdu until he was 43. He paid for the publishing costs himself after the manuscript was rejected by the publishing house where Andre Gide was editor-in-chief.
5. Henry Miller‚Äôs first book, Tropic of Cancer, was published when he was 44. The book had to be published in France, because it was too risque for the American market.
6. J. R. R. Tolkien‚Äôs first novel, The Hobbit, was published when he was 45 years old. For the next ten years he worked on his trilogy, Lord of the Rings, only to encounter snags with his publisher when he had finished it. Lord of the Rings was published over the years 1954 and 1955, by which time he was 63.
7. Tony Hillerman published The Blessing Way when he was 45. His agent, Ann Elmo, famously told Hillerman to ‚ÄúGet rid of the Indian stuff.‚Äù
8. Bram Stoker published his first novel, The Snake‚Äôs Pass, when he was 43. He published Dracula when he was 50.
9. Alex Haley‚Äôs The Autobiography of Malcolm X was published when he was 44. Roots, his second book, came out eleven years later, when he was 55.
10. Raymond Chandler‚Äôs first novel, The Big Sleep, was published in 1939, when he was 51.
11. Richard Adams published Watership Down at age 52. It was an instant classic
12. Annie Proulx, winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction, the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction, didn‚Äôt publish her first novel, Postcards, until she was 57. The Shipping News was published a year later.
13. Daniel Defoe published his debut novel, Robinson Crusoe, at age 59.
14. Laura Ingalls Wilder published the first book in her ‚ÄúLittle House‚Äù series, Little House in the Big Woods, in 1932, when she was 65 years old. She finished her last book when she was 76.
15. Frank McCourt‚Äôs memoir, Angela‚Äôs Ashes, came out when he was 66.",1635724873

"IntellectualDarkWeb","t5_e0m2r","&gt;I highly doubt you are dating a transwoman.

Let's get it out of the way that you're just plain wrong on this one. If you really care about researching my profile so much, you could trace my mentions of her all the way back to last July when we started dating. Perhaps I was a bit transphobic (or at least unsure of the authenticity of transgender people) before I met her. But now I have no doubt that trans people exist and are just as authentic as cisgender people. I have been completely immersed in the world of trans people and have several transgender friends now, who are often at my place, which is more that what many so called trans activists can say who often get the realistic priorities of the community wrong. I know it's hard to hear this from a cis male who lives with transgender people. My girlfriend really opened up my eyes.

If you've gone through my post history, and bothered to make a reply like this, I hope that you have at least read my detailed rhetoric regarding what specifically I challenge within the discourse. And if you have done this, then you would know I recognize a swift difference between transgender individuals and the political movement which essentializes transgender people and turns them into a perceived monolith at their expense. My girlfriend would be banned from online trans communities for contravening their doctrine. Online gender non-conforming communities have sharpened themselves down to such an extremely fine ideological edge that they are no longer representative of the broader trans populace. 


&gt;(300 comments) and found 115 mentions of transgender. You seem utterly obsessed with it. 

That's not hard to believe considering that this comment alone will probably add another 15. I wouldn't consider it an obsession so much as a topic that I find important.

If you want a link to the Black transgender woman's video I will PM it to you. The rhetoric she espouses in her video is exactly what my girlfriend and her friends find solidarity with. 

&gt;You don't actually make an argument

This is not true, and there is no way you have read all of my comment history. Did you happen to see my argument about incels posing as trans women in order take advantage of the protected status of trans women, and shame cis lesbians for not fucking them? Something like this is bound to happen, but I assure you, the fact that the LGBTQ accepted these people rather than called them out was harmful to real trans woman who are merely trying to navigate social waters. 

&gt;Remember: in this thread you're literally equating the desire to be called 'they' with ""radical authoritarianism"". 

This is also untrue. The user I was replying to appeared to me to be making a gesture that all of transgender theory is infallible. I was merely asking him if this is was he believes. Perhaps it was a hastily done comment, but neo-pronouns are an entirely different topic at this point. 

&gt;If your supposed trans gf agrees with you on everything, does she wanna be called she? And then does she simultaneously hate NBs? Because why would she demand to be called she but deny NBs being called they?

You might be better off asking her how she feels about non binary. But NB is an entirely different belief structure, isn't it? Namely, making the shift in belief that gender is binary, to gender is not (or shouldn't be) binary. But for the record I don't have an issue saying ""they"" if someone asks me to refer to them that way.",1635724874

I will take care of my loved ones, and I will tell them to take care of themselves. I find myself the mom friend to many‚Äîor the one friends will come to in a crisis. I would *never* tell anyone to take on such a role, to everyone, and burn themselves out, not ask for support or refuge, and without setting boundaries. But I do this myself. I am in the stage where I recognize this in myself, and am making those feeble first steps to begin to untangle, to set boundaries, to do self care *before* burnout.

It is so much harder to undo habits than it is to never get in the habit in the first place.

It is a fine thing to set high standards for yourself. It is not fine to, at the same time, have none for others. Or vice versa. 

It started so young‚ÄîI was the one to check out scary noises at sleepovers, ‚Äúthe brave one‚Äù they called me. Y‚Äôall, I *relished* that label. I wanted to be brave. Who doesn‚Äôt? 

Then they called me ‚Äúthe one who always knows what to do.‚Äù

Then, ‚Äúthe one who always knows the right thing to say.‚Äù

None of these were manipulation; they were compliments. They were admiration. And it is intoxicating. But there is a danger, in getting carried away.

It is so hard to learn to say no if you‚Äôve gotten rusty from not saying it. People often say ‚Äúno is a complete sentence,‚Äù but it‚Äôs a hard one. It‚Äôs much easier to say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that, no.‚Äù *without explanation or justification* which is the spirit of that saying.

Now, I set my phone on a schedule for do not disturb starting an hour before bed. I have turned read receipts off. I have gotten in the habit of not answering texts or calls at work. People know I‚Äôm unavailable at work and while sleeping now. I would *never* wake someone up for anything less than a dire emergency‚Äîsleep is incredibly important!

I would say his parents talked to their friend and real estate lawyer about possibly the van and other things of personal or joint property that needed taken care of. This van life was suppose to be a business venture for them. We don't even know if the Laundries may have invested in it too. Gabby's parents may have. He talked to Brian about that.

Flageolet is that oily feeling you get when you go whoop whoop. You can add that on chest, head and i even got a colleague who can mix from the function.

Also the term flageolet, comes from sundberg(voice scientist) he describes it as partial vibration.

M1 chest,belt mix

M2 head, falsetto,rockfalsetto, mix

M3 whistle gear 1 and 2

"Minneapolis","t5_2r3bl","That's not true. If certain behaviors become off limits that previously weren't off limits, then we should expect officers to experience consequences for engaging in newly outlawed behaviors. There's nothing in the contract that prevents this from happening.

And really, in order to expect a change, we'd have to start first attempting to hold officers accountable. This has nothing to do with the union contract. There's nothing in the union contract that protects officers who beat the shit out of a prone, unarmed, surrendering suspect. They should be charged with a crime. Which would also have nothing to do with the union contract. And yet, as far as anyone can tell, nothing has happened to these officers. 

The problem here has nothing to do with the union contract, because the union contract governs how discipline plays out, it doesn't come into play if no one is being disciplined.",1635724878

I think it's simpler to just say they are the only creations that cannot be corrupted by definition because they are the living extensions of the emperor's will. It also explains why they seem singularly  distant and inhuman in their demeanor, they are just the hands of the emperor--not servants with a duty like the rest of humanity. They literally are the Emperor. 

I also think this question of corruptibility will become hugely important when you consider the revelation of who the King in Yellow is and what he may be up to.

"TransDIY","t5_31hgt","I can't comment on CPA but progesterone contributes to breast development, and we know how it contributes. This is just basic womens medicine.

OP: Estrogen alone during puberty causes longitudinal breast duct growth. Once you add progesterone later in puberty or during pregnancy, radial duct growth takes over instead of longitudinal.

It's for this reason that we don't take progesterone until we're at Tanner 4 because the types of growth are mutually exclusive. Progesterone contributes heavily to Tanner 5.

Secondly, when you *stop* progesterone the radial ducting collapses, just like what post-pregnancy women experience. So we need to stay on progesterone to maintain the youthful size and shape.

The part about staying on hormones is correct. Start on estrogen, eventually add progesterone, stay on both for life.",1635724878

So I honestly don't think it matters all that much what version of the character what actor plays what. All that matters is that the character is at least engaging and written well within whatever narrative context they exist in. 

However it feels more like most of the praise for Tom Holland cones from the fact that he *looks* like a teen/high schooler more so than anything to do with the writing or actual acting performance. I mean don't get me wrong, I think the guys a decent enough actor. But I don't really get the heaps of praise here or how he's the ""best"" depiction of Peter Parker when these MCU Spider-Man movies are basically just supplementary content in between other MCU stuff.",1635724878

We're really excited that you posted, but it had to be removed because it violated Rule 2 - our rules are what keep LBGW one of the top-visited NSFW sites on Reddit, so we need to ensure that our hot post providers always follow them.

Here is a good way to make sure you are following the rules:

Rule 2 means that all posts must contain at least half your face. We must clearly be able to see some of your features! 
I.e. (eyes and nose)/(nose and mouth)/(eyes and mouth). 

This means that we DO NOT allow text-only posts. All posts must contain at least one image which fulfills rule two.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Your parents need to talk to a therapist or get involved with a caregiver support group. Stat. I will give them a fragment of the benefit of the doubt because they sound like they have made lives that revolve around caring for your sibling. Which brings me to the next question: what are their plans for your sibling's care after they are both gone? What does your sibling have to say in all this? If their intellect has not been affected by their medical condition, they should have a say in what the future will look like once your parents are no longer here. And you should also have a say in the matter if their plan is just to hand over the caretaking to you, whether your are prepared for the task or not.  


Bringing this back on-topic, you are NTA at all. I can't imagine a set of new grandparents who would be SO focused on the adult offspring whom they take care of, that they would IGNORE the fact that they have just become grandparents...! WTH? Who does this? How is this a thing? Which brings us back to ""your parents should be seeking the assistance of a therapist"", because this is not a normal reaction in any way. Cripes, if I had been able to have kids, I can just imagine my parents going off the deep end with joy. They would certainly not have FORGOTTEN THEIR GRANDCHILD'S NAME, nor would they have shown nearly zero interest in the baby. I just don't get it, and you should not have to put up with it.

If your parents are overwhelming you with calls to vent about your sibling's condition, send them to voice mail when they are calling at a bad time. You have caretaking going on in your own household, and if you find it too draining to both be their sounding board and make the adjustment to being a new parent, you don't have to let them vent to you nonstop. You would also be within your rights to go LC or even NC with your parents until they start showing an interest in you and your family. You can decide whether you want to preface this change with a call explaining to them why you are limiting contact, or you can just do it without any preamble.   


Blessings to you and hour husband and your new baby! Share your joy with people who appreciate it, and leave the rest of the people behind.",1635724883

"teslore","t5_2t5ay","From an outside lore perspective; no explanation required because that way it's cool, adds mystery and it's better we never find out because that would take away the magic. In addition I doubt anyone working on the projects came up with a concrete reason because if you have an answer like that there is a desire to tell people it. By not creating an answer you avoid this pitfall.

I personally have a few theories, though idk where my sources are anymore

1) as another user noted; it could have propagated through the Dwemer magical psychic link known as ""the calling"". Downsides are; we don't know whether or not it allows communication with other realms or if it is dependent on the plane. The only people who would know this are Yagrum or the Psijics

2) Kagrenac fucked up trying to do something and instead of making the Dwemer unbeatable or whatever he unmade them

3) the Dwemer had previously used the heart to do something to their race, maybe making them ageless or super intelligent or idk maybe even invulnerable. When Nerevar won against Dumac at red mountain he did something that undid the spell and the backlash destroyed the Dwemer. An alternative to this is that Kagrenac tried to do something to improve their chances of victory, using the Dwemer wide enchantment as a base. He fucked it up and poof",1635724883

Right now about half their team are honestly pretty good candidates to be finals anchors, Nany, Josh and Devin. Nany I dont think needs an explanation of why shes an anchor after last year. Josh we've never seen in a final, so it is possible if he can keep up with the cardio he could be okay in a team setting with enough ppl so they can avoid him having to do anything involving grace or spatial awareness, but I think it's more likely since this would be his first final that he ends up tryna go hard, gasses out and ends up being an anchor, best case scenario he isnt a detriment, but doesnt really offer up anything special or needed either. Devin we've seen in a final and mini final like things before and unless I'm forgetting something has never done well in them, he does bring puzzles and strategy to the table which I think his team definitely needs, but I'm just not sure if hes worked on his endurance/cardio enough for his brain to make up for it. 

Like if Emerald was thinking smart the first guy day they should've made a deal with Kyle to send him in, where he can pick an injured Logan or shorter Ed depending on elim on the condition he switches to Emerald and picks Josh, same with Emy but replace Logan with Bettina and Josh with Nany. But the thing is that Nany and Josh are Kaycee's number ones and Emanuel seems to follow Kaycees lead since they were partnered up the whole time til teams. So itd have to be Devin and/or Tori who take this initiative and get at least 2 more team members to vote with them without knowing about the deal they have in place with Kyle/Emy (I only specify Kyle and Emy cuz I dont think anyone else stronger than Josh or Nany would want to risk an elim to switch at that point). And tbh while I'm sure Devin (and prob Tori too) recognize they have some anchors on their team that they could benefit switching for stronger players, at the very least Devin is gonna realize if he targets Josh or Nany that could lead to him being targeted as an anchor as well (and for Tori if Nany is replaced with Emy I think she recognizes she'd be the next choice for someone wanting to switch so it's better for her to keep Nany as long as possible and then try and get someone to switch as close to the last girls daily as possible). 

Basically Emeralds biggest problem is the same problem as Cara's alliance in WOTW2, they have a strong alliance with the numbers that allows them to win dailys and control the game, but just doesnt really work for a final. And just like Cara's alliance in WOTW2 some of their strongest male alliance members arent actually on their team (Rogan and CT on WOTW2 and CT and Kyle on Sapphire in this game). They care way too much about bringing their entire alliance to the final, including those who wont benefit them in a final, than they do building a strong team.",1635724884

I certainly am, as I worked plenty of those jobs when I was younger) is sort of part of the unwritten social contract here. It‚Äôs frayed somewhat due to COVID. People on edge shouting at frontline workers, and workers quitting jobs on the spot due to poor pay or working conditions. That last one is actually a good thing. A lot of food service workers are finding better jobs with kinder employers, or getting out of the field entirely. It‚Äôs the biggest push the labor movement here has had in twenty years. So, if you see articles about employers complaining that *no one wants to work!*, most likely the pay or working conditions are bad.

In any case, I‚Äôm glad we set a good standard for politeness in that area to the rest of the world.",1635724885

"sto","t5_2rfq3","The T6 Somraw is the Qa'TeL. If you look at the lineage from the T2 Somraw, to the T6 Qa'TeL, you can clearly see the evolution.

Klingon ships have always been.... odd compared to Romulan and Federation ships. Because they have such a disparity in size, even in the same class, different tiered versions of what is supposed to be the same ship often don't work with lower tier versions.

You can see this mindset with the BoPs. When they do legendary bundles they add in all the unique skins, consoles, and weapons, from the lower tier versions. The BoP series only ever had one normal, and one zen, ship per tier through T1-4. When they made the legendary B'rel they included all of the unique consoles/weapons from the T1-4 BoPs, even though they can't use each other's skins, because the T6 BoP is the T6 BoP for all the other tiers of BoP. Even though the T6 BoP can't use the T2-4 BoP skins.

This is also true for the Orion carriers, the Gorn science vessels, the Nausicaan destroyers, and the raptor class.",1635724885

&gt;Former NSW Minister for Family and Community Services and former Australian Sex Discrimination Commissioner, the Hon Pru Goward has joined Western Sydney University as Professor of Social Interventions and Policy.

&gt;Dedicating more than a decade to state politics, Professor Goward‚Äôs public service tenure centred upon complex social issues and families. As a New South Wales minister, she held several portfolios, including family and community services, social housing and mental health. Professor Goward was also the first NSW minister for the prevention of domestic violence and sexual assault.

&gt;Western Sydney University Vice-Chancellor Professor Barney Glover AO noted Professor Goward‚Äôs outstanding public service career and her dedication to addressing disadvantage.

&gt;‚ÄúProfessor Goward‚Äôs impressive legacy in government includes a child protection system which resulted in a drastic reduction in the number of children entering care. She also oversaw the biggest social housing building program in the country.

&gt;‚ÄúWestern Sydney University prides itself on reducing inequalities and promoting inclusive and equitable quality education, and I am certain Professor Goward‚Äôs appointment will complement our important work in this area,‚Äù said Professor Glover.

&gt;At Western Sydney University, Professor Goward will provide regional, national and international leadership in research on social policy and evaluation. Professor Goward will also lead the development of a unique vision, original program of research and act as an advisor, providing high level advice on new programs.

&gt;‚ÄúI care very deeply about effective social policy and I am delighted that my new position at Western Sydney University means I can continue to build on the work I was passionate about during my time in government.

&gt;‚ÄúI am grateful for this opportunity to further deliver critically important work, which will translate into action and investment into breaking the cycles of intergenerational disadvantage that limit opportunity and ambition,‚Äù said Professor Goward.

I think the reason this one struck a nerve is because it is the opposite of the standard dime a dozen fuck poor people outrage bait.

It is more offensive because people know it is a genuine opinion that is widely shared amongst the AFR crowd. If Bolt hit the same 

&gt; although often damaged and almost entirely lacking discipline, trust in the system, trust in anyone who represents the system.

points in his column I doubt anyone would have even noticed but it is because Pru has things like this this before it,

"FeminismUncensored","t5_3otol5","&gt;You are the one saying that women are just as violent as men while ignoring the nuance.

What nuance? Violence is violence. 


&gt;Without a proper break down we have no idea if 70% of those women lightly shoved once or if 70% of those women punched their partner as hard as they could twice.

They cover this in the study I listed above and it goes on to say 

&gt;This explanation cannot account for the data, however, as both men and women reported a larger proportion of nonreciprocal violence perpetrated by women than by men. One might be tempted to think that men who perpetrate violence in nonreciprocal relationships are the traditional male ‚Äúbatterer.‚Äù However, the data were not consistent with this representation; women who were victims of nonreciprocal violence experienced less violence and a lower likelihood of injury than did women who were victims of violence in reciprocally violent relationships. Some have suggested that survey studies, such as this one, likely exclude the more severely abused women typically studied in clinical settings.22 Thus, our findings may represent 1 form of partner violence‚Äîwhat Johnson23 has called common couple violence or situational violence‚Äîthat is likely to be found in broader population samples rather than in clinical samples.

&gt;In analyses of reports of violence frequency and injury occurrence, 2 clear findings emerged. First, perpetrators who were men were more likely to inflict an injury on a partner than were those who were women, regardless of reciprocity status. This replicates findings in the literature at large that women are more likely to be injured by partner violence than are men.1,7 Second, relationships with reciprocal violence resulted in more frequent violence (by women only) and a greater likelihood of injury caused by both male and female perpetrators. Reciprocal violence was more dangerous for the victim, both men and women, than was nonreciprocal violence. In fact, men in relationships with reciprocal violence were reportedly injured more often (25.2%) than were women in relationships with nonreciprocal violence (20.0%); this is important as violence perpetrated by women is often seen as not serious.10 An important caveat to these findings is that we do not know the extent or severity of the injuries reported, only that they were reported to have occurred.

&gt;These findings highlight the importance of considering relationship violence in the context of the relationship. Many authors have noted that research and prevention should begin to shift away from the sole focus on violence by men against women given the accumulation of data indicating that partner violence is perpetrated by both men and women.10,20 The data presented here suggest that it is critical to begin to study some of the relationship processes that contribute to reciprocal partner violence as those are most likely to result in injury.",1635724889
"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt;And about LPL not losing Bo5‚Äôs, I assume you mean only at worlds, which is a bit disingenuous when they only got two teams to Bo5 to begin with and had civil war in quarters. And if you weren‚Äôt talking about just worlds, IG lost to TL in MSI 2019 semis.

Well, they did not lose a bo5 in 2019, they lost one to Damwon in 2020, and they haven't lost one this year. I don't know what is disingenuous about this.

"Polska","t5_2qiqo","Dziƒôki za ten komentarz. Ciekawa odpowied≈∫, kt√≥ra dobrze pokazuje co oznacza okre≈õlenie FUD. Fear, uncertainty, distrust. Trochƒô siƒô musia≈Çe≈õ na≈Çaziƒá po sadach r√≥≈ºnych zbierajƒÖc te najr√≥≈ºniejsze argumenty jak wi≈õnie :). Odpowiem na nie po kolei. 0. Blockchain to internet do handlowania miƒôdzy lud≈∫mi (p2p). Okre≈õlenie web3 lepiej ni≈º ""kryptowaluty"" oddaje to co siƒô dzieje. Ta rewolucja ju≈º jest tera≈∫niejszo≈õciƒÖ. 

1. Anonimowo≈õƒá - odchodzi do lamusa. ObowiƒÖzek KYC umacnia siƒô jako standard. Dostajemy zaawansowane i inteligentne korzystanie z prywatno≈õci  

2. Ilo≈õƒá transakcji jednocze≈õnie - je≈õli m√≥wimy o prƒôdko≈õci dzia≈Çania, liczymy raczej ich liczbƒô per sekunda - TPS. Ju≈º teraz sƒÖ waluty, kt√≥re przebijajƒÖ 1700 TPS systemu VISA. Twoje sformu≈Çowanie zdaje siƒô odnosiƒá do nieco zaawansowanego tematu konkurencji i dzia≈Çania modelu eUTxO. M√≥wiƒÖc w uproszczeniu, nie ma to wiele wsp√≥lnego prƒôdko≈õciƒÖ dzia≈Çania. 

3. Centralizacja jest problemem - w rzeczy samej! Nowo-powstajƒÖce prawa i regulacje mocno przetrzebiƒÖ rynek. Pozorowanie decentralizacji nie przejdzie. Za to DAO umo≈ºliwiƒÖ ludziom z ca≈Çego ≈õwiata ≈ÇƒÖczenie funduszy we wsp√≥lnƒÖ si≈Çƒô w spolnych sprawach. 

4. Spekulacje finansowe - fakt, niestety problemy znane ju≈º od zamierzch≈Çych baniek gie≈Çd tulipan√≥w nadal trapiƒÖ ludzko≈õƒá. Monety z pieskami stworzƒÖ jeszcze niejednego milionera i niedw√≥ch biedak√≥w :(. Przyznajƒô jednak, ≈ºe nie rozumiem Twojego argumentu o u≈ºyteczno≈õci. Inwestowanie w akcje producenta u≈ºytecznego wynalazku nie jest dobrym pomys≈Çem? Inteligene kontrakty i ekonomia NFT odmieniajƒÖ przemys≈Ç gier, us≈Çug finansowych czy w≈Çasno≈õci artystycznej juz dzi≈õ. Przysz≈Ço≈õƒá jest zdecentralizowana. 

5. Stablecoins - kluczowy element decentralizowanych finans√≥w. W obecnych rozwiƒÖzaniach wielu dopatruje siƒô przekrƒôt√≥w. Je≈õli Twoje informacje sƒÖ prawdziwe, jeste≈õ kluczowym ≈õwiadkiem przynajmniej przeciwko firmom Tether i Circle :). Moje raptem kilkuletnie do≈õwiadczenie m√≥wi, ≈ºe obydwie waluty stabilnie trzymajƒÖ warto≈õƒá, a obserwacje pokazujƒÖ, ≈ºe stabilne sƒÖ i us≈Çugi oparte o te Stablecoiny. Przysz≈Ço≈õciowo jednak stawiam na ju≈º udowodnione, ale komercyjnie jeszcze w rozwoju, algorytmiczne stabilizacje.

6. Energia - technologia u≈ºyta w Bitcoinie ma ju≈º ponad 10 lat. To faktycznie jest dinozaur energo≈ºerca. Obecne rozwiƒÖzania (oparte o Proof-of-Stake) sƒÖ ponad milion razy bardziej wydajne energetycznie. Nie m√≥wiƒô w przenosni. SƒÖ te≈º korzystajƒÖce z nowocze≈õniejszych i ogromnie oszczednijeszych form Proof-of-Work.

7. Chiny? Powa≈ºnie? Partia zakaza≈Ça kopania, bo ma dla obywateli swoje krypto, cyfrowego Yuan'a i zero potrzeby aby Ci drudzy mogli siƒô bogaciƒá w spos√≥b niekontrolowany przez niƒÖ. Obecnie rozwa≈ºajƒÖ cofniƒôcie zakazu, a ameryka≈Ñski SEC og≈Çosi≈Ç ju≈º nie bƒôdzie banowal cryptocurrencies.  

8. ≈ölepa uliczka - Masz prawo tak uwa≈ºaƒá :). Na dzi≈õ, przeciwko Twojej opinii tylko w samym de-fi stoi 100 mld USD ( https://defipulse.com/ ). Przysz≈Ço≈õƒá bƒôdzie pewnie zaskoczeniem dla ka≈ºdego kto wejdzie w niƒÖ nagle.

I will never forgot this one in particular. The entire class was him yelling at us for over an hour every day. Imagine conservative talk radio but you have to pretend to pay attention. Fire and brimstone. Everything was wrong and satanic. We were all going to hell. I ended up learning a great deal about his personal life as he would interrupt his own rants each day to explain to us how great he was. Guy was a narcissist who as far as I could tell had never worked full time in his life. Just these random gigs ""teaching"".

Long story short one of the campers was his nephew. His nephew got bored one day during the hour plus long rants and started messing with my bookbag. I told him to stop and our ""teacher"" walked up to me and slapped me across the face. I was 10 years old.

Of course my useless parents did nothing and I was still forced to be there. He would randomly go up to me for the remaining month and demand that I apologize for making him hit me. I never did.

I am an atheist now. Sometimes I think of tracking him down. Might be fun given our size difference. But I probably won't. He taught me a good lesson about religion so for that I am grateful.",1635724890

mocked gay men who died of AIDS. It got worse when comedians like Eddie Murphy, who made millions off jokes about gay men dying horrible deaths from AIDS, was rewarded with a lifetime achievement award and a hit movie in 2021, or Kevin Hart, who said he‚Äôd beat his son up if he ever came out to him. And now we have Dave Chappelle. So while on the surface it looks like things are getting better (being able to marry) they really aren‚Äôt because within the community itself there‚Äôs so much insecurity and fear that nobody talks to each other and it‚Äôs once again impossible to meet other gay people. And an isolated community is a very unhealthy, unhappy one. 

Other minority groups need to get it through their skulls that the right-wing‚Äôs idea for the future (if it‚Äôs anything like Tucker Carlson‚Äôs ‚Äòdocumentary‚Äô)doesn‚Äôt have very good things for them either.

&gt; Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed urged citizens to join the fight against the Tigray People&amp;#039;s Liberation Front, the party in control of the rebellious northern region of Tigray, after Tigrayan forces said they took another town on a highway linking the capital of the landlocked nation to the port of Djibouti.

&gt; CLAIMS OF GAINS.TPLF spokesperson Getachew Reda said Tigrayan forces have seized the town of Kombolcha and its airport in the Amhara region.

&gt; Tigrayan forces have said they will keep fighting until Amhara forces leave the heavily fortified area of Western Tigray, and until the government permits the free movement of aid into the rest of Tigray.

"PS3","t5_2qhhw","I recommend purchasing an adapter and use pretty much any controller (i.e. PS4, PS5, Xbox, Nintendo, etc.) you want. The adapters let whatever controller you use work like the PS3 controller, including the PS button, except no pressure sensitive buttons as that's only a PS3 controller exclusive.

Adapters that work with the PS3:

* [Brook Wingman XE](https://www.brookaccessory.com/detail/87495367/) -- rumble, sixaxis, &amp; recovery mode work.
* [Mayflash MAGIC-S PRO](https://www.mayflash.com/product/showproduct.php?id=4) -- rumble works (if using PS5 controller it will only work wired), sixaxis works (doesn't work with PS5 controller), no recovery mode.
* [Mayflash MAGIC-NS](https://www.mayflash.com/product/showproduct.php?id=30) -- Same functions as the MAGIC-S PRO above.

If you do go this route make sure you keep the firmware updated on the adapter as they will implement further features and fix bugs if necessary.

I use the Brook Wingman XE &amp; Mayflash MAGIC-S Pro with a PS5 controller. If you want full compatibility the Brook adapter is best since it's works with rumble, sixaxis, and you can get into recovery mode with it so you don't need a PS3 controller.",1635724893

*****
&gt; Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed urged citizens to join the fight against the Tigray People&amp;#039;s Liberation Front, the party in control of the rebellious northern region of Tigray, after Tigrayan forces said they took another town on a highway linking the capital of the landlocked nation to the port of Djibouti.

&gt; CLAIMS OF GAINS.TPLF spokesperson Getachew Reda said Tigrayan forces have seized the town of Kombolcha and its airport in the Amhara region.

&gt; Tigrayan forces have said they will keep fighting until Amhara forces leave the heavily fortified area of Western Tigray, and until the government permits the free movement of aid into the rest of Tigray.

I'm not a real estate agent by any means and I am hesitant to say that a housing market ties significantly to federal funds and federal employees is capped... Especially considering that our government is hell-bent on preventing a decline in housing prices. That said. I'm not sure how hyper localized you noticed a decline in housing but at least in Alexandria, Vienna, Tysons area, Bethesda to Frederick and silver spring to pretty much Baltimore City, prices have risen pretty significantly through covid. In the last 15 months, houses by me have risen about 10% for example.  Can't say I've looked particularly close to Crystal City though. That being said, hq2 was already priced in to housing in much of the area. It feels like it was 5 years ago but I think it was 3, houses rose pretty noticably as people adjusted for the expectation of higher demand of housing. There might be fringe cases and perhaps people are slightly off on hq2 leading to a quick rise in housing but that bet is probably pretty significant and nowhere near a given. Not to mention we don't really know what the outcomes of WFH will look like    and how impactful hq2 will be to the housing market. Rent skyrocketing especially close to HQ probably is directly tied to it but I don't know that it should be viewed as a positive sign to buy. 

About the company you'd ideally work for comment. I really would actively reccomend not buying until you land whatever new job you are searching. I think I interpreted it as expectations with current company.If you are expecting to switch jobs, you definitely don't want to be tied down to a house. You have way more leverage and way more possibilities for work in almost every sector (even defense) if you aren't tied to a specific city when job hunting. Personally, as I was finishing my masters, i leveraged a job opportunity across the country to get about a 25% raise. If I had owned and has bought a house recently, That would have been a pretty empty threat to leave as opposed to a real plan. 

In terms of maximizing use of funds I think it sort of ties to the retirements comment still. Maxing your match is still getting you significantly less than if you were maxing. At minimum, I'd look to Max an IRA each year and use the windfall to help inflate your 401k/403b etc accounts to or close to Max (19.5k). Tax advantaged retirement accounts give you essentially a guaranteed rate of return of at least cap gains mitigation. Other than that, i would personally beef up my emergency fund slightly (risk tolerances vary) and just keep funneling money to an investment portfolio which matches your risk expectations. 

But this is just one person's opinion.",1635724898

But, here is the interesting part - I never seem to stick to 16:8 anymore - my actual fasts are somewhere between 18-22 hours every day and I do a 28 hour fast once a week. I fall back to 16:8 fasting occasionally, but always tend to do longer fasts.

I‚Äôm pretty sure I have PTSD from that experience.

Now, I live with chronic pain from degenerative discs and multiple back surgeries and it effects every aspect of my life. I don‚Äôt even get relief from my pain when I sleep.

I tend to think these things should be mutual, as in... one of you shows a sign of interest, the other (hopefully) picks up on it and reciprocates a little in returns. A little back and forth ensues, until things are in motion. Shouldn't be terribly complicated. If he's coming over to yours, I wouldn't worry about invading his personal space. It's kind of implied that you will at least touch each other a little, even if it's just a cuddle. If he's not ready for things to go any further than that, I'm sure he'd say something.

She also made about 2/3 the amount another new practitioner would make at the same setting, which can be pretty tough if you are already in debt from school.

"Divorce","t5_2qipv","There may be more points in the stay column than the leave column, but you have to also look at how things are weighted. I think that staying with someone who you are no longer attracted to physically or emotionally holds quite a bit of weight to me. It sounds like you are scared of the future if you are to split and worried about your child. I think most people thinking about divorce are scared and apprehensive of the future because you don't really know how things are going to be until you do it, but that's not a reason to stay. I also firmly believe that no one should stay together for the sake of their kids. Kids grow up looking at your marriage as a model for how relationships should be. They will see the strain, whether you mean them to or not, and may grow up thinking that this is how relationships are supposed to be.  You want to model healthy relationships for your child. Your child is also so young, he or she will never remember the two of you being together. Just like you learned to be a parent, you will also learn to be a single parent. I think you know what your decision is, but it's easy to be scared of the unknown. Whatever you decide, you can handle it!",1635724901

"Disneycollegeprogram","t5_2v17m","As DCP intern you are expected to be available at any time, with respect to otherwise-documented work restrictions (religion or health, for example).

I worked my first DCP in 2007, which was pre-recession. I worked Magic Kingdom and I worked ALL THE TIME. I‚Äôm talking 63 hour weeks at the peak. I was force-extended constantly that summer and (as a joke between me and all my friends) I only once had an ER request granted ‚Äî it was a Thanksgiving miracle. I am not speaking figuratively when I tell you that as a CP I have been clocked in at every hour of the day at some point ‚Äî on Christmas morning I was due in at 4:45am and I had times where I clocked out after 5am from a late shift.

Your CP schedule is not going to be predictable. Days off will not be consistently Tuesday/Wednesday, for example, and sometimes you might be scheduled to close three nights in a row, open twice in a row, and then have one closer and another opener.

You can make requests for various schedule requests. When my mom came to visit for my birthday I scored 4 days off in a row. Know how that happened? 14 days working in a row, 2 days off on one schedule, then 2 off the next schedule, then I worked for another 3 days and then I had another day off again. They guaranteed me those 4 days I asked for my birthday and to be with family, but they won‚Äôt guarantee that working up to or around it will be easy.

In general, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not a good idea to try working a second job while on your DCP. Be young and have fun. Seriously, my CP was a long time ago and I loved every second of it, even the tough parts. Trying to juggle a second schedule for yourself is going to be a nightmare anyway. Unless your Aerie manager is willing to work 150% around your Disney schedule (and I don‚Äôt know why they would be); just enjoy your internship. Aerie will always be there later if you‚Äôd like to try retail again, but you won‚Äôt always have the open time in your life to experience an internship.",1635724902

Lck aside they are top 4 in the world. If you count every single team that competes on a pro level they are far above just 1% they are the .01% of the 1%.   

There‚Äôs no way anybody should be out here calling them failures, they performed amazing despite not playing heavy meta picks. The reality is going into a tournament you either play within the meta and find success or don‚Äôt and play at a disadvantage. It‚Äôs called tournament meta reads and they got unlucky that this one was not in favor of them.    

On the opposite end of the bracket SKT1 got knocked out in the same position as GenG and went to five games with DWK. Yet no one is calling them a failure or upset that SKT also heavily drafts Azir which is one of the main issues they had with GenG or that SKT drafts Kenner and let‚Äôs canna run it down every time.   

To put it in terms of actual sports at the end of the day only one team hoist the trophy at the end of the year for every major league and sport. Not every team gets lebron or giannis. Not every team has Tom Brady. The fact is running deep at worlds is absolutely an amazing feat and even the losers need to be recognized for their effort. Harden doesn‚Äôt have a ring yet and may never get one but the dude ran Into the best team in the modern NBA at the time and brought them to 7 games and lost off of some bad shooting that happens every once in a while. But if you are faulting harden and don‚Äôt think he is one of the best scorers in nba history you are absolutely short selling the work he put in and his accomplishments.",1635724902

On recoveries/interception it almost always involves different sets of offensive players on the other side of the ball as you. And if you have a particularly good CB, the offense can adjust and get their n-count of interception opportunities closer to zero by not throwing their way. However, *interceptions thrown* should be much much more predictable, if you are measuring the same person in future periods (be it the next game or the next year). As a team you can adjust and throw less or throw different types of passes, but the modern game requires passing so the overall n count for passes thrown by that same player will usually be high enough to model.

"CompanyOfHeroes","t5_2rn3p","1:15 Your argument on RNG winning games in wrong. There is no RNG in Starcraft 2 and its not a predictable game. There are still multiple build orders and ways to play including cheese strats. Coh2's elements of RNG doesn't ruin the immediate 'balance' of the game. Rather players need to learn the skill that can compensate for RNG by consistently taking favourable odds. 

Example: Similar to poker. If a player takes all 50/50 odds, they will be less likely to win than say a player that only takes 70/30 odds. This is how high level players play. These players understand which fights to take and which fights not to take.

Odds can can be compensated for simply by moving a units/tanks closer. A mortar/artillery moving closer can take will land more accurate shots. A tank moving closer will land more shots. A 1v1 tank engagement can swing wildly either way but if you coordinate your other units such as tank snares units or anti-tank guns to attack at the same time then you have a higher chance of winning those odds. There's less RNG when you can coordinate a good amount of firepower in a small amount of time. 

Otherwise I do agree that coh2 should not be a esports 1v1 game. I have a hypothesis that Relic only let the balance team balance the game in exchange if they made 1v1's hyper-balanced and encouraged an esports scene so its not entirely the fault of the balance team. Although even if it isn't, I hate the idea that they're balancing the game for a minority of players where the majority of players play team games. Which is why I've been a vocal advocate of different balance changes for solo games and team games.

Back to the original point though. There are only a couple elements of RNG which break the game. Namely vehicle abandon instead of a kill, main gun critical, casemate TD first shot accuracy, and bouncing tank snares. Otherwise, the RNG has been toned down immensely since 3 years ago with first shot accurate call-ins, lowered main gun critical, and multiple shots in exchange for firepower (think B-4).

Don't get me wrong, I love this game but I'm not a fan of where the balance team has taken the game, they've introduced more bugs than fixed, and have made the game more un-fun than fun. I agree that embracing the chaos is the right thing to do instead of a hyperbalanced 1v1 and broken team games. I think this game would be a lot better if Relic balanced specifically for team games (where the majority of players are) then had a mod or game mode that had hyper-focused 1v1 esports game mode with the removal of certain RNG elements like vehicle abandonment. Instead they choose to appeal to a minority and subject the majority to the tyranny of the minority.",1635724903

would y'all ever date someone with the same name as

hmslusitania

I'm sorry for adding directly to a post but I went to a

wedding once where the groom's name was Loren and

the bride's name was Lauren and at the end the officiant

was all ""introducing Loren [surname] and Lauren

[surname], husband and wife"" and the entire assembled

lost it

ashavahishta

also sorry for adding on but at my high school there

was a Dominic and a Dominique who were dating and

everyone just called them ""Dom and Dommer"" which is

honestly the funniest shit ever

faerytale-wings

My parents are both named Terry (spelled differently)

but I'm pretty sure that's one of the reasons my mom

never changed her last name.

People would call and ask for Terry and child me would

be like ""boy or girl?"" And they'd panic and hang up. My

mom found this endlessly amusing.

flynn-flynnagan

#no one ever spelled their names right

either

#and of course people assumed they had

the same last name all the time

#so sorting mail or phone calls was

difficult

#1 also had a shocking number of people

just assume my name was Terry too?

#like??? #no #there are enough of them

exceeded the quota

#used up our allotment

#we can't have any more Terry's in the

family for another 3 generations

Why would you leave this GOLD in the tags??

faerytale-wings

Had to submit it to the tags for peer review

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","&gt;That's not the same thing.

How is it not the same thing?

&gt;Income tax is essentially a fee for the government providing you the service of allowing you to work.

You need to pay it whether or not the government does anything to support your work. So no, it's not. More to the point, it was introduced to pay for a war, so we could say that in part it funds defence, which allows you to work, live, play and do whatever you normally do.. Inheritance tax does too!

It's not as though income tax is spent only on supporting work after all.

&gt;The government isn't providing any service in exchange for that inheritance tax. It's unjustified. How the government (claims) chooses to spend it is besides the point.

Of course it is, it's providing defence, the courts, the police, the fire service all  of which protect your ability to hold on to any sort of wealth, it funds roads and infrastructure so that you can spend your money, and invests in education and training to ensure that there is an economy in which your inheritance has value. 

&gt;Your arguing that the concept of taxation is justified. I'm arguing that this specific form of taxation is not.

And I'm pointing out that that's daft, tax is just a funding stream, you are taxed on income, or profit, taxed again when you spend your money and then that money goes to someone else who is then taxed again on income or profit, and again when they spend it. You essentially pay tax when money changes hands, whether that's in exchange for a service, for goods, when you invest or when you work for it. It doesn't pay for a specific service related to the point at which it was taxed. Inheritance tax is the same, it pays for things people want and need and is levied when money changes hands. Look at how VAT margin schemes work, or the rather different and specialist approach to taxing second hand boats and cars, or horses for that matter, what service do you get when you pay VAT on a second hand car, then pay VED, then pay for tax on your insurance and then pay tax on the fuel you use? The money isn't segregated after all, it could be spent on almost anything by government, and rightly so.

&gt;You could apply your argument to literally anything. You walk on public footpaths? The government taxes you for every mile. You breathe the atmosphere? The government taxes you per litre of O2.

Sure. I mean there are taxes on fuel, on excise goods, on carbon emissions, on vehicle excise, taxes for living somewhere, taxes for buying a house, taxes on buying insurance (that you have to have...) as well as the usual taxes on the sale of goods (so VAT), on income by essentially any means. 

&gt;Your argument is a ridiculous strawman.

It really isn't. Yours however seems to be based on a completely bizarre understanding of taxation.",1635724905
"oddlyterrifying","t5_2yo6b","This is a shitty argument. You cannot produce food, on a scale to support any real human population, without using land. Even if you farm organically, reduce or eliminate beef and pork, etc. You have to use some land that is no longer natural habitat. The key to fighting climate change is fighting big oil, not farmers.

I would reccomend going for a more broader course though, as you can always specialise throughout your course, and being flexible in what you can do is handy.

Why is it that when workers talk about being abused or not liking their current situation, the response is to go and become the abuser? Why can't workers go to a job and expect to be treated fairly and be paid a living wage at the very least? Why do people expect the worker which has been abused to have the means to start up a company just to be the abuser?

"cars","t5_2qhl2","&gt; Not exactly sure what you need

An Excel spreadsheet of data where each row represents a car and each column is data about the car. You might also want to include an identifier so once you locate some bargains you can find them again. The car's detail page's URL would be ideal. Each row should have *complete* data. That means if you can't find visual conformation of the tech package, then you apply the default, which should be the most common configuration. Use 0 for ""no tech"" and 1 for ""has tech"". If ""has tech"" is less common then the default would be 0.

For the trim levels (Deka etc) you can represent them as text in the spreadsheet and I'll turn them into digits like 0, 1, 2... but I would need guidance. If Deka is the lowest trim, give it 0. What trim level is next highest? Represent it with a 1.

The number of observations you need goes up as the number of variables increases. It might be more effective use of your time to *somehow* come up with your own estimate that trim level X should be worth $1800 more than trim level Y. That's a bad example because you can probably find the actual trim level nearly all the time. Tech pack is different. Do you only want the car if the tech pack is there? Then there's no need to identify ""no tech"" vs ""has tech"", just filter out the ""no tech"" cars.

Is that helpful?

I could see chamber being a menace in matches where he happens to be played by the best aimer on the server since with him you'll be able to have your strong gun where the action is on defense. Normally, hard carry type players can only defend one site at a time so they're vulnerable when their team is on defense but chamber will allow them to cover both sites on D. 

The ult and pistol abilities are also strictly aim based to get value out of, which makes him a bit of a fragger in that regard. 

But duelist? Definitely not. For as effective as he is in being where he's needed on defense or moving around quickly on attack, and for how well his abilities arm him, he's got no tools that actually give him in edge in the actual fight. No entry oriented ability, nothing that works for one on one fights. Chamber has to rely on the support of his teammates or a ridiculous aim differential in order to effectively capitalize on his abilities. 

With aim differential, when played by a smurf far above the rest of the lobby, he might feel like an absolute oppressive demon that is everywhere and the situation is hopeless. But if his aim is on par with the lobby, he won't be able to just 'go off' on his own.",1635724907

"neutralnews","t5_2ql83","Love that the police reform debate has been hijacked by people trying to reinvent the wheel and ignore best practices that have already been established outside the United States. Lefties continually point to Camden NJ as a place where ""defunding the police"" was succesful. All that happened was that a new county-wide police force was created, which oh btw effectively busted the police union and lowered salaries and benefits ([source](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/12/camden-policing-reforms-313750)). If the police were corrupt, then maybe that's fine. But it's puzzling why self declared socialists continue to cite this example, where the city just submitted to a county police force, which is not exactly a new concept.

While the Minneapolis city council finds new ways to American exceptionalism police reform, the Hennepin county attorney grandstands without actually changing a damn thing. During the civil unrest following the murder of George Floyd, local and state police hunted down journalists and abused them in high definition. No charges have been filed. ([source](https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/10/05/bodycam-shows-minneapolis-officers-hunting-civilians-during-floyd-protests/))

Minneapolis and Hennepin county should clean house first instead of listening to Twitter activists for governing advice. The DA should file some indictments against the corrupt pigs that abused their power instead of jumping in front of the TV cameras whenever he can. Same goes for the Minnesota AG.

I've found that most members, including the leaders, strive to be Christlike in most instances. Obviously they don't always achieve it. 

I do agree that the worst form of motivation is using fear. The church does need to get away from threats of missing family and loved ones in the afterlife to keep people on the ""covenant path."" I've always found the Mormon version of Satan to resemble some sort of fan fiction like a comic book villain with the stories of the pre-existence and the temple depictions of him.

"overclocking","t5_2rfc8","Alright my man, let me know how it goes as I'm intrigued as to what the solution will be :)

I am actually in the process of re-tuning my 5600x curve as I tried once before but never got it really stable so now I reset to default and upgraded to latest BIOS.

I tried at first to do what others say: Set all cores at -30 and go from there with OCCT/prime 95 to test for failing cores. This turned out to be hard since this aggressive undervolt actually made my system so unstable that it would just power cycle without bsod and WHEA wouldn't even log the error.

After hours of trying I reverted to my first approach which was to set all cores to just -2 and see if it would hold up with just a slight undervolt which it did. OCCT rand for an hour which to me is good enough for now.

I then wanted to set all cores to -15 since it's half way so to speak of the max negative. But because of my experience before and trying to stabilize my system I felt confident that -20 would be possible too.  So I checked Ryzen Master to find my 2 ""best/fastest"" cores and set them to -2 and the rest of the cores to -20.

My reasoning is that my fastest cores will need the most voltage/least undervolt since I assume that they will be preferred for lightly threaded things and thus boost higher freqs and thus require more voltage to be stable.

Now I am just running OCCT for 30min sequences and adjusting all cores by +2 or -2 depending on if the core errors in OCCT. So I tried setting all cores and additional -2, check and see that core 2 is erroring. I've stabilized it by not having an offset at all and it's just at 0. (stock)

It seemed to run fine and tomorrow I'll continue this process of running 30 min intervals and altering my offsets until I find the lowest per core setting that is stable for 30 min in OCCT. When I have that I will just keep that setting and trial it for a day or so. See if it crashes unexpectedly in games or just browsing the web or simply idling.

If that works fine I will probably do a final test run overnight in OCCT/prime95 on mixed setting (large+small files) and If it holds then It'll be good enough for me.

So far, I can have very aggressive undervolts on my chip during load. Like in the ranges of -20 to -30 on all cores. But the problem is during no load or light loads where my offset is too big resulting in too low voltage and crashing the system.

It's a lot of work. But I hope I can get 4.7Ghz all core stable during load. It's my goal at least.",1635724908

So biggest competitive / business decision they had to make to give Bjerg a deadline because in the end they don't want to be screwed over.

**Buyers and sellers, use the link above to verify where to redeem codes to ensure 4K codes redeem properly.**

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a transaction has been completed, one user (buyer or seller) must create a comment (can be in-line with the deal discussion) tagging both `DCSbot` and the user they transacted with, for example  u\/DeadAlive92.
 * The u/ is required, and the username for the bot ***MUST BE TYPED NOT COPY/PASTED*** to work properly.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential transaction must be made via comments. Exchange codes/payment via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted buyers and sellers.  **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

 * If you believe you have been scammed, please [fill out this form](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/digitalcodesell&amp;subject=I%20Think%20I%20Have%20Been%20Scammed&amp;message=*%20Username%20of%20the%20person%20scamming%20me:%20%0D%0A%0D%0A*%20Link%20to%20the%20thread%20where%20the%20transaction%20originated:%20%0D%0A%0D%0A*%20Link%20to%20screenshots%20uploaded%20to%20imgur%20of%20my%20conversations%20with%20the%20scammer:%20%0D%0A%0D%0A*%20An%20explanation%20of%20the%20situation:%20).

He was quite ok shagging some other guy‚Äôs wife but couldn‚Äôt bring himself to take on an unemployed mother of four on a 24/7 basis. Didn‚Äôt see that one coming !  Your wife is going to learn more about the harsh reality of grown up life in the next couple of months than she has in her previous 30. It‚Äôs constantly staggering how little it sometimes takes to sway an otherwise good and sensible parent off of her perch. 

Don‚Äôt get sucked into doing the ‚ÄòPick me Dance‚Äô OP. Google it. You can never win doing this. You are undermining your own position at every turn. Basically, no one places any value on something that they can have for free and at any time. No one. You are in a very difficult situation. Four kids (DNA test them by the way). Your finances are already going to be stretched. Your wife will be in affair fog. There‚Äôs no reasoning with them when they are like this. She will be incapable of making any rational decisions. 

The first thing to go should be school. She can‚Äôt cope with the temptation there and, if you guys are going to split up, she won‚Äôt have the time or money to be able to continue. So. Stop it now. Be prepared for the ‚ÄòIve made a terrible mistake‚Äô approach. Once the affair fog lifts, she will quickly realise that she is up the creek without a paddle. She will want to get back to the previous ‚Äòstatus quo‚Äô. Sadly, this won‚Äôt be the end of her extramarital affairs though OP. She‚Äôs got a taste for it now and her AP will renew his interest if someone else is going to be paying the bills. You didn‚Äôt deserve any of this shit. Good luck.",1635724911

MacKerricher park in Fort Bragg is also great if you want to camp right next to the beach and the Mendocino forest is beautiful. Careful in Clear Lake and late at night in Fort Bragg though, my friends and I had a car creep up on us, we think with the intention to abduct us, when we rather stupidly decided to go to the beach around 1am. The cell signal in both places also sucks, so be careful with that and especially on the winding road between Willits and Fort Bragg. No signal and in some places a sheer drop on one side all surrounded by forest. If you end up in that area I do recommend visiting the botanical gardens in Fort Bragg and the Point Arena lighthouse.

Unfortunately, your post has been removed.

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

You can rank every hand in your range according to these criteria and if you need 25 bluff hands say, you just take the best 25 according to your ranking.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","1) How would you see less people go into liberal arts degrees in college? I would argue that cost is more a factor than specific major in the job market. It‚Äôs wild that we‚Äôve come to a point in society where a bachelor‚Äôs degree has simultaneously little value and yet is necessary for success in the workforce. It has little value b/c consistent reports from employers state that college does not do an adequate job prepping students for the workforce while simultaneously holding that a college degree is the floor for most job applications. 

2) I wouldn‚Äôt say that wages would crash thru the floor but I imagine that ‚Äúwages would fall,‚Äù would be an understatement. We‚Äôve both said our piece here.

3) Police often take criminal justice degrees in addition to police academy trainings. Some aspiring police officers also have concentrations in social work mainly due to the enormity of police responsibilities. We‚Äôve defunded social services and thrown the police at the problem instead and the police tend to struggle in those areas. Areas such as domestic violence situations, drug abuse, homelessness, mental health crises etc. 

Social workers are another area whereby college degrees are required but the pay is abysmal. Training is required to have the empathy and the mental framework needed to properly help people. Commonly social workers study psychology and unfortunately psychology degrees are a dime a dozen. 

EMS and paramedics need anatomical and pharmacological knowledge in order to best care for patients. Some localities require bachelors and some only associates. I‚Äôm not sure about you but I‚Äôd like a person saving me from a gunshot wound to be skilled enough to pass collegiate level bio and anatomy courses.

To your point, fundamentally these essential careers are civil servant in nature and thus fall victim to poor conditions and low wages. However these careers are fundamentally and primarily government in nature which prevents an ability to argue for higher wages. EMS Specifically only has unions in less than 5 states. They often aren‚Äôt included in firefighter negotiation agreements and set up GoFundMes for equipment. John Oliver did an illuminating special on the profession. I didn‚Äôt really learn anything (I have friends who are EMS) but if you have a spare 15min maybe you‚Äôd learn something. 

4.) I think people should do CBAs but at the same time I wish the system wasn‚Äôt so unfair. We‚Äôve created an economy whereby, as stated, college education is sold as a necessity but sold as a luxury. And the interest rates are exorbitant. I don‚Äôt understand the idea of having extraordinarily high interest rates on loans are almost impossible to discharge in bankruptcy. 

College was never meant to be so expensive in the first place. Government backed loans did lead to an explosion in costs however the core idea of public education financing was the fed was going to cover Pell grants and the like and states were meant to cover the rest. Truman had a report crafted for affordable college back in the ‚Äò40s and we‚Äôre still arguing over it now.",1635724912

**Workers and Resources: Soviet Republic** - early access 1950s-1980s Soviet style city builder, probably my favorite right now. Really great micromanagement options (i.e. you can turn off management of power/fuel or early education for a simpler experience). Stays relatively light on the politics of the era. Bonus points if you love logistics management.

**Kenshi** - mostly a squad based rpg focusing on real time rts style combat, but carries some decent town/base builder elements. Same kind of vein as RimWorld, the world of kenshi is a brutal one, and losing can be fun. Pretty small dev team, can be a little janky

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","if the boxer did kick him in the nuts, he would be disqualified and lose.

if he instead chooses not to make an illegal move, and the final bell rings and no one got knocked out, then it would be a draw. thats the analogy here.

the simplest way to understand it is, in order to win, you *must* checkmate the opponents. thats just what the game is and the definition of winning is, just like connecting 4 checkers is how you win connect four. its not three or five. the rules say four. 

you cannot win without checkmating. there is no checkmate if there is no check. these stalemates occur when the king is not in check. no check, so it cant be checkmate, so cant be a winner.

its on the responsibility of the guy who delivered the stalemate to not do that, and make moves that would result in a checkmate instead.",1635724914

""The ruling confirms The Hague District Court's positive view of investment arbitration and orders which are rather unconventional in such arbitration.

It remains to be seen whether the phrase 'third time lucky' will apply to Ecuador in view of its earlier attempts. However, the court seems to want the parties to focus on remedying the environmental damage rather than pursuing their legal battle. In its judgment, the court stated that it was difficult for it to comprehend that the parties were willing to spend such a large amount of money on legal proceedings when this money could have been used to address the real issue ‚Äì the environmental damage.""",1635724916

"asexuality","t5_2qv0q","Probably the Twelfth Doctor in *Doctor Who*. There was no hanky panky in the TARDIS for the classic show, but the modern era all had various forms of romance/implied sex in the show. Then Capaldi comes in and kinda makes it clearly that he'd not be kissing any of his companions, there'd be no romantic feelings between him and Clara (later Bill and Nardole). Now, the Doctor DEEPLY loved Clara... But it wasn't a romantic love to me. And it just kinda spoke to me, or maybe it was just the way I read the show as I was coming to terms with my own asexuality. 

I'm trying to think of any more, and I really can't. I mainly watch sci-fi and superhero shows, but really, I think all media operates under the belief that all relationships have to have a romantic or sexual aspect to them. AND it has to be THE most important part of it. I don't really see a lot of people like me in what I consume. Yelena Belova's creator said she's asexual, so I hope the Marvel films stick to that and don't force some dumb relationship on her, just because.",1635724919

"Coronavirus","t5_2x4yx","&gt;No it doesn‚Äôt, because the comparison is being made between vaccinated uninfected and vaccinated infected individuals. You cannot just extrapolate out from that a comparison between vaccinated uninfected and unvaccinated infected individuals.

Yes, that's what I'm trying to do. The difference between Table 6 and Table 7 is previously infected individuals, about 5% of the new Table 7. For the placebo arm, these new people are the unvaccinated infected (possibly unvaccinated + missing data), and there were 7 new cases of reinfected individuals. For the vaccine arm, the original Table 6 had 8 cases \*total\* over a much larger population. 

So I am trying to compare placebo arm of (Table 7 - Table 6) = unvaccinated infected, with the vaccine arm of Table 6, which is the vaccinated uninfected individuals. Taking into account the large N difference between them, it seems to me that (recent) vaccine is more effective than (possibly long ago) infection at preventing confirmed new cases of Covid. 

RE: the zero protection statement for T/B, I think there was a later analysis of a larger dataset that showed modest protection instead of 0, but I can't find it later. Otherwise beta just seems very evasive, which is consistent with data from Qatar and other places with respect to the Pfizer rollout also.",1635724919

My piercer said if it didn‚Äôt heal after this change (we already tried the body safe longer plastic barbell and that seemed to annoy it too) then she was going to remove it and chalk it up to a weird piercing error and let it heal. 

It was swelling today and I couldn‚Äôt get in contact with her so then I went to change it to a nugget bar myself and couldn‚Äôt get it through. It seemed like the inside of the hole was way less healed than last time. So I left jewelry out AND THEN I read all these articles saying never to remove it if it‚Äôs infected and now I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs infected and rejecting. Help?

Maybe it could be tied to certain things like obtaining certain ranks in pvp or have some grind to obtain like the win x amount of matches in y game mode like the mounts. Nothing crazy but maybe make it kinda like the pvp and armor version of grinding out a relic weapon where it still takes some effort to acquire and holds some prestige.

I can tell you that my daughter didn‚Äôt become gay because she chose to engage in orgies and sexual misconduct, in fact she is a virgin. She‚Äôs Gay because that‚Äôs what she has always been and as her parent. I saw differences in her from the very onset of her personality. So by that logic God abandoned an innocent virgin girl to homosexuality as early as 11, which is when she first admitted that she was attracted to girls. Does that make sense to you? Paul is talking about people who chose sexual misconduct become worse as a result. Not innocent children that find that they do not fit the gender expectations.",1635724922

"CanadianInvestor","t5_347i1","You said the processors are not produced by Apple. Which is wrong. There are two steps to producing a CPU, engineering the chip architecture, then shipping that to a fabricator to manufacture. Apple DOES engineer the chips, so you are wrong.

I honestly do not think you even know the difference between the ARm instruction set, and the ARM company. Apple has a license to arm instruction set inperpetuity. ARM had NOTHING to do with these chip.

Secondly you said ARM has been around for a long time. This is a pointless statement. X86 instruction set has been been around for a long time too.....it doesnt mean that Intel or AmD could not release a faster x86 chip than the other.

Apple has designed the fastest arm instruction set laptop CPU's available that are blowing everyone away.

You‚Äôll need to start somewhere so start there. Take some time to learn how to change the oil in your parents car. You‚Äôll build experience from there. I started with a deep socket set and a 1/2 drive.  I pulled the heads from my 69 Camaro with just that.

I sat in the floor space between the passenger seat and rear seats. I was out of the car like instantly and ready to go. Both front seats were injured pretty badly. Broke hip,wrist and collarbone on driver. Right arm nearly shattered on passenger . Consider myself lucky.

"PS3","t5_2qhhw","I recommend purchasing an adapter and use pretty much any controller (i.e. PS4, PS5, Xbox, Nintendo, etc.) you want. The adapters let whatever controller you use work like the PS3 controller, including the PS button, except no pressure sensitive buttons as that's only a PS3 controller exclusive.

Adapters that work with the PS3:

* [Brook Wingman XE](https://www.brookaccessory.com/detail/87495367/) -- rumble, sixaxis, &amp; recovery mode work.
* [Mayflash MAGIC-S PRO](https://www.mayflash.com/product/showproduct.php?id=4) -- rumble works (if using PS5 controller it will only work wired), sixaxis works (doesn't work with PS5 controller), no recovery mode.
* [Mayflash MAGIC-NS](https://www.mayflash.com/product/showproduct.php?id=30) -- Same functions as the MAGIC-S PRO above.

If you do go this route make sure you keep the firmware updated on the adapter as they will implement further features and fix bugs if necessary.

I use the Brook Wingman XE &amp; Mayflash MAGIC-S Pro with a PS5 controller. If you want full compatibility the Brook adapter is best since it's works with rumble, sixaxis, and you can get into recovery mode with it so you don't need a PS3 controller.",1635724927

The zones and aesthetic were awesome. The raids were some of the best still to this day. Class design was at/near it's peak (pruning started post WoD) if you liked deeper, more complex rotations like sub rogue. Multistrike was a thing and was really cool. The vengeance mechanic for tanks made them absolutely bonkers. Class mastery was added in cata and further refined in MoP. Challenge dungeons were added and were the precursor to m+. If you enjoyed mass farming mobs, you could buy luck pots and farm to your heart's content. Nat Pagle rep for waterstrider, there was an actual farm you could tend to. World rarespawns with cool drops worth camping like the xp potions, boe weapons for leveling, the cool dino mounts. Legendary questline for the cloak. Flex raids were added and you no longer had strict limitations when forming a group.

For me personally, I truly miss the class design of that time and the raids. The zones still feel magical to me and I love just flying around and seeing everything. The music is also really good. Siege of Orgrimmar was one of the coolest raids ever created but a lot of people probably look back at it with disgust because it was the active raid tier for over a year I believe. Throne of Thunder was awesome. The giant dino island was really cool and a pleasant surprise to stumble onto. Timeless Isle was new as a concept and really cool to explore.

When classic servers were first announced, my first thought was ""holy shit, I might get to play MoP again?"" but now seeing how they're handling it, I fully expect them to take the EQ route and just relaunch classic vanilla servers over and over again as the old servers progress onto newer expansions and player numbers dwindle.",1635724927

Edit: I iterate the ‚Äòwhite‚Äô part because black and brown people suffer from the same mentality that has plagued humanity for centuries..the same mentality that plagues Trans people

So yes, to answer your question:

"writing","t5_2qh2n","I have two things I always suggest.

First, you're not trying to take a photograph. You don't have to describe everything exactly as you see it--don't write out *every* detail. Try instead to create a sense of a place. Everyone's going to imagine it differently, so what parts are important? What do they really need to get right? And for the stuff they don't--what's the sense you want them to have of the place? How do you want them to feel?

Second, don't just focus on sight. You're not drawing. You're not directing. You're not limited to one sense. Engage *all* of them.

My favorite writing exercise is to take the 54321 therapy technique and turn it into writing. Write a paragraph with five things your character sees, four things they hear, three things they can touch, two things they can smell, and one thing they can taste. Then, if you're feeling really daring, try using less-obvious senses: sense of time, sense of where your body is, sense of speed, etc.

You probably won't/shouldn't write lists like that in a book--in narration it's better to be more variable, or attach one sense or another to certain characters to give your points of view some differentiation. But it's a great exercise to sharpen your description skills.",1635724928

"AusFinance","t5_2uo3q","I cannot believe that you're actually arguing against countercyclical monetary policy. Would you complain about central banks lowering interest rates in response to bubbles popping in the stock market?

Also, you're completely wrong about what the RBA does in response to house prices lowering. If house prices go down and the RBA thinks that that will have an impact on the wider economy, then lowering the cash rate is a good thing. If the RBA reckons that it won't, then it won't lower the cash rate at all.

By the way, you're using rent seeking against the wrong level of government. Property owners rent seek through supply restrictions at a state and local level, not through the RBA. How the fuck is conducting monetary policy properly rent-seeking? Rent seeking is where a group attempts to increase their share of wealth without creating any new wealth, through regulatory capture (zoning, tariffs and subsidies). The RBA isn't helping anyone rent-seek but state and local governments are.

Are you suggesting that the cash rate should've been higher since between 2008-2017 and during COVID?",1635724928

We are studying what other countries are doing, and we will learn from their successes and mistakes, and also learn from our own successes and mistakes, and we will implement a plan to help us transition into a covid resilient nation that takes into account our unique situation. We need to be vigilant. We only got to where we are because of how hard we have worked, so we cannot squander what we have been given. We need to be #sgunited in order to reach our goal of being a covid resilient nation. This is an unprecedented situation, and the next few weeks will be quite critical. The MMTF is keeping a close watch on the situation, and we will not hesitate to act when there is a need to. We know it has been a frustrating time for everyone, but we ask for your patience as we do all we can to make sure that Singapore transitions into a covid resilient nation.

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","Gray rock treatment. Present them with a boring smooth wall of dullness anytime you engage with them personally; providing as little information or reaction as possible. When you engage with them; you have become comfortably numb. You just can‚Äôt be fucked to care about them or anything they do or say. 

If you have to depend on them to do something; ensure you ask for it in ways that come from a place of authority/produce an audit trail. Asking in the presence of others - displaying the unnaturally flat affect that you reserve for this person alone - is super effective. Be professional but project coldness. (Expect to be let down too and for them to blame you. Account for this in your timelines). 

If they need help from you - you can make receiving the help as slow and painful and difficult as you want, with lots of documentation and training and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why you can‚Äôt get this‚Äù to build more audit trail that you tried to help them and they don‚Äôt seem to be able to learn. 

(While I expect I imagined it; I have taken training that felt malicious to me by way of treating me like an idiot. How much fun could you have INTENTIONALLY designing malicious training? Might be a business model)

Never respond to any attacks they make on your character, except when they say something nasty in the presence of others. Then, act slightly surprised like you just noticed they were there, and say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I wasn‚Äôt listening - could you repeat yourself? ‚Äú

If you need to talk about this person or vent or whatever, get a therapist. Do not invest a single calorie of emotional energy discussing this person with any coworker beyond the minimum required to do the job. To speak their name is like summoning Beetlejuice. 

Also, I suggest AGAINST personally engaging with HR - they are there to protect the company; and I‚Äôve watched them protect the guilty and fire the innocent. I think it is better to avoid their offices yourself, and instead, help your friend find new opportunities for management visibility that will help HIM make new friends in HR.",1635724929

My mental health finally got to the breaking point last year and my FP managed to get me to get on medication (I still am confused how he managed that.) I found a great doctor, and he found a combo that works for me. He has zero issues with switching dose or meds if I need. I feel like it has helped A LOT, it has helped with regulating my emotions.

"Hardtailgang","t5_2s1z1m","For refrence I'm switching from a kona lava dome with a 68* HTA, 120mm fork, and a considerably shorter reach.

For my first ride on this bike I did about 9 miles and 1500 feet of climbing. The first things I noticed before even getting on the bike is how blantantly long the front end is - it's like an elephant in the room. It's also pretty heavy when loading on and off the rack and it sits really low like a chopper on flat ground.

For climbing I was expecting it to suck because its weight and I'm used to more xc type geometry. But climbing it honestly felt great. I had a tendency to be lazy on the climbs and just hang in the saddle and it does fine and doesn't feel heavy. Even for technical climbing it does great if you stand up and get it. 1500 feet of climbing was no more difficult than my previous aluminum hardtail. 

Going downhill it's a big stable tank. I'm not sure if its the improved fork or if steel is really that compliant but this bike is seriously smooth - I didn't think I would notice a difference. It also feels very planted on chunky stuff and I'd sometimes forget I was on a hardtail. Once you're up to speed the weight isn't really an issue and I think it helps the bike feel more stable. I did one pretty steep and chunky rock slab and and I shifted my weight more over the fork and it did its thing. Felt way more comfortable than my previous 68* 120mm front end. 

I think the first thing I'm going to change is shortening the chainstay with the sliding dropouts. I have mine 3/4ths of the way back and the wheel base feels extremely long and not nearly as playful as reviews made it seem. I also sized down from a large to a medium and this frame feels bigger than the previous. 

All in all I'm very happy with it. I have to get used to it still but later this week I'm going to spend some more time on flowy Jump trails as well as do a little slab hunting to see what it will do.",1635724931

Am i the minority here? Minjae bohyun is my otp. Their final scene at the cafe was just sooo beautiful. I have no idea how many times i repeated that scene. I can even memorize the critical conversation including the timing of the bgm. I am that obsessed.

Watching this show when i'm in my 30s give me more understanding of every cast in the show, even the least favorite people minyoung and joohwi. I don't justify their acts. But i can see why they choose to do what they do. For me, the most frustating character is homin. But even to homin i can understand his actions. For me what he does to bohyun at ep 14-15 is gaslighting, but i can see why he did that, and i can't be happier when bohyun can see through that and fight the wavering emotion towards him, which is no longer love, but just an affection (?) sympathy (?). Like when you're feeling sad when your friend is sad and want to hug her and cry with her. 

Minjae is one of kind. And a really cool guy. Undeniable that his charm in the show is when he's being straightforward, transparent, and literally affectionate towards bohyun. So bohyun is big part of that charm. Sometimes i wonder, without bohyun, will he be able to bring that side out? And without that side of him will the other girls, especially Hyeim be that sure of him to the point of saying she's 100% sure when they only have one date?

What i love about this show is how close the cast are and how i can see that they are all good people. They said it themselves over times that all of them are good people. And as a woman who love to cheer on other incredible women, i'm cheering for both bohyun and coco to shine even brighter and find their happiness and contentment.",1635724932

"Naruto","t5_2quts","Tsunade still would have run out of chakra and died were it not for Orochimaru's intervention. If Sakura gets bisected and runs out of chakra trying to heal herself then she's finished. Given that her endurance isn't Uzumaki-tier, that's a real possibility.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention simple logic, if you cut someone in half, even if they're still alive they basically lose unless they have a means of attacking you without moving. Sakura has no such means, therefore cutting her in half across the chest level is a loss in itself since it puts her at the mercy of finishing moves or at best she'll just age to death or run out of chakra. It would take quite a lot of chakra for her to regenerate her entire lower half, while 6G Lee can just stomp on her neck and remove it from her body.

&amp;#x200B;

This condition wouldn't be easy to meet, but it shows that bisecting Sakura would already set her up for a fatal condition (killing blow, chakra depletion, death by accelerated aging from SoA100).

&amp;#x200B;

If Sakura could summon Katsuyu, she could have a chance at negating the chances of remaining bisected, however it would be very hard to use the Summoning Jutsu before Lee speedblitzes her. Also, summoning Katsuyu apparently takes up a fuck ton of chakra, which Sakura would need for regeneration since she *will* be beaten senseless.",1635724932

In other words, the 8k games is where they truly gather information on the hero, what items people are buying, that they could later nerf, the skill builds people are going, that they could target, for instance, if they want to reduce how early she becomes strong, etc

For the vast majority of people, even you - reading this comment right now - yes you - Valve doesn't actually care whether you think Marci is OP or not. Valve gathers the data first and foremost from pro dota, but since there's none of that around right now, they look at what's happening in the next best thing - pro dota's public games.",1635724933

I see the ""poop in front of others"" as the first step: let's forcibly break people of the first major social training given in life: toilet habits. 

Once you've forced people into learning not giving a shit about giving a shit, the arbitrary rules of modern society are so transparently invented, I think it's understandable why the released often exhibit a range of problems conforming to an entirely different world outside.

The slave wage labor is full on bullshit. The incarcerated should be able to choose to work or not and any labor should pay into a release fund for the worker to get set up in life on release. Working for for-profit companies in exchange for concessionary pennies is bullshit.",1635724935

I‚Äôve re-potted it only once into a larger container sometime in July and not since. I haven‚Äôt added any new soil or anything else since I read that you shouldn‚Äôt re-pot when it‚Äôs colder out.

I live in Massachusetts so it‚Äôs definitely gotten colder - especially the past month. With this temp change I‚Äôve also noticed more leaves falling off! Also, I rarely open my windows and normally have fans going instead, but have opened it a few times lately. 

For more info that might help diagnosis it - I bought flowers from Star Market (affordable local grocery store, nothing fancy) and put them in a vase next to this plant. About 10 days later (today) I threw them out since they were starting to smell, even though they still looked nice. But they definitely had started to stink and die! Could this perhaps be the reason for this plant mold/fuzz or whatever it is?

Please let me know how I can cure him :,( and if it‚Äôs possible to do so! 

Also - if anyone knows what this plant is called, I‚Äôd love to know too so I can research more about the care and keeping!

&gt;[111.2k words, science-fiction, post-apocalyptic, futuristic, dystopian, GLBTQ fiction]
&gt;
&gt;From hunters to hunted... 
&gt;
&gt;It‚Äôs almost one hundred years since The Great Turning, the catastrophic meteor strike that changed the world forever. Russell Owens is a recently discharged New North Americas Army sniper who only wants to return to his home just outside of Yellowstone to resume life with his gentle husband, Ted. Russell doesn‚Äôt want to re-up and hates that he had to kill for a living. 
&gt;
&gt;Zola Wright is the most skilled assassin the NNAA has ever had. She was tricked into re-upping‚Äîonce. When the burned-out Red is sent to find Russell to talk him into returning, what her commanding officer doesn‚Äôt realize is that she‚Äôs not coming back. Her conscription time is up, and she wants out. She‚Äôs also reluctantly falling for Russell. 
&gt;
&gt;Now the sniper and the assassin are the ones being hunted, on the run from the army they just finished serving. Their former CO has secrets he‚Äôll kill to keep. But Russell and Zola have more in common than their killing skills. And when Russell and Ted both fall for Zola, she knows their only option is to stand and fight together for the happiness and peace they yearn for‚Äîor die trying.

"Homebrewing","t5_2qj8u","Because you said you are holding the cider for only 3-5 days, I assume it is still (uncarbonated) cider.

For still cider, any recycling symbol #1 (PET/PETE) plastic bottle will be fine. I would not use other types of plastic. If you look at fruit juices and other acidic beverages in the store, you will see that most of them are sold in PET/PETE ... for a reason.

PET bottles work great for bottle conditioning cider too.

Soda bottles (0.5L, 1L, 2L, and 3L, and other bottles that accept the same cap) work great.

As far as beer bottles, I definitely recommend avoiding twist off bottles and sticking with either pry off (the type you need a bottle opener) or EZ cap (aka flip top). IMO you can't reliably cap twist cap bottles.

&gt; I'm not sure how I can seal them afterwards

With [crown caps](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/120-count-crown-beer-bottle-caps), using a [wing capper](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/northern-brewer-bottle-capper) or a [bench capper](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/super-agata-bench-capper).

&gt; which I will probably be bringing to a wedding 

Plastic bottles may come off seeming janky, depending on how sophiticated the wedding is. Are you trying to make the wedding bottles look nice? If so, you can consider contacting some local craft brewers and seeing if they are willing to sell you some of their crown-cappable 750 ml bottles.",1635724935

Let‚Äôs say an average employee and a team leader get different benefits. The team leader is paid $20k more and has more holidays.  
If the wage is increased for the employee to match that of the team leader, nothing has been actually taken away from the team leader, their situation is the same. But the value of being a team leader has dropped. It makes no difference that they still get the extra holidays.",1635724938

I wonder if it's because we have to hand the items to the customer so there is no picture proof. Because of that customer, I take a picture of the order at the door BEFORE I knock or press that ""confirm you've arrive"" button. Nothing like that has happened since so Fingers Crossed. 

Btw- what area are you in? I went back into my Google Maps Timeline to find that exact customer's address so I know who to avoid. I also recommend reporting them directly to Support, not just in the ""report fraud"" section. I feel like that it factors more, if Support can notate their account.

"indonesia","t5_2qkte","Sebelum reformasi dan desentralisasi, kebanyakan objek wisata di Lombok fokus ke candi candi di Hindu Lombok. Kenapa begitu.

1. Karena jalan2 di luar Lombok Barat sangat jelek. Lombok Barat banyak Candi Bali karena dulu dijajah oleh rajah Bali.
2. Karena sentralisasi tang buat perencanaan wisata adalah orang Jawa. Orang Jawa suka lihat Candi2,

Kalau jaman order baru turis, asing atau lokal, pasti ke Taman Narmada, Pura Meru, Pura Suranadi.

Karena desentralisasi orang kuasa sekarang orang lokal (ie orang sasak), karena itu mereka fokus ke wisata ""halal"" dan wisata alam.  Mereka mau lestarikan Lombok sebagai wisata Syariah seperti Sumatra Barat / Aceh. Tetapi 15% penduduk Lombok adalah orang Bali. Kalau orang Bali konsentrasi di Ampenan-Mataram-Narmada

Kalau mau makan makanan khas Sasak, harus ke Rumah Makan Suranadi.  Restoran ini sudah 40+ tahun.  Surandi adalah tempat hiburan untuk orang lokal Lombok.  Ada hotel Suranadi, hotel itu dibangun 1932 untuk pesanggrahan pemerintah Kolonial. Hotelnya ada spring fed swimming pool.",1635724939

In natural terms,  the qualitative side of consciousness plugged in as a causal player (e.g., how else could we refer to it?). In explanatory terms, however, it basically divides out--it is never really captured in language. So, an alien robot anthropologist is left with the nagging question of why these humans are making odd-sounding claims about something that appears to be supernatural (e.g., like claims of free will, or the Divinity of Christ, or seeing auras, or out-of-body experiences, or near death experiences, or seeing ghosts, etc.)--it all seems highly unlikely, but they claims to see something which is not really captured by symbols and measurement apparatuses and so on. So, the skeptical robot anthropologist will turn out to be named ""Churchland."" The credulous robot anthropologist, on the other hand, will still have a mystery.",1635724940

"farcry","t5_2st42","I haven't played 1, 2, or Blood Dragon yet, so I can't comment on those. New Dawn is a direct sequel to 5, but other than that the games are separate enough that there isn't really a required order to play through each game. You'll miss a few easter eggs if you don't play in release order, but nothing important story-wise.

3 and 4 are the best two I've played. 3 has the better characters and story, but 4 has a better map and improved gameplay and overall I'd say they're equally good. 

Primal is also very good IMO, but it's very different from the other games in the series. It still feels like a Far Cry game, but with a lot more of an emphasis on stealth and survival. 

5 does have a few minor improvements over 4 (HUD/UI, weapon/vehicle customization, guns for hire, and more freedom to explore the whole map from the start of the game), but it has two pretty big issues that prevent it from being as good as it could have been. Your character in 5 doesn't talk at all, and when you get to certain points in the story the game will just decide that you are doing a specific mission right now and there's nothing you can do about it, even if you were in the middle of something else.

New Dawn isn't bad if you can get it on sale for $20 or less and you pretend it's a DLC for 5, but it's definitely the worst in the series. It introduces levels for enemies and weapons, which means that not all guns can kill all enemies (at least in a reasonable amount of bullets) because higher level enemies have ridiculously strong armor. And your character still doesn't talk.

6 fixes the two biggest problems I had with 5, but it keeps a toned-down version of the levels system from New Dawn and the ending doesn't feel like the other games in the series because it doesn't give you the usual choice. You can counter the levels by equipping armor-piercing rounds and hitting headshots, but it's still kind of annoying especially early in the game when you haven't unlocked armor piercing rounds for all of your guns. And it replaces the usual skill tree with gear that unlocks the skills if you have it equipped. The enemy NPCs are dumber than they used to be too. In the older games, you had to be stealthy at least for a bit each time you attacked an enemy base. If you were spotted before you disabled the alarms, then it would get a lot harder. In 6, the enemies are slower to react, which makes ""just run in and shoot everyone lol"" a viable strategy most of the time. The checkpoints, tanks, and anti-aircraft cannons were pretty good additions to the game though, and the story is a lot better than 5 was.",1635724940

It's gotten well past the point of ""do what's right"" in customer service in the past few years.

There has to be a point where the barista/customer service rep/cashier etc can say ""I'm sorry, but I am unable to do that at this time."" 

From a customer perspective, I will be 1000% more likely to come back to your store if I see management back up their employees in these types of situations and tell the customer that they are not giving them what they want.  There is no reason to dump out a 5 minute old pot of coffee because it's not ""fresh enough"". If it was getting close to time to change it, sure ""make the moment right"" and do it as a courtesy but it's not remotely acceptable for a customer to feel like they deserve to have an entire URN of fresh coffee made each time they come in.",1635724941

I had relationships with men that involved love manly too little too late on their ends. It took *years* to realize I had to work on myself, and love myself before I could ask anyone to love me. And then one day I met a man that loves everything about me. Now a lot of people say this, but this man loves me no matter what I look like. Fat, gaining 60+ more lb's, losing that 60 pounds.

A lot of good suggestions already in this thread but a few others I'll include are:

Ronin, Superhot, Samurai Gunn 1 &amp; 2, Duck Game, Move or Die, Nidhogg 1 &amp; 2

Other games that aren't all technically 1 hit-die but require fast reflexes:

Hyper Light Drifter, Enter the Gungeon, Nuclear Throne, UBERMOSH series, Devil Daggers, FONOTICA",1635724944

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","The difficulty is assessing your skill relative to the bootcamp.  There's a sense that paying the money will give you the skill you need.  You have one advantage which is you already know some programming.  Maybe having it part-time also helps as it's spread out over time, when most bootcamps seem crammed.

However, you could ask the question is going to college and majoring in CS worth the money either?  A good percentage of students do make it through college, but there's always the opportunity to switch majors if things aren't going well.  There's no guarantee being a CS major will mean you will complete the degree, and there's no guarantee graduating with a degree means you get a job or have a solid understanding of things like web development (in fact, you probably won't get that).

So, in a sense, it's like asking the same question whether college provides similar guarantees?  Is it worth the price?

If your primary goal is to be better than most non-developers, you're already there.  Most non-developers lack any programming skill at all.  This isn't like math or English where non-math majors or non-English majors are supposed to have some level of proficiency.  Most people who don't take programming pretty much have no proficiency.",1635724944

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","**Imperium: Classics/Legends** features table-based AI opponents that all behave differently for each civilization i.e. the Roman bot will play like a typical Roman player, while the Persian bot will follow a typical Persian playstyle and so on for the 16 different civs in the game.

It does all this through a simple lookup table that you check top to bottom when the bot activates a card. The first row that matches that card is what the bot does. It sounds complicated but in practice you've memorized this table halfway through your first game.

More interestingly it uses the actual cards in the game as input, not a separate/preset bot deck. With Imperium being a deckbuilder, this means the 'touchpoints' of the game stay intact. If I let the bot buy a lot of green cards, and the 'green action' is to steal my resources, it's going to steal a ton of my stuff. There's actually a point to denying and countering what the bot wants to do, as well as keeping track of what it's ""trying to do"" just like with other players.

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","This was my reasoning as well.  There are some monsters in the monster manual that say ""this creature does not need to eat, drink, or breathe"" or something similar to that effect.  I figured if it didn't have that in its block, it would need to do those things.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Dang. I totally clicked on this story expecting you to be asking for some entitled bs like demanding babysitting 3 times a week when your sibling had cancer and surgeries or something.  

NTA. To me it sounds like they've invested so much time into taking care of your sibling that they have become far more emotionally invested in them than in you.  It's sad.  It's emotional neglect.  Not even remembering their first grandbaby's name is extreme.  

I think ""caring more"" about one child over the other, because that child genuinely needs more help, is a trap some parents fall into unless they make a conscious effort to fight it.  In all other aspects of our lives it is only reasonable to care more about stuff you put more time and effort into, but it is cruel to do this to children.  Just as it is not your sibling fault they have a chronic illness, it is not your fault either, and you still deserve to be loved the same as if your sibling had been healthy.

I'm sorry your parents don't love you as much as your sibling and if you feel mentally healthier not talking to them, I think it's quite reasonable to do so. They probably will never understand, but that doesn't mean you are wrong.

Good luck and I'm sure you will do better with your own children, whether you have more or not.",1635724949

Patients don‚Äôt care if you step out to  look up something or even or tell them that I want to ‚Äúdo some homework‚Äù and call them in a few days with a plan. You are fine. Keep a list of questions you have for yourself to look up when you have time, read notes from your consultants to see how they approach things, and keep a list of patients who either have an unexpected outcome or present with something baffling.

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","I would recommend the opposite of the oven as suggested by someone else: Stick them in the freezer.

The freezer should shrink the parts enough that they should slide together much easier, even without lube.  I would still recommend some sort of lube or anti-seize on the joints though.

Big thing to note, is that when they come up to room temperature, they are probably going to be effectively permanently connected.  The only way to get them apart would be to freeze them again.  This is why i recommended lube above, it will hopefully prevent some form of cold welding between the pieces and allow you to separate them once re-frozen.

Dark Souls lore is very intricate and both 1 and 3 had some amazing story to tell once you scratch the surface.

Call it hate all you want but personal choice for no good reason has a non-zero chance of harming himself or others in a pandemic in which we have the evidence to show that most people SHOULD get the vaccine.

Late to the thread today, caught out by the clocks changing.

Watching Tomoya drinking, smoking and playing pachinko hurts. 

That whole pre-OP sequence is so bleak. 

Maybe the illusory world can brighten things up? 

[Never mind](https://imgur.com/a/l6pKAzX) 

Sanae's persistence pays off and Tomoya agrees to go on a trip with her and Akio and presumably Ushio. 

Akio and Sanae left, before Tomoya arrived, leaving 5 year old Ushio alone. What if Tomoya hadn't shown up? They literally have first hand experience of the dangers of leaving a child that young unattended. 

Unless I missed something, our first sighting of Ushio is the first indication the anime gives us of how long the time skip has been since last episode. The VN told us in a couple of paragraphs covering that pre-OP montage that we were skipping 5 years, and that Sanae and Akio (Akki!) were raising Ushio. 

She doesn't have the antennae hair, but Ushio looks a lot like Nagisa 

Now it's Tomoya's turn to attempt to leave Ushio unsupervised. Luckily Ushio managed to stealthily follow him. 

Oh boy that ""Itadakimasu"" from Ushio. She's just so cute. I'm rarely a huge fan of fictional children, but Ushio absolutely goes on the list of exceptionally good ones, alongside Kanna from Dragon Maid and Renge from Non Non Biyori. 

And after an episode of Tomoya doing some pretty mediocre parenting learnt on the fly, he takes the trip with just him and Ushio, which was obviously Sanae's plan all along.

They have unlimited usage of their likeness in regards to the season/episodes they were contracted for, plus use of that footage in things included in that contract such as home video releases.

The only thing Kern states is that the studio lied that they would‚Äôve had to pay Doherty her ‚Äúper episode fee‚Äù, he doesn‚Äôt state they wouldn‚Äôt require permission nor any renumeration. Everything else you‚Äôre putting into his mouth.

Playing fast and loose with the word ‚Äúfact‚Äù considering you thought Milano, Combs and McGowan negotiated and signed for an 8th season, when that season was already included in their prior contracts. Your facts just aren‚Äôt very‚Ä¶ factual.

We also know that as part of luring Doherty back to television, Spelling gave Doherty more control than was usual over her image, so they may have had stipulations in her contract requiring her approval for a multitude of things.

"writingadvice","t5_30ow4","The first half of your profile is writing comments just like your ‚Äúsatire‚Äù here except sincere and in the porn section. 

I spent a while in the world of BDSM sex and you‚Äôre exactly the sort of ‚Äúdom‚Äù that I learned to avoid because for you it‚Äôs not a kink, it‚Äôs not play, it‚Äôs not fantasy; it‚Äôs disgust. Instead of two people mutually enjoying something - which BDSM proper can be - you genuinely find the thing you desire to be disgusting. You‚Äôre working out your own disgust on other people, which means you don‚Äôt understand things like the distinction between fantasy and reality. Which means as a dom you would be outright unsafe. You‚Äôd hurt women and blame them for getting hurt - as you do in all sincerity in your ‚Äúnon satire‚Äù comments here. 

The issue isn‚Äôt absolutely everybody somehow misunderstanding this post in every group you wrote it in. The issue is that telling people that women are things - not as a consensual fantasy, not as a joke, but by being sincere in a way where you don‚Äôt even have to own it - allows you to express your actual sentiment in lots of spaces that aren‚Äôt interested in hearing it. Because that gets you off. 

There‚Äôs no ‚Äúposition‚Äù to disagree with because your ‚Äúposition‚Äù is that you clearly believe every single word of what you wrote and you‚Äôre unable to see women as people. No argument need be made beyond that.",1635724952

This one might be a little more open in interpretation, but here‚Äôs how I see it

You are a US Marine, you were always strong and quick on your feet -ever since elementary-, which made you as an ideal soldier. Also, you graduated at the top of class, and there was something that made you stand out amongst the others, the sort of strength, reflexes, and possibly luck that may remind those of every protagonist‚Äôs ‚Äúplot armor‚Äù, except more realistic and not as exaggerated. However, after just being recruited for Marine Ground Combat for six months, you were taken in by the CIA for your excellency in hand-to-hand Krav Maga combat, your skills in guerrilla and stealth tactics, and being able to work with the worst of conditions. Ever since then, you have had a prestigious career with the CIA, but have had some injuries as a result, such as losing your left hand and it being replaced with a robotic replacement and having a scar that treads through your left eye. 1-10?",1635724953

\*Custom link, since PCPP does not support bundles by default.

The CPU and board combination is an odd one, especially at this price point, but it was part of a bundle, which is where the graphics card comes from. Here's my reasoning as a whole:

**CPU**: The 5600X isn't as good from a pure value standpoint as the likes of the 10400 or 10600k, but it *is* marginally faster, and it's supported by the motherboard that comes with the bundle.

**Cooler**: This isn't strictly necessary as the 5600X comes with a stock cooler, but given your budget, an extra $25 to reduce noise is probably worth it.

**Motherboard**: This isn't a board I would usually suggest at this price range, as it's definitely a ""budget"" offering. It will certainly work with the 5600X (assuming you don't get unlucky with BIOS versions,) but its feature set is somewhat limited. If you wanted to purchase a better motherboard like a B550 Aorus Pro, there is certainly room in your budget to do so.

**Memory**: This kit is decently priced and quite fast. If you wanted to get into RAM overclocking, this is guaranteed to have Micron Rev. E, so it should do well on that front (though you may want to get a better board if you go down that route.)

**Storage**: The Silicon Power P34A80 is priced extremely well for an SM2262EN-based drive with onboard DRAM. It's higher end than what you need for a gaming rig, but given the price, can't hurt.

**Video Card**: The 6800XT is fast enough to handle just about anything you throw at it, and it was available, which isn't a given in the current market. Obviously $1300 is a lot to pay for it, but it's better than it could be.

**Case**: The P360a is priced well, has good airflow and build quality, and includes 2 fans out of the box. If you wanted a different case, there's room in the budget to expand, but the p360a is a great choice if you just want a decent midrange case that works.

**PSU**: The Cooler Master V Gold V2 is priced quite well relative to [how well it performs](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cooler-master-v750-gold-v2-power-supply-review), and the white color scheme might be a plus to you.

&amp;#x200B;

For peripherals, I really don't know enough about high-end peripherals to make a suggestion about what to get. Either way, there's plenty of room in the budget to accommodate a monitor/keyboard/headset/other peripherals.",1635724953
"Glocks","t5_2v6xn","Short version:
It was a Clinger holster (V3) that they discontinued when they went to their new system, which has some sort of pad on the back, which I wouldn‚Äôt want, and I asked if I could still buy the V3, to get some spares. Nope. üò¢

The rest of the story:
I liked the V3 because it‚Äôs fully ambi (I‚Äôm left handed), and as you can see, the slide is fully covered on both sides. 

However, it came with a CLIP, which I did NOT want, so I went to Tulster Holsters (who also sells their holsters with belt clips, but does at least offer snap loops as a separate purchase option), and bought enough belt loops for this, and one other Clinger V3 that I have for another gun. 

Since the V3 is no longer available, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to buy a holster from Tulster, I‚Äôd just have to specify Right or Left, as the slide is only fully covered on the inside (but that‚Äôs good enough).",1635724953
"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","The school girl thing came from the British ‚ÄúSt Trinians‚Äù comic strip &amp; movies in the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs where adults dressed up as juvenile delinquents.

In the UK maybe 15-20 years ago it was fairly common to go to ‚Äúschool disco‚Äù parties, I went to a few in my early twenties, although the trend has mostly died out now. 

It‚Äôs very much seen as nostalgia here, rather than anything more sinister. In the UK, they have school uniforms at most schools, so when most people think back to their first crush, that‚Äôs probably what they picture, in the same way that many American men may have a thing for cheerleaders because the first girl they had a crush on was probably an cheerleader. 

So on it‚Äôs own, it‚Äôs not always a red flag, but I can see how it wouldn‚Äôt translate well to US culture &amp; it definitely is dying out here too, mainly because some 14 year old girls in actual real school uniforms have been getting catcalls from disgusting men.",1635724953

I went into a and e with a dislocated shoulder (I have a condition that causes my joints to pop. I can usually get them back in myself, but this time, I couldn't). It had been out for a few hours before I went to a and e. I told the nurse this in triage. I told her my pain was an 8 or 9 out of 10. Then sent back to the waiting room. I waited for a total of four and a half more hours; the only pain meds I was offered (I had to go and ask) was paracetamol... A man came in with a suspected broken ankle and was given morphine in the waiting room as a Dr came to see him. I WAITED OVER 4 HOURS WITH NOTHING BUT PARACETAMOL. Even when a doctor saw me, they wouldn't give me anything more substantial as I wasn't crying... This is not the only time this has happened to me. I have so many stories about Drs not believing my pain. It sucks, and now I don't trust any Dr who can't earn it. Sad but true for so many women.  

The kicker is at the time, I had morphine on repeat prescription from my GP but couldn't take any as I wouldn't have had any left and wouldn't have been able to get it reissued early (as it right)",1635724954

My first idea was to break apart each document using a pdf to jpg program that I wrote and go through each document by hand. This was ridiculously tedious and took me days to get halfway there. I eventually decided that since I didn't have to get every single payslip page I'd automate the entire process by having pytesseract scan the pages for keywords and identify them as payslip files based on the presence of said keywords. I would then save the files to a different directory and get rid of the original files. 

The end result wasn't exactly perfect due to limitations in both pytesseract and the scan quality of said documents, but I did manage to get more than enough samples to finish the job. Best of all I didn't have to lift a finger during the entire process once I got the programming down",1635724956

I just need to start with a comment from the last episode, since it relates to this one too. 

The first time I watched Clannad, I did not cry on episode 16, the reason being that I just could not believe that Nagisa had really died. I was sure that when episode 17 started, they would say something about her being in the hospital or that she had just fainted in that scene and she is fine...but all I got were grey clouds and a realization that 5 long years had passed since then and Tomoya was in shambles. Now I always cry when Nagisa's death happens, be it in the VN or in the Anime.

Now back to the episode, as I said, Tomoya life is in shambles, he lost all meaning to keep going after Nagisa died, he wishes to never have met Nagisa, he turned to gambling in a sad way to kill time and is overworking himself just to not go back to his empty house, he also left Ushio to Sanae and Akio to take care not wanting to see her, what miserable and painful 5 years those must have been. 

Sanae shows up to save the day, inviting Tomoya on a date (where he once again notices that the city keeps changing) and asking him to come on a trip with her and the rest of the family, but when he goes to the Furukawa bakery for said trip, Sanae and Akio are nowhere to be found. A strange figure can be seen running throw the house, Okazaki follows it, ending up at the door of Nagisa's room, the colors start to darken again, he can\`t stand remembering her...he follows the running again, the colors get even darker, but then...

IT IS USHIO, USHIO YOU HEAR ME?! NO, YOU DON\`T, YOU READ ME! LOOK AT HER, LOOK AT THIS SMOL NAGISA, LOOK AT HOW CUTE THIS SMALL CREATURE IS! GOD, SHE IS SO PRECIOUS! 

The colors lighten up again as soon she appears, even if Tomoya himself doesn\`t seem really happy to see her. Their interactions here are quite bittersweet to me. Tomoya seems to really don\`t want to interact with her, but at the same time he also is kind of gentle to her, fixing the turtle toy and cooking, but soon goes back to acting cold. At least there are some funny interactions especially thanks to Ushio. 

Tomoya ultimately decides to take Ushio on the trip by himself since Sanae and Akio don't seem to be coming back (for obvious reasons), and the 2 depart. 

For a curiosity that is not really a curiosity since everyone probably noticed this already, we've been seeing Ushio since the beginning of the show in every episode, as she appears running in the first opening, and also walking in the second ending (quite obvious today).

&gt; The only in-universe reason -- that I can think of -- why Cauldron thought that the Brockton Bay experiment was going to produce useful results was that the PtV shard told them so.

I should note that Cauldron thought that the BB experiment was more important than the fight against Scion:

&gt; [Doctor Mother in Alexandria's interlude in Arc 15] ""If the Terminus project is a success, the end of the world isn‚Äôt a concern.  And I believe we *will* succeed."" 

[snip]

&gt; ‚ÄúIn short?‚Äù Alexandria leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table.  ‚ÄúHe [Coil] doesn‚Äôt even know it, but *everything* rests on his shoulders.‚Äù

(emphasis in the original)

Assuming that the PtV shard was correct and the success of the BB experiment was really that important, Taylor saved the world twice: first by replacing Coil within the framework of the BB experiment (see Accord's interlude on Cauldron's reaction) and creating a peaceful BB with the Undersiders-Protectorate deal which she brokered and then again by killing Scion.",1635724957

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","I have a personal RP story that I use to immerse myself with the MSQ. My simple answer for the job switching is to only tie in specific jobs to my personal lore and ignore everything else as out of canon/out of character. For me my in-character jobs went from Warrior &gt; Dark Knight &gt; White Mage very briefly &gt; Dark Knight/Gunbreaker mostly as I've been playing this game since 2013. I play many things besides those 3, but in-canon that's what my WoL is and when I do major story quest lines I try to stick with being a Gunbreaker/Dark Knight.

Jobs do have places in the world and society, what's missing is that most of these places are lost to general history (like most the casters) or they've been pushed out of there homes in some way (Monk, Gunbreaker, Red Mage).

Dragoon is an actual title in Ishgard, Paladin/Sultansworn is a title in Ul'dah, Monk used to be a title in Ala Mhigo before it was occupied, White Mage is a title in Gridania, Ninja means something in Doma, Samurai means something in Othard in general...etc etc. The issue I think you're having is that the jobs also are flexibly allowed anywhere and don't force you to be tied to anywhere in particular due to the straight forward linear nature of the MSQ.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Just as I can not make someone get sober, I can not make them repay me, or stop asking me for things. Just as I can not stop other people from still giving resources to the addict. Addiction tares up families because all resources go toward the addict, and the non-addicted families members are left ignored or worse- shamed if they are ever in need. The end for me was when I changed my ways, learned to set boundaries practiced till I got better at keeping them, let go of feelings about situations that were out of my control, questioned if some things were any of my business, and started to accept people and situations for the way they were, not the way I wanted them.

REMEMBER, we are **not** easygoing when it comes to behavior. Be nice, fuckers. Read the rules. We will not spare you when it comes to the ban hammer. You have been warned. Remember, this is not a democracy. Comments are subject to deletion and users subject to permanent bans for being shitty towards others, or making unacceptable comments.

Also, remind yourself of the rules. ANYTHING with underage/questionable age content or creep shots will be removed, and submitting users banned forever. Please report that shit. P002200

I saw so many vids of black Americans being racist back. And turns out the video was genuinely not racist and purely promotional.

&gt;I'm really intrigued by the various sources you have referenced at various points and I will be looking them up. The Continuum Concept sounds like something I'd really get a lot out of. 
https://www.amazon.com/Continuum-Concept-Happiness-Classics-Development/dp/0201050714/ref=sr_1_1?crid=OAG2631FND3V

Or just check your local library =)

&gt; I actually left a wonderful trauma clinic and a coveted place there AMA in a huge emotional flashback, because I had such a serious interaction with an overworked therapist HOUNDing me while showering love and attention on another more popular patient.There wasn't enough love and energy to go around and I wasn't in a YAVIS state of mind then. I had just quit my dream job due to being sexually assaulted and harrassed,

Sounds like you've been through a lot =(

&gt;The notable thing about that experience was that a few years earlier, I was the popular patient at the same clinic and another woman was obviously the clinic HOUND. I saw how the therapists struggled to be kind, polite, etc. to her and the patients outright bullied her. The very same nurse who got irrationally angry at me the second time around was always looking out for me especially during my first stay and was one of my favourites. I was so shocked at her turnaround, I wonder to this day if she remembered me (Im probably the only foreigner that clinic has ever had, so I'm pretty memorable for that if nothing else)

Interesting. Even professionals can be so arbitrary in how they treat people. =(

&gt;I hate to just leave things on this sub without a clear message for others

Hey, you don't always need to be the ""helper"". It's ok to be the ""helped"". I've posted my fair share of despairing ""non-constructive"" posts over the years. It's an important part of healing.

 The best way to ""visually"" understand this is to scroll down to turn 20 (it will occur earlier, but 20 is obvious). You should see that it is the same line for every 3 turn  block. Now if you simply adjust 1 of the delays, you would see everything fly around (adjusting HK a2), or the skills changing position (Maneater no longer block at the end of a turn).

Hope that kind of explains it.

"Cringetopia","t5_ovfhp","She was pretending it was a ""joke"" at first and I believe it actually was. Her videos were mocking the I'm not like other girls ""I'm so goofy"" people. But my theory is she started getting a bunch of creeps sending her money and following her because they've moved further and further away from any sort of satire and are now clear fetish bait like this one. She still won't explicitly deny it's a joke and kinda lets people think it is, I guess to get away with it. At school she can easily be like ohhhh I know I'm totally kidding it's a joke haha.

1) the quality of grammar and spelling in my emails has a direct correlation to the level of respect I have for the individual I‚Äôm talking to. My clients and industry contacts get perfection. People I don‚Äôt care to impress get rapid fire texting with autocorrect turned off.

2) I came across the money to start my first business by working my ass off at a shitty job for slave wages. Formed a corporation so I could do side jobs in the same industry as my day job on weekends and to start advertising with about $1000 in savings I had. Bootstrapped the business by myself with 80 hour 7 day work weeks for a few years before I could afford help.

3) English is supposedly one of the more difficult languages to learn and many small business owners are the type that only have high school educations. I have my grade 11 English and trade school as my only formal post secondary education so I may be a little bit rustier than a career student earning minimum wage. The last time I was in a classroom was over a decade ago.

Hope that helps shed some light.",1635724964

For whatever reason, the Braves get screwed by MLB and the umps more often than most clubs. I'm not implying why or what's happening. I've provided more data to back that up than what you provided in your contrarian reply.

Yeah this is correct

&gt;There is nothing in and of itself wrong or abnormal with not getting laid until adulthood or having difficulty with or little interest in relationships. 

There is something wrong with it. But central to my view is the idea that most people do not have these issues, and that our current societal structure supports most people being able to regularly find new partners without using online dating, or at least did support this in 2019 and will support it in 2022

Also in my view is that most people consider themselves normies, that having sex in high school is fundamental to being a normie, and that normies are generally not insecure about their ability to find partners",1635724966

If it can down to rehoming in a non ideal environment or euthanasia then I might consider euthanasia as it wouldn't be safe with inexperienced dog owner and around kids or multiple people households. I get where your coming from because its what shelters attempt with temperament testing but I also hate ending an animals life because I'm not the appropriate person or environment for it. I know this is a very personal experience and everyone will have different opinions on this.

Fandom - Avatar: Legend of Korra

**Rating - Explicit | graphic violence | non-con | language | explicit sexual content**

Title - Equal Entanglement

Genre - Dark (eventual) Romance

Pairing - Amon/OC \[M/F\]

[Latest Chapter on AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/31370405/chapters/86563738)

Summary:

*He saves her from the world. She saves him from himself.*

A more satisfying conclusion to Amon/Noatak's character arc from LOK Book One.

I was an A-1 day-1 Amorra shipper, but regardless of how much I love Korra, she's just not a realistic match for my baby Noatak.

Excerpt:

*""His irises were pale and ice cold, unobscured even under the dark shadows of his menacing mask. The ivory visage bore a peaceful expression, but its eyelets were carved into aggressive downward slits. The eerie image came complete with a large, unyielding red orb painted directly above its brow. His frigid stare left her face to skim the rest of her bare body, and a silent rush of trepidation seized her chest. Where the other men had salaciously leered, he seemed to be critically scrutinizing. She had never felt insecure about her body, but his attention was giving her a strange sense of inadequacy. Shaking now, she sheepishly lifted the knife out in front of her as a warning against whatever he was planning to do.""*",1635724969

You‚Äôre obviously still a hot topic of conversation with your mother. She‚Äôs likely farming sympathy from this woman playing back all of her grievances with your relationship/the NC. In my experience, a narc feeling rejected by NC can become a flowing sewer of insecurity/vengeance/anger/hurt - any and all negative emotions that they refuse to work on in a healthy way and will try to make your responsibility.

You‚Äôre not overreacting. This is awful. Even though it‚Äôs in FB, it‚Äôs an invasion of privacy. How dare she go in and tarnish a memory that you had with your sister by posting this vile crap. 

My mother used to try and wheedle her way into my sister‚Äôs and my romantic relationships. She‚Äôd try and get buddy buddy with the spouse as an way to coax them into ‚Äòventing‚Äô about my sisters. When that didn‚Äôt work, she‚Äôd try it with the in-laws. My husband has always greyrocked her instinctively so she‚Äôd try asking me ‚Äúwhat wrong‚Äù with him, and subtly try and find problems with his behavior. My point is, despite how well you‚Äôre relationship is with your spouse, sometimes nparents simply can‚Äôt be happy for you. They read your success as a measure of their failure. If you‚Äôre in love with someone, they think it means you love them less. If you‚Äôre successful at work or you‚Äôve achieved a ‚Äòhigher‚Äô level than they have, they think it means you‚Äôre looking down in them. Everyone has to be completely focused on the narc, in the way that they demand, for them to be ‚Äòhappy‚Äô (and you know they‚Äôre never really happy).",1635724970

The line down below last night took us about an hour and a half to get through, there was a super long line and then about 70 wooks trying to crowd the front to cut. Eventually some hotel security was able to clear the crowd, but it really slowed everything down. Additionally, there's only one entrance to the bowl itself, so everyone entering or exiting at the beginning, setbreak etc all have to funnel through the same little hallway. We showed up between 630-645 and didn't get into the floor until the beginning of Turtle in the Clouds, but honestly we were kinda lucky from what I heard. Apparently the floor hit capacity early on and some people were getting turned away (this didn't happen to me personally). Finally, I know it sounds like some parking lot rumor but my girlfriend overheard some security staff mentioning that MGM has never tried to sell this many floor tickets before.

I've just changed the path leading just after the fencing ends from the coops to something else and plotted a few areas to plant those cherry trees.

With the barns, do you mean cutting that corner where the greenhouse currently is or going around that area and putting something else there?

I am planning to move my machines into another shed. Current one is purely storage but I'm a bit resource bound with stone and wood right now.

"computerwargames","t5_2yh2r","It's surprisingly immersive. I just did a quick battle as Vikings against Anglo-Saxons, in a small battle. Keeping your line together when the fighting begins is challenging, but rewarding if you manage it. It helps to have a few units behind line, ready to fill gaps. Because some weak units will flee or begin to chase an enemy.

Controlling where the fighting happens is key to victory. In this battle I was very successful and part with luck I managed to make the battle happen against my intact line, which was partly in woods' cover, and my left flank was controlling a small hill. The enemy and I had only one cavalry unit and I managed to keep the enemy cavalry away by maneuvering 3 of my units on that hill and using archers to tell it it's wiser to stay back. Horses in this game get rekt by archers. Normally the cavalry will just charge the archers of course, but having my backup troops on that hill was key to protect the archers. The fight ended in Anglo-Saxons routing 40% of their units against only 9% of my Vikings having routed. They had a reinforcements coming, but it was too late.

Some other things to note about the game: Especially with the expansions it has a crazy number of different unit types. It's of course important to know the key types like skirmishers, infantry, heavy infantry, etc. But especially when the battle starts it's important you know, which are your best units. Probably not all of them. Most of your units might be some farmers, who never fought before. Yea, they will put up a fight against similar units, but think of them as the ones you don't count on. When the line breaks you can bet it's one of these weaker, undrilled units. So the challenge is when you realize, who are your best troops to decide if you put them to first fight or save them for later. In my Viking battle here I had 4 strong units that I decided to put on my left flank to protect against cavalry and to attack the enemy flank. I used the classic method of moving only my line's left flank toward enemy. So they have to contact my strong troops first or get flanked by them, if they try to go past. So other key to this game I think is: Realize 80% of your troops is cannon fodder and absolutely untrustworthy. Make sure there is general nearby or they rout immediately. Make the weak troops fight other similar troops and not veterans. Make a plan for your strong troops and dont waste them. But this is all beginner tips. The game system is vast.

The manual in this game is very deep too. I dont remember the calculations for how fights are solved. It's too complex, but the game tells you the odds before you attack. The game is so good in simulating ancient warfare that the manual quotes actual Roman general tactics as tips for the game... I'm really just a noob in this game, but in my view the line is everything in it. You try to keep it together in many ways and break the opponent's line, so they become weak and open for flanks. You could build a big cavalry if you like and make your winning move as one big flanking attack against a weak enemy line. So many things to do in this game. And you can easily have a relatively short battle, when you pick Quick battle and pick the smallest troop sizes.

The campaigns are pretty cool in that you progress your army somewhat. I plan to look into Field of Glory: Empires. It might interest you too and it has some positive and negative reviews. I think with the tactical battles of Field of Glory II(there's an odd feature where you can fight the Empires battles in FoGII exe and then go back to Empires) it challenges games like Paradox's Imperator: Rome, which has a simple battle system.",1635724972

The first time this happened was Christmas years ago and he was devastated the cat was missing for 24 hours I think. The cat wasn't the type to be gone more than 2 or 3 hours. The cat had been visiting this house for 10 or 12 years and this never happened before.

It turns out he climbed onto a neighbours extension and wouldn't get down the small jump. We were searching everywhere. The cat usually was a loud meow and came to his own name. So eventually when he got hungry enough he started meowing. The next two times he went missing we looked in the same place he was there. We made it so he could not climb there anymore after the third time. But it was a mini Christmas miracle. I know its short stints but the cat was trapping itself and wasn't enjoying it, but kept doing it and getting to scared to move üò¨",1635724973

"dndmemes","t5_35g8o","Here's a copy and paste of what I commented on this in r/CuratedTumblr earlier:

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I think would be the most useful, and what they do:

&amp;#x200B;

**Wizard Spells:**

Disarray Cone (or Cone of Disarray): Causes enemies in a cone in front of you to run in a random direction if they fail a WIS save.

Hurl Tetanus: Conjures and hurls tiny rusted pieces of metal at enemies. Deals piercing damage, then on their next few rounds if they fail a CON save, deals poison damage. Nat 1 on CON save leads to them being unable to move, use weapons, or cast spells that require a somatic component.

&amp;#x200B;

**Warlock Spells:**

Mortifying Grasp: When touching an enemy, deals psychic damage.

Unfriendly Stillness: Ceases airflow in an area and fills it with an unsettling aura, dealing psychic damage.

Unhinged Decay: Deals a medium amount of psychic and necrotic damage. Causes items around the target not worn or held to begin to rot away.

Disquieting Bleeding: For X rounds, the target takes additional psychic damage any time they take other nonmagical damage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Any Caster:**

Misplace Carcass: Teleports any dead or undead bodies to a random nearby location not in view of the caster.

Scuttling Jinx: Creates a small arthropod that scuttles over to the target and latches onto them, giving them disadvantage on attacks and saving throws. May be redirected to another target if the current target is defeated.

Continued Strangulation: After grappling an enemy, deal continuous force damage every round for X rounds.

Pervading Agony: Following a failed CON save, deals a small amount of psychic damage to the target every round until the target is defeated or the caster gets out of a certain range of the target.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cleric/Paladin:**

Kindled Pestilence: Deals poison damage for X rounds and then Fire damage for Y rounds. If the target is immune to poison damage, the fire damage cannot be applied.

Revered Burning: Ignites the target in brilliant white flames, dealing a medium amount of radiant and fire damage

Sacred Repulsion: Deals a small amount of radiant damage and knocks the target back several feet.

Purging Maul: Bludgeoning weapon attacks deal additional radiant damage. Attacks against Undead, Fiends, or Aberrations deal twice as much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bard:**

Humiliating Angst: Deals psychic damage by forcing the target to recall embarrassing memories.

Decimating Shimmy: Forces the target to do a painful dance, dealing force or necrotic damage, caster's choice.

Induced Frolic: Forces targets in a certain area to sing and dance with each other for X rounds following a failed WIS save, making them unable to fight.

&amp;#x200B;

**Druid:**

Lava Passage: It's like Moses parting the Red Sea, but for lava.

Sandblast Supreme: Whips up sand or other small particles on the ground, obstructing vision and dealing slashing damage in an X radius sphere.

Synthesize Wolf: Forms a wolf-shaped construct out of earth, plant matter, and/or other loose materials on the ground, which can aid you in combat.

&amp;#x200B;

**Misc.:**

Immobilizing Sizzle (Sorcerer): Deals fire damage and holds an enemy in place for X rounds.

Throttling Hate (Barbarians with a subclass that allows casting): Not necessarily a spell, could be a class feature or a feat instead. Deals bludgeoning damage to a currently grappled enemy while you are raging.

Dappling Cloak (Ranger): When in a forest, perfectly conceals the target/s of the spell when they are not moving.

Enveloping Trickery (Rogue): Honestly, I'm not really sure what this should do. It just seemed like something a rogue would have. Maybe it's some kind of illusion.",1635724973

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","There are a few you're forgetting, at least in my mind.

1. Capture- In some realities, Death is less of an inevitability, and more of a person/god that will come for us all. Think beings like Thanatos, who have to be free to do their job, and cannot perform the act of causing death when trapped. In these realms, death can be something that is permanently stopped when the being that brings it around is captured/destroyed. 
2. Immortality- Immortality can itself be framed in several lights. One, obviously, is magical immortality, which sometimes has to be sustained(whether this counts or is ""death with extra steps"" is up for debate), or is some sort of wish. Sometimes its scientific, other times, godhood. This is different from Regeneration, in that this is the inability for any cell in your body to ever perish. Its not that your body regenerates, its that it simply does not receive harm.

I went to experian and saw that they offer the FICO calculation for all three bureaus with their membership, which is 30 days free. 

After looking, I saw a vast difference, and that my FICO scores are all sitting in the 715-720 range! Obviously this is great news.

Thanks for being the first person who gave me something to look at that I hadn't already, as I appreciate it so much.

I put the Mossberg up there due to modularity, budgets and the ""Remington Rust"" issue, which some people do not like at all. I think its really incumbent upon all firearms owners to take care of their tools, so that rust shouldn't be an issue. As for pistols, completely agree on the glock, only choosing the Sigs again due to modularity. Also I consider Sig's to be slightly higher quality, and don't believe the sidearm is the one area to skimp on. That said, Glocks are indeed quality firearms, and perform very well.

Everyone is the hero of their own story and most everyone who makes money thinks they earned it. There is no true arbiter of fairness. It's only those with leverage and those controlling the flow of money. We don't value people based on their real contributions. The tiny fraction of capital that actually gets used for startups and innovation is treated like a judge on Star Search -- as if it had anything to do with the real talent and success other than being money well spent. We are supposed to be slaves to the person who can recognize a good singing voice? The composer, the artist, the dancers -- yes, there are many, but someone with cash at the right time and right place could be any jerk who won the lottery. It requires nothing.

This systems has some major downsides as it hinders discussions on race and acts like there's no systemic racism in France. However i think it does more good than bad and prevents tribalism

"RWBYcritics","t5_wuw08","&gt;On the night known as ""White Night"" A legendary Grimm of immense power known as The Saint, razed Mantle to the ground. And in the process, abducted a large group of people. But there were a handful of survivors, notable was Nicholas Schnee.

Why was it called The Saint? Seems like a very weird name to give a grim. Really I only see a grim getting that kind of name is if it's shorthand for a title the fearful populace gave it like the saint of slaughter, saint of despair, or something along those lines. You calling it The Saint and having it be the arch nemesis of Nicholas just had me thinking of an evil Santa. No not the krampus I mean an actual evil Santa.

What was even the saint anyway? You mentioned it was a legendary grim but you never really described what it was and what made it so dangerous aside from being old and smart.

&gt;Atlas despite being so young, with the advancement in technology, they quickly rose to become a true superpower of the world. Even outclassing the original kingdom of Vale.

So Mantle and indirectly Atlas were offshoots of veil before becoming their own sovereign entities. That's interesting. My particular head Cannon for the origins of mantle was that it was a settlement of people trying to escape the grip of the expansionist empire that was minstrel money it was grabbing up every territory in anima. Any particular reason why you had them be a runaway colony of vale?

&gt;So to did every kingdom contribute something, save for one. Vacuo when they were needed most, abandoned the others. The Faunus soon became regarded as traitors, and oathbreakers, and Mistral fell, though it would later return in time.


&gt;Vacuo was treated harshly in the aftermath due to their abandonment. It was carved up, and wouldn't see any form of independence until modern times, when the crime rate was far too great, and the White Fang reclaimed the birth home of the Faunus.

Even for a recent college graduate in a highly in-demand field you're unlikely to get anywhere near that around here.

"warriors","t5_2rtiv","I'll preface by saying I've always liked Lee on the roster. He's great in the locker room, he's a great value contract, and he's an elite shooter who could very well end up hitting 42+% of his 3s this season. 

I still don't like his defense. He bites hard on seemingly every pump fake, and dies on seemingly every screen. He's generally been better so far than I'm previous years, but he's still overall a negative defender. 

He has a good understanding of the offense and he has vision, but his actual passing ability is very iffy. He's not a shot creator or playmaker in any real sense. He's overall been a positive on offense with his fantastic shot making. And if he continues to hit 3s at such a high clip, I think you have to start considering starting him over Poole. 

That said, I don't think 6 games is a good sample size. Lee has been hot and I don't trust he'll keep hitting 3s at a 46% clip. Obviously it would be great to see, but I'm skeptical. And in my mind, he's not a starter level player unless he's hitting at that level given his lack of defense. 

It is definitely clear that Poole and Steph are really the only shot creators on the team though. Poole as a 6th man makes a lot of sense and while I want to see him get minutes against starters for his development, shifting his rotation even more towards playing with the bench unit might be best for the team.",1635724980

"PokeLeaks","t5_2ylx9","Well, birds fight, and they dwell in trees, in general, eat seeds, pollinate plants, make nests from branches and sticks, lots of birds are so tree oriented they developed camouflage for many of them. Blaziken makes sense from its basis in cock fighting and the fire typing is there but nothing about chickens is inherently related to fire, fire is just cool to use. Grass type is more related to birds, or plant life than fire. Alot of birds fight in the sky through aerial dives and physical collisions, birds are dinosaur descendents so they are or can be very aggressive too, especially with kicks and wing beating, or hard pecks and bites, not all birds fly or fly efficiently, some just glide or fly for very short distances only. grass fighting is okay to me.

It was a mistake on his part, but I feel that's part of what makes that whole arc so compelling in the film. 

Luke makes a gigantic mistake that costs his family and the galaxy dearly. He goes into exile and cuts himself off from the force because of this and it takes Rey to snap him out of it and realize that he can try to be better despite of his failure.

Also, more and more video game workers need to demand profits as well as salaries. Especially on smaller indie or 'III' games. If you aren't getting a piece of the pie then you aren't getting fairly compensated. That said if they aren't going to give you money, RUN!

"killsixbilliondemons","t5_352se","Well to answer that, we need to define time in throne. Which is much harder than one assumes. 

This is because the sheer concentration of egos in throne has led to time being dependant on the people's perception of time. So if a majority of the atum of the people in throne feels that it has been a week, it has been a week. This means that during periods of great strife or sadness, time moves much slower, and a week may take dozens of days to pass. And in times of great happiness the weeks may flow like water.

This is why controlling the media in throne is so important, as by acting as the sole source of media in throne, gog can control the emotions of the people, and thus how fast time flows.

Becuase of this it can be noted that during times the worm queen wishes to last longer, such as her birthday party, she may make all content in throne spectacularly boring, to stretch out the time.",1635724984

You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

The figure talks and moves like a person. They even emote like one and have mannerisms that reveal their quirks. But you see nothing. The shape is there - it has to be since you can see their gestures. It's not that a shadow envelops them or that they are covered in absolute black.

Where they are, there is a person-shaped absence of reality. A person-shaped hole in the fabric of being and presence. Actual *nothing* (at least nothing that exists in our reality) that happens to be like a human person.

You see nothing when you look at their direction. You can also see their warm smile, which should be impossible.

How in the world are you strong if you do not lift anything above 235lbs? And why 235? What made you decide that was the number?  A 235lb deadlift is very different than a 235lb overhead press and even bench press. 

Why even lift that heavy, why not just use some resistance bands and max all of your lifts at 135? Wouldn't that be better on your future joints by your logic? 

Spoiler, you are speaking bullshit and it is not scientifically backed as you say. Your bone density goes through the rough if you lift, which is very good at combatting the deterioration caused by aging. 

This is not an original thought though, yours I mean. Almost every older, sedentary person believes this and older people that use their gym membership once a month for 20 years and think that means they have been lifting for 20 years.",1635724985
"HotWifeLifestyle","t5_32dpu","There's no worries about her catching feelings and note that it's not juse me.  We both can not envision playing separately.  Doing that in any configuration seems more like an open marriage and that's not at all our goal.  As noted, we share the security concerns and there's plenty of good data validating that guys can't be universally trusted.  These are not friends, they are well-vetted individuals to the extent that they can be vetted, but not someone who would ever be afforded out of hand trust either by me or my wife.  She's had bad experiences with guys in the past and never wants to experience anything like that again.  She knows that I'm well equipped and trained to the point that there's little I cannot handle if behavior starts to get out of line.  And further, being in the room, seeing and smelling the heat of my wife being taken to orgasmic bliss is my quid pro quo aside from our hot sex once the guy leaves.  

As noted in the earlier comment, we view any lifestyle play as a SHARED extension of our really great sex life together.  It's an add-on for both of our enjoyment and for us sexual enjoyment is a together thing.  And trust that we long ago figured out that lifestyle sex is just sex.  That was one big topic for the extensive talking we did before starting.  Our mutual trust is absolute and we really have nothing to talk out.  The issue for us is simple.  While we understand that doing this in the form of the woman effectively dating is a popular approach likely driven by fetish/kinks we do not share, as hard as we've tried we just can get a visceral sense of how this arrangement works for the guys.  We do understand how it would definitely work for the woman's interests.",1635724985

Also, I'm not sure where all the fiscal conservatives are, but putting them in jail is the most expensive option. We can feed, clothe, house, provide healthcare, provide mental health and addiction services, and train people for jobs and still save money over putting them in jail. 


We need to address the underlying housing issue that affects everyone besides the 1% in the region. Plenty of millennials with good jobs want to buy houses but can't afford them because hedge funds and Zillow are buying up all the stock to inflate the price and as an investment instrument. Affordable housing means less people on the streets too.

Any violent criminals on the street need to go to jail, including homeless people. We need to have hard enough consequences for theft and easy enough job training to change the economic equation for all the homeless thieves. People get caught stealing catalytic converters and also having hard drugs can go to forced rehab. 

But most importantly, we need national leadership on the homeless issue. This isn't just a regional problem. We can reduce the defense budget by 10% and solve homelessness immediately.",1635724985

I had ran the 0000 steel wool longer in the chamber than I thought was reasonable.  To the point I was afraid I may have done some damage (removed too much material).

I then grabbed a bag of mixed 12ga rounds I had an my tools to disassemble it to get them out quicker and I loaded it up.

"thatHappened","t5_2vmb7","Almost entirely. The disinformation, the downplaying, and the horrible response was bad. But realizing that George Bush started a pandemic response, which Obama built on, and Trump threw away for no reason. The least amount of blame he gets is like 85%. 

Under the Bush/Obama plan we could have responded to this with a robust quarantine system and rode this out until a vaccine came out where 80% or so could have been vaccinated and lead us to something close to a herd immunity (obviously variants would keep this from being 100% true). Instead he sowed distrust, prompting this anti-quarantine, anti-mask, anti-vax movement which has killed any chance of immunity, not just for us, but pretty much everyone.

And now following his example we have a bunch of extremist Governors keeping this anti-intellectual movement alive for political profit.  I mean, who else could we blame?",1635724987

And if you're given artistic liberty to make an axe wielding samurai based on the unseen Hitokiri, its gotta be a heavy axe, what better way than to add a 2nd head? 

Giving a viking a rapier is totally different, they never used them. But Samurai did use axes in combat, it was just very odd because they were honorable in history, but the Hitokiri worked in the shadows and blah blah so they didn't care about that. A Hitokiri is the only real choice for an axe wielding samurai, and making it a double headed axe was also the only way to avoid making them a copy of Raider.

I‚Äôm not super offended, I‚Äôm just pointing out that you crossed a line and made it personal.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre boss must love you.‚Äù  And ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt really think things through more than halfway‚Äù. Those are slights against me and not innocent comments. 

&gt;My experience is that bosses will fill the schedule and have an extra if they need.  Sometimes people just call in, for whatever reason.  It doesn't matter anyways.  They simply said they need extra hands, not that the world will burn if they don't get them.

Well that‚Äôs nice for you, but we‚Äôve clearly had different experiences.  In my experience not coming in is a black mark and makes it hard to get promoted etc. So it is a big deal, it affects your career in the long term. 

&gt;I guess I don't get how you think every business is the same, just based on your experience with jobs who always seem to understaff their shifts.  Of course you would hate an employer that did that.  That doesn't mean the same thing is happening here.

Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not happening here. Again you don‚Äôt know anymore than I do about this situation. 

&gt;And knowing your busy and slow days only helps so much.  Sometimes it just doesn't work out to be that kind of day, hence why they send people home early at times.  Adding unnecessary employees to a shift cuts into available hours for when they do need help.   This hurts more than it helps, by quite a lot.

I get that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a juggling act and the system is never perfect.  However, OP makes a good point that if they had to pay a fee for the convenience of last minute coverage Corporations would have to lighten up and have a more sensible policy for hours, scheduling etc. 

&gt;I wasn't the store manager but I was the ASM for over a year at my last retail job and you're really only supposed to schedule who you need and nobody extra unless you have the budget for it.  But every job is different, except you seem to think they are all the same.

You‚Äôre making assumptions about how I think again. 

I understand that being the manager or assistant manager is a tough spot and sometimes you‚Äôre just doing the best you can. In which case it falls on Corporate to budget more money for labor.  

If the bastards were paying what their employees deserved this wouldn‚Äôt even be a problem in the first place. 


&gt;Asking someone to cover a shift is nowhere close to asking them to work 'double hard'.  

That isn‚Äôt what I said, read more carefully.  I said when the store is understaffed the employees who showed are expected to work double hard to get it done. They are being asked to do their job and someone else‚Äôs for the same pay.   That is unacceptable. 

&gt;Maybe you just really don't like putting in the effort.  

Here you go making it personal again implying I‚Äôm just lazy. 

&gt;Some people would jump at that shift. Just because you see it as asking way too much doesn't mean it actually is.

Some people are desperate and oppressed allowing Corporate to exploit them and driving down wages for the rest of the work force.  The fact that some see it as reasonable doesn‚Äôt mean it actually is.",1635724988

This was before Covid mind you, but other vaccines were created and required for admittance to childcare. Religious and medical exemption allowed for children to come without them. Staff were not mandated to get flu vaccines.

The infant caught a cold or two, and stayed away during a hand, foot, and mouth outbreak, but it was generally a very healthy infant despite childcare illnesses, and the parents not knowing who had what vaccines. There were 9 infants in the room, 4 staff, and numerous supply staff.

Chances are that your child will be fine if people truthfully come by while healthy, vaccinated or not. Staff are not mandated to have Covid and most vaccines while on childcare, just suggested.

There was a ESA or GDQ event (around 2018 I think) where there was a nasty cold/flu type thing going around. A very significant number of attendees were sick by the end of the event. Enough that it was a topic of conversation on social media.

They basically said that it only took a month or whatever to talk to the unit therapist and be cleared for duty, which is VASTLY unbelievable.  It would be closer to a year or more, effectively stunting any fast track promotion consideration.

However, as long as they were cleared for normal duty, they could go back to work on patrol.  The therapist would then have to re-evaluate the officer before any UC duty paperwork could even beGIN to be drawn up.

1. I admitted NOTHING about not being with Faker. They win with those players ON the roster, not AFTER they leave. Pretty much all of their top rosters ARE the crazy things that happened *from* the rosters with t1 developed rookies. I suppose I should have clarified after *joining* and *playing with* the team - but thought that was pretty obvious lol. They usually get noticeably worse as players after they *arent* playing on the team.

2. I don't disagree with coaches easily being credited as well. Think I originally mentioned it myself - but chose to delete that at some point. **However**, faker has been the only constant in the org since their initial success (again cursory check). Coaches have left and rotated, but the development of main team is constant af. We don't have the information to say for sure what % each player / coach gets - but Faker is the 1 constant we *know* people are seen to develop around.

3. On the above point -&gt; look at this year. T1 was struggling hard entire the let their head coach go near the end of the season and the team publicly discussed how they become mostly self guided with Stardust to help guide conversations. I'm not sure the extent there, only confirmed that the players had *more* agency in decisions with coaches. But the fact we know is that T1 instantly turned their season around from the edge of disaster when the players were given more agency. even the rookie/unknown *coaches* seem to improve alongside the team.",1635724991

Well yeah, but also no because they already handle a lot of volume and creating 100 accounts for governance would be less work for them than a regular person.  

Still B seems better to me because it incentivizes not overcommitting.  If you don't overcommit, you can't be upset with anyone over your reward amount.  If you can't overcommit, then you will be more likely to stay in governance and participate rather than losing all rewards.

"TokyoRevengers","t5_p1yhl","The answer is actually really complicated and not clear so this wont clarify much but here goes. Honda 250 is a common model number with a lot of different variations out there. To help simplify, 250 stands for the engine power or 250cc (which might not be the case on Mikey's bike due to an engine swap) and T stands for touring. linked below is the site with all the Honda bike variants. CB 250 T (typed into search like this) only has one model year listed. 1978. while there is other 250s made (such as the nighthawk, wiki below), there is no listed model T for the 250s made during 1991-2008. Due to this the bikes year is most likely 1978, with the kids in the manga, anime being confused as to why it looked older(?).

"deadbydaylight","t5_3cb2g","Doctor is fucking badass with my build:

BBQ/Distressing/Huntress Lullaby/Unnerving Presence

Here's why it's one of the best builds Doctor can use in terms of generally fucking up a survivor's day: 

Detection

BBQ and Chilli reveals the auras of all survivors not in lockers or anti scratchy Boon totem circle if they're outside 40m. Distressing increases Doctor's Terror Radius by 26% (We'll say 25% for simplicity), and his standard TR is 32m. 32+25% is 40, so upon hooking a survivor, Static Blast will reveal any survivors within 40m of you, even if they're in an anti scratchy circle unless they're running Calm Spirit or in a locker. Plus if they fail a skill check you will receive a loud noise notification, as well as if they scream from Madness.

Fuck Your Skill Checks

Unnerving Presence will reduce the size of a survivor's skill check by up to 60% while they're in your Terror Radius which is already 40m. It can go right up to 54m with Calm - Carter's Notes and Calm - Class II. Huntress Lullaby, upon hooking survivors, gains a token. This reduces the time between the sound warning and the skill check eventually eliminating the warning altogether at 5 stacks. Huntress Lullaby is unfortunately a Hex perk, so survivors can remove it from play before you get a lot of use from it. So far this seems pretty underwhelming, right? Wrong. With Doctor's power, Carter's Spark, skill checks can go the wrong way, shake on the screen and not be in the middle of the screen like usual. Even veteran survivors will fail some of their skill checks with all 3 of these in play.

In conclusion, this build is great for tracking survivors and it also provides unique slowdown in the form of more difficult skill checks and disorienting skill checks. They'll be more focused on the skill checks, and if you're using Iridescent King, they'll ignore the Terror Radius and Red Stain because in Madness II the TR and RS are both meant to look exactly like you're right behind them while they're in your TR.

No, no, no, nope. Why are there expectations to react a certain way in the first place? That's bullshit.

&gt; He KNOWS I'm very uncomfortable with babies

Okay so *he* knows this, *he* showed you a baby while knowing this, and somehow that ends with *you* feeling guilty?

**He is the one who should be feeling guilty for crossing your boundaries.**

&gt; So I don't understand why he had the need to show that picture to me, knowing babies are making me uncomfortable.

Ask him. And make it clear that you don't want a repeat of this. It's not that big of a deal. If you don't wanna see pics of something, people shouldn't purposefully show those things to you.

My partner also became an uncle a few months ago. I hate kids, he's neutral about them more or less. He went to see his nephew a few times, gave me some basic updates on how the new parents were doing, and that was pretty much it. I think I only ever saw one picture of the kid, and we were on the same page that it was a one time thing to show me that yes, the baby exists - and I don't care to see it more than that.

You don't have to have the same feelings about everything. He can be happy, and you can be happy that he's happy without being happy about the same thing. That's not insensible or unhuman, that's just ... the way people are. No one cares for everything. We're just expected to because most are too chicken to be honest and choose to fake reactions instead.

You're a person, not a click bait YouTuber. Your job is to be genuine, not to pump out reactions as they're desired.",1635724994

However, Victoria has experienced a higher peak and it did take more time for R_eff to drop below 1. It seems that the virus spreads more easily in Melbourne compared to Sydney for structural reasons, given the frequency of small outbreaks growing quickly over the last year. It would therefore make sense for vaccinations to take longer to bring R_eff below 1 and for cases to drop, since the initial rate of spread would be higher on average.

**What is holding me back or an obstacle in my way**  
**DEATH, with THE SUN as further clarity**  
What this is saying is that you are in a period of change and transition and it is important to go with it and not resist or turn away. The death of your old self, old habits and unhealthy attachments are often painful and it‚Äôs okay to need help during this transition but do not resist as it will come either way and it is staring you in the face. You kind of know this deep down, this about all you‚Äôre doing with a new job, therapy, boundary-setting etc. Hence why the death card stares at you so, as death and change are unavoidable. Do not fight change and death of old ways ‚Äì this is good. Do you want further clarity? How‚Äôs The Sun! The sun in warmth, love, joy and abundance. This warmth is what people are drawn to (drawn to you!) and will get you through any hard time. It will help you succeed. Radiate what you shine for and share your love. If a difficult time: things will get super better! Everything will work out. Life is good. Everything is on the up. You are shining. You are glowing. You are abundant. It could also be saying its okay to not be sun shine and warmth at all times and this is something  to continue to work on changing.

**Where do I need to focus my energy and self-care**  
THREE OF SWORDS  
Going forward this new seasonal year you need to continue to work on your response to others and pain. You need to continue to be mindful and aware of where your pain comes from, and where it may come from others, but you need to continue to give yourself permission to feel. Permission to feel hurt, happy, or in conflict with others. All emotions are an aspect of life, continue to move forward in your growth and change. And remember; someone else‚Äôs  reaction or response to you need not define you ‚Äì it defines their own understanding and projection.",1635724996

Apparently there's going to be new versions of all the mods at some point in the next month, they originally meant to release in september but had to delay.

But played Vice City for the first time with the current version of the mod and it was almost flawless, I think I had one crash and there was a little bug where the credits rolled super slow at the end. Only other glitch I experience was map icons disappearing when I was on Bridges and reappearing when I got off the bridges. 

Given that the Vanilla version legit wouldn't run properly on my PC. I'd say this was a pretty amazing improvement. The overhauls are a little bit more noticeable in the older games since they had to add HD widescreen support, controller support, properly re-done HUD and they re-drew all the loading screen art to be much higher quality. Also you can move the camera around in your car which you couldn't do in older games, you could only look forward, back, left and right. 

Currently playing GTA IV and the only bug I've had is that some graffiti'd wall textures shimmer a bit. No crashes or anything, actually had less hitches than vanilla on my PC.",1635724998

A similar situation happened in my first year coaching years ago, but it was in the first quarter. A few of our coaches left to go to the hospital with the player and we finished the game. 

I have no issues with suspending the game in this situation, but I do have issues forfeiting a game halfway through for being outmatched or losing badly.

"depression","t5_2qqqf","I feel for you. I've had bad hygiene myself lately. I'm lucky to have gone mostly bald (sarcasm) but when my beard starts to grow back my facial skin underneath gets really dry and flaky. I have to scratch it off basically through my very coarse beard hairs. But tonight I spent an hour in the bath soaking and washing and moisturizing so hopefully that will help. Once the beard gets long it's way easier to maintain healthy skin underneath. So I'm growing it back out to avoid all that unsightliness.

As far as the crying goes I know that feeling too. I haven't cried much at work unless I'm telling a close friend a sad story then I might shed a tear but the feeling of hopelessness along with an inability to perform well is soul crushing. It's the worst thing seeing people who I know I'm more skilled than outperform me. Makes me feel remedial.",1635724999

Crock pots/insta pots are the best.  You can buy already cut steak, pick 3 veggies you like and a stew packet.  You throw it in with water and turn it on in the morning.  When you get home dinner is ready.  Some bread for dipping and you have a meal of beef stew for two days.  When I first started I would use canned veg.  So beef, season packet, water, can of green beans, can carrots, can of potatoes, salt and pepper.  Once you get one under your belt you will be so proud of yourself.  You can do it!!!

"TheB1G","t5_2vmjf","In the last 15 years‚Ä¶we‚Äôve had MULTIPLE absolute blowouts on us against better teams‚Ä¶but so far this year we‚Äôre played EVERYONE close. That basically means we have a chance to beat literally every single team. There was a ranking somewhere that factors in ‚Äúluck‚Äù and odds and such and over the last 4 years Nebraska has had the worst ‚Äúluck‚Äù in the entire country. Now some of that comes down to coaching‚Ä¶to the players‚Ä¶yes all of that is true but some of it is just terrible coaching.

Think about how different this whole year could‚Äôve been if that fumble against Illinois hadn‚Äôt had the most insanely unfortunate bounce right into the defenders hands for the TD? We likely start the year off with a win. we would‚Äôve beat Michigan State if not for the absolute fluke TD return‚Ä¶so now after we beat Northwestern let‚Äôs say even if we had lost to Oklahoma still we‚Äôre 5-1 going into Michigan‚Ä¶which if you‚Äôll remember the phantom pass interference call where there the receiver stopped running his route and the QB threw the ball 10 yards out the back of the endzone that ended in them scoring 7 instead of punting? We wouldn‚Äôt even have to bring up them holding Martinez in one spot for 3 full seconds before blowing the whistle only AFTER they stripped the ball out‚Ä¶so now we‚Äôre hypothetically 6-1 going into Minnesota but we‚Äôre already bowl eligible. 

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è there‚Äôs a lot of optimism if you‚Äôre able to see how close we are / how we‚Äôve been slightly hindered by some rough calls, but it‚Äôs still our own fault as we have to be good enough for the refs to not matter. 

Just shows a bit at how I can think we‚Äôre closer than we look‚Ä¶and one more year might pay dividends in the end. Like what do we have to lose by keeping him one more year? I‚Äôd rather keep a coach one year too many than to get rid of a coach one year too early.",1635724999

Not a single person I know in my 30 years of full time employment at any time (including myself) have ever experienced this. 
The only way to make more money is to polish your resume and send it to someone else. Your employer doesn‚Äôt give two shits about you. Your only value to your boss is what they can get out of you for as little as possible. Learn new skills, master your craft, and upgrade to the next company.

"CultOfCapella","t5_42anzu","Here are a few ideas I thought of on the spot.

An omake detailing what happened after the first time that Subaru tried to escape Capella, or possibly even ask for help. The person that he'd ask for help would be Capella-chan herself, seeing as she predicted what the meatbag would try to do. Punishment ensues.

During his date with Emilia-tan, his mind is preoccupied with the dilemma of whether he loves Capella or not, maybe even whether he loves EMT or not. Because of this, he has a hard time talking to Emilia and looking her straight in the eyes.

Subaru tries to communicate to Otto and Garfiel that something is wrong without raising too much suspicion from Capella, however, his pathetic attempt falls flat.

While Subaru is training with Clind, Capella infiltrates the mansion, finds his room using his scent, and deposits another 'gift'. Entirely from her POV. There could also be a follow-up omake where Subaru discovers it. As for what it might be? Maybe her hairpin, and a letter telling Subaru to convince Beatrice to wear it.",1635725001

When the French team is not winning, the tens of thousands of people don't care about football, don't go in the street, and simply don't talk about football.

[Curvy Kate Lifestyle plunge](https://us.brastop.com/products/curvy-kate-lifestyle-plunge-bra-latte?variant=31758755135536) $29 and [the same bra for just $20](https://us.brastop.com/products/curvy-kate-lifestyle-lace-plunge-bra-blue-red) in a different colorway.

[Freya Expression Plunge](https://us.brastop.com/products/freya-expression-plunge-bra-pacific)  in blue for $27 and [in gray for a couple of dollars more](https://us.brastop.com/products/freya-expression-plunge-bra-shark?variant=39912217837761).

You get the idea. This is the US site because I live in the USA but it's a UK company so if you're in the UK, you're okay, too. 

Apart from Brastop, if you're in the US, I'd head to Amazon and search for a 30DD bra. You should get plenty of choices. I see bras in 30DD with low gores by b'temptd and Calvin Klein on sale in your price range, for example. 

Whether any of these bras will fit you is another story. Based on what you've told us, I have honestly no idea. Shape is just as important for fit as size. Reading the Wiki can help you figure that out. Once you do, [Shape Guide for Projection and Vertical Fullness](https://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/myp66c/projectguide_shape_guide_for_projection_and/) can help you decide what bras to try. 

If you order from Brastop using PayPal, you can get your shipping refunded if you need to return. If you have Amazon Prime, you can order up to 8 items and only pay for what you keep. No shipping charge, free returns. Wherever you decide to shop, try for free shipping and if possible free returns. 

I hope you are the exception, but most of us don't hit the jackpot with our first purchase.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Interesting question. I spent more than a year on Weight Watchers and I definitely think I ended up with some disordered behaviors. For one, I was weighing myself five or six times a day. When I had to eat at a restaurant, I'd have some pretty serious anxiety because I couldn't accurately calculate the points value for my food. Instead of doing the best I could and moving on, I would obsess about it. What if they used butter? How much butter? What if the portion size is larger than I think it is? What if, what if, what if ... Also, I lost all ability to tell whether I was fat. Objectively I no longer was‚ÄîI got down to a normal BMI‚Äîbut I didn't trust the mirror. I literally could not tell if I was still fat. It really wasn't healthy. Now, I don't mean to bash Weight Watchers. I think there's a lot that's good about the program.

3. I think we'll  have a correction at a minimum. Prices won't rise forever and eventually demand will drop; people don't have infinite buying power. But I don't know when it will be, and whether or not it will stay a correction or turn into a true crash. There are just so many factors at play.

4. On the one hand, a crash could make it easier for me to buy a house. On the other, there could be spillover effects in the larger economy if it got bad enough. But all in all, I'm positioned alright to take advantage of a crash.",1635725003

What does it do when you wind it? With the watch sitting on a able unwound, what happens if you give it a few winds with moving it any more than necessary? Does the seconds hand move a bit and stop?

The mainspring cam is what keeps the mainspring barrel from reversing and allows the whole movement to retain tension on the spring. It's right next to the mainspring barrel and if it comes out of skew or it's spring comes unseated than the  mainspring loses tension and can't hold tension.",1635725003
"antiwork","t5_2y77d","As if 7.77x min wage is a ton of money. Many lawyers, particularly younger ones, are just getting by after making their student loan payments. 

And 7.77x is not accurate because lawyers don‚Äôt tend to work a standard 40 hour week. Take the median lawyer‚Äôs weekly salary and divide by something closer to 50 or 60 hours instead of 40. 

Finally, lawyers can probably help you with the problems discussed in this sub more than anyone else. Many of the things posted here are illegal and would stop if more people consulted a lawyer. Many will do a free initial consultation or work on a contingency fee arrangement. You can bitch about the CEOs, landlords, financiers, etc. but the problems that r/antiwork is trying to bring to light are legal issues. You need the lawyers on your side.",1635725003

"zelda","t5_2r61g","The 3DS version alters/changes a lot of stuff and some of them for the worse (Most of them actually). So lets get on it:

- Clock Town layout is changed slightly. 

- Saving. You no longer need to hit the Owl Statue for the first time to be able to use it. You also can save without quitting (This is a good change).

- Zora Swimming. This one I don't get it. In the N64 version you can swim at full speed whenever you want. In the 3DS, you need to use Magic to be able to do so. Once it depleted, your swimming animation changes and you swim slower.

- Secret Songs to advance time were reworked allowing you to pick specifically how much time you want to advance. This is a good change seeing how many quests involved waiting until a specific timeframe to be able to progress them. You would need to just sit and wait for 5 or 10 minutes and even more in the later quests of the game that span the entire three days cycle.

- Bosses were heavily altered. This is the worst offender to be honest. Every boss fight was heavily altered because speedrunners found a way to ""one cycle"" every fight and Grezzo is known for trying to shoot them down if they can. Before, fights were the usual ""smack this guy whenever he is stunned"". Now, whenever you stun the boss, a giant eye pops out and thats the actual boss's HP, meaning you can't one cycle anymore. Some bosses like the 3rd and the 4th were completely overhauled and the fight is completely different from the N64 counterpart.

There are a lot of other minor changes that don't impact the player if he has no prior knowledge of what was changed but it still bugs me and a lot of people who played the N64 version.

Now I'm biased. I played the original N64 version when I was a kid so I'm going to tell you to go for the N64 one. I think the changes in the 3DS do more harm than good for the game. Keep in mind that this is coming from someone who likes the 3DS version of Ocarina of Time.",1635725005

Amy and Carl did set Upsilon to automate, yes, but also to shut down the power after a certain amount of time (hence the ""13 days"" message). I always figured that was the intention, put it in automation to give Amy and Carl time to evacuate using the shuttles, then shut itself off. See date 2103-05-03 where Amy is concerned Wau helpers will turn the power back on after they leave, so they seal off areas to prevent that.

Then ""everything went to hell"", Carl is killed, Amy on her own makes her way to the shuttles but must've run out of time because she needs to hook up emergency power, but is attacked and left ""alive"" there for basically a year until Simon finds her. And at this time Wau makes it's first attempt at creating Simon and fails, giving up until a year later. But the point is those ""13 days"" of power remaining weren't 13 days after Simon was born, but 13 days after Wau first attempted to bring Simon online. So Wau was perfectly fine without power for a good year.",1635725007

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","I would not be surprised if a high level appraiser would be able to tell the difference between a natural 100 gram gem / ingot, vs. a 12.5 gram gem / ingot whose volume / weight had been scaled up by a factor of 8.

Just like Sense Motive can detect an enchanted personality at DC 20/25 (forget which), a jeweller might be able to do the same with magical counterfeits. I imagine that a magical scaling effect would probably affect the patterns and textures inside the gem and on the surface, as well as reflection and refraction of light.

A small quibble, if you take a tiny cut gem and increase its size, the cut will no longer appear to be quite as fine due to the change in resolution.

And the larger a gem you're trying to pass off as genuine, the bigger a merchant you'll have to seek out, and it's more likely that they'll be 3rd, 5th, 8th-level Expert. If you have a (fake) ruby the size of your fist, you might be redirected until you're meeting a retired 13th-level wizard. And in a medieval fantasy universe, any logical shopkeeper is going to spend increasing amounts of gold on protections for their goods - just *starting* with Detect Magic.

The thing is, it's not wrong for players to get up to a little fair level appropriate misbehavior - sometimes the adventure they really want, is a life of crime. Instead of fights with monsters for XP and gold you can sub out for storylines about jumping through hoops to defraud vendors and still award XP / gold. Just like combat encounters, however, they should face off against appropriate challenges for their goal.",1635725008

"Empaths","t5_2zhl2","Honestly Ive been in this position, narcissism, bpd and autism all look similar and are developmental, its complicated and a diagnosis is pointless unless it helps you identify behaviours but most important thing is working through your trauma and processing it. 

Dont feel bad about the way you feel about things, Ive felt the same about things. When I was six the only person that was nice in my family of narcissists died (my grandad) and I remember watching ppl cry and stuff and I thought they were all just pretending (because I didnt feel anything/couldnt relate) but truth is I was already deeply traumatised by six and the last thing that should be expected of me is to have normal emotional reactions. Thats why I say just keep processing your trauma, if you are doing something and over a week you can look back and go ""hey I dont feel like I did a week ago, I feel less shame and feel less anxious and more connected"" then you are on the right path and just keep going at it noticing the changes. If you had a shitty childhood there is not much point slapping a nasty label on yourself. Just get into therapy if you can as its a good support and encourages making progress, if you can but most work is done outside of therapy for me and most anyway. 

Will you be a 'narcissist' or 'bpd' if you enter a relationship? Yeah whatever label fits the boat at that time but another way of looking at it is, will you have a healthy relationship when you are deeply traumatised? No, it most likely will not be healthy, as you are deeply traumatised and until you work through it it will be a bit of a shit show. I was in a relationship with a narcissistic girl, got traumatised by it, watched videos about recover from narcissistic abuse, learned the world isnt black and white and it takes two to tango and I had problems too, since then, Ive processed so much trauma I come across more healthy than most people I come across as in my social skills are good, my emotions are normal amd make more sense (still have trauma tho but the majority of me is healed and the trauma is the minor part of me). 

So yeah, dont beat yourself up friend, processing trauma is the main way and it might take time but it get easier as you get familiar with yourself and start understanding your emotions/trauma better.",1635725008

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

&gt;I am unfortunately no stranger to witnessing violent acts, and I know that creates a heavy bias. **I'm aware of those biases and will come by them honestly. I think we all probably have experiences that impact how we watch the show and view the characters, and I think that makes the fandom really unique.**

&gt;I agree with the Mona/Alison statement/comparison. I mentioned in a previous reply that I think these characters suffered from bad writing on many levels, but especially the way mental illness was handled.

I totally agree with everything. I bolded your statement on biases because we all have them but sometimes in fandom, peoples bias show through in their opinions and they are stated like they are facts. Which is why I always push for full story and context and it‚Äôs okay if someone has a differing opinion from you as long as they are respectful and that view isn‚Äôt damaging to others.

"JuniorDoctorsUK","t5_4bij9","Lol bullshit. He‚Äôs looking at guaranteed earnings of a practice in Perth. That‚Äôs an incentive put in place so you know how much you‚Äôll get while building your patient base/reputation. In reality most GPs I know make about 250-260k when they‚Äôve established themselves working comparatively chill days. In Perth I‚Äôd expect closer to 300k as they can charge (demographics). I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the practice at the top was around $400k but it depends on the structure of fees, services provided and if they provide any inpatient care. For the practice that had been linked with guaranteed earnings, I‚Äôd expect 300-320k with 70% of billings. Bulk-billing practices like that are pretty shit though and I wouldn‚Äôt want to stay there for long.

That‚Äôs all borne out by the facebook groups I‚Äôm in where Australian doctors talk about how to make more money (and by extension work out roughly what they should be making), where to invest their money and which airlines have the best business and first class products (Qatar). None of them wish they worked in the UK or the US, nor do they constantly complain about how much they earn or want to take industrial action. 

250k is usually around 140-150k GBP. Cost of living is 10% higher than the UK. Apparently you lot work full time hours for 3 days a week pay. In summary, u/Interesting-Curve-70 is a complete mug if he/she actually believes this shit.

Obviously, python would be a lot slower compared to the low level languages, but if you can achieve acceptable performance, then why not?

Another thing to take into consideration: if you are using yocto to build your system, there may be some python packages you will need to create. If you do download a python package via PyPi, the package may not be optimized for your system/use-case (looking at all of you python packages that has Cython or some sort of C binding under the hood).

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","Me, right here. I'm a government employee in an agency that everyone in the US has heard of. I have healthcare, a pension, a union, a fully remote 4 day workweek (10 hr days) and I can complete all my assigned tasks and even substantially improve on my division's established work processes in way less time than I spend on the clock each day. My management team is great, fully acknowledges that I know what I'm doing, and leaves me alone. I don't sit in meetings all day and I don't have anyone obviously looking over my shoulder. 

My work is satisfying and helps a lot of people who depend on my agency. But most of what I do can be automated, and in fact these days most of what I do is figure out how to automate my job out of existence. In a just world my reward for that would be immediate retirement with full benefits, but in reality I'll probably just be asked to do the same for some other component, rinse and repeat. 

I won't be eligible for retirement for at least 15 years. There's so much I want to do that has nothing to do with work, and even with all the flexibilities this job offers, I can't really squeeze any of it in without neglecting my family or my health. I am super lucky, yet I still feel the days slipping by without getting what I want out of them.

But in deciding to want to live your life, despite of mental illness, is liberating and can be a great step in the journey of recovery. Consider, what are you saying 'fuck it' to specifically?

What I'm trying to tell you  is that the wires are thicker 16 awg vs thinner 18 awg pcie that come standard in pc psu.

18 awg wire capacity is 10 amp, less 80 rule is 8 amps.  8 x 12v = 96.

3 PCIE x 96 watts = 288 watts

The 16 awg pcie wires are from server psu and are often used in asic miners.  The capacity of 16 awg is 13 amp.

You'll often see the claim of 468 watts for pcie on 16 awg.   That is actually 13 x 12 = 156.

3 PCIE x 156 watts = 468 watts (but they are not reducing for 80% rule).

"latterdaysaints","t5_2uas2","No problem at all. 

Re the self-sabotage point: I agree people do that here on earth, but only because they cannot see things clearly/eternally. God will at some point remove the limitations and allow us to see things as they really are. Then I think everyone would willingly choose Christ. If they won't then to me that's equivalent to a drowning man being thrown a life jacket and refusing to accept it. No-one in their right mind would do that. They would have to be insane. God won't penalise us if we are insane.

Re the speculation and tertiary pursuits: I like to study the gospel in depth. I think God has encouraged us to do that. Lots and lots of scriptures counsel us to search out the mysteries of godliness. Don't think there's any issue with that as long as you keep the commandments at the forefront - particularly the big two: love God and love your fellow man.

My interest personally is in trying to understand the nature of absolute truth vs. the layers of narrative we have superimposed over the top that we assume to be true, but probably aren't. Lots of things in the gospel are either figurative or temporal (or both) and do not necessarily describe absolute reality. If we anchor ourselves to rigid, literal interpretations of things that are intended to be taken figuratively we can end up becoming dogmatic and intolerant, which is a problem.",1635725011

"darksouls","t5_2sazo","But you have never finished before? 

Well, spellcaster are the most unique build, DS was created with a specific playstyle as base. You can customize to a point, choose your weapon, armor, pick spells, but It'll hardly change the gameplay significantly.

I had a problem with something similar, Hope my story helps you.

The First 3 times I played dark souls I couldn't finish, Just bad luck, currupted save, control died and stuff, always at anor londo. So I had to replay the First half four times, same goddam build.

The kicker was, each time was months appart from one another, and the last one, years apart, so I had forgot a lot of things, same build, but a better player with New mindset that sees the game in a different way. Since I had forgot a lot of Things, I had a lot of fun exploring lordran for the last time, didn't wanted to miss a single detail.

Never had much Focus on different builds, since the Very First playthrough I stuck with hybrid, it's the most diverse build and now that I'm good, I can afford the below avarage HP and test many of the weapons and playstyles. Until O&amp;S I had a strength build with BK sword, but them switched to a faster playstyle with dex and grass crest shield, hybrid build allows for this types of changes.

Still, addapting to the circustances never was the main attraction of dark souls for me, If I want to test vastly divergente playstyles, I Go for league. The beauty of dark souls is to explore the world.",1635725012

These art pieces often don't really represent this life, or at least not truthfully. Maybe you're thinking of the paintings by Brueghel the Elder? That's early modern, already: there are medieval works that show this, but often the two are conflated (another problem in movies and popular perception). 

For instance, there are the Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry and the Canterbury tales ‚Äî to an extent (top of my head). When going back to the original question of OP, we see a problem: few pieces of secular art from the early middle ages remain. Frankly, there's only one: the Bayeux tapestry and there's barely a peasant on there. If there is, it's mostly in the extraordinary context of war.

To know the peasants, and humans in general, look at their trash. That's where archeology steps in, when history and often art history just can't provide.

Almost no one is remembered. We probably will be, in some form or another. My comments as ""belgiumfunnomore"" will be here long after I've gone to meet whatever is beyond the veil head on. That's historical, right there. These daily and banal actions are historical, because they are part of one of the biggest revolutions of the last decades: the internet and the interconnectedness it bestowed on mankind. That's scary and invigorating at the same time, and I don't know what I would prefer either. Be part of this moment, or keep to myself? But, I see this as an opportunity, to try and prove worthy of being remembered.",1635725013

Same with the rulers of a land. If he allows it, its not automatically kufr akbar. Its kufr doona kufr. Meaning minor kufr.

BUT if someone believes he has the RIGHT to make these rules, and/or claims this is halal, THEN that is kufr akbar

**Good** - Discussion is rooted in science, provides links to peer reviewed science, and it focuses on the food taking into consideration any of poster's stated goals. Recipe improvements are encouraged. EDUCATING your POV without BERATING others for theirs.

**Bad** - Generalizations and assumptions about ingredients, portions, the poster or their diet (ask instead) and the sub. Non-constructive criticisms.  Claiming something is ""unhealthy"" without linking to sources. Gatekeeping. Expectations that pictured foods should be perfectly ""healthy"".

**Not Allowed** - (removal or ban territory) attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, vote complaining, trolling, crusading, activism and agitation trolling, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy.

It'd be hard to convince me the high school I went to, being overwhelmingly white and christian, was not homogenous. So respectfully, I think your definition is unnecessarily narrow, and not all that useful.

Without any sources or references it's hard to drill into that 20% of people experiencing it at some point in adulthood. Even to take the statistic as accurate, it says nothing of who this is pulling from, or what other circumstantial factors are involved. Poverty in a small college town or a failing oil community will look very different, just as poverty in a thriving metropolis will look different. State to state, county to county. 

But I apologize for not being direct with my question: is your view that poverty does not have much of an impact on a community's ability to overcome social issues? Or at least, is it your view that this is overstated? I'm confused as to what it is that's being debunked.",1635725015

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","EDIT and WARNING: Long, current world affairs news

   One of two things; Denial or suppression of memory and a false sense  patriotism...

    The discrepancy of how the individual, of a minimum 25 years in the United States, was issued an order of attack so quietly and possibly a language not understood by this target - of not knowing why in the identical way of having someone uninformed, of a rank enough and both given and gave orders, without a response of being understood and not necessary but.. perhaps it's urgency or the time being near impeccable to current questions and no one, in the entirety of ArmyINSCOM was educated or the information - conviently spread around to a group that put it all together again.

   To now understand in that, not only was that one individual whom had influenced a people so thoroughly, the war seemingly unfair as to his affiliation to anyone or sizable army to his aid had been his stature - Medium or average, with slightly more applied it hand been brain power. 

   What came first, a decision made where pride to be had for a man and who's following was capable of influencing with such confidence, reasoning and the 'once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity' of how happy everyone had been in torturing a family member, friend and where the government of the people allowing the people to govern.

   Where this world has found a man mispronouncing his name and a group of kids yet graduated from school, having been smart and intelligent enough to create the information some organization the federal government paid some 200 million to reward, a prestiges award to the ACTIVE servicing military member of the United States when consideration of the prisoner of war being tortured created information in how they were clueless was being done with, a prize to nobility awarded to that whom didn't source their information and ask where he got it from, the science of basic fundamental laws of all matters concerning artificial intelligence being a man that when everyone was too lazy to do so - saved his own life, with all the newest information of any given moment and good being done within the last 4 years. 
   Even the good done with a firearm and the need for one, justified and a punishable form to death of a squad which is at the ready and eager for the command and not of this country. 

   The blunt force trauma of this country had been unforseen and unprofessional, that of which could be impossible of natural cause would of been explosive and concussive headaches in intervals being between a few seconds each because what explained to a medical professional hadn't been concerning or concerned about - despite the two transcribing nurses, an unknown individual and then the doctor of a next visit and what is wide spread news, of no release of information signed by the human, is factually checkable to records I've possession of on this CD information had been burned to.
   Where there may of been a situation in what had been an even more severe attack by military grade weapons, synthesizing equipment and now civilized spy gear that I wrote to ArmyINSCOM and the FBI of June, 2018 and the information sent had been 30 or so minutes after a phone call regarding information on Cyber Warfare via email and has continued for the last 3+ years of ongoing attacks, experiments of my brain and body and/or torture by the United States of America.

Unfortunately, the idea was great, but the execution wasn't.

There were intermittant connection problems, so it sometimes didn't know where they were last connected.  Lastly, because they are portable devices (without thier own transmitter), if they were lost somewhere like a bus and the bus moved on, then there was no way they would be where the app said they were.",1635725016

"Superstonk","t5_43zwn1","Everyone who brings up the fact that whales, tons of them, will become billionaires and who is going to pay for all of this have valid points to an extent, but selling early because of these hypothetical scenarios isn't the play. It's the FUD. If the government steps in, they step in, but if you sell before that point, you lose your right to say and negotiate shit. You also potentially lose out on millions and millions of dollars in profit alone with all of the other paperhands while, say, 3-5 percent of the diamond hands get paid at the higher price points GME hits.

Or maybe they slow squeeze this to make less of a stink, right? 3000 new billionaires in a month makes quite a stink, but what if this slow squeezes over the next 5 years, with intermittent stock splits. This way, the stock price doesn't seem as insane and the new ""billionaires"" will have become that over a longer duration, drawing less attention. And when I say slow squeeze, I mean the type of squeeze that is slow relative to what we're expecting. Like, for example, we 50x, then a split, then we 50x a few months later, then a split, etc.

Or what if it's a cluster fuck and the MOASS blows all at once. Maybe the government gurantees full payout over a period of no more than 5 years, with different allocations depending on amount invested, to ensure we get paid insane amounts upfront, and the rest over the next year or two.

Or maybe RC figures something out for us because he's smarter than you.

Or maybe the FED just Brrrrrrrssssss and NDAs us (or not)

Who started it, is all speculation. Fact is that you didn't know them and I didn't know them. Gabby is clearly a victim here because she was murdered and in no way would I justify that. Whatever happened does not justify her murder. 

Now that things are being questioned, because of witnesses sharing what they saw, does not mean that that it justifies her murder. What's being questioned here is the dynamics of their relationship and not of her murder. 

The truth is, we don't even know IF Gabby lied in the video. Sometimes, abusers can drive you crazy just with their words and then the victim starts the fight. This could've happened, but it also might not have been. 

I do not think at all a murder was justified, but we also don't know anything at all whatsoever regarding the dynamics of their relationship. We don't know if they were ""just as abusive"" to each other. We literally don't know. Her parents didn't know, so how could we? 

Point being, I most definitely do not justify her being killed, but we also don't know anything about their relationship so aside from that, everything is really just speculation.",1635725017

They already have an abundance of options, with literally 5 different BDL characters they could pick from, two of them (Cinque and Gladio) with double BDL. Again, original Dark Odin teams were 1-2 BDLs at *most* and USBs otherwise. An Ingus/Cinque/Gladio/Tyro/Elarra team can definitely do this fight and fairly smoothly. And if they need an upgrade on a chain with Ingus, they can now buy Galuf or Machina once they have enough level 4 lenses, so no need to use tickets fishing for that.

The trap that newer players fall into is thinking that what they have isn't good enough and they need to get more and more to overpower content instead of learning the actual strategies needed. That's where OP is right now.  They have plenty of tools. They don't need more at the moment. Making them think that they do distracts them from actually learning the fight.",1635725017

The *REAL* plan here is to get the bridge built, creating the need for a nearby parking lot.  The generous land owner will then either give or sell a bit of the land down there for the parking lot (remember the land owner is already *donating* the east side land for the bridge).  To get to the parking lot you need a road to get down there.  And that is the catch - It's a pretty expensive proposition to get a paved road to there.  But if one was there all of that nice riverfront land would be perfect for a bunch of McMansions and the land would be worth much, much more than it is today.

I think there was traditionally also a bit of offerings made to some of the 9 stars - each represents a different function (fishing, fertility, rain etc) but I‚Äôve not gone that in depth yet.

It‚Äôs just been declared a national public holiday in New Zealand - first year next year - so how it will work on a national level is still up in the air, but I suspect there will be night markets and celebrations so I might as well tie it together!",1635725017

I have been making a kind of ""egg"" casserole thing when I'm feeling lazy that is super easy and comes out very tasty.

Put a couple cups of diced frozen breakfast potatoes and one can of diced green chilies in a 9x9 baking dish and cover with one bottle of Just Egg. Top with cheese and bake in a 350 oven for 45 minutes or until set. 

It puffs up and comes out similar to a frittata. You can serve a square of that with side salad for a more complete meal.

Thus stoves, unlike fireplaces, had to be cleaned at the end of each day, and stove polish (a black, waxy material) applied fairly regularly, in order to ward off the danger of rust.

Of course it would be quicker and more intuitive for one person to do both and to just switch seats each level, but our way demanded more communication, which made the game way more immersive and colorful.

"GlobalOffensive","t5_2sqho","The thing is that I can't play valve matchmaking too much because if I do, I will always end up with a terrible trust factor after a week.

Usually the first games are good, but after too many games I guess I get reported for cheating too often and my trust factor is getting worse.

So basically I can only play on third party servers if I don't want a relatively bad TF. You can email Valve as much as you want they don't care.

So yeah I think Valve is doing a terrible job with trust factor. 

Surprisingly players in low trust factor are actually worse so you get reported even more. Also because they meet cheaters more often they usually don't hesitate to report.

Usually they are new players cheating, and when they cheat if they are only wallhacking they are so free because they always slow peek corners looking at you. You buy awp and they can't kill you, then they cheat harder....

But this is not interesting and valve should do something it is not playable.

The only time when I didn't meet cheaters was when I made an account where I forced myself to play really bad to not get reported, it worked but what's the point...",1635725021

That‚Äôs as far back as we can trace our family roots. I only found it because a relative had managed to trace back to the slave, and then I started researching people with my last name in NC and found a website of a woman who‚Äôd done research on her family - a white woman.

Unions are bastards and will totally fuck your productivity if you let them have the chance. The only way to deal with unions, especially the British sort, is sharp, decisive counter-union action. Building new union institutions that take into account things like productivity increases, the status of workers whom aren't allowed into unions [he's particularly derisive of unions that clock up overtime while not hiring new employees], and rely on actually intelligent people with degrees and an understanding of economics and business, also works.


For the most part the Anglosphere's managed to figure this bit out though public labor unions remain an exception there [and shouldn't exist in any case].",1635725022

So for the potions that are good (Battle Elixir, Destruction Elixir, Honor/Malice, Fate/Sage Tonic), Dried Slime, Arastite ore (both from room 2 of /orecavern), Chaoroot and Doomatter (both bought from swindle) are all good and easy options to farm and get the potions.",1635725022

I'm fairly well convinced he saw the broken window, saw us come out of the woods a little after sundown, and harassed us because he could.

For a visa you'll generally need acceptance from a university, language certificate if studies are in German (vast majority of programs are) and around 10k Euros blocked account from which you'll get paid monthly, this is meant to be used to support you during your first year. During your studies, you can take part time employment. You can look into universities and check what their admission requirements are and whether your current education qualifies you to apply for a Uni, or if you need to do something additional.

They're with a smaller company (TOP Media).

"3commasCommunity","t5_l7vjo","I calculate the cost of the coins purchased to start the bot, and factor that with the value of the coins left over after bot is stopped. and factor that with the total dollar profit that the grid bot has earned during the duration it ran.

When you add the two numbers together it may add to the bots profit if coins are worth more now that at start or substract from bot profit if the coin's value is less than at buy in.

If the value of the coins left over is lower than buy in which will significantly decrease the bot's profit, I will hold the left over coins and wait for a better price before selling them.

Over the last thirty day My spreadsheet is showing my total P/L is negative for two bots that I closed. However, they are minor compared to the overall P/L.

I don't really take a ""break even"" level into consideration when I decide to stop a bot. It is based on my performance threshold of 1% average daily profit. If a bots is (over the course of 3 days falling under that 1% I close it to allocate the free up funds to other better performing bots or start new ones.

My ultimate performance is measured by my portfolios value.

Since I began this Crypto adventure in July:

My cash deposits into my account: $7,835

Current portfolio value: $13,308

So the overall profit of my Crypto activities is: $5,473

I also look at the time duration for each $1,000 in profit as displayed in the 3Commas mobile app.

The first two $1,000 in profit took 32, and 31 days to reach

Then it took significantly less days for each of the next three $1,000

Three days ago, my fifth $1,000 took only 7 days to earn with my grid bots.

"vintageaudio","t5_2svvy","So I acquired a pair of ar tsw 610s about a month ago, and I realized that none of my amps were really adequate to bring out the best sound in those speakers. This led me on an online search for a decent integrated amp under $200, which brought me to this example of a Denon PMA-757. The PMA-757 provides 80w into 8 ohms, 100w into 4 ohms, and has outstanding build quality. Not only does the thing weigh a ton, but it also has metal knobs (not something that I really expected from an 80s amplifier). The faceplate is all metal, and the only spot where plastic is used is on the loudness, phono selector, and tone control buttons. It also has some really cool features, such as a subsonic filter, a reverse stereo option in addition to mono, and most importantly, MC phono cartridge compatibility. While I decided on an at12sa for my turntable, it is good to know that I could eventually upgrade to a denon MC cart and not need a brand new phono preamp for it. The amp sounds great as well; I tested it with a pair of ads l300s and it is highly detailed, and a slight bit warmer sounding than my jvc jr-s300. It clearly wanted to be paired with bigger speakers than those though, and since the ars still need refoaming of the woofers, I tried it with a pair of celestion ditton 110s. I never liked those speakers, but I can say that those paired with this amp sound a lot better than with any other one I've tried; the warm tone of the amplifier helps to mitigate the screaming midrange of those speakers. While I can't try out the phono section yet, I am assuming that it sounds pretty good. 

Overall, this amp is great, especially for the $150 I paid for it. I'm surprised that these units don't sell for more than they do, they're very good.",1635725025

&gt;You can cash a minimum of $25 or any amount above that in 1-cent increments. If you cash only a portion of the bond‚Äôs value, you must leave at least $25 in the TreasuryDirect account.¬†

So, as long as you hit the $25 minimum, and there's at least $25 left, afterwards, you can go as partial as you want.",1635725026

&gt;&gt; Esta medida busca que todas las acciones del gobierno nacional contengan a las personas con discapacidad, un colectivo hist√≥ricamente invisibilizado y que todav√≠a enfrenta enormes barreras impuestas por el Estado y la sociedad toda para alcanzar su inclusi√≥n.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; En cambio, este Gabinete permitir√° que las m√°ximas autoridades de cada dependencia se re√∫nan peri√≥dicamente en una mesa de trabajo para analizar y planificar c√≥mo incluyen a las personas con discapacidad en todas las acciones, programas y pol√≠ticas que ejecutan desde cada √°rea gubernamental.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Nosotros, desde la Agencia Nacional de Discapacidad -que depende del Secretario General de la Presidencia, Julio Vitobello-, tendremos la enorme responsabilidad de asistir al Gabinete para la incorporaci√≥n efectiva de esta perspectiva en todo el quehacer gubernamental, tanto de forma general, aportando los fundamentos base del modelo social de la discapacidad como paradigma de construcci√≥n, como tambi√©n desde el rol de Secretar√≠a Administrativa de la Mesa de Coordinaci√≥n, que se ocupar√° de la sistematizaci√≥n operativa de las acciones del Gabinete y el seguimiento de las l√≠neas de trabajo que surjan en su marco.

Also, (without revisiting the picture), I recall that I didn't really like that POC women seemed to be front and center, and expressing the most distress. It seems like POC women have already been ACTUALLY routinely subjected to the trauma of dehumanization and humiliation and didn't really need to be depicted in some sort of role-reversal with cattle for people to imagine it... 

I also hold cows in very high regard and just felt really unwell about seeing them cast as the abusers in the illustration just for the purpose of juxtaposition. Anyone who has even met cows would know that they would NOT do the same to us if the roles were reversed...

I understand the picture's message. There often aren't objective right or wrong answers when it comes to art.

But, while I respect your preference for demos to be removed, I personally have pretty much the opposite opinion about what's most fun in the game :D I'd definitely support Psyonix adding a non-contact mode though, for players who share your preference.",1635725028

Vala supposedly gets pulled into the unstable wormhole and sent to the Ori Galaxy. (yeah, I know that sentence makes no sense if you haven't seen the show. No, I'm not going to explain 10 season of this show to make it make sense)

Multiple problems with that
1) It would have been an incoming wormhole from the Ori Galaxy. Pretty much since the first episode of the series it was established that you can only travel through a wormhole in 1 direction and therefore she would not have been able to travel through the wormhole backwards.
     
2) In Season 9 Ep 19 ""Crusade"" we learn that Vala was in fact sent to the Ori Galaxy. In ""Beachhead"" we surmise that the Ori have a Black Hole of the other end powering the Stargate. However, Vala ends up on a planet, which is clearly orbiting a star. Ignoring point 1 for a moment, if she could have travelled backwards through the wormhole, she would have ended up in space, and probably pulled into the black hole. Or given that she was dematerialized by the Ring Transporter at the time, she would have just disintegrated.",1635725028

„ÄåDead Loss Angeles„Äçis a Close-Range Stand wielded by Doctor Harry Mournwell, an Orthapaedic Surgeon and member of the Science Team working at the Rising Sun Facility, which allows the User to manifest sharp and thin bone tendrils from his back, which can act as flails and stabbing arms.

The User is also able to soften the bones of the people that the bone tendrils penetrate, while also causing the bones to act like magnets and become attached to one another, effectively causing affected individuals to become locked in-position. As well as this ability, the User can also willingly and painlessly segment the bones and tendons of his hands and fingers to both further the reach of his Stand and attack multiple targets at once.

When not manifesting as a fully-formed Stand, it will appear as a blistering black tar slick.

An Orthopaedic Surgeon and member of the Science Team working at the Rising Sun Facility, Doctor Harry Mournwell is an unusual accomplice to the Revolutionary Rock Humans led by Muninn Oberheim-Suzuki, in so far that he is in fact not a Rock Human.

Mournwell was once a promising and exemplary medical student widely believed by his peers to have a bright future ahead of him ‚Äì this future was suddenly ripped out from underneath him following his decline into drug addiction to heroin. Within five years, Mournwell went from a scholarly somebody to an afflicted liability. Eventually losing his prestige and standing in society, he spiraled into a depression which only his close friend and fellow Rising Sun collaborator Doctor Jacques-Jean Burnel could break him out of.

Eventually ditching the habit, both Mournwell and Burnel were approached by the Rising Sun to participate in an experiment at the Facility. After being given Stands, both men were eventually told of what the Rising Sun were working towards, and accepted to help them achieve their goals.

A person could be understood to be naturally confused as to why two humans would assist in the destruction of their own people. For Mournwell, it was an easy choice on two fronts:

* When presented with an enemy with overwhelming strength, the only correct course of action can be submission
* The opportunity to punish a society that actively shunned him and painted him to be evil for the act of self-indulgence and at the same time refuse to lift that individual from their addiction can simply go to hell.

Nazi scientists discovered Adrenochrome and used technologies (including MRNA!) to keep him young and healthy for decades.

Hitler and the allies realised they had a common enemy (communism), and negotiated a secret truce.  Germany would pretend to fall on the Western front, Hitler would fake his death and go into hiding in South America, and from there, the allies would mine his brain for propaganda techniques to fight communism.  They tested these ideas in South America.

Finally, they unleashed COVID-19 and 'left-wing politics' on the western world to teach us how vulnerable we are to communist ideology.  Soon the masks will come off, and we will be set on a new path to a 'glorious age of Western Fascism'.

Compared to the rest of the roster, they have insane grappling cardio. The short answer for the reason behind that is their lifestyles and training regimen.

Everyone on the roster is scared of being taken down. That, combined with their chain wrestling makes them unstoppable. Conor stopped Khabib's first takedown attempt. Most other fighters give up after one attempt and resort to a clinch. 

The chain wrestling and their impeccable timing results in them mostly ending up in dominant top positions and they have incredible top pressure. It's much harder to escape with the strikes involved. This pretty much sums up why they're so dominant.",1635725030

You really want to go somewhere else what about the hypocrisy that somebody that was drunk at 2:30 in the morning hit me head on and almost killed me you want to go there.

Now we can talk about the next door neighbors just got evicted why because they rather smoke fucking weed and pay their bills. We can go for my step brother being in and out of prison why because of fucking weed because he started smoking weed and weed move to cocaine. You want to start there you keep on going oh wait a minute let's see how about my son's friends 18 22 years old none of them have a job nothing want a job all they want to do is sit around smoke weed play fucking video games you want to go there. I sent you live in a strawberry field and you think everything is sunshine and Rosie and wonderful because you probably smoke weed all fucking day long and don't do anything else.

Every once in a while he has an amazing round, I thought the second with Lux was solid, his second with Calicoe was great, his second with Chilla Jones was phenomenal, he has great rounds and great material interspersed between okay shit or subpar shit. But Lux is one of those rappers, like Daylyt that can win a whole battle on high crafted lyricism alone. And I felt like Geechi should have had more than one great round, some good spots, and the rest okay spots and subpar spots for his battle with Lux, because, like Geechi said, fuck what I say, Lux is the endboss.

""mine works fine"" fits the description. Sometimes, it works fine. Often, it doesn't.

Nothing phased me. My second one, I went in to the Dr office at 34 weeks and told them my hands and feet were itchy in an off handed way. I thought it was just because it was winter and my skin was dry. They told me to get bloodwork on the way out and I thought nothing of it. The next morning they called me and told me to come back in. I just figured they didn't get all the blood they needed or something cuz I'm notoriously stingy on blood draws. I went in, they told me to go straight to labor and delivery and that I had to have an emergency c section NOW. I looked my Dr in the eye, said no, and walked out. He chased me to the parking lot along with my mother, who had driven me. They asked why I was leaving and I told them I had to go hone and clean my room. I'm still not sure why. My room was perfectly clean, I always keep things tidy. It took them 20 minutes to convince m to get back inside the hospital because I was convinced I had to go clean my room. Turns out, I had cholestasis of pregnancy. Basically, being pregnant was causing my liver to shut down and it was killing us both. Having the baby immediately cures the problem, so I was totally fine after I had her. I was scared shitless though. She came out not vet weighing as much as a bag of sugar. I have never been so scared. She's perfectly fine though. Never even had to go to NICU. She's a fighter.",1635725032

&amp;#x200B;
Top 100 Argentine rock songs that the web site Rock.com.ar published on 7 June 2005.

A ranking that hasn't been as influential as the Top 100 by Rolling Stone &amp; MTV from 2002 (which influenced later rankings to such an extent that they copied many of the songs in its list), but still, this Top 100 by Rock.com.ar has been taken very much into account in media, articles, investigations and various conversations about the best Argentine rock songs of all times.

Furthermore, from an artistic point of view, the fact that it wasn't copied ends up as being positive, because one listens to a list which is unique and different from the others, while between the other rankings there are many songs that are repeated (it's too suspicious to see that a song which not even in Argentina is very known, is repeated in lists made by Mexicans, who could hardly have ever listened to that song... you can clearly see the lazyness and the ease of copy-pasting the list from Rolling Stone &amp; MTV).

However, on the other hand in this Top 100 from Rock.com.ar there are questionable choices which seem arbitrary. It's evident that the organizers were fans of bands from the '70s that didn't become relevant and that remained unknown. It's evident they have a bias towards protest or political songs. And how is it possible that in the top positions there are songs that aren't anthems of Argentine rock, nor they are even among the most popular in the setlists of their authors...?

The good: it is original and it has a criteria of its own.

The bad: it is biased and it limited itself to a very narrow segment in the huge world of Argentine rock.

--------------------------------------------
In the words of the ranking's organizers:

***""The 100 of the 40***

*If today someone came from a distant and strange place, Spanish-speaking or not, and we wanted to give him the coolest of our rock, what songs would we be thinking about?*

*Encouraged by that idea, and also to make a selection-kind of list that could act as a guide for newcomers, we the makers of rock.com.ar chose the 100 most important songs of the four decades of our rock.*

*Not caring about what era they are from, nor their style, nor their authorship.*

*Whether they have been (or are) great hits, or not.*

*(Considering this country is the place where there are 35 millions of coaches for the football national team, after this, each in its own will give the thumbs-up or not, and will make their own roster. And it's alright).*

*Here comes the 100.*

*You will say whether you agree or not...""*

"AoSLore","t5_i4mx9","&gt;I mean. It's literally their name, Stormcast Eternals, they are living storms cast down from the heavens to murder the forces of Chaos. There's dozens of books where they do it, they talk about being made of lightning all the time. They have to make all of their gear out of Sigmarite because it can transmute into lightning like they do

&amp;#x200B;

Gates of Azyr has them being encased in crystal cacoons 

&amp;#x200B;

""And so it was that he alone saw them come. He saw them borne down from the storm by the white-blue shafts and ripped from coils of shimmering magic. He saw them hurtle from the heart of the turning maelstrom, **encased in brilliant cocoons of light.** He saw them strike the earth with shuddering force. Where they crashed into the ground, domes of energy sprang up, each one swimming with raging coruscation. **Then the domes shattered, spraying fragments of crystalline matter across the burning land**, exposing the scions of the storm, the ones delivered by the wrath of the skies.""

&amp;#x200B;

""**Others strode out from their broken cocoons**, their movements fluid despite the weight of arcane armour. Their every movement was perfect, poised to perfection and suffused with god-like power. They strode out from the remnants of the lightning that had hurled them into reality, hefting their weapons with an eerie, fluid power.""

&amp;#x200B;

""He heard Lord Vandus issue the command to advance, and watched as the Liberators fell into their battle formations. **The last few of Anactos‚Äôs own troops broke free of their crystalline cocoons, racing to join his aerial vanguard.**

&amp;#x200B;

So they don't actually SMASH bodily into the ground. Either the magic of Sigmar protects them or they are encased in cacoons. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;I dug into the Lexicanum further. Several points in the Lexicanum, seemingly added by several different people, claim Guiliman beat Skullbrand. They say he stabbed him through the heart, not threw him from a building

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason why you shouldn't trust the Lexi then.

&amp;#x200B;

""Skarbrand bellowed in anger as explosive shells tore into his cranium and blew fleshy gobbets across the platform. Step by step, the Daemon was driven back, yet still he did not fall. Gritting his teeth at the sight of the enemy drawing close, Guilliman fired the last shells from his magazine, aiming for Amalrich‚Äôs black blade. A single bolt struck the weapon and blew the black sword apart in a storm of deadly shards. Skarbrand‚Äôs torso was shredded, and he toppled backwards off the platform with a final, furious roar.""

Then winter break happened, we came back in January, and he‚Ä¶. started turning in work. I thought it was new years momentum and would fade. Nope!!!
