""So I first create a parent.  It becomes a [daemon](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Daemon_%28computer_software%29), then spawns a bunch of children.  One of these makes sure that we're in [promiscuous mode](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Promiscuous_mode).  It starts snooping, waiting until it sees something interesting -- maybe activity from [SATAN](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/SATAN), maybe some other sort of [penetration test](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Penetration_test).  We're especially interested if we discover that the attacker is trying to [finger](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Finger_protocol) us or probe us in other sketchy ways, possibly poking around for a [back door](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Backdoor_%28computing%29).

At this point, we can assume that the attacker is trying to [exploit](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Exploit_%28computer_security%29) any of our weaknesses.
Our goal then becomes to lead the prober to a [honey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypots_in_espionage_fiction)[pot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_%28computing%29).

This system can expand greatly.  In our example setup, we have several local systems and another at home attached to my [naked DSL](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Naked_dsl) line.  During initial [negotiation](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Negotiation_%28BDSM%29), the children exchange connection information -- we want to keep our children responsive, and children with a [long, fat pipe](http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/proceedings/&amp;toc=comp/proceedings/ispan/2004/2135/00/2135toc.xml&amp;DOI=10.1109/ISPAN.2004.1300495) interacting with many other children will hurt performance of the system as a whole. They will choose a master and place the rest in a [master-slave](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Master-slave_%28computers%29) relationship with it.  Normally, we keep the children in a [jail](http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/chroot-practices.html), so that if the children themselves are attacked and successfully exploited, it's not a big concern -- it won't affect anything outside of the jail.

Our daemons provide synchronized termination.  When one dies, so do all the others.  Normally, we signal the children to [kill](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Kill_%28Unix%29) their parents.  If the parent is killed by someone else, no problem -- we just have its child notify the other daemons, then kill itself.  If the child is killed first, it will become a [zombie](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Zombie_process) unless the parent reaps it.  After the parent does so, it notifies the other daemons and kills itself.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","One of the questions posed to us at the end of a college class on moral reasoning:

&gt;*A student is entering the last two years of college and is beginning to think about a possible career. The student has focused on two areas: a biology (pre-med) program and classics (Latin and Greek language and cultural studies). The student has done very well in both areas. The student can imagine being a doctor working in public health, and seems to have all the makings of an excellent doctor. But Classics is the students real love - there is something about the ancient Mediterranean world which the student finds fascinating. What career choice should the student make?*

Does anyone think that this really presents a moral dilemma? Questions like this have been put to us for the whole quarter, and I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed. The above described scenario does not have one morally relevant aspect - it's amoral.

And yet I contrived several pages worth of explanation, going over egoism, conjuring up implicit social contracts, talking about virtue, and trying desperately to *somehow* contort Kant and Rawls' theories into having an opinion on the matter.

But it was all filler - drivel. In truth, this is not a moral question.

Am I just bad at moral philosophy, is this the kind of situation that moral philosophers really feel it is important to analyze?

*edit:*

*I'm not asking what the correct choice is. I'm just saying that [these](http://reddit.com/info/6lkgb/comments/c046zof) kinds of questions are amoral.*

*Yes, there may be some issues of **ethics** involved - but not morality, specifically. In other words, if the student goes into Classics, or into medicine, in neither case has he done something morally **wrong**. Framing it in terms of a moral choice implies that one of the options would be immoral.*

*If I [fail to go see my friend in the hospital](http://reddit.com/info/6lkgb/comments/c046zof), I haven't done something **morally wrong**. I've been a bad friend, I've probably decreased the chance that she might come see me if I get hurt - but it wouldn't make me a bad person, it wouldn't be immoral.*","1212278891"

However, most clients are dumb. And rather than take your professional, experienced word - they like to make you cave on some of those aspects.

Let me address each of your points just to hopefully keep things simple.

* I agree. Typically, I like to let the user choose their own password. My code will determine if it contains invalid characters, etc. However, many users will choose an easily guessed password and then will be pissed when their ""secure"" information is some how obtained. Generating the users password rarely solves any problems though as most applications allow the user to change their password. So overall, I agree with you.
* This doesn't really seem to be an issue if you're sending this URL automatically via email or if it is dynamically generated on the page. Clicking a link is the same no matter if it's long or short. Now if you have to type it in, that's another story. But why not just copy and paste? I've never seen a URL so long that 2 copy-n-paste methods wouldn't resolve.
* I agree. That's just stupid. Who actually does this? They need to learn about usability.
* I agree here as well. I've personally miss-guessed captcha's because they are so un-readable. Poor solution.
* I agree. I don't want spam. Who does? Unfortunately there are way to many clients that claim ""that's how I make my living!"" My typical response to that is, you should get a new job. You're going to get blacklisted and when you do - your days of spamming are over. This is one of the most ridiculous requests I hear - to automatically subscribe people. What's even worse is most clients don't want to use a subscription list that adheres to the law. They'd rather blast out a few thousand emails without a the required ""unsubscribe"" information.
* I agree there too. This is the first thing you should think of and implement when dealing with forms. That's just incredibly stupid and no where near user friendly. It's easy to do, so why not?
* Most likely, it's not the programmers scheme, it's the payment gateway's scheme. We can't help what formats these gateways accept. Although they are getting better. Most international credit data should and can be accepted. Another thing to remember here is that the user tends to enter wrong information, not update their information, or is using a card (credit or debit) that has insufficient funds or access. From my experience most of these denials can be attributed to the card issuer or card holder.


I'm in no way trying to discredit your concerns. I agree with most of them. I just want to show that it's not always up to the developer, which is in most cases - bullshit.","1212278949"

I can't imagine any solution being better but neither can I imagine anyone being truly happy about this. Obama supporters are rightly angered by the fact that their candidate didn't get a real chance to run in FL and Mi, and because of the way Hillary has used his respect for the rules against him and Hillary supporters are gonna be angered because they've just seen their last ray of hope die off... Meh...

“Forcing people to ""be free"" is exploitation. I believe in the self-determination of peoples. 
Well the people of Iraq wanted to get rid of Saddam. They even had an uprising like in 1991 that was crushed. 


“If tomorrow the Iraqis were to elect a hard-line Islamic fundamentalist regime in Iraq, the US would not allow it.””

They’re allowed Sharia Law in Afghanistan.. I don’t see why not. That simply wouldn’t be possible since they have 2 different religions that don’t want the same things.


“Their agenda, their goals, are to promote American empire to ensure American imperial dominance for the next century.”
“They wanted to exploit the US' military supremacy to translate the death of the USSR into a permanent state of US hyperpowerdom.”

Their agenda is to use America’s force to spread freedom and democracy, by force if necessary. While I personally don’t believe you can spread freedom by force, I think the goal o spreading freedom and democracy is a good one. However if you look at history, we’ve been generally bringing those values not by force, but by cultural dominance.


“And what's even worse than that is that they didn't say they wanted to impose democracy through war and death. They said Iraq was a direct and real threat to the safety of the citizens of the United States.”

In all fairness, the problems in Iraq have caused Iraq to be a huge base for Al Qaida types. So, while maybe under Saddam it wasn’t a threat to us, it is now. I didn’t hear before the war that “Iraq was a direct and real threat to the safety of the citizens of the United States”. I think that is the thinking now, and it makes logical sense. We fucked up their country, and if we don’t stay and fix it, they’re gonna come and fuck up our country.


“The whole premise of the Vietnam War and Korean War was to expel the Communist invaders. The world was free to choose its own destiny and America was there to protect everyone from this Communist takeover.”

That’s not at all what was happening. There was the first world, us, the second world, the communists, and the third world over which we fought. We didn’t fight for the third world to make up their own mind. When we defended Korea from the Communist invasion we didn’t then say “Okay, well now you guy decided if you want to be like us or like them.” We installed dictators there, built up a capitalist system, and like always, capitalism leads to democracy (though I’m sure we encouraged them too).


“Would you have supported launching a war?”

No, probably not. I think we should have helped when they gassed the Kurds, or better yet, I think we should have finished it off in the Gulf War. They had an uprising and wanted freedom.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_uprisings_in_Iraq

 It was kinda silly to do it out of the blue. But really, I don’t think we should be liberating anyone.  I think we should just stick to our own business and show others how to live by example, not by force. I think it just costs too much and it’s not up to us to do unilaterally.

I mean look at my initial argument
“I think they agenda from the start was to make a stable democratic Arab gov't to set an example for other countries in the region. Now we sorta screwed that one up big time...”

I never said I agree with that. I just said, I think that was the agenda. There is no evil empire building scheme or anything. I don’t think that is a good idea in retrospect, though at the time I supported it. I think the goal of bringing freedom and democracy to the world is just unrealistic. It’s like getting rid of poverty. We can’t do it on our own. I’d love to help the people of Iraq, Cuba, China, Iran, and other oppressed  countries, but I don’t think we should do that, because there is no good way of going about it. I think we should have let the German Empire win in WW1, and we should have never got into these foreign problems. Let the world figure its own problems out without us. It’ll be better that was in the long run

They are simply not self-sufficient in any way, shape, or form, so cutting them off from Israel's power, water, sanitation, and defense would spell certain disaster for all the colonists.  Most would not choose to stay and would leave, an effectively incomplete evacuation, leaving a meager yet sizable number of religious nutcases who would start stealing supplies to survive, and creating problems until some sort of Waco-like event happened, which would be a disaster.  The world has such a long history of these militant quasi-religious breakaway sects and the one thing we've learned is not to let them fester in solitude and paranoia like we did the Branch Davidians and Aum Shin Rikkyo.  They attract more psychos and dig into their land like ants in a hill.

If they ceased to write laws, their constituents would vote them out or see them as useless and maybe cut their exorbitant salaries.  To balance that, we have a Supreme Court that tries to make sure unconstitutional laws don't get enforced.  That's 9 people.  So, 500 versus 9.  And the 9?  They only meet a few times a year and hear a dozen or so cases.  The 500?  They meet almost year round and pass thousands of laws and resolutions every year.  The future is clear.  More laws.  And more laws means less freedom.  And, contrary to what the politicians would tell you if anyone ever had the balls to ask them when we'll have enough laws, there really is no constantly growing need for new laws.  So new laws will necessarily stray further and further outside of the bounds of the constitution and into the realm of personal freedoms.","1212281091"

Some times we are happy. Some times we are not. When we are happy, our interpersonal relationships improve; we go outside and do things, gain life experiences. After we are happy, those things stay with us. When we are unhappy, we look into ourselves often sacrificing relationships and activity. But after we are unhappy we have learned something important about ourselves.

If this doesn't resonate with you, I apologize for using the second person. I don't mean to say that that is what happens to everybody or that that is all that happens. What I am trying to say is that people who strive for happiness lose out on some good stuff.","1212281126"

For example in question it is assumed that if the student becomes a doctor he will save lives, that's not necessarily the case. If he doesn't like the job he might not become doctor (after all you don't just chose to become a doctor), or he might become a bad doctor and do more harm than good, or he might become a good doctor and save life of a tyrant that will be responsible for death of millions. And the same applies to classics, if he likes it he might make important discovery or hell know what else. The only thing that I can assume about the future is that the student will be more efficient at what he likes, and therefore his work potentially will be more beneficial to society. 

But if we assume that the student knows for **sure** that if he becomes a doctor he will do more good than a classics major, then the only right choice is to become a doctor. In that case it does become an interesting choice, should he chose something that is beneficial to him or to society, and then it's his choice. If the question is ""What career choice should the student make?"", the answer is: whatever choice he makes.","1212281494"

"environment","t5_2qh1n","&gt; I forget the Asimov title that explains this, but that was his argument, not mine, and it was a good one.

Naturally, having read Asimov since my childhood it was not lost on me. The essay was called the ""Relativity of Wrong"". Indeed, those with limited knowledge thought the earth flat, when with more knowledge it was held to be round -- yet there were those who still rejected the idea to the extent that Columbus' voyage was deemed near idiocy. This is a potentially *great* parallel for today's debate on global warming, because even as modern science builds its case there are those who still reject it. But lastly this was in my original comment a simple throw-away line to include several common science-denying positions and not as a serious point of debate, which I think is pretty clear. But Asimov is using this tale for a point:

&gt; What actually happens is that once scientists get hold of a good concept they gradually refine and extend it with greater and greater subtlety as their instruments of measurement improve. Theories are not so much wrong as incomplete.

This is precisely what is happening as we refine and extend our theories in so many fields: biology and neuroscience discovering how damaging pollutants and toxins can be even in small amounts, particular for infants, when in years past we painted our houses with lead paint and stuffed asbestos into insulation; how climatologists are refining their models to show demonstrably that not only is there of course the background periodic and episodic climate change of earth, but that the actions of humans, despite the incredulity of it at its face, considering the sizes of the oceans and atmosphere, are influencing this as well.

Asimov's point wasn't so much about flat-earth vs. roundish-earth (for there was also the time where we thought maybe the earth was truly spherical, when it is not) but in response to a non-scientists criticism of science for producing wrong theories (such as flat-earth and sphere-earth) and wondering when we would have cube-earth and so on. The point is that science is a process of refinement, and over the past few decades this refinement has been leading scientists to conclude that there is a human effect on our atmosphere, oceans, and temperature.

&gt; Such things are lost on those like yourself, those that would vote me down.

Actually, I voted you up, sorry to disappoint. But apparently Asimov's point was lost on you, which disappoints me, because I have long enjoyed reading your comments.

From Asimov's [essay](http://chem.tufts.edu/AnswersInScience/RelativityofWrong.htm):

&gt; My answer to him was, ""John, when people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.""

Somebody *today* who is a flat-earther is wrong, and I am not ashamed or afraid to say so. Only time will tell whether in 1000 years the advances of science will continue to confirm or, finally, reject the idea of human influence on climate change. I won't be surprised either way, because I'll likely be dead. But also because I don't claim to have the answers. I can only go on what the best science of today is saying, and it's saying we should figure some things out about how we pollute.","1212282511"

Ah, at casual the glance generally offered to comments on Reddit (by me as well, I'm not faulting) it probably looks like I'm some dude who's pissed off over some petty downvote. For a few weeks I've felt the Reddit community shifting slowly from interesting debate to lolcats and insults, from friendly discussion to spiteful digs. More and more often I'm seeing people who ask valid questions voted down and insulted. And more and more I'm seeing members voting a comment down because

* they disagree with its assertions, while recognising that they aren't entirely invalid
* they know it's right but it slightly lessens the credibility of their own argument(s)
* it is a question the voter already knew the answer to

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;Can somebody explain the chemistry/physics of this one?

Yes:

Electrical impulses, begun in the brain and transmitted down the spinal cord, instruct the diaphragm to relax, which in turn causes the lungs to contract.

This raises the pressure on the gas inside the lungs, which causes the gas to be forced out of the body via the mouth, in order to equalize the pressure with that of the outside world.

While that gas exits, other electrical signals originating in the brain cause the vocal cords, tongue, and lips to move in certain ways, which imparts a characteristic shape to the pressure waveform.

This waveform is transmitted via the atmosphere to the mark's ear.  The mark's eardrum begins resonating along with the waveform, which causes electrical impulses to be transmitted to the mark's brain.

Finally, these electrical impulses cause the mark to hand money to the person whose diaphragm relaxed.","1212283372"

Read up on the Communications Decency Act, the Child Online Protection Act, the PROTECT Act, the Digital Millenium Copyright Act, the No Electronic Theft Act... those are the ones I know of off the top of my head.  Completely unconstitutional laws passed by legislators banning various forms of speech on the Internet.  All of them have been overturned by the Supreme Court so far... except maybe the PROTECT Act.  I've read differeing things about whether it is currently active or not.  According to Wikipedias page on the guy who got thrown in prison for ""lolicon porn"" (hand-drawn depictions of underage girls involved in sex), lolicon is still illegal to view or possess in the USA.  I thought that was overturned, but it's hard to keep track.  

As soon as the courts overturn one of the censorship laws, legislators pass another one.  One day, the Supreme Court will be too busy to hear a case challenging one of these laws.  On that day, the law will be stamped in concrete and will never be overturned (I believe.  Does anyone know of a situation in which the Supreme Court decided not to hear a case and later went back and heard a case trying to overturn the same law?).

I've got a novel idea that will never be implemented, at least not as part of any existing government, MAYBE it could be done if we were starting over... Any legislator, who has taken an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, who passes a law that is later ruled to be unconstitutional, they should be recalled from office.  They spend MONTHS arguing over each bill, revising them, etc.  If they are so astoundingly corrupt or amazingly incompetent that after all of that they still cannot realize that a law is contrary to the Consitution, can anyone justify them remaining in office?

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","I'm not very impressed with this article at all.  It tries to justify social narcissism by saying ""sometimes useless trivia winds up saving the day!""  Sure, there are occasions when a story in the news provokes a deep discussion on social issues but the article fails to explain why sitting around having a chat about what Britney's child care practices mean for the world at large actually does to change anything.

Although I'm the first to point out the faults of ""serious"" journalism, such as their obsession with scandal and sensation the goal of the news is to provide information about the world.  The goal of ""entertainment journalism,"" or whatever you call tabloid writing, is to entertain the world by providing more details on entertainers.  The focus of the medium is entirely dedicated to scandal and celebrity and this brings in a huge number of viewers.  This shouldn't be news, people generally like being entertained more than they like learning, and reading about the world or watching the evening news is much more geared to distributing facts.

Now I'm speaking in ideal generalities, everyone can rattle off examples of how the corporate news media focuses on sensation and non-issues, but the basic crux of their difference remains.  Entertainment media aims to entertain, and news media aims to provide information.

Neither branch of the media exists to provide a guide to having fun conversations with your friend.  The fact it's easier to use Bennifer as a segue to a conversation about real issues with this particular authors group of friends doesn't mean anything at all past, groups of friends often like entertaining conversation.  Does having a conversation with friends actually do anything to change the world, does it raise awareness of totally new issues, does it create a wave of enlightenment that sweeps the globe?

No.  It does none of those things.  It passes the time pleasantly.  Watching E! then watching CNN and judging which one gives you better conversations with friends is the definition of being socially vapid; it is certainly not a metric to evaluate the social worth of the information.","1212283772"

There is no particular reason that alcohol should be correlated with social conformity and marijuana with rebellion. During Prohibition in the U.S., alcohol was trendy in part because it was anti-authoritarian. Marijuana has been at times used as a tool of conformity, as with the ancient Hashishin.

Clinton's campaign managers are talking about appealing this ruling and dragging things into August knowing full well it won't change a thing.  Almost half of Hillary's own delegates voted for this compromise.

Hillary's actions are vindictive in nature.  She knows that she lost and lost badly.  Rather than publicly admit it, she wants her supporters to embrace a narrative that the primary was stolen from her.  Nevermind that awarding her all of MI's delegates and allowing every FL delegate to count would still leave her trailing.  She will never be president now.","1212284588"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt; This is where we are with abortion. Its legal, so why not?

Do you grasp the process of how laws are developed? They don't just pop into place out of nowhere, they rise to the top of public discourse, gain the attention of the politicians and eventually are voted on. That means that abortions were happening, either in secret by a doctor or at home with cruder techniques. This has been happening in all human societies since there have been humans. 

Making something legal doesn't mean you are required to do it, nor does it necessarily mean that it is moral or acceptable for your particular code of conduct. Making something legal, among other things, allows it to be regulated and discussed. We're much better off now, with condoms and other contraception methods, than we were in fifty years ago. Why this interest in negating human progress for no other reason than ""I don't like it! I'm offended!""?

&gt; Maybe I could wait until 8 months, and just reach up in there and snap it's little neck like a toothpick. 

How sadistic of you. I worry for your over-active imagination, as you clearly have an unhealthy fascination with killing babies. Nobody is in favor of third trimester abortions, and arguing specifically against them is a straw man.

&gt; The joys of ""pro-choice"".

I've never met nor heard of a pro-choice individual who was glad that abortions occur. It's sad, because that is a *potential* life. However, it's not a guarantee, as many fertilized eggs (the moment the soul appears, so I'm told) don't ever make it out of the womb. Why is this not a travesty even worse than abortion? I just don't understand where you draw the line, which is why I've decided that you can't, but that we have to be rational and face reality. It's going to happen, so make it happen the cleanest and safest -- physically, emotionally and otherwise -- as possible.","1212284851"

Secondly, even if it IS true, then you can find evidence of the originals and prosecute them for those.  Should we allow police to arrest people for things that are in themselves not a crime with a victim (drawn pictures, cgi, etc) simply because they suggest something criminal might jhave happened?  Let them file charges and throw people in jail just beacuse it's difficult to investigate?  That is what these laws boil down to, and usually (at least in the USA) are the claimed motives - police whine that it is too difficult to figure out if a photo is real or computer generated.  If it's real, it's too difficult to tell if the subject is underage.  If it's a drawing, it's difficult to tell if the subject is meant to be underage or not.  So their reaction is to write a law that is so overly broad that police won't have to do investigations, they can just judge based on personal opinion.  Any time law comes down to ""well, she looks underage to ME"", you KNOW that is ripe for abuse.  Did you read the story on Reddit awhile back about the illegal links that the FBI has seeded across the net?  If you click the link, they arrest you.  That simple.  They post the link to a few known kiddie porn places and assume you came from there and arrest.  In the person they arrested that was in the article posted on Reddit, the only piece of ""child pornography"" they found on his computer was a 64x64 resolution image that the police said they thought looked like underage girls.","1212285832"
"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt;Abortion isn't murder, it is a form of contraception

You are definitely doing it wrong. Abortion is not a form of contraception. Contraception is a birth control option you place into action prior to the sex act.

I am not a religious person and have no knowledge, information or experience regarding sin, nor did I mention it above. Likewise did I discuss whether or not abortion should or should not remain a legal option. I suggested that if a young woman considered whether or not she could see herself going through the act of an abortion prior to actually becoming pregnant and determined at that time that she could not, she would take greater care and responsibility to not ever place herself in that situation.

Abortion is currently legal, yet this child is not seeking a legal abortion. It could be she does not think that she is emotionally capable of enduring an abortion.

Another interesting tidbit is that the Uncommitted votes weren't all necessarily Obama supporters as Edwards was still in the race at that point, among other candidates who were not on the ballot and not named Kucinich. Why it's screwy is that there were undoubtedly people who saw ""Clinton, Uncommitted, Kucinich"" on their ballot and picked Clinton, though they would have voted for Obama, Edwards, or someone else were they on the ballot -- and, following earlier DNC decisions, they did not seek to be placed onto the ballot.

The sordid tale of Michigan is pretty interesting. They appealed to the national DNC convention in 2004 to start sharing the 'power' of early primary status instead of it being the same two states (Iowa and NH) every year as it has been for quite a long time. The argument is that it isn't so democratic to let two states have such a big say year after year after year. So the convention has a commission look into it, and guess what: they agree and tell NH that sorry, in 2008 they don't get to be the first primary after all. Michigan applies to be one of the states which goes before NH, but other states are selected instead. Michigan's Democratic party says they will agree to the decision as long as NH agrees.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt; Contraception is a birth control option you place into action prior to the sex act.

Not really. There are day-after pills, for example, which are clearly contraception and don't receive such vehement opposition. Regardless of when it is used, any method to prevent a baby being born is a form of contraception.

&gt; Abortion is currently legal, yet this child is not seeking a legal abortion. It could be she does not think that she is emotionally capable of enduring an abortion.

Who is emotionally capable of such a thing? Are people ""emotionally capable"" of handling a parent (or both) dying at a young age, or being taken advantage of by an older and stronger boyfriend? 

&gt; When a woman realizes that she can never see herself having an abortion, she does everything possible to avoid pregnancy.

There are numerous reasons teenagers, or older individuals, become pregnant without wanting to be, and not all of them are the mother's choice.

Also, many states don't allow minors to have an abortion without a legal guardian's consent. While I agree with this in part, what do you do about parents that make the decision without the soon-to-be mother's input? What about parents that would prevent an abortion even to the medical detriment of their kid? 

Again: nobody is saying abortion is always the answer, but sometimes it is the correct decision.","1212286845"

In a caucus situation, electing an uncommitted delegate isn't terribly rare; it usually happens when the supporters of several unsuccessful candidates who failed to meet the viability threshold in a precint band together to elect a delegate, or after the candidate a delegate was elected to support has dropped out of the race.

It's crazy rare for it to happen in a balloted primary, which lacks the face-to-face/local community element where a group of people who know each other settle on some person they feel represents their views.

Since the 70s/80s there has been a concerted propaganda drive (I can provide cites if you want) funded by wealthy individuals and corporations to shift power from government (which is democratically accountable) to corporations (which aren't). They've tried to sell this idea that corporate power is accountable to ""the market"" - a sentiment you're repeating here.

This is based on a dangerous fallacy. A dollar is not the same as a vote. If I have 2 dollars and you only have 1 that makes me twice as important as you. The fact is, that the people who tend to be most injured by the costs that corporations externalise, don't actually have any money, or any say in what happens. The idea that the market is better than democracy is actually a fairly nasty and fairly dangerous lie.

The militia is not the military. It is not really clear what they had in mind, it does not seem to refer to a grouping we have today. The closest is the National Guard. I think they had more an idea that the military were foreigners and private armies.

Passionate != angry. I wish more Americans would accept that, as my travels outside of this country have shown that you can have passionate yet civil debates about sensitive topics. I've yet to have a reasonable conversation with a fundie, even if I stay calm they interpret my disagreement as open-faced insults.

&gt; but it's hard to stay calm when your position is continually misrepresented and demonized in popular culture.

Demonized! That's an interesting side-effect of religion, as well. Notice that when atheists and other progressives discuss their opponents they rarely claim they are evil or intentionally attempted to destroy society. Not so for religious fanatics, though, especially the American far right. They live in a worldview that sees black and white answers. So instead of atheists being ""people that disagree with us,"" they are Satan's tools of mahem, bent on destroying and killing all Christians! They won't be satisfied until God is dead!

I acknowledge and comprehend that most religious people intend to improve the lives of those they preach at.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Morality is an inflated metaphysical abstraction anyways - all of it. So, sure, this question isn't ""truly"" a moral dilemma, but neither is ""kill this dude, or don't kill this dude (for kicks)."" Essentially, if ethical propositions have no truth value whatsoever, can you really say that anything is a moral dilemma, and, even if you can... how could you possibly determine what is ""right"" or ""wrong?""

Essentially, in theory, I would say this deals with certain ethical questions: authenticity (existentialism), the greater good (utilitarianism), selfishness (hedonism), altruism (whatever), etc. etc. If you can't make those sort of connections, I'm sorry, but you really aren't much for thinking. If crazed zealous Christians can figure that reading or not reading Harry Potter is a moral dilemma, than I really don't see why we can't just transform any instance into an ethically questionable one.

Firstly, a democractic Iraq would be - in accordance with the overwhelming sentiments of its people - openly hostile to Israel. A unified Iraq, further, would run totally contrary to the decades-long Israeli strategy of dividing-and-conquering its Arab neighbours, ie trying to make the Christians and Sunnis turn on the Shiites during the 2006 Lebanon War, and facilitating the rise of fundamentalist Hamas in the 1980s to counterbalance Yasser Arafat's secular PLO and cause internal strife among Palestinians (if you don't believe me, look it up). And there are numerous examples in Iraq of this ""divide and conquer"" strategy in action, such as the US military and its ""Iraqi"" puppet government arming and supporting Shiite death squads (to target Sunni communities were anti-American sentiment is strong), or those British Special Forces troops who were arrested in Basra while attempting to conduct a ""false flag"" bombing (and promptly broken out of jail by British army tanks).

The city itself is concentrating on renovating the very small downtown core, with some success.  But there are abandoned buildings everywhere -- abandoned skyscrapers, even -- and generally it would cost a lot more to renovate them than tear them down.  That goes for the lots, too: they're often have to be cleaned up (chemical waste, tangled pipes, blah blah blah) to be habitable.

The city can't even afford to tear down all the buildings it wants to (buildings that aren't up to code -- that is, legally habitable -- become drug havens, etc.).

Honestly, if you want to help detroit, the way to do it is not to concentrate on the abandoned areas.

The only point I wish to make with them is that you can study intelligence without following the subjects of the study for decades, as you have previously stated.  Some of them compare various populations and their intelligence.  As I said before, I don't know whether the studies that otakucode referenced exist.

As to your question, I think a good methodology for studying the question of varying math and science predisposition between males and females is as follows: Take a widely varied (with respect to age) population of identical twins and fraternal twins, both raised together and apart, the latter including both same-gender and opposite-gender pairs.  Give them a test that you believe accurately measures their science and math aptitude.  Then, apply the statistical techniques used in the studies above to isolate the gender variable from the rest of the environmental and genetic noise, and see if it is signficant in determining how well they did on the test.  Because you have a wide age distribution, you get to see how age affects the differences between men and women on a population-wide basis in whatever age groupings you desire.

The technique is basically the same as in the socioecoomic status study I referenced above.  Except instead of separating out socioeconomic classes, they separate out genders.

This isn't lost on me, either.

That we might actually be causing changes that wouldn't happen if we didn't exist... that seems a given. Even that those changes might be macroscopic.

This still doesn't change the situation, we have incomplete science that hints at one bad thing, when we have dozens of them that might wipe things out. Rogue asteroids. An especially virulent pandemic. A large nuclear war. You name it.

And we also have idiots screaming at the top of their lungs that the only way to avert this crisis that they are 100% certain of, is that we implement social and political changes that they wanted long before anyone even imagined such a ""crisis"". Telling us that there is no other way. Working themselves up into a frenzy over it, quite certain that several billion people will die, and not being all that sad about it either.

Fuck global warming. If only to ensure that we kill all the fucking global warming proponents, I say we crank out twice the CO2.

To whom it may concern:

If you are reading this then I can only assume that you have removed the pond under which this note is buried.

Of course, as I am not around at the moment, I am not in a position to comment on why you may have chosen to remove the pond and, it is fair to say, that there could be any number of reasons for doing so. I will not try to list those potential reasons right now but there could be quite a lot of them. One of the more bizarre reasons could be that the removal of the pond was the direct result of a bite on the ankle from a Wildebeest, but I shall not speculate.

Anyway, I would like you to be aware that the digging of this pond and it's subsequent filling with water and stocking with fish and aquatic plants took a considerable amount of personal effort. It's not just the digging of the hole you know (although clearly that is a major part), but also the consideration that had to be given to the siting of the pond, its shape and size, its location close to convenient electricity supply, etc etc etc.

I have to admit that I am a bit miffed about all this. You have destroyed (yes, I know this is a strong word to use but there are principles involved here) something that took me a long time to do. If I came along and destroyed something that it had taken a long time for you to do then I think you would be a bit miffed as well, so just think on that.


Enough of this. Just get on with what it is you think you are doing, you sniveling pond destroyer.

Oh, and by the way, I hope your head falls off.

"politics","t5_2cneq","[This site](http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=132x6063329) has done a pretty good job of covering the fact that Hillary pledged not to campaign or participate in Michigan and Florida back in September 2007.  This is significant because Hillary knew full well that those states wouldn't count and did not ""rally for democracy"" and did not fight ""to make sure every vote is counted.""  That is all just political bullshit that has come about because she now needs those states to win.

As for my statement that Hillary was one of the strongest proponents to strip Michingan and Florida's delegates... I'm still looking for the article that I got that information from, but the gist of it was that 12 of the 30 voters in the DNC to determine if they should seat the delegates were Clinton supporters.  Those 12 all voted not to seat the delegates.  So the question is, if Hillary cares so damn much about these people's right to vote, why did she disregard them completely when it wasn't in her political interest to do so?  The answer is that Hillary is yet another politician who cares more about her career than the freedom and liberty of the people she says she cares so much about.  She's a snake. ","1212289663"

When cells do not remain balanced, their performance is reduced and the likelihood of a cell failure is greatly increased.  So when engineering a pack of the smaller cells, you have to account for the added cost of a BMS that can handle the larger number of cells.  That added cost is not trivial.  Using a larger cell reduces the number of cells the BMS needs to manage, thus reducing the cost of the BMS.  Additionally, lowering the number of cells also means lowering the number of interconnects needed to connect up the cells.  Typically a smaller number of cells and interconnects means increased reliability over a larger number of cells/interconnects.","1212290071"

I have- six or eight times over the past 25 years- and many other places in India besides- and there is nothing (with the exception of horse-drawn carriages) that one cannot see there today. Everything looks quite familiar, but much less crowded, fewer cars and trucks, and the air looks much cleaner than today.

With the exception of some medieval, historically preserved European cities like Bruge or central Amsterdam, Calcutta has probably changed less since 1947 than any city I've seen.

Since the 1990s the pace of change has accelerated- there has been more change in Cal (and all over India) than in all the years since Independence- from 1947 till about 1989 or so, the place was basically preserved in amber- I have no trouble recognizing some of the streets and buildings from my visits in the late 80s.

Some things are not as common as they used to be- drying cow-pies, sidewalk barbers and chai-wallahs, snakecharmers, cows in the street... but they're all there- if you look. The sidewalk book-stalls (Rashbehari Ave.- the Rodeo drive of Asia!) and Howrah station are particularly unchanged since these pictures were taken.

Most of these pictures I've seen before- they're from a series by a British journalist doing a feature on US serviceman in India during WWII. I think they're really from '44 of '45- notice the war-oriented signs in the train station.

So... please explain why you call this 'exotification' and why exactly do you object to these pictures?

Add to that that I have communicated with people who deliberately avoid voting in what they call the ""meaningless Washington State beauty contest"", despite being eligible, as well as the claims of people in Michigan and Florida who wanted to vote but didn't do so because they believed in advance that their votes would not be counted, and I do not believe that the ""popular vote"" metric accurately measures the will of the people in this contest.

The last three generations have been asleep at the wheel, and there isn't really a damned thing we can do anymore except start an armed revolt. There are two problems with that: 

1) The system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these sheeple are not ready to be woken up. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it. 

2) For the last 40 years, ""Liberal pussy-ism"" has been tactically implanted into the minds of Americans. We've become declawed, neutered faggots who are too weak and too stupid to take our country back. We wave signs and pretend like we care, but as soon as we get hungry we'll go home and eat a pizza in front of the TV, poisoning our minds with American Idol and meaningless sports.

I *don't buy into your basic premises*. The only reason you think ""X is inane"" is that you have certain unsupported assumptions about X that are so fundamental to your worldview that you're having trouble even imagining the viewpoint of anyone who does not share them.

If someone were to say to me, ""You're a dick."", I would not say ""Gee, that's a sexist remark, let me dismiss it unexamined."".

I would say either, ""Nonsense, it was totally appropriate, the midget hit me first!"", or ""Hmmm, well I *did* set fire to all those kittens... I guess you're right, I am being a dick. Let me try to stop that."".

This is because getting at the truth is more important to me than winning arguments (in this, I am unlike a feminist).

&gt;3) People outside of ""the poor"" are going to be as much affected by the rising gas costs as ""the poor"".

Very wrong. Incredibly wrong.

Gas costs the same for everyone. If you make &lt;$30,000/yr, and you spend $5,000/yr on gas, than you've spent 16% of your income on gas.

If you make $50,000/yr, you've only spent 10%. It scales evenly.

In fact, middle class generally uses LESS gas, as they can afford more fuel efficient cars and hybrids.

So no, they are not *as much affected*. They are less effected. Period.

"business","t5_2qgzg","for one, those were absolutely primitive in comparison to what is possible today.  they were also very range and speed limited.

mdasenn is right - electric vehicles are technically difficult.  A key problem is energy density.  Lead-acid batteries have been used both commercially (i.e. first gen EV1, current EVs that aren't as well known, etc.) and also in numerous DIY EVs.  They're heavy and have lifetimes that are drastically shortened by deep discharges, among other issues.  Both NiMH and Lithium chemistry batteries offer substantial advantages over lead-acid, but require more careful maintenance and control.  Battery management systems are mandatory for long-life and reliability.

Another issue is that it is one thing to build a EV that works, and another that handles the average driver driving it.  I've lurked on DIY EV mailing lists for a long time, and the EV owners there drive very specifically and carefully in order to maintain the proper lifetime of their batteries.  I don't think the average consumer is going to be as attentive as the current set of EV enthusiasts, thus the engineers need to make things as idiot-proof as possible.  That in itself is not trivial.","1212291224"

Muqtada al-Sadr is TOTALLY finished. He is being laughed at openly by Iraqi public now. 

""“People are fed up with them because of their extremism and the problems they are causing,” said Rafid Majid, a merchant in central Baghdad. Like many others interviewed across the capital, he said the good deeds the group performs no longer were enough to make up for the hardships endured by ordinary Iraqis who just want to go to work and keep their families safe.

With provincial elections scheduled for October, a public perception that Sadr loyalists were to blame for the violence could hinder the cleric’s hopes of broadening his power and influence in the oil-rich south.""

http://strata-sphere.com/blog/index.php/archives/5472

“I think now that the big bad ideas about Sayyid Moqtada Sadr — that he is filled with violence and is a shallow man — have changed so much, even in the West,” said Salah al-Obaidi, one of his top advisers, using the honorific signifying Sadr’s descent from the prophet Muhammad. “We want people to know who Sayyid Moqtada really is.”

For many Iraqis, Sadr’s image remains negative. “Most people do not approve of what Moqtada is doing,” said Dhirgham, 20, a clerk in a women’s clothing shop in Najaf who feared he would be killed if his last name were used. “He destroyed Iraq. He put us one century backwards.”

 

 
And the word is out in the public that Sadr's ""Millita"" was mostly young men who were addicted to drugs, and forced to fight to get their next hit of drug, or DIE. 


The NYPOST has it right... ""Success in Iraq: A media blackout""

""DO we still have troops in Iraq? Is there still a conflict over there?

If you rely on the so-called mainstream media, you may have difficulty answering those questions these days. As Iraqi and Coalition forces pile up one success after another, Iraq has magically vanished from the headlines.

Want a real ""inconvenient truth?"" Progress in Iraq is powerful and accelerating. ""

"" Today, Iraqi soldiers, not militia thugs, patrol the lanes of Sadr City, where waste has replaced roadside bombs as the greatest danger to careless footsteps. US advisers and troops support the effort, but Iraq's government has taken another giant step forward in establishing law and order.

My fellow Americans, have you read or seen a single interview with any of the millions of Iraqis in Sadr City or Basra who are thrilled that the gangster militias are gone from their neighborhoods? 

 Didn't think so. The basic mission of the American media between now and November is to convince you, the voter, that Iraq's still a hopeless mess.


 Our troops deserve better. The Iraqis deserve better. You deserve better. The forces of freedom are winning.

Here in the Land of the Free, of course, freedom of the press means the freedom to boycott good news from Iraq. But the truth does have a way of coming out.

The surge worked. Incontestably. Iraqis grew disenchanted with extremism. Our military performed magnificently. More and more Iraqis have stepped up to fight for their own country. The Iraqi economy's taking off. And, for all its faults, the Iraqi legislature has accomplished far more than our own lobbyist-run Congress over the last 18 months.

When Iraq seemed destined to become a huge American embarrassment, our media couldn't get enough of it. Now that Iraq looks like a success in the making, there's a virtual news blackout.

Well, he says so. He could of course, be anyone, that's the beauty of the internets, be if he's a troll, he's being unusually nuanced. 

Frankly, disturbing as his personal impulses may be, I find his reasoning fairly compelling.

He doesn't actually say ""I should be allowed to rape children"", although many people think he is going to say that, and react as if he had, without really reading. 

He says something along the lines of ""Minors should be allowed explore their sexuality, learning it at the same natural rate that they learn other things about themselves and the universe. They should not be made ashamed of it, or afraid of it, or be punished for it, or have people around them punished for allowing it.""

Now, I try not to use the word ""should"", but I really can't find any flaw in the basic reasoning. 

As a society, we treat all sexual contact that children have as if it were rape, regardless of the circumstances. Does that trouble anyone but me? Does that not seem insufficiently nuanced? 

Don't we all really know that the real reason we want to go for the pitchforks and torches is that there is something wrong with *us*, that *we* are made uncomfortable by the situation, and that's what we are really trying to punish? 

It's easier to say ""Ewww, yuck, that just *has* to evil, let's lock them up and throw away the key!"" than it is to *think*. But in every other situation, when we do that, we do something stupid. I don't think this one is any different.","1212291409"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt;Sexual practices that are often considered to be crimes against nature are anal sex, bestiality, homosexual acts, fellatio, cunnilingus and necrophilia. The term is sometimes also seen as a synonym for sodomy or buggery.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_against_nature

&gt;The English term buggery is very close in meaning to the term sodomy, and is often used interchangeably in law and popular speech.

&gt;Over the years the courts have defined buggery as including either:

&gt;   1. anal intercourse by a man with a man or woman, or

&gt;   2. vaginal intercourse by either a man or a woman with an animal.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buggery

&gt;Cunnilingus is the act of using the mouth, lips, and tongue to stimulate the female genitals.

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","Trungpa was certainly a very talented writer, and was a very charismatic teacher.  He was the first writer on Buddhism that I encountered, and I was very moved by his books.

But given his trend towards angry outbursts, his drinking, his drug abuse, his violations of the Vinaya when he was a young monk, his taking advantage of female students for sex, his manipulative and vindictive behavior (including an emphasis that he was a Bodhisattva who never made mistakes), his insistence on the importance of fidelity to the guru over all other virtues, and the fact that he selected Osel Tenzin as his successor, while he might have had a few profound experiences, and managed to advance along the path to some degree, I would not put him in the category of a great enlightened teacher.  Rather my judgment is that he was largely a charlatan manipulating those around him for his own gratification - the Halloween party is the clincher for me, I could never accept someone capable of such abuse as a true teacher of the Dharma.  And if he were truly enlightened, free from all attachment, and simply acting selflessly in some Crazy Wisdom way to teach others, I seriously doubt he would have drunk himself to death, still slugging down the sauce even as he was dying.  

He, through his controversies, set back the progress of the Dharma in America more than any other person, and he and Tenzin left a lot of human wreckage in their path.  I have only had one of my Buddhist teachers comment on him, and he said that while he did have some interesting insights, his writings were full of subtle distortions of the Dharma and best avoided.

I have been around a former student who was at Naropa in the earlier days who was deeply disillusioned by him, and who claimed that those who stuck around were enabling his drinking, drug abuse, and sexual abuse, which is where I based my judgment.  Since it was a former student who was bitter about the experience (Trungpa exploited his girlfriend's trust in him as someone who would confer some great spiritual experience on her, and used her as a sex toy until he got bored with her and dropped her like a rock), perhaps it's not so, and I really can't say much about the current organization.  From the Shambhala folks I met in Halifax and in Austin, I expect that most people involved are sincere in their interest in and dedication to the Dharma.  All the same, I want nothing to do with it.  In general I distrust anyone of the ""Crazy Wisdom"" type.  There have been some interesting gurus of that sort (in Zen as well as Vajrayana), perhaps there's something to it, I'll choose to avoid it since it opens the possibility of severe abuse.

I think that many westerners are actually quite inclined towards allowances of iffy behavior on the part gurus, after all Shambhala is comparatively huge, and there are other groups with large followings and apparently morally imperfect spiritual leaders of the ""crazy wisdom"" type.","1212291941"
"reddit.com","t5_6","""where new units don't require road expansion, they wouldn't necessarily pay for anything.""

You're killing me. My link to the City of Lancaster web site notes the traffic impact fee.
Multi unit dwellings are not exempt from the fees, and they not exempt from installing improvement per the city master plan.

&gt;First you say the developer has to give up an easement to the city, and then you say the developer has to do the work for an expansion themselves. These things are mutually exclusive - if the city gets an easement, city labor and bid rules apply.


Not at all. Much of the work they're forced to dedicate to the city isn't on private land in the first place. It doesn't matter whether the city land  was part of the original parcel, and donated because the city declared an easement, or it's all the way into the middle of the street and was never part of the original parcel. The developer is required to do the improvements for the city per the cities master plan. 

In my link showing the KFC, you can see a right hand turn deceleration lane, and a right hand merging lane. Before KFC was put in, some of those lanes and all of the sidewalk area was part of the original parcel. This was removed from private ownership by the city, so it could be dedicated to the expansion of the street. This did not release KFC from its responsibility to pay for the improvements. 

In my first link where I show what is now a 9 lane intersection, the first corner developed was a Costco. They had to pay for improvements all the way to beyond the middle of the street. They paid for new deceleration lanes, center dividers, signals, removal of power poles, the installation of those utilities that were on the poles to underground conduits, etc.","1212291946"

 This evening at 4:55pm CDT in our H1 data center, electrical gear shorted, creating an explosion and fire that knocked down three walls surrounding our electrical equipment room. Thankfully, no one was injured. In addition, no customer servers were damaged or lost.

We have just been allowed into the building to physically inspect the damage. Early indications are that the short was in a high-volume wire conduit. We were not allowed to activate our backup generator plan based on instructions from the fire department.

This is a significant outage, impacting approximately 9,000 servers and 7,500 customers. All members of our support team are in, and all vendors who supply us with data center equipment are on site. Our initial assessment, although early, points to being able to have some service restored by mid-afternoon on Sunday. Rest assured we are working around the clock.

We are in the process of communicating with all affected customers. we are planning to post updates every hour via our forum and in our customer portal. Our interactive voice response system is updating customers as well.

There is no impact in any of our other five data centers.

Posted on May 24, 2007

President Bush addressed reporters Thursday 
about Congress’ latest strategy for Iraq and 
insisted that U.S. forces would leave if the 
Iraqi government requested they do so.  Bush 
said that Iraq’s fledgling democracy needs to 
follow “benchmarks” stipulated in the plan and 
that “arbitrary timetables” for American troops’
 withdrawal from Iraq have been nixed.



Press conference transcript from WhiteHouse.gov:

 Q Thank you, Mr. President. You say you want
 nothing short of victory, that leaving Iraq 
would be catastrophic; you once again mentioned 
al Qaeda. Does that mean that you are willing to
 leave American troops there, no matter what the
 Iraqi government does? I know this is a question we’ve asked before, but you can begin 
it with a “yes” or “no.”

**THE PRESIDENT: We are there at the 
invitation of the Iraqi government. This is a 
sovereign nation. Twelve million people went to 
the polls to approve a constitution. It’s their
 government’s choice. If they were to say, 
leave, we would leave.**

I am, however, VERY annoyed that this is what we've come to, that a man has to sever ties to people who have been a part of his life and community, because a bunch of other people don't like something the pastor said, and if he wants to be President he has to make that kind of a decision.  It seems like a real ""them or us"" mentality, doesn't it?  And Obama reacts to it like that's what it is, but that's where he's mistaken because they'll force him to burn these bridges and make these sacrifices - and he does it, perhaps thinking of the greater good that he can accomplish when in office.  However, all it will accomplish is that they find a new way to turn his positive intentions into negative.  *They'll never let up.*  He can try to do this and that, thinking it will pacify people enough that they can stop the stupid personal attacks and focus on the campaign issues, but it will make no difference.

... he has an Islamic middle name and his father was a Muslim.  Muslims are scary and he's probably a Muslim.  We can't trust him.

... he's clearly not a Muslim... but he belongs to this ""radical"" church.  He should distance himself from this pastor and church.  They say angry black things and as long as he's a member, he must believe he's angry and black.  We can't trust him.

... now he's distanced himself from that church, but why now? It's clearly politically motivated and therefore insincere.  He should have done it before.  We can't trust him.

... now he's thrown a lifetime of friendship and community ""under a bus"" for political ambition.  Do we want a President that's so fickle and disloyal?  We can't trust him.

... now he's not a member of that church anymore.  Is it possible the whole ""church"" thing was a ploy?  I told you he was a secret Muslim.  We can't trust him.

I disagree with the person that wrote the DailyKOS article where it states that all candidates are going to be put through the same thing from now on.  I think if that were true, McCain would have been as raked over the coals about Hagee as Obama was about Wright.  He wasn't.

The MSM, the Republicans, the Clinton camp, the racists, the people who benefit too much from the status quo to let anyone rock the boat... whomever you want to add into this amorphous cloud of ""they"" will not stand by and let this man walk into the White House until they force him to play their game, strip him of everything he has; his support system, his reputation, his faith in people, and after all that, damn me if they won't try to find *some* way to keep the election from him anyway.  And if after all that, he manages to come through unscathed, unharmed, and unchanged, it's not beyond the realm of possibility that what Hillary voiced last week will be the next step.

I admire Barack Obama and his family for their ideals for taking the risks and making the sacrifices, knowing what they were getting themselves into, and I really really hope for all our sakes that this story has a happy ending.  They're good people and they don't deserve this shit, even if he did have the audacity to run for President, and up against the Clinton machine at that.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;How, then, do Barr and Root stack up on these two questions. At the convention, neither would clearly and unambiguously commit themselves to the libertarian position on either of these two questions. Both avoided a clear commitment to pulling U.S. troops, all of them, out of the some 730 military bases now located in roughly 130 different countries around the globe. They evaded questions attempting to elicit clear positions on these two issues. On the drug question they both hid behinds states’ rights: it is not a federal issue; they are running not for state but federal office; therefore, let the states decide. In any case, they would only commit themselves to medical marijuana, not its recreational use, and legalization of anything stronger would certainly be anathema to them. On foreign policy, they would only make ""major"" troop withdrawals, not total and complete ones.
&gt;
&gt;Since Ron Paul, a member of the Republican Party, not only embraces these two planks, but makes them central elements of his candidacy for that party’s presidential nomination, we have arrived at an anomalous pass where a prominent member of the GOP is more libertarian than the two standard bearers of the LP.

On foreign policy, yes, I agree with you -- Ron Paul sounds more libertarian than these guys.  However, that's not the case for drug law.  He isn't advocating a nationwide requirement that states legalize drugs.  He simply wants to eliminate federal drug law and allow states to make what laws they want.  He's said that he personally views marijuana as ""probably very helpful"", but that's very different from taking a policy stance mandating that states allow drug usage.  Some states would probably *not* legalize anything, including marijuana -- his effect in those states would be limited to the removal of federal drug police from the picture.  I'm not familiar with the two libertarians that you mention, but their views and those of Ron Paul's WRT drugs, from your brief explanation, don't sound radically different.

&gt;Another positive element of the 2008 LP Convention is that Barr will take more votes from McCain than Mary Ruwart would have. I am already on record as favoring socialist Obama over mad dog McCain, so this is all to the good.

Obama isn't socialist.  I don't particularly agree with his fiscal policy -- taking out a loan so that the ill today benefit at the expense of the ill tomorrow sounds like a bad idea to me -- but even the most fiscally-liberal nations in Europe are not really socialist.  With the exception of a few states like Cuba, socialism effectively died as a real-world institution during the last century.","1212293090"

Seperation of powers is the fundamental strength of the American Constitution.  It is the genius of America.  Saying DC should be a state means you do not know what the consitution, the very essence of American Ethos, is for.  Which makes me think you have no idea what it is to truly be American.

I think DC should be a 100% federal government run city, that has no voting power besides federal elections, and only federal employees as residents, living in government controlled housing, like the White House.  Sure, this might mean the feds might have to figure out how to run a Starbucks, but what's the problem with that?

If people are dumb enough to think that or misinformed on the subject.  Why are we polling this question in the first place?  For example, if I give a random person a question that clearly doesn't know the answer, why are we concerned with analyzing the polling data.  

Here is another example:
We (the reddit community) keeps pointing out that Obama is black.  When it is clear that he is bi-racial.  Raised by his white mother and grand parents in Hawaii.  He is about as black as Bill Clinton.  People are going to believe what they want to, even on reddit.

If we had a poll, ""Is Hillary a Christian or Buddhist"" 10% would probably vote Buddhist just for kicks and giggles or because they don't know.

I just don't believe the polls?  Or the polling of this question.  Why is it relevant?  Even if the people do think he is Muslim.  Who cares?  For all we know.  Depending how they do the polling.  

Polling Call: ""Is Obama a Muslim.  (1) for maybe (2) for yes.  Come on, Obama sounds like Osama...must be Muslim.  Select option 22222222 or option 1.""

I disagree with their logic, reasoning, conclusions and methodology, but I am not disillusioned to the reality of our conflict.

I completely agree about how frustrating this is, but is the article we are commenting on doing any better?

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;Morality is an inflated metaphysical abstraction anyways - all of it.

Yes, it's an abstraction. In what way is it metaphysical? I can see how one would render it as a political abstraction, or economical, sociological, etc. Divine command theory is metaphysical, I suppose. But otherwise, I'm not sure what you're trying to say by invoking that notion.

&gt;So, sure, this question isn't ""truly"" a moral dilemma, but neither is ""kill this dude, or don't kill this dude (for kicks).""

The reason ""kill this dude, or don't kill this dude (for kicks)"" isn't a moral dilemma is because the answer is obvious. It's a moral question, yes - but it is far from a dilemma.

If that were a moral dilemma, then ""live prosperously, or go into debt for the rest of my life"" would be considered a real dilemma of self-interest.

&gt;Essentially, if ethical propositions have no truth value whatsoever, can you really say that anything is a moral dilemma, and, even if you can... how could you possibly determine what is ""right"" or ""wrong?""

If ethical (versus moral?) propositions have ""no truth value whatsoever"", then of course you can't.

&gt;If you can't make those sort of connections, I'm sorry, but you really aren't much for thinking.

As I said, I had to write a paper on the issue. I just believe the topic was moot.

&gt;If crazed zealous Christians can figure that reading or not reading Harry Potter is a moral dilemma. . .

The Christian Moralizers are wrong. This is a trivial truth, I'm not even going to address it.

&gt;I really don't see why we can't just transform any instance into an ethically questionable one.

Men and women are more than the sum of their biology. I'm the first to use bioethics to oppose certain animal testing or to propose expanded sex ed in schools, but biology and bioethics is not an excuse to justify the universal buy-in to an unattainable ideal of beauty. Any man, or any woman, can easily decide that for them personally, the biological imperative to mate with a certain type of person is meaningless. 

In fact, I'd say while the majority of men choose youthful women with a particular waist-hip-bust ratio for masturbation and pornographic material, a similar majority of men chooses women for dating, marriage, and child-rearing based on much more than appearance. I'm something of a feminist, though I don't identify with most of feminism, but I love men. I think they're great company and I love all my male friends, and not a one of them is so shallow as to chase 19-year-old hotties and excuse it as a ""biological imperative.""

The ACTUAL exceptions to the rule ARE the shallow men who can't see past the waist-hip-bust ratio. I've met a few, they're out there, but they're not the majority.

Another note on the biological-drive-to-mate front: Childbearing is no longer the primary goal of life for many men and women. I'm childfree by choice, and while I might foster a kid or two at some point as a service to my community, I don't have any desire to produce children of my own.

Attention to one's appearance is good, because it makes you feel good, but when you stop exercising and eating healthy because you know you feel better and have more energy when you do, and start doing so because you think someday you'll look like Barbie, that's crossed the line between healthful and mature all the way to insane. The vast majority of women are never going to look like models, and the ones that do, mostly do so with no effort, just by a lucky roll of the genetic dice.","1212294606"

It kind of is...  but first off, knock yourself out.  I can't imagine what I have to hide that you would photograph from my driveway.

Perhaps that is where we differ.  I'm looking at it practically while you are looking at it legally or technically.

I'm saying, practically - what's their point?  Why do they care if some guy in an ice-cream truck with cameras drives down the street and takes pics?

&gt;Maybe it's the fact that this is a road and most roads are public that's confusing you. 

I'm not confused at all.  I've clearly stated in other posts that they have the right to bitch about it.  (Although I do doubt whether they had the legal right to make google take them down, I suspect google did this just to avoid hassles.)  Once a photo is taken, it becomes much harder to deal with than if you can keep it from being taken.

&gt;Think of it as private land and no matter what's built on it they have a right to deny people from entering it and taking photos.

[You mean photos like these?](http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;FORM=LMLTCP&amp;cp=rhczc67770xx&amp;style=b&amp;lvl=2&amp;tilt=-90&amp;dir=0&amp;alt=-1000&amp;scene=6026285&amp;phx=0&amp;phy=0&amp;phscl=1&amp;encType=1)  Because there is no stopping people from taking pictures.  You can just - theoretically - stop them from coming on your land.  Which they failed to do.

If you or I didn't see the decorative no trespassing signs at the front of the neighborhood and went driving around and took some pics - then posted them on the internet, there is NOTHING they could do.

Google took them down for some other reason - perhaps goodwill.  But legally they couldn't do a thing.

Except that A)Numerically, her chances are slim-to-none at winning the nomination.  I think at this point she would have to bribe virtually every superdelegate into voting for her to even have a shot.  (and this is unlikely, seeing as she's already $20-$30 million in debt) 

and 

B)If she manages to ""win"" the nomination while pissing off her entire party, would they even give her the nom?  Strictly speaking, they don't HAVE to.  And if they did, would they fight very hard to make her president?  It seems unlikely they'd be happy to bury the hatchet which was just used to hack the Democratic party to splinters.

Oh, and C)The more publically she does all this ridiculous cloak-and-dagger shit, the more likely the Republicans are to win anyway. If the public sees the Democratic party at each others' throats, whereas the Republicans are all one big happy party, it's going to look REAL appealing to voters.

The only way to make sense of this, to hold as true both your belief in Islam *and* the fact of The West's success, is to vilify The West.  In other words, you have to conclude that The West has been so successful because it is fundamentally evil and operates at great cost to Islam and the greater good of humanity in general.  This is why so many of AQ's upper echelons come from wealthy backgrounds and were educated in The West.

In Sunni doctrine, there is no intermediary between God and the worshipper. ""Muftis"", or religious scholars, serve to interpret scripture and advice society on how to go about their lives in accords to their interpretation. Each Mufti/Imam/scholar can come up with whatever interpretation, but only a select few will gain recognition, usually from those that come out of older and more prestigious institutions like the Al Azhar university in Cairo, or out of Mecca/Medina.

"geek","t5_2qh17","Ok, I'm going to potentially regret this, but here is the answer.
make a TOR or I2P plugin for, say, azureus.
when you want to submit a torrent, you tell your client to submit it to a TOR or I2P tracker.
at 00:01 greenwich, the TOR or I2P tracker makes a flat text file of all the torrents it knows about, and makes it available (DHT). your clients plugin grabs the text file (it's name increments daily, like list_05_30_08.txt, for instance) every time you fire up azureus, and provides a basic search interface. Since there is a real tracker in the loop on TOR or I2P, TOR or I2P users can weed out the spam. Sort of like how Napster used to work, except the tracker exists only in TOR or I2P space, so is immune from prosecution.
If no one else makes it, I probably will, but I'd rather not.","1212297140"

"funny","t5_2qh33","I taught at several different schools. One was in a very ""low class"" area with lots of poverty, drug abuse, etc.

Trying to teach kids who can't even respect themselves let alone the teacher is nigh-on impossible.

Doesn't really matter anyway since schools are mainly indoctrination centers anyway.

Interestingly, the kids at the ""bad"" school had a MUCH higher rate of obesity than the kids at the school in the town that census data declared to be the wealthiest in the entire state.

The kids in the wealthy town were so much different in so many ways.

Studies have shown that the vast majority of Americans remain in the socio-economic group throughout life that they were raised in. I can see why.

The attitudes/beliefs/outlooks/habits/etc implanted during the formative years set the foundation for later life and are seldom altered to any great extent.

Sad but it is reality.

I truly feel sorry for those kids in that poor area. They are assuredly going to have a tougher time in life than the kids in the wealthy town... with a few exceptions, of course... but likely not too many.","1212297230"

Scenario 1:  the student becomes a doctor working in public health, and reasons that this is the morally correct choice, as it gives the greatest good to the greatest number of people.

Scenario 2:  the student becomes a doctor, anticipating better pay and better long-term prospects.  She reasons that the society will repay her for that sacrifice, allowing her to save up enough money to pursue her real interests in comfort.  

Scenario 3:  the student becomes a classicist, arguing that acting solely out of duty, actual or perceived, is not moral.  She reasons that moral reasoning is therefore irrelevant to the question, and that not pursuing her primary interests for the sake of an undefinable greater good, would be a pointless waste.

You could go on and on here, although just coming up with decisions based on some of Kohlberg's stages is probably fruitful.  I think the particular careers chosen make it interesting from a moral reasoning standpoint, although I can imagine the frustration in trying to shoehorn this into the categorical imperative, say.

Science is sometimes a myth because of the way in which it is used. One of the definitions for ""science"" from reference.dictionary.com is ""systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation."" 

However, this definition is sometimes a myth. This ""systematic knowledge"" is not always gained through impartial observation or experimentation. Nobody decides to observe something that does not interest them. With interest sometimes comes opinions (and sometimes interest comes from a preexisting opinion). That means that sometimes people engage in this scientific method of information-gathering with an intended result. 

This kind of science is teleological and usually means you get the answer you were looking for. Historical example:

So he goes back to the hotel, takes all the stuff out of the mini-bar, puts it in a dresser drawer and puts the salmon in the mini-bar.

The next day the salmon is on the desk, the mini-bar has been re-stocked and the original contents of the bar are still in the dresser.

I would prefer to see something emerge from a phone industry organisation (i don't know if it exists) so everything from there would be controlled by them and not only one company like microsoft or any other company that would own these informations. 

what i could see is network creation, like let say. facebook. so we have a standart protocole and you have a facebook account. that will let you phone your facebook friends. Or gtalk friends or yahoo...or msn...or anything that exists....but this shouldn't be something that someone own and can restrict the use to let say live messenger.","1212298872"

You're talking about bias, right?  Something along the lines of [Bacon's Idols](http://www.whitworth.edu/Core/Classes/CO250/Readings/fr_baco.htm) though more narrow, perhaps.   

Stuff like that's been dealt with the best it can be.  There's a lot of rigid methodology and discrediting going on these days (we're talking falsifiability, Uniformitarianism, multiple tests, double blinds, etc.) that weeds it out and whatever is left over is usually always peer-reviewed, by people who might want to discredit the research in favor of their own.

Also, your example isn't ""science"".  It's ""pseudoscience"", an exploitation of Darwin's ideas that he didn't approve of ([page 225](http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=238), last paragraph, last sentence ""It may be doubted..."").  Only through the pop culture (of the time, at least; Rudyard Kipling, etc) and the very vehemently neo-colonialist mindsets prevalent in that period did evolution get twisted into scientific racism.  Everything else was due to the belief that ""correlation = causation"", something that was taken care of in the 50's (I believe).

edit: Hm.  Though, now that I think back upon it, I guess what you mean is that the methodology and the whole of science is dependent on the culture of the times.  While possibly true, I wouldn't label some aspects of science as simply ""myth"".  Them's fightin' words.  ""Unintentionally biased"" is more like it though what I've said above about the rigid methodology still holds true, I think; a lot of it is still weeded out.","1212298997"

If the copyright claim is incorrect or otherwise invalid, a counter-notice may be issued in order to put the material back up.

Here's the deal; I'm a part-time freelance journalist (""part-time"" because I've never been able to pay the bills with it and am not at all interested in working as a staff reporter for a newspaper or magazine or any of the wire services) and as such, it's not in my professional interest to provide any fodder for those  (and their name is legion) who wish to second-guess my work on the basis of my opinions.  Not only that, many of the editors with whom I work would be disgruntled with me did I publicly express my opinions inasmuch as doing so would have the effect, at least in terms of reader perception, of undermining the objectivity of their publications.  I value Reddit because it is a forum in which I can express said opinions without them coming back to bite me in the ass.  

I hope you understand, if not, no worries.

Finally, many years ago when I was in journalism school and writing for the university publications, I learned that pretty much no matter how one presents the ""facts"" of a news story, someone is going to object and claim bias.  You cannot win.  There is no way to present news in a way that won't make someone angry.  I therefore adopted a rule to the effect that so long as I was pissing off both sides of an issue to an equal extent, I would consider that my reporting was basically on the mark.  This is the case with the NYT.  Conservatives charge that it has a liberal bias, and liberals charge that it has a conservative pro-government bias.  Personally, I think that as large as the NYT is (it has by far the largest staff of any newspaper in the world), biases vary across the board, but that for the most part, most of its staff reporters honestly do try to be as objective as possible, with varying degrees of success.

The act is defined primarily by the physical orientation of the partners and the combination of analingus with manual penile stimulation; however, other positions and variations are possible.

2. Middlemen organize events such as concerts.
3. Middlemen front the money for quality recording studios.
4. Middlemen produce actual hard copy of the songs... I'd be very surprised if the demand for hard copy is ever entirely eliminated.

None of these things can be done by a Band itself in most cases.
None of these things can be done by the fans.
These things all matter to a professional band, and all require full-time professionals.  The argument can be made that there is less need for a middle man than there used to be, but it can not be made, with honesty,  that there is NO NEED for middlemen.  Can you imagine a band unsupported by any non-full-time-musicians trying to manage a concert for 50,000 fans?  Without the backing of a record company they wouldn't be able to afford liability insurance... the 1st kid to get mugged in the parking lot of the event could sue them for all they were worth!

&gt; Less popular artists will still be able to make some money off of their ventures if the market thinks they should. If a broad user base doesn't like your music, and this would be millions if not billions of people if properly implemented, you probably shouldn't be writing music. :) 

This is one of the places where my model shines.  Because each user of my model is paying an *on-going* subscription fee, OVER TIME a *tiny* number of fans can still accumulate a significant patronage for an unpopular band.  Nobody is held hostage to the tastes of the mob.

&gt; My model doesn't limit you to 5 artists, nor a set fraction of 15$ - artists are paid at the level the market values their future output, which can be quite high, 

You're right the 1st version of this idea had some warts, I've since refined it a bit:
Ultimately, each user's subscription would support both the infrastructure to keep the system working, as well as the artists themselves.  The logical extension of this model is to have a *minimum subscription fee* that covers the infrastructure over head only, and then let users add to their subscription am optional patronage fee that could be anywhere from $0 to whatever they can afford.  They can then allocate their monthly patronage payments over as many bands as they want.  Forexample, perhaps I've  elected to put $6.59 a month into my patronage fund, I might then decide that LadyTron should get 43% of that each month, Metalica 12%, and the balance to go to Patty Loveless.... whatever.  This gives the user 100% control of how much gets sent to each band, and how much he spends total while still supporting the underlining infrastructure the whole thing needs to keep running.

&gt; and guarantees that one-hit wonders and megastars won't be able to get a free ride for the duration of their natural lives without producing anything more. 

Some people will always end up supporting the one hit wonders and such long after the rest of us wish they were gone... There is no accounting for taste.

&gt; My model allows you access to everyone's music for free, and forever. 

Not for free; at the cost of donated resources.  There is a difference.  People may be less generous in the future.  

&gt; My model does not require you to pay for, nor does it sell, anything with zero marginal cost - 

Neither does mine... you pay for a subscription only as long as it has value to you.

&gt; the only side effect is the efficient creation of new music, on a meritocratic distribution, rather than one determined by best marketing (theoretically, everyone can get infinite airtime because their are no cost associated with choosing one artist over another). 

As long as there is money to be made by ANY mechanism, including your donations, there will always be marketing.  My system doesn't try to fight this law of nature, but allows for a unified point of sale with merchandising, bonus material, and actual content all offered by the same system.  This is possible because it is not distributed and thus does not need to be 100% virtual.  Also, my system is based upon a fundamentally metadata rich technology: html, not a traditionally metadata poor technology like P2P which is great for serving files, but not good at presentation, organization, semantic and explicit relationships between different files etc. [1]

Beyond that, meritocratic compensation exists in my system as well.

&gt; My model does not (in general) require a vast bureaucracy to maintain. 

Allow me to restate: your system does not benefit from the reliable work of full-time professionals, but instead relies upon anonymous volunteers who are inevitably untrained in the job of maintaining a rather complex technological artifact, such as your P2P system, and often untrustworthy or misinformed.  Even Wikipedia has SOME permanent employees... a number kept small in large part because it's product is purely virtual.  Could a Wikipedia sized organization coordinate a band's world tour?

&gt; My model is non-coercive - no one who cannot pay will ever be required to. And last, artists can still make a living, even a great living - they've just been moved from an unenforceable royalty system to an easily enforced distributed commission model. Would you like to rebut? :)

In a way, there is a partial non-coercive implication in my system: You'll note that the small non-profit pirate that I pondered in my original post is no threat to my system by virtue of the limitations of being small... it therefore is not worth the time or expense to prosecute such a pirate.  For this reason, I sort of assumed that at least the popular songs would be available for free from private parties web sites somewhere... it would just take time and effort to hunt them down.  

A primary advantage of my site is convenience... which people WILL pay for.  It is simply easier, more friendly, more useful, and faster to look up a band on a web site and see a well organized, well presented, comprehensive list of songs and albums with links to each, than it it is to enter that band's name into a P2P search tool and see an unorganized list of songs that is almost certainly not comprehensive, containing many duplicates, and largely without descriptions or explanations beyond file type.  [1]

Alternatively, I can be certain of the quality of the presentation, the organization of the content, and the accuracy of the metadata, because my system would be the work of actual employees.  In your system, such details will not always be present, or of unequal dept across the entire system, and will inevitably be subject to sabotage... What happens when the ""Celine Dion Sux"" crowd out number her fans?  My system is near 100% resistant to the depredations of the internet's juvenile delinquents.  

Also, because my system runs on dedicated professionally managed hardware, it will almost certainly be higher performance in things like searching. 

Net: Higher Performance, Higher Reliability, Easier to Use, Professional Publisher Level Support, but at a price.  There's no escaping the fact that you get what you pay for.  I think that a majority of people on the internet (almost 100% of those out of college and thus with a steady source of income) would rather pay a little more for a better quality total-product-experience.

-----------------------------------------------------
[1] You've made an interesting hypothesis that it might be possible to design a P2P with web-page-like richness of metadata and presentation. However, for it to have the richness and complexity of systems that are already running using normal CGI and html it would be a pretty significant project to create: The way I'm envisioning it having to work (based upon what you've written and the need to be able to offer something like equivalent functionality to my system) is: a browser at the front end capable of displaying full pages of descriptions and metadata, a thin-client database query tool to serve the front-end with the results of searches and link-clicks (link clicks are really just pre-configured searches in this paradigm), meanwhile searches are only against metadata descriptions not against actual content files.  To ensure that the metadata is always available, and thus that the search tools work for all hosted content, all description files would have to be hosted on the same server as the associated content file... this might be a significant load when one remembers that description files need to be hierarchical: There would be no individual content file for a band itself, but there should be a description file for it that references all their songs, albums, videos, etc.  That parent description file would have to be on every hosting machine with even one of those content files as well as the description file of the content file itself.  The thin-client database would in turn make requests of the thick-client distributed relational database ultimately allowing the user to browse through hyper-linked description files until he finds what he wants.  I'm not saying it's imposable, but it's a huge amount of work re-inventing the internet-wheal just to overcome the need for a centralized server, and it just about has to be way slower, because every single link-click needs to be backed by a distributed database search!

I’m more willing to believe they want to affect their reader in one way or another. As someone in the industry, you will disagree based on what you have seen, but as I have never worked with them, can only go by what they show me. And again, that is going to be limited to what is of interest to me. So I judge it on what I am shown and you judge the NYT based on the people you know there. I can accept that. 

As far as your personal experiences with writing go, I can very much believe what you say. I’m not a writer by any stretch, as you can surely tell. I don’t expect someone to make everyone happy, but you yourself have said that people (editors?) have tried to censor your writings. So maybe it’s not the reporters that bother me so much as it is the people in charge of the media, be it editors or owners (or their owners for that matter). So I am guilty of generalizing my disgust at the paper as a whole. I apologize to the truly unbiased, objective and non-corrupt, reporters that want only to relay the facts. The rest of you suck.

That's just plain wrong.

Let's say that there are two states, A and B.  A is a primary and B is a caucus.

In the A primary, Clinton gets 100,000 votes, and Obama gets 90,000 votes.

In the B caucus, Clinton gets 100 county delegates, and Obama gets 140 county delegates.

By your math, Clinton ""won"" the ""popular vote"", with 100,100 ""votes"" to Obama's 90,140 ""votes"".

But in reality, in the B caucus, 100,000 caucus-goers chose those 100 county delegates for Clinton, and 140,000 caucus-goers chose those 140 county delegates for Obama.

Which means 200,000 actual people, across both states, expressed a preference for Clinton, while 230,000 did for Obama.

The snake didn't even eat the dead chick, it's evolved to eat what it kills.

The context is that the suffocating of male chicks was videotaped and broadcast, and the faces of the human viewers were shown.

The animals (chicks) would have been killed anyway.  Videotaping it in a restaurant, the kind of place where many people eat chicken, instead of in a slaughterhouse, was the point.  It was completely justifiable.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I am sorry, but you are totally confused. The totals your example of Iowa do not represent the popular vote. They are the number of ""state delegates"", that is number of delegates to county and state conventions. CNN describes it as ""State Del*: Instead of releasing raw caucus vote totals, some state parties release the total number of delegates to county or state conventions each candidate is expected to receive. In some cases, a presidential preference vote is held in conjunction with precinct caucuses, and the raw numbers from these votes appear in the State Delegates column.""

This is NOT a metric for popular vote. When you say that using this metric doesn't hurt Obama, you are just lying. Think about it for a minute. Suppose State A has a population of 1 million people and releases actual numbers for the popular vote, in which Clinton beats Obama by 50,000 votes. State B, which also has a population of 1 million does NOT release numbers for the popular vote, but instead releases numbers for state delegates, like Iowa, in which Obama beats Clinton by 203 STATE AND COUNTY delegates. Obama has actually won State B by a bigger margin than Clinton won State A, but because you are lumping together apples and oranges (popular vote and state delegates), Clinton has a lead of 50,000 - 203 = 49797 in the popular vote. This isn't math, it's freakin fantasy.

If you want popular vote for a state that DOESN'T release popular vote, you have to calculate it yourself. Many people have actually done that. Here's one calculation from RealClearPolitics, which is a site that has been pretty anti-Obama from the start. But even there you can see that Obama wins the popular vote in most cases UNLESS you count the vote for Clinton in Michigan, where Obama wasn't even on the ballot, and DON'T COUNT any of the 40% voters who chose ""uncommitted"" rather than vote for Clinton. That is a totally unfair scenario, as most people here would agree.

To Whom it may concern

If you are reading this then I can only assume that you have removed the pond under which this note is buried.

Of course as I am not around at the moment, I am not in a position to comment on why you may have chosen to remove the pond, and it is fair to say there could be any number of reasons for doing so. I will not try to list those potential reasons right now but,  there could be quite a lot of them. One of the more bizarre reasosn could be that the removal of the pond was the direct result of a bite on the ankle from a Wildebeest, but I shall not speculate.

Anyway, I would like you to be aware that the digging of this pond and it's subsequent filling with water and stocking with fish and aquatic plants took a considerable amount of personal effort. It's not just the digging of the hole you know (although clearly that is a major part), but also the consideration that had to be given to the siting of the pond, its shape and size, its location close to a convenient electricity supply, ect ect ect.

I have to admit that I am a bit miffed about all this. You have just destroyed (yes, I know this is a strong word to use but there are principles involved here) something that took me a long time to do. If I came along and destroyed something that it had taken a long time for you to do then I think you would be a bit miffed as well, so just think on that.

Enough of this. Just get on with what it is you think you are doing, you snivelling pond destroyer.

Oh, and by the way, I hope your head falls off.

Also check your registry setting for startup.  You can do this through msconfig if you want (I think it is under the ""startup"" tab), I prefer to simply use regedit though.  You can find the programs that startup automatically by going to:

HKLM -&gt; Software -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; Windows -&gt; Current Version -&gt; Run

Also look under:

HKCU -&gt; Software -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; Windows -&gt; Current Version -&gt; Run

Remove the keys that you know you don't need.  This can be kind of dangerous if you don't know what you are doing.  To be safe just type in the file name in google and it will usually tell you what it does.

Also check your startup folder on your start menu.

Lastly, run a defrag.

Also, what Anti-Virus do you use?  Does it do an autorun nightly?  If so, it it setup to start at the next opportunity if it is shutdown at the time it is supposed to run?  If you power off your computer at night this could be a big performance issue as the virus scan could be hogging resources.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Yeah, that's a really weird question to put on a test. Agreed.

But, the general issue of ""Is statement X a moral question?"" is a question of meta-morals, and one thing that makes philosophy different from other disciplines is a tendency to dive into meta-disciplinary questions instead of avoiding them. What are the criteria that make a question a moral question instead of just a question of personal preferences? In this case, your instinct is that the fact that this choice will the well-being impact others is not sufficient to make the question a moral one. That instinct could be worth drawing out some more and examining. What assumptions are behind it, etc.?

Incidentally, I think the view of morality as a series of Big Decisions is overall more wrong than right. Confucius, for example, didn't talk about morality per se. He talked about how to be an exemplary person or a gentleman. Doing that is about more than just not killing people. It's also about improving yourself until you're the best person you can be.

This is nonsense on more than one level. The first, of course, is that the only way for a woman to win high political office is to be the ""heir apparent"". Sure, it's **a** way to win the Presidency, and a pretty common one, but it's far from the only way. 

There's also the possibility that Obama might pick a woman as his VP. Hillary has probably blown her shot with her recent antics, but she's not entirely out of the running yet, and there are a couple other women politicians who would make very good VP picks. It doesn't get much more heir-apparentish than the VP for a successful President. All in all, there's a decent chance we'll see a woman in this spot again in a mere 8 years.","1212305736"

As far as i know, there are many who condemn terrorism. It does depend on which terror acts though.

On the other hand, attacks in Iraq or saudi arabia have drawn much condemnation. Political pressure from (secular) dictators also plays a role in which events to ""condemn"" and the ones not to.

Not necessarily. Just because you say he believes that, doesn't make it so, and many Christians don't. 

Because I went to a public school (for the Americans amongst you, it's like the 13/12/2008 date thing - here in the UK a ""public school"" is the more exclusive kind of private school) we had a large chapel and two attendant Church Of England vicars on site. All RE lessons were taken by them. Perhaps this is unusual in Religious Education classes, I don't know, but these vicars did at least give a lesson or so to Hinduism, Buddhism and the like. But these two old boys were quite specific that the Bible is metaphorical, that it's a set of set of rules and analogies to guide you though life,  and that a modern Anglican may revere Jesus essentially because he was a good person, rather than any magical ""holiness"" about him. We are, after all, children of god in this metaphor (which, to my mind, works just as well if you replace ""god"" with ""nature"").","1212306190"

I propose a compromise.

I think that's a fair division of labor.  Otherwise, I can just leave the seat down all the time, and you can start remembering to wipe it before you sit down.

Of course, that's a non-issue with me, so I don't even get to use such witticisms.  I not only drop the seat when I'm done -- I also close the lid.  I grew up in a household with a dog, and I currently live in one with cats -- none of which should really be allowed access to the toilet bowl, in my opinion.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Throw out the utilitarian and Kantian rationale as I don't think they really apply to this situation, and approach it from the standpoint of a eudaemonist virtue ethicist.  What would a person of refinement and excellence choose as the path to greater fulfillment of his capacities and achieve genuine flourishing?  Without being able to answer that in the abstract, you need to lay down some goals and criteria: what are the things that you value most?  In terms of what you would like to accomplish in life, what choice suits you better?  There's no clear and obvious answer, prima facie, that one should value one of these routes over the other; I think you need to know more about this person's situation, what the person intends to accomplish, etc.  I would NOT fall into the easy trap of saying that the career of a doctor is a ""higher calling"" or whatnot or that it has higher prima facie worth; without some further reasoning, one isn't subject to some kind of duty to sacrifice one's own enjoyment.  Either of the routes can be a noble calling; doing what truly makes your own life goes best in an objective sense, in whatever way that manifests, is the most noble calling in the end.  Neither ""altruism"" nor ""egoism"" in the usual connotations are privileged over the other, as much as eudaemonistic conceptions of flourishing and happiness can take on an individualist kind of flavor.  If you wouldn't derive fulfillment and enjoyment from going the doctor route, even as much as there is something psychologically healthy in being responsive to others' need, then the idea of a moral responsibility to nevertheless go that route is not very appealing.  There are ways that one can do things for the betterment of others or the community *that don't require giving up pursuing a profession you have reasons to believe you will enjoy more.*  The question posed in your class hints that the societal benefits of education in the classics don't match those of doctor services.  But as someone has already pointed out, there will be plenty of doctors to go around even if you don't enter that profession, so it's not like the more immediate need for doctor services will go wanting if you pursue another profession.  Given *that*, the choice seems rather clear: do what, according to your best knowledge available to you, you think you will most enjoy doing.

Well that's not going to fuckin happen. My roommate and his girlfriend are going at it like a pair of chimpanzees that got into a bottle of Viagra and horny goat weed.

This isn't an uncommon occurrence. They usually keep it comparable to a rock concert in decibels. What really bothers me, is that she got him arrested today.

While enjoying a quiet evening in the park, my roommate and his girlfriend are enjoying a few good shots of cheap whiskey to make the day a little more interesting. When everything seems to be going good, Mr. Johnny B. Lawenforcement shows up to greet the happy couple. Just so happens my roommate's girlfriend has a sexual history with this particular officer (as well as half the county it turns out). My roommates girlfriend decides its perfectly OK to inform the jealous police officer/former boyfriend that they are just having a walk while enjoying their favorite alcoholic beverage.

Needless to say my roommate winds up in handcuffs and his backpack searched. The guy gives him a drunk in public charge as well as an open container in public charge.

Of course, she gets off the hook without incident and receives a text message from the police officer an hour later saying that her boyfriend is a bitch and threatens to put him in jail if she doesn't leave him.

As for loading and handling pages like [this](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/), Safari blows FF3 and Opera away. It's clear that FF and Opera have problems handling that page. Safari is also a lot faster in loading Google Reader and Gmail2.

As for UI speed, Opera is clearly the best. FF3 is better than FF2, but it's still slow.  Safari's UI is a dog and scrolling uses too much cpu.

I said to him, ""kid, I'd give 20:1 odds that god doesn't exist""  He didn't take me up on the bet, to bad too... *I love me a god bet*.  Of course, he only speaks some sort of gobbledygook...

Especially if it gets me that cold hard cash... man, *I love me some money*.



Anyway, I'm not even sure what I'm going on about anymore... Plus, I've got a *wican ceremony* to get to (*I don't believe in the god or goddess*, I just enjoy practicing the rituals, *I like that Darwin guy's ideas if you wanna get real*).

In all seriousness... the other commenters here seem to doubt his faith more than one might doubt, say, McCain's or Hillary's, or any number of revolting Republicans in the executive branch and Congress. Why is that? I mean, what is that doubt beyond the hope that Obama is more rational than your average conveniently 'strict' Biblical literalist or Bible-using wannabe-patriarch. Obama has been quite public in his rejection of ancient myth as the deepest basis for legislation, and this particular doubt about his rationality has nowhere to go.

I think he has 'faith' because he seems to have given it more thought than (as mattomatto might write) ""than would have been necessary just to play politics.""

"programming","t5_2fwo","Yes and no.

Comparing OCaml to GHC is apples and oranges: GHC is much more complicated and slower because it is trying to solve a much harder problem.

Comparing OCaml to MLton is much fairer but MLton is many times faster than OCaml for symbolic processing thanks to its high-level data structure rearrangements (that require whole-program optimization).

You can also draw a fair comparison with F#. I recently ported the (single-threaded) SciMark2 benchmark to both OCaml and F#. Safe F# (on 32-bit Win XP) is 50% faster than safe OCaml (on 64-bit Debian) overall but it is also faster than unsafe OCaml on every single subtask and, in particular, it is &gt;2x faster on the Monte-Carlo benchmark because OCaml's handling of integers is so inefficient due to its simplistic tagging mechanism. If you use the int32 or int64 types instead of OCaml's native 31- or 63-bit integers then it is 3.4x slower.

You might also consider the performance of these languages when used interactively. Here, OCaml resorts to interpreted bytecode that is extremely inefficient (often an order of magnitude slower than its native code compiler). So interactive OCaml is much slower than Lisp using SBCL, for example.

Finally, you should also consider the enormous sacrifices that OCaml's designers made in order to tweak its performance. Abstractions completely destroy performance in OCaml. Not just high-level abstractions like functors but even lower-level ones like splitting a numerical function into two functions can introduce massive performance degradations. Then there are the missing features. OCaml has a 16Mb limit for strings and arrays on 32-bit platforms (!). OCaml has a very simple set of types, with no int8, int16, float32 and so on. OCaml has no support for native-code DLLs which makes it commerce unfriendly and, ultimately, was one of the main reasons we ditched it in favor of F#. OCaml's marshalling is not type safe. Indeed, there are many ways to segfault self-contained OCaml programs because it is not really a safe language at all (because safety was sacrificed for performance). These are all things that could have been addressed instead of tweaking the performance for single-core machines.

So I would say that OCaml is by far the best choice for anyone who has no money but wants to be able to write fast embarassingly-parallel floating point code without having to leave a high-level language. Outside that remit, OCaml is no longer significantly better than alternatives like Haskell.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","This is complete bullshit. I enjoy when vice actually does dig up interesting stories, but most of the time they're just too busy over-dramatising and hyping up material as a quick fix for lack of actual substance. Like in this case.

When you go to DPRK you get a standard tourist trip of the destinations depicted in this 'documentary' unless you request otherwise. You have to pay a pretty hefty visa fee - but it covers all the expenses while you're in the country. For drama, it seems Vice chose to call this a bribe. If they actually had to pay any bribes to get in it's just because they're too fucking lazy to do the paperwork properly. 

The rest of the vid material are from the few VCD's you can buy at the few souvenir shops there. I know because I have them too. 

Besides, what's covert about it? Because they're only showing them the standard tourist spots, there's no problem filming it. 

Now what really upsets me about this VBS manure is that because they where too lazy to care and get the proper papers (which they probably would get, seeing as they only shot the usual stuff) all the guides and people involved in showing them around will get into serious trouble once this airs. Apart from being highly unethical as to the consequences for the people involved, it will make it more difficult for actual filmmakers and documentary journalists to be allowed to do their work - like the guys at VeryMuchSo:

Something with a wide reading head would be better for the blind

My logic here is that they don't know where the words are on the page...

It would also be a LOT of technology to fit into a pen

you would need the optics first, then you would need an amazing OCR program embedded in it.  and it would have to scan pretty fast. The link at the bottom of the page is the only data on the rate at which English speakers talk I found (I didn't look very hard) and it looks like you could probably put an average of 350 words per minute.  so you would probably want the progam to be able to do 100-200 words a minute just to be bareable.

To be able to optically sense the word, translate it and then pronounce it would take some serious processing I would think.

Plus, you would probably need a fairly decent phonetic dictionary embedded, so you wouldn't get funny sounding words out of the machine (you know, like when you type a weird name into MS's speech program and microsoft Sam murders it.)

1. You might want to use an IDE most of which have rails support and ruby support but not Merb support per se.

1. You might want to use heroku one day.

1. You might be interested in using a more ""enterprisey"" database such as oracle, db/2 or ODBC which activerecord supports. Of course merb supports activerecord but merbivores prefer datamapper.

1. mod_rails is an excellent way to deploy your applications. It doesn't support merb (yet).

They are effectively brainwashing instruments, like installing spyware, virii, botnets, and meme complexes into the minds of people. They replicate and overtake the creative freedom of the original system.

Society as an abstraction over people likes people to have morals and ethics, because they increase the coherence of the meta process/system society is, which is good for its survival, not necessarily peoples.

Every time you acknowledge ethics/morality in any degree of minutae by thinking them as words/concepts/thoughts might possibly be real in any kind and degree of sense, the subroutines steal braincycles from other possible software that could potentially be running for you and not for someone or something else. Some of this alternate software might be more healthy for you in person in general, like immune system and structural integrity, personal empowerment or who knows what might bring more joy to life.

So, yes, someone definitely needs to re-think the layout of the ALU site.  Especially since these days, there is essentially one canonical Lisp, and that's Common Lisp (moreover, Scheme doesn't even call itself a Lisp, so it probably shouldn't call be have equal weight -- this based on a very long thread at comp.lang.lisp).

* Less of the dry stuff: ""last chance to submit papers to $conference about ... *yawn*""

I've even gone to the extreme of installing my own soap dish, as the battle for soap dominance in the shower was too great. My soap (dove) would be removed from the shower and placed on the sink, and a fresh soap would be placed in the shower. Ever since they broke my soap dish, they've left it and the soap within, alone. now i simply remove their soap from the shower's normal soap dish before i bathe and add it to the stack by the sink. Not removing the soap tends to leave a gelatinous mess. Depending on who is cleaning my room, a soap is taken back off the stack and added back to my shower when they clean. I believe each time i get a new cleaning person (which happens often), i get an extra bar of soap added to my stack as the new employees will simply pull one from stock, which is when my stack grows bigger. Every now and then, every few months or so, the soap stack disappears and  I restart from scratch (i theorize that they use my supply as emergency rations)","1212318121"

"self","t5_2qh96","I hate myself for the way I look. I'm overweight, pimply, have a small dick, and starting to bald. I've never kissed a girl and I've never seen a girl in real life naked.

I deleted my Facebook account because I had such few friends it was embarrassing. Then I created a fake account with my school email so I could look up the profiles of the girls I'd like to fuck. I've been obsessively checking one girl's profile everyday for the past couple months to see if she has new photos she's been tagged with. I hate myself for it.

I've been at university for two years now and have only made one friend here... and he's not really much of a friend. He's more of an acquaintance who I eat with every once a week and I think recently he's been doing it only out of pity. I tell my family and old friends back home that I have a lot of friends.

Lately I've not been doing homework and doing badly in my classes. Last school term I got straight A's and was very proud of it, but my parents didn't seem to care, and I did it mainly for them. In high school I failed a few of my classes and therefore upset my parents very much by going to a mediocre college. Whenever they're driving me up here or driving me back home, I always feel bad because they expected so much more out of me.

Perhaps worst of all, I know that I'm unhealthily self-centered. Even though I could barely pass as decent-looking, I can't stop staring at my face in the mirror sometimes, and wonder... if I lost a little bit of that chin fat, all the chicks would dig me. I know they never will because I have a shit personality. Also, my back is hideously deformed due to a severe acne disorder I had during puberty and there are huge scars everywhere. Because of this, I can never go out in public wearing just a T-shirt... even on hot summer days, I always wear two layers so I know for sure nobody can see the scars through the shirt. Because my appearance dictates how I act in front of others, I'm usually detached and cold. I think I'm afraid to have real relationships with people because I know they will disappoint me sooner or later since I have unrealistically high expectations of people to feed my needy ego.

I've had a private blog I've written for several years that I've shared with no one. And almost every post is similar to what I've just written here. I don't know why I have to write them as I do, but maybe it's just to get it all out of my mind into physical form. I guess I don't really give a shit if you read this all or not, but all I need to know is that maybe someone glanced over it, or read the first few sentences briefly then scoffed and clicked back. I'll know that the world will probably never notice me, but maybe a few people will.","1212320248"

You fail, you're a trainwreck as far as comprehension goes.

First of all, I'm not one to rely on spatial memory, I was talking about TFA's point of view.

Second, the problem with spatial POV is not ""think of photoshop icon"" but link software (or objects in general) to the path towards them (their position in space) rather than a ""meaningless"" label. In TFA, TFAA would usually remember a software's place in the launch/start menu (and how to get there), but not necessarily its name. The concept of ""image edition"" gets linked not to a name (e.g. ""Inkscape"" or ""GIMP"") but to a path in the aforementioned menu (""third from top, then 2nd from bottom, and then 5th from top"").

Third, while most spatial-memory persons have no problem remembering a few very commonly used names, that doesn't mean it will work for anything even remotely obscure, or slightly less used. TFAA probably wouldn't remember that KDE's default image viewer is Gwenview for instance.","1212320282"

Ah ha, now I think I've figured it out. A woman living on her own or only in the company of other women doesn't have to worry about it (and thus doesn't have to look) because the toilet is always in the same configuration: lid up, seat down. Once a man enters the picture there's a possibility that the seat might be up.

A lone man always looks first because he can't remember it's state from the last time he used it. A lone woman may not look first because she always leaves it in the same state.

Most of the stuff they have would be foiled by real-life constraints: They come up with an amazing mathematical theorem or whathamacallit, and they have *implemented* it right away (no scenes showing programmers looking at the Weird Last-Minute Glitches). They haul in boxes of dusty records, and come up with results the next day; no one has heard of this somewhat crucial step called ""data entry"".

first i dont care if anyone reads this or not. second. stop reading now. don't bitch about it being here, if you don't want to read it, stop. go do something else. but for god's sake don't just bitch about it for a little morsel of recognition.

seriously, why do so many of you do that? do alot of you just need hugs? I'd be more than willing to do that. but it's something deeper, right? like being in the light makes you more real because you exist in someone else's mindspace. even if you're an annoyance. no simpler way to say it. just stop.

now, here's an interesting point. I don't know if anyone will get this far, because if you did and you're here, you have to have something to gain from it. I can't imagine what. I already asked you to bury this and to stop reading. so who's still reading?

I admit it. I have downloaded a few terabytes of movies and television series, including every episode of MacGyver. I'm currently in the process of downloading every episode of the Simpsons.

Where I differ is obviously in the value judgement placed on this activity. You see my circumvention of copyright as a very simple case of my taking food from the mouths of hard working creative types. Whereas I do not view the situation in such simple terms...and that's because the situation does not exist in such simple terms.

Hell, its all about how things get made. From your world-view, an oligopolistic industry shrouded in copy-right protection is THE way that anyone with any creative bent might best seek to realise their vision. I see that view as being comparable to the view of the Luddites. Like those who protested the industrial manufacture of ice because they were somehow involved in the natural harvesting of ice. They too had their case to make against the winds of change. And there's always a winner and a loser. That's straight economics.

I mentioned MacGyver episodes, mainly because the greater majority of things I download are actually things that have gone out of fashion. I very strongly doubt that we'll see Richard Dean Anderson before congress any time soon the way we did with Lars Ulrich. ","1212321048"

A truly independent woman who made it all that way with a husband who might be something entirely unrelated to politics. . . a doctor?  A plumber?  A computer programmer?  (That was pandering.)

Repeating the Washington blahblah has become the new trend. All this coming from a Washington based proponent of capitalist economy and US intervention in South American. Try coming out your comfort zones to observe the installed market forces (aka Democracy and Co.) acting in Iraq and Afghanistan and the rest of the third World. Countries where the average difference b/w high income and low income is in millions, where there is no middle class, where the will of ""Super Power puppets"" overrides the wishes of the masses, where your president drives in limos while 75% of the people live below the poverty line, where the fate of millions of lives is decided through a signature in Washington/Moscow. Try visiting the starving millions in India, Pakistan and others. Try reading about the slave labor in the luxurious UAE, try leaving your comfy living rooms and air conditioned homes/offices and then f'ing rant about Whether revolution does or does not make sense. Try comparing what Capitalist economy had bestowed upon Cuba and the system brought in by Che and Co along with the US embargo. Given what the US has been doing in South America and the third world, ranting about Che is inline with the US officially labeling Mandella as a terrorist. 

In an nutshell, popularity of icons like Che Guevara has more to do with the utter failure of US backed (often military) regimes. The fact remains that Che is more popular in South America and the non-American world than your two times elected president is in the US.

I doubt these things would be getting passed if there wasn't majority support.  We smokers are a dying breed. Literally. We've known this day would come.

Recognizing that cigarettes are bad for smokers, and for non-smokers, do you really think it's improper for the government to mitigate that risk? How would you feel about the government stepping in to stop a restaurant cook from spraying all your food with carcinogens before serving?

I have difficulty guessing the agenda you're trying to push.  Obviously, you love the proprietary, vendor lock-in closed-source .NET and its Ocaml ersatz that's called F# in which you have invested time, effort and books.

But why the Ocaml bashing?  It's obvious that Ocaml has not been designed for numerical multi-core computation.  But that doesn't make it a lesser systems programming language:  people use it to write network servers, compilers, symbolic computation or linguistics code, and they usually don't miss int16s or float32s.  Can't easily do all these things in monad prison, now can you?  And, no, the FOSS people won't be using F# any time soon, and lots of academics are FOSS people.

They don't care about your balding head or your (possibly) tiny dick.  They care about you.  They're out there and 99% of the time they're not the gorgeous hottie you fantacize about.  I never had sex until I was 26.  I met my partner at 40.  He's not my ultimate hottie but he treats me like I'm one to him.  That beats the shit out of some vacuous, self-centered hottie any day, believe me.  The hottie will be gone next week.

Hang in there.  Keep your chin up.  Sometimes it just takes time and a bit of adjustment on your part.  Keep looking at the good parts of yourself and improve where you see it's needed.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","What's wrong is, when these companies move their workload overseas, they get to pay their workers substantially less than they do American workers. Many Americans thus lose good jobs, and communities are destroyed. Another thing that is wrong, is that these companies don't have to treat their workers in Mexico with the same rights that workers in America are protected by law to be treated with. 

About your statement regarding US citizens buying cheaper cars, there are two things here. First, the corporations moving work overseas do it to reduce cost. Note, that doesn't mean the savings will be passed on to you. Second thing about that statement: what is your definition of ""cheaper""? If you mean cheaper by, you can now purchase an automobile that has been manufactured by the same corporation that actively exercises it's stranglehold on your government for a dollar amount less than it was last year (regardless of the significant largely negative ramifications of this), then that is one narrow definition of cheaper. When the company that makes your car has the ability to shape their policy for their interests often at the expense of significant social interest, that's not cheaper.

Not only are Americans, with their damage to economy, government, and environment are getting the raw end of the bargain. Mexicans, and many more peoples south of the USA have been strangled by the USA for decades. Forcibly imposed economic strangulation policies,  so-called ""Free Trade"" ""agreements"" (some of which were signed by Latin American leaders at gunpoint) is why $20 a day is good money for Mexican workers at these car manufacturing jobs.

if you see an inter-racial couple, then you automatically assume the minority rejected his/her culture? how is that not racist? in fact, especially in the case of white males/Asian females, it's the non-Asian who's fascinated by the Asian culture, thus pursued the relationship... my old white male roommate regularly flies to Singapore to meet with his g/f's parents... my Chinese co-worker's white husband learned Chinese just so their bi-racial kids would grow up in a Chinese-speaking household... a white guy I know married a Taiwanese woman and vehemently defends Taiwan's right for independence... he moved to Taiwan and became a Taiwan citizen just so he could vote in the elections!!

what do you really know about Asian-American culture? have you ever been to Asia? studied about it in school? hung out with an exclusively Asian-American group? 

or are all your prenotions just based off of nothing but ignorance? that's the worst racism of all... THINKING you KNOW about an entire race and telling OTHERS what to THINK when in fact you're generalizing and otherwise just pulling shit out of your ass

What's wrong is, when these companies move their workload overseas, they get to pay their workers substantially less than they do American workers. Many Americans thus lose good jobs, and communities are destroyed. Another thing that is wrong, is that these companies don't have to treat their workers in Mexico with the same rights that workers in America are protected by law to be treated with.

About your statement regarding US citizens buying cheaper cars, there are two things here. First, the corporations moving work overseas do it to reduce cost. Note, that doesn't mean the savings will be passed on to you. Second thing about that statement: what is your definition of ""cheaper""? If you mean cheaper by, you can now purchase an automobile that has been manufactured by the same corporation that actively exercises it's stranglehold on your government for a dollar amount less than it was last year (regardless of the significant largely negative ramifications of this), then that is one narrow definition of cheaper. When the company that makes your car has the ability to shape their policy for their interests often at the expense of significant social interest, that's not cheaper.

Not only are Americans, with their damage to economy, government, and environment are getting the raw end of the bargain. Mexicans, and many more peoples south of the USA have been strangled by the USA for decades. Forcibly imposed economic strangulation policies, so-called ""Free Trade"" ""agreements"" (some of which were signed by Latin American leaders at gunpoint) is why $20 a day is good money for Mexican workers at these car manufacturing jobs.","1212325740"

Peak Oil is not that there is no more oil, but when the easiest oil (assumed to be about half of it) is depleted, and output starts to decline. There is evidence for that this is happening in Saudi Arabia, althoug they keep information about field status secret.

The oil that remains to be found is deep sea fields, oil sands, oil shale and other hard to produce oil. One cannot produce that oil as fast or cheap as earlier, so the prices rise because of both scarcity and higher extraction costs.","1212326056"

My mortgage company (Countrywide), after looking at just my credit score (830 at the time) and one pay stub, told me they would pre-approve me for up to around $700k.

Running the numbers, they were right--I could have afforded to take a $700k loan.  If I was willing to have no safety net at all, rely on warm clothes during the winter rather than the furnace, only eat the cheapest, highest calorie/dollar food that I could find in bulk at someplace like Costco, limit TV to basic cable, and only upgrade my computers every 5 years or so, and pinch every other penny that I could conceivably pinch.

You probably didn't go to the slums in Mumbai - which is, by the way, the 2nd slummiest city in the world (just behind Mexico City).  Kolkata is number 8, with about 20% fewer of its inhabitants living in slums than Mumbai.

But Mambai is the home of Bollywood and nightclubs and Sheesha joints.  You walked up and down the streets in Colaba and said ""Wow, what a nice city (for India, at least).""

And then you come to this message board to spread more misinformation about how the cultural and intellectual hub of India is nothing more than a series of slums.  

You reduce it to the slums (which are in no way unusual for Indian metros) at the expense of diminishing and ignoring its considerable intellectual, cultural, and political achievements.  

Next time you meet an Indian intellectual working in an American university, ask them what city they were born in - they'll more than likely say ""Calcutta.""  Liklier still that they'll speak Bengali, not (or not just) Hindi.  Look at a list of the Nobel prize winners from India and see how many of them are from Calcutta.

Your experience was miniscule (compared to the wealth of experiences which Calcutta has to offer) and heavily influenced by the pre-conceived notions with which you entered the city.

Do you eat meat?  Did you know that the vast majority of livestock animals are fed antibiotics *daily*, which increase antibiotic-resistant MSRI deaths greatly and actually pose an existential threat to humanity as well?

There are many, many things which pose greater risks to public health than second hand smoke and which aren't regulated much at all.  It's easy to demonize smokers, but not very rational or fair.  If you don't want to breathe in second hand smoke, then don't live or work someplace with a lot of smoke.  If you're worried about the couple of hours of exposure you get from going to a restaurant with smokers in it, then loosen up.

The effect of second hand smoke on most people is so minor as to be nearly negligible.  It took gigantic studies before it was even possible to show a statistically significant effect on children who *live* with indoor smokers.  The effects on actual smokers are clear, but not nearly as great as most would assume.

These provide a good visual quality and are simple enough to render in real-time with moderately inexpensive hardware. In the last decade, we saw more and more advanced techniques such as per-pixel lighting get implemented. However, they are still not the state of the art.

A professional rendering system with virtually unlimited CPU time (by which I mean it doesn't have to be real-time) can do much more. Raytracing, gas simulation, particle systems with millions of particles per frame, Maths-based objects which aren't polygonal and will look round regardless of how close you look or abusive super-sampling on already abusive high-resolutions are just a few examples.

Software such as Blender or 3D Studio MAX will render production frames using the CPU to be able to implement those features as liberally as they can. You can very well wait a few seconds or a few minutes for a frame to render if you're making a wallpaper or movie.

This is not to say GPUs are useless for 3D modelling and rendering software. The GPU is used for the actual editor representation, a preview of the scene which can never be as good as the scene but the closer it looks the better for the creators.

Here in The States there are a few drinking establishments that feature a trough that is in practice similar to the pissing wall, but they are thankfully rare and in general, your average bar has respectable individual urinals that flush on an as-needed basis and do not require a man to bare his junk to his comrades.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","As someone who is currently making the same effort, I can only comment on what I've found so far, so it's definitely not canonical.

My approach has been to listen to local classical radio. I find that the mix is really good, and the people who do these shows really care about the music which is great. When I hear a piece I like I look up the track on the internet and then seek it out somewhere, either iTunes or at the library. Listening to the music not knowing what it is really helps me to find what I like without bias. \* 

One revelation I had early on is that a piece can be drastically different depending on who records it. Searching for track titles usually brings up some commentary and amazon cd comments are good for that purpose too. Also, I'm not an audiophile but how you listen makes a big difference in classical because it still has [dynamic range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war). A nice pair of headphones will go a long way, and I'd steer clear of youtube personally.

We're mostly atheists here, and none of us would be terribly impressed if a believer showed up and tried to sell us their brand of salvation. Yet if another atheist shows up and reels off a bunch of stuff that we are inclined to agree with, well, they'd fit right in.

So it is, in my observations, with religious communities. Mouthing pious platitudes in the company of other believers just helps people fit in. That's a pretty good payoff. Belonging to the group can be more important than being right. In a religious community, the atheist is ""wrong"". Nobody really knows anything about anything anyway, sometimes it just pays to buy into the local groupthink.

Now of course there are some committed theists out there who are not just deluding themselves so they can fit in. In my experience such people are quite rare, not likely to bring up the subject of religion, and don't particularly enjoy the company of the sheeple anyway.","1212327964"

They were assisted in getting there because they're tools, willing accomplices, of the lobbyist power structure. That was Bill's whole shtick: bringing Democrats back to ""the center"", i.e., screwing over the working class and making sure no major party stood in the way of corporate profits, or stood for the people.

Barack Obama doesn't take lobbyist money, and thanks to 1.5 million contributors, he doesn't need to. This rightly worries the Hillary and McCain backers. 

They'll be better off if Obama never makes it to the White House, and they don't care if the Democratic Party is collateral damage in preventing Obama's rise. And they've let Bill and Hill know that they'll continue to take care of the Clintons, so long as the Clintons continue to work hard for their corporate masters.

Playing ""chicken"" with the nomination is a win-win for Hillary: if the Democratic Party flinches from fighting her and gives her the nomination she didn't earn, she becomes President. If not, the corporate power structure will make sure she and Bill make another 100 million dollars for knee-capping Obama.","1212328332"

If it's simple, do it. If you don't want to or can't, then will you pay someone to fix it? No? Then what grounds do you have to call ""Can we *finally* get this fixed?!?!?!?!?!"".

If you read through the comments, it isn't simple. To be a good implementation of Javascript the dialogs need to be presented as expected, blocking everything else until OK'd. To be a good fix for this problem requires changing enough of the browser interface so it can handle blocking popups on a per-tab basis rather than on a per-window or per-process basis on all platforms on which it runs. Then providing a way to indicate that a tab out of view requires attention in a non-confusing manner. Then providing a user friendly option to quit out of a stuck script which isn't intrusive for the 99% case of scripts with popups which are working normally which will also potentially keep the popup messages somewhere viewable in case they are important. More difficult things have been done, yes, but it's nothing like a two minute change.

Some great artists you may not such as Mahler and Haydn.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I actually think women have a good argument that this analysis misses.

Look at the expected seat state probabilities for both genders.  Men, who spend much of their pre-couple life using an all-male bathroom expect the seat to be in either the up state or the down state with more or less equal probability (biased towards up, since people urinate more frequently than defecate).

Women, on the the other hand, have a probability distribution of expected toilet seat position which highly favors the seat being down.  This means that if they are in a male-like environment where the seat is up or down with equal probability, the likelihood of making a mistake is high.  The consequence of making a mistake is also high, since it means falling into the toilet.

For a man in a woman only environment the probability of making a mistake is low, since he is used to checking the state of the toilet before using it anyway.  Additionally, the cost of a mistake is low - you just pee on the seat some.

After a few years of living together, the individuals should adjust their expected seat position probabilities and the argument is made less important, although the woman still pays a much higher penalty in the event of a mistake.

In short, if you love a woman - put the seat down or you are a douchebag.

No, I called you a foul little ghost *of a boy*; ""ghost"" has more than one definition.

No, my position that gender is an arbitrary distinction when determining if a relationship is ""appropriate"" or not.

&gt; [""we shall overcome""]

The comparison wasn't that the struggle for gay marriage is the same as the black civil rights movement.

The comparison was that the gay rights struggle is *similar* to the black rights struggle.

The ""level"" of similarity is debatable, but they're certainly not *nothing* alike, which was your claim, and what I disagreed with.

&gt; [3rd grade]

Quoting somebody isn't proof of a position being right, which you imply. By quoting other people with an agenda against homosexuality. As an argument supporting an agenda against homosexuality.

That's circular, like when you say the Bible is right about something because it's ""God's word"". Do you see the assumption being made there? For those that don't believe in God, or your interpretation of God, it is a significant assumption, and renders most additional discussion meaningless until you are capable of accepting that you may, in fact, be *wrong*.

ANSWER THE QUESTION. FOCUS.

How will gay marriage destroy society?

It's unfathomable how completely bereft you are of anything of value to anybody.

I hope you're an organ donor so when you finally shuffle off this mortal coil *something* of worth will have been gained from your existence, you obtuse, hate-filled, small-minded, bigoted piece of flotsam.

That 2.02% are the 2.02% who actively make decisions in their hardware platform, work out the nastiest problems and document them, care about what their system is doing, refuse onboard audio and video, etc.  The power users.

Their importance is significant, because they usually run the data centers, do enterprise-level thinking and participate in enterprise-level decisions.

Imagine if, instead of producing hardware, you produced shoes... and found a market consisting only of CEOs.  Further imagine that this market is unhappy with their shoes and you could do a year's work with 10 top people and build a shoe that ALL the CEOs would wear.

CEOs are less than 1% of ALL employees out there, but you'd be in a significantly different position if the ONLY people you focused on were the biggest decision-makers in the society.  In no time at all, your shoes would be known by all -- not just CEOs -- as the only shoe to consider.

About 12 years ago Informix decided that they would support Linux; of course, having a decent code infrastructure, they realized that all they had to do was type ""make"" and they would have a Linux version. Oracle shortly followed; and now, after a decade of inductry changes, Oracle finds it necessary to even roll their OWN Linux distribution in order to remain the top dog.  That's how important it is.

Are you absolutely certain the desktop won't roll the same way?  Because it's your ass, you know.

Although I've kissed a girl and seen one naked, we were each 7 years old at the time so I don't think it counts. I admit, beginning to lose your hair (or notice it thinning, as is my case.. if there's any real difference) can be distressing.

I also have very few friends, but we're extremely ""tight"" with one another. My best friend whom I see regularly has been my best friend since we were 5 years old. Although I don't have acne problems, my cheeks are always rosy (most likely due to high blood pressure), so I always look like I have a bad sunburn on my face.

My dad and I were **extremely** close with one another, to the point where we too were best friends. But he passed away 6 months ago from a heart attack (exactly 2 goddamn days *before* he was scheduled to have surgery to fix his congenital heart defect).

When I go out, I generally only wear black t-shirts because if I do otherwise, I tend to get a hint of a shadow under my man-boobs, which makes me look even larger. But since I'm about 1.9 metres tall, I generally get noticed regardless of what I wear. My increasingly bushy pube-beard doesn't help either.

However, when it comes to personality, I tend to  act the same, no matter what company I'm in. Whether that's due to my limited social experiences so far, or I just learned to not give too much of a shit about what other people think, I'm not sure.

I've had several female friends, but I've never tried to make the leap from friend to romantic relationship with them. Mainly due to my insecurities, but also because I especially don't want to risk my friendship with one of them in particular.

Thing is, I know nobody is going to care about this post of mine. Everyone here has their own problems. No matter how sad or serious we may make our problems sound, many will probably think we're just mopey, whiny, or exaggerating. And we probably are. We're focusing so much on the bad things that we completely discredit anything meaningful in our lives, however little they may be.

Only thing I can say is... buck up. If your insecurities have gotten to the point where they seem to socially cripple you, then I and probably everyone else here would suggest doing something to overcome them.

"politics","t5_2cneq","It's a question of perspective.

Hillary's ""base"" is white middle class women who are old enough to have been a part of the second wave feminist movement, roughly from the end of the 60's to the beginning of the 80's. They're also the group of people who are most likely to have run up against bona fide sexism and hit a real glass ceiling at some point in their life. They tend to see everything through the lens of ""patriarchy"" and gender as the only dividing line that matters.

Now - that worldview is just wrong on a number of levels. It's too narrow (ignoring other factors like race or income as determinants), sexist in its own right, and Hillary Clinton is a really poor standard bearer for feminism, as she is where she is by virtue of marrying well. But nevertheless, it's important to understand where those white women are coming from.

Younger women see it better, IMHO; the aim of feminism is that a woman should have equal opportunity, but ultimately be treated as an individual. Hillary's run basically proved that a woman *can* be President, and that's enough for them.

I think on the whole, it's most telling that black women are voting their race over their gender, to the degree they're doing either. It's clear which they think is the bigger impediment, and it's something that middle class suburbanite women would do well to get some perspective on.","1212330589"

I believe `aticonfig --initial --dual-head` did it for me originally, but I've since tweaked it. One thing to keep in mind is that most cards have a lower top resolution for 3D than for 2D, so if you're running Compiz or something it may not work.

Try with vanilla GNOME or KDE or whatever floats your boat. I had to choose between dual 1280x1024 without Compiz or 1024x768 with Compiz. I chose the former because the lower resolution looked like crap on my LCD monitors. YMMV.","1212330763"

A government (and by that I mean democratic government) can only initialize violence against you via the same legal process that a corporation can and will use. There is no difference between not paying your taxes and not paying your credit cards as far as this goes - I know this because I've been through both.

"self","t5_2qh96","Well, I would have to say that I have quite a bit of empathy with you. I have the acne, have put on quite a bit of weight in college, and well, my dick is not a specimen for exhibition. I used to do the two shirt thing too, I have not gone swimming since my early teens. Oh yeah, I have big nipples too, like really big, not outwardly, but, in terms of circumference. 
I am struggling with the weight thing, I have come to understand that it will take a change of sufficient magnitude that the effort will need to be concerted, I am working on it. Beyond that from what I understand about small-dickedness, I would not be too worried about it. The way the wanker dangles is governed by the part of the nervous system that we have no control over. Generally, the dick is a pretty stock size on most everyone, with some outliers both toward huge and toward small. Your dick is probably not as small in comparison to the general population as you think, your parasympathetic nervous system just does't let it hang low when you are not hard. While I admit that I am a virgin, my lack of sex has given me plenty of time to study it. What I mean by that is that, while i avoid porno, I do not skip the science articles on sex, and the reference material if I have a question, I don't mind commentary as long as it is not aimed at tittilating me on its own terms instead of sharing information that is insightful. I am not entirely sure that a dick needs to be as huge as we would think. Like for instance, if your read about the clitoris, it is not way deep in there somewhere, but more toward the surface. I also gather that regardless of the guy's dick size, it is common for women to require some extra stimulation. Beyond that, sex generally lasts, per instance, around 15 minutes, with only three to five of that being penetrative. I do not mean to be dispassionate by saying that, I am sort of alluding to the notion that a bigger part of sex might not be so dick centric as it seems to direct reasoning. The 15 minutes thing too is also consistent with studies they have done on hotel porno, the average person who does hotel pay perview porn only watches it for around fifteen minutes.

With the acne, it does suck to have that, I was very self conscious about that when it was at its worst. I  don't think most people really mind scarring that much, especially on guys. If your scars are discolored, you can get stuff to bleach them. Beyond that, if you are like me, the farmer's tan from wearing a shirt all the time in the summer is as big an issue as the acne scars. I have not figured out the farmers tan yet, I have thought of going to a tanner, not as a lifelong habit, and using sunscreen there on my face and arms an legs, and just getting tanned in the regions of my body that never see the sun. I have noticed that the skin on my body that sees the sun is in better condition aestheticaly than the white stuff.

One thing I do suggest you do is refining your fashion quite a bit. This can help immensly. Look the best you can right now, and don't have it set out there in the future. You are not going to be able to solve it all overnight, but you can take care of some things today. I suggest wearing a short sleeve button up shirt over a T-shirt, I have gone to wearing dickies shirts with the labels cut off, they have nice short sleeve work shirts that are consistent in quality and availability. The button up short sleeve shirt has the qualities I liked wearing two T-shirts for, but looks much better. Beyond that, with pants, if you wear jeans, go for the darkest denim you can that is not black, and get a goood cut. If you are on a budget, there are ""Levi &amp; Strauss"" (not Levi's)ones at Wal-Mart that are nice for around 20$. Avoid light denim and cuts that are tapered, never wear anything pleated, don't wear shirts that have buttons on the edge of the collars. If you need to, don't be ashamed to go to a big and tall store, the first time i went to a big and tall store, I felt so at home, I did not feel like an outsider, I could almost feel good about being a big man, it was almost like there was different air in there, that is where the big men shop, the neurotic world churns outside.

Figure out your hair, and don't hide in a hat. Things to avoid are puff and frizz, this can make you look horrible, especially if you don't keep right on top of things ang get a haircut just as soon as you need one. I know it sounds crazy, but, I have found a lot of success with groom &amp; clean, that an Brylcreem, These are sort of unique hair products, it is not grease, it is hair groom, hair gel and spray leaves your hair hard or brittle, pomade and wax is gooey, hair groom on the other hand is ideal, a little dab around the size of a nickel or so, maybe a little bigger, will allow you to style your hair while conditioning it, it will stay in place and you will be able to go longer between haircuts. There is also shaving, make sure to keep up on it, big guys don't look so good with stubble. I find it much easier to shave without any shaving cream, just water or with shaving oil. Before I stopped using shaving cream, I shaved much less, now without the cream, it is no hassle, just wetten up and go, feeling to make sure it is smooth both ways.

I recommend also cultivating your deeper person. You are doing good by being here on Reddit, just make sure to get lots of good content that is quality, try to stay away from too much negativity. Virtue is important, and our culure glosses over so much of the deeper more fulfiling stuff in a superficial manner. Big guys are sort of shuffled to the perimeter, use this as an opportunity to gain perspective and grow contemplatively. If you are religious, get serious about it, historically guys who were outsiders or loners have had great relationships with God, like hermits and monks and shepards, they all have time to think and pray and grow. I know it may not seem like it is for you, but, it will help a lot with things. I became a Christian when I was eighteen, my high school friends, the people I had grown up with, all disbanded and went to college scattered all over, Church gave me a new set of friends, ones that will be my friends for life it appears. If you have not gone to church much before, I just suggest pursuing God for whatever you can get from it, be honest and forthright, if yoou don't have the faith right now, there is only something to be gained, and not really anything to be lost. There is some superficiality in Church, there is superficiality anywhere, I find with this, I just need to be a little persistent, and bear thruogh it because I am not perfect and the greater whole is worth it. I do not mean to be pushy with the evangelism. The biggest thing in my life that I think has ever helped me is my faith. I pray like a schizophrenic, my mouth is running whenever nobody is looking. Prayer has taught me about myself and has taken me deeper intellectually than anything I have ever done, it sounds like your blog might be similar in function, prayer is immediate and portable, your car or your room, or a restroom stall can all be a prayer closet, It just seems to work, ask for guidance and wisdom, but mostly, talk like you would to a friend. If you are skeptic, do what skeptics do, and experiment. 

As a big guy outside of the popular crowd, you have something beautiful that the people at the center of attention might never get. That is the space to think and grow as a person.

&gt;My undergrad level knowledge says that D-size cells are standardized and cheap to manufacture (one reason).

I think a huge battery is difficult to manufacture and requires a lot of maintenance, plus it won't be able to provide the voltage and current output as required. As a matter of fact, most ""large"" batteries internally contain a series or parallel combination of smaller cells.

A note: Even the 'Japanese' numbers are for their factory employees in the US.

&gt; Gas costs the same for everyone. If you make &lt;$30,000/yr, and you spend $5,000/yr on gas, than you've spent 16% of your income on gas.

&gt; If you make $50,000/yr, you've only spent 10%. It scales evenly.

&gt; In fact, middle class generally uses LESS gas, as they can afford more fuel efficient cars and hybrids.

&gt; So no, they are not as much affected. They are less effected. Period.

Some people live *at* their means or above, regardless of economic class. This means that regardless of what % of their income they spend on gas, the *rest* of what they spend overshadows it. Most middle class folks I know are struggling as much as the lower class right now.

If a commercial airline pilot is living at his means and loses his job because not enough people are flying (because of rising oil costs affecting the cost), he is *as much* affected by the rising oil costs as the poor person living at their means. If he is not able to transfer his skills to another occupation, then guess what, he's at risk of losing what he owns just the same as the poor person. The same goes for any person across any economic boundary that relies on oil, which guess what, is *all* of them.

Women, who spend most of their pre-couple adult life using female only toilets, are used to the seats always being down.  Men, on the other hand, are used to the seats being in either position and are used to checking the seat before attempting to sit.

This makes the probability of a woman making a mistake much higher than that of a man for perfectly justifiable reasons and the consequences for making a mistake are quite large - you fall into a fucking toilet which is gross and probably painful.

I mean maybe if a man and woman have been living together for a long time and the woman can reasonably be expected to have gotten used to the probability distribution of the toilet seat position, then the rule could be relaxed - but frankly why not just be polite?

- Barber: [Adagio For Strings Op.11](http://www.amazon.com/Barber-Strings-Orchestral-Leonard-Slatkin/dp/B000002RQE/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212330597&amp;sr=8-1) - Slow yet intense string piece.  

- Dvorak: [New World Symphony](http://www.amazon.com/Dvor%C3%A1k-Symphony-No-9-New-World/dp/B0000041QB/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212330667&amp;sr=1-4) - Good symphony with a wide range, from slow moving parts to more bombastic parts.  (at times, you can hear similarities to the score from Star Wars/Imperial March)

- Rachmaninov: [Vespers](http://www.amazon.com/Rachmaninov-Vespers-Sergey/dp/B0002T2QC4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212330728&amp;sr=1-1) - One of my personal favorites.  Choral music - intense, haunting at times, interesting harmonies founded on that trademark Russian low bass.

- Mozart: [Le Nozze di Figaro](http://www.amazon.com/Mozart-nozze-Figaro-Kanawa-London/dp/B0000041OU/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212330877&amp;sr=8-1) A very accessible opera, and one of Mozart's most famous, perfect for a beginning opera listener.

- Beethoven - Symphonies [5](http://www.amazon.com/Beethoven-Symphonies-5-Ludwig-van/dp/B000001GPX/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212332082&amp;sr=1-1) and [9](http://www.amazon.com/Beethoven-Symphony-No-9-Choral/dp/B000HDR7GA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212332109&amp;sr=1-1).  Easily two of Beethoven's most famous symphonies.  Beyond the parts you hear in movies and commercials, very moving and complex pieces.  The 9th is incredibly deep, particularly the 4th movement.  I literally have over a dozen recordings of this piece alone, and hear something new every time I listen to it.

- Vivaldi: [Four Seasons](http://www.amazon.com/Vivaldi-Four-Seasons-Antonio/dp/B000003CSU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212332274&amp;sr=1-1).  You'll recognize this in quite a few places.  I'm fond of the Winter suite, especially the third movement.

- Bach: [Brandenburg Concertos](http://www.amazon.com/Bach-Complete-Brandenburg-Concertos-Pearlman/dp/B000003D1F/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212332655&amp;sr=1-2).  A good example of Bach's counterpoint style in Baroque string music

- Rachmaninov: [Piano Concerto #2](http://www.amazon.com/Rachmaninov-Piano-Concertos-Nos-3/dp/B000025WWO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212332879&amp;sr=1-2).  Intense and melodic, this piece transitions from sweeping melodic lines building to full frenzy - almost chaotic at times.

- Beethoven: [Piano Concerto #5 - Emporer](http://www.amazon.com/Anton-Kuerti-plays-Beethoven-Orchestra/dp/B000003XUG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212333007&amp;sr=1-1).  You could call this a ""fancy"" piece  - several running lines across the piano, including heavy ornamentation and embellishments, particularly in the 1st and 3rd movements.  The 2nd movement is more reserved, and it's tranquility bridges the more lively movements.

- Stravinsky: [Rite of Spring](http://www.amazon.com/Stravinsky-Conducts-Petrushka-Sacre-Printemps/dp/B0000026GJ/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212333568&amp;sr=8-1).  Fascinating, driving intensity - asymmetrical rhythms make this very interesting, unconventional.

- If you're feeling adventurous and want to delve into a longer piece of a different style, Handel's [Messiah](http://www.amazon.com/Handel-Messiah-Reynolds-Langridge-Marriner/dp/B00000427H/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212334401&amp;sr=1-1) or Mendelssohn's [Elijah](http://www.amazon.com/Mendelssohn-Elijah-Dietrich-Fischer-Dieskau/dp/B0002XV31A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1212334350&amp;sr=1-1) are two great oratorios.","1212333213"

At 20,000 units per year, those costs drop further to a range of $13,000 to $16,000, At mass production volumes of 100,000 units, costs come down further to a range of $11,000 to $12,500.""","1212334153"

1)The marrige was annuled because she lied what she lied about is almost irrelevant see 2

Relatives will often demand to see the bloody sheets as proof, how ever if the woman doesn't bleed (which may not be because she isn't a virgin but due to other causes) it is customary for the husband to cut himself and bleed on the sheets and then lie to his family.

Disclaimer: The above is something I read about many years ago I do not remember the source so I can not guarantee it's accuracy but in any case it would obviously only be true for very conservative Muslims. I know a muslim who doesn't drink but has girlfriends and whos reasoning for this is that you have to have a little sin in your life :)

Edit: I found several sources from google supporting this among them several different versions of this article specificaly mentioning the lack of bloody sheets but here is an quote from a different story completely
&gt;...the wedding festivities often culminate in the bride's and groom's retreat to a bedroom nearby. After a brief time, a female family member will bring out blood-stained sheets for triumphant display to the crowd, attesting to the bride's virginity and the groom's potency. Since many young couples today have in fact been sexually active before the wedding, however, the display of the sheets can pose a problem. We heard of cases where the bride brought a vial of her own blood into the bedroom, or where the groom cut himself, or where animal blood was used.

At the time there were three options for DTV hacking. Two were called plastic hacks 3M and Activation and the third was EMU emulation. The Black Sunday ECM nuked all 3M's and a lot of cards running activation but the EMU boxes were unharmed. The only way to fix the cards hit by the Black Sunday ECM was to use a hardware device called a boot loader. It used a Atmel chip that allowed the card to bypass the damaged area. After all this went down most went to emulation since it was considered bullet proof and remained so until the end of the H stream. Before the H stream was cut off a plastic hack came out for the HU/P3 cards and business carried on as usual until two or so years later when the HU stream was cut off and the P4/5 cards were out.

Similarly humans have never had such an abundance of food and just like food many people don't know when to stop with information.  Like food, information used to be a limited and even scarce resource, so we are hard wired to gorge ourselves.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Corporations are a legal fiction, that only exist by the will and permission of the government, and in turn, the people. They enjoy privileges, such as shareholder liability protection, that ordinary people doing business do not.

If a solitary business owner is taxed, and his employees are taxed, and he pays his employees out of revenue his business generates, then this ""double taxation"" the article is complaining about occurs anyway. That's because under income tax, any wealth-generating transaction is subject to tax.

I think that's all the more reason that corporate taxes should be heavier, and individual lighter. If you want to enjoy the benefits of investor liability protection, then you can deal with larger tax burden.

As for taxing resource extraction, and drawing in more externalities such as pollution, deforestation, water depletion etc. I'd love to see it. 

A problem remains, and it is a problem, that once someone's personal wealth generates enough to live on comfortably and then some, they become simply an owner. Their bank account continues to balloon while they aren't productive in any way. This increasing accumulation of wealth creates situations where the majority of people are unable to get ahead and are just working to keep living, while the wealthy enjoy the benefit of owning an increasing share of society's wealth and property.

That's why income and capital taxes are necessary: so that society doesn't inevitably end up an oligarchy, with the only recourse to the people being revolution.","1212334993"

While I loved the people and the cultural experience and richness there, the literal filth on the street, the meat out in the open sun being sold, the people squatting to piss and crap in the middle of the street with no restrooms, and then people sleeping on top of that as their home, is a little hard to over look wouldn't you think?

Although, it was also interesting to notice most of the natives to Calcutta simply overlooking it. It is so rampant that it has become part of their daily life. This was prevalent in just talking with some of the people there. Being an outsider and being used to higher standards than that, it makes the poverty stand out like a sore thumb. 

You don't need pre-conceived notions to notice that there are a lot of things wrong with Calcutta.

2) While smoking is clearly not that healthy, the health risks of second hand smoke are so small as to be difficult to detect amongst those who don't actually grow up with a smoker.

3) Most animals we raise for slaughter are fed antibiotics on a daily basis so that they can survive very suboptimal grain-based diets.

4) The widespread use of antibiotics on such a scale is the leading cause of antibiotic-resistant diseases such as MSRI and TB.

5) The threat of a pandemic is an existential risk to humanity that no amount of smoking could be.

&gt;NO, it's only your opinion that police forces exist for the ""stated reason"" of enforcing law and order

Actually, it isn't my opinion, it's documented fact: The purpose of police forces are to maintain law and order. **You are 100 percent wrong. Give it up**.

&gt;Where is this mythical ""reason"" stated?

[Police are agents or agencies, usually of the executive, empowered to enforce the law and to effect public and social order through the legitimatized use of force.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police)

[The UK police force is a modern, responsive institution responsible for building safer and more secure communities for us all.](http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/)

Ask anyone - stop someone on the street, if you want to - and ask them the question ""What are Police Forces for?"" and they'll give you a similar answer. Everyone KNOWS police forces are supposed to exist to keep us safe and promote law and order.

&gt;My opinion is that police forces exist to control the population

Your opinion is wide of the mark, and I am not willing to entertain any conspiracy theories. 

&gt;With a name like ""Tapok"", I'm sure you're brown enough

I'm 20 years old, white, middle class, and English. The name is just a username. Trying to determine someones skin colour from their username is at once futile and insane.

&gt;Lemme guess, you believe in some sort of ""god"", don't you?

Most animals we raise for slaughter are fed antibiotics on a daily basis so that they can survive very sub-optimal grain-based diets.

Many people know that over-use of prescription antibiotics is dangerous due to how it promotes antibiotic resistance in a variety of bacterial infections.  What they don't talk about so much, is that the amount of antibiotics used for factory farming absolutely dwarfs all human consumption combined. In a very real sense, we can thank meat-eaters (myself included) for the next MRSI-type of infection.

"self","t5_2qh96","I made this account just to comment on this, and, I'm not trolling, all of this is true (I just needed a name, and it was the first thing that came to mind).

1)  I don't think that it's been proven, but I'm absolutely positive that cardiovascular health is associated with penis size.  If you want a bigger dick, try running.

2)  If you have a REALLY small dick, you might have micropenis.  See a urologist.  You might be able to do this on the cheap through your university.

3)  Read The Mystery Method, and maybe The Game.  I haven't read The Game yet, but I watched Neil Strauss's Annihilation Method DVDs.  The Mystery Method might make you feel worse at first, but it will give you a way to think about your relationships.  Annihilation Method (which you can pirate off of bittorrent if you want, it's out there), will teach you more about how to approach life.  If your dad didn't do the right things for you, maybe Neil Strauss can get you a bit of what you need.

4)  Read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.  It's another book that will help you understand a little about getting your life on track.  I'm not sure that Lila is as good though, I never finished it.  I didn't like it as much.

5)  On working out.  Lift weights too.  More muscle = more testosterone = bigger dick + more self-confidence + more energy.  Also, chicks are met at the gym, plus, a meat-head can look butt-ugly.  There's a certain kind of chick who finds that more manly.

6)  Try out wrestling, jiu-jitsu, or some other sport that involves kicking people's asses.  It will make you more self-confident and you'll make guy friends if you survive it.

7)  Don't give up.  I never had it as bad as you.  I was fortunate to have great parents.  On the other hand, I had a funky growth defect (that got corrected) and didn't think that I could be what I wanted when I grew up.  All that stuff does is hold you back a little, if you don't let it destroy you.

I got my shit on track, and started leading the life I wanted, in most respects.  Now I'm working on getting the other respects back in-line.  Once I got women and fun in-line, I got professional stuff in-line.  It's a constant struggle for everyone, because now I have to get women back in-line again.  I went from a good job, but not what I wanted to be doing, but a really hot girlfriend, to school where I wanted to be, but no girlfriend.

You're going go get out of life what you invest into it.  Don't worry about the dick thing.  It's probably not as small as you think it is.  Besides, most chicks aren't size queens (though, some are).  Work out some of your frustrations and the rest will fall into place.  DON'T hang around in places like reddit, where people feed back into very negative feelings very strongly.  If you're really unhappy, communities like this will throw you over the edge.  DO go do things that are social.  Try your school's dancing clubs (they all have one, and it might get you some practice getting laid), or, if you're into geekier stuff, try LARPing or something.  Get off of your computer and out somewhere where you'll see people.","1212336193"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Here in Austin we have several classes that do just this. Some are part of The University of Texas' Informal Classes, some are available at Whole Foods Market's Culinary Center, and some are available at Central Market's Cooking School.

If you have any similar resources in your area, this might be a place to start to look for lessons in new cuisine.

Other options:

- Go with a Chinese friend to Dim Sum. If your friend is familiar with Chinese culture they'll be able to explain how it works and what you're eating.

- Read up on sushi on Wikipedia and then go try it. Be sure to learn the proper tequnique for eating it.

- Read Chowhound.com

- Read your local restaurant critic's column in the paper each week.

- Read Cook's Illustrated.

- Watch the Food Network

- Try out one expensive or highly regarded restaurant each month/quarter/year/whatever. Pick a different style of cuisine each time: French one time, Continental the next, Interior Mexican, Italian, Korean, Thai, etc.

- Take a wine tasting class to learn what to look for in a good bottle of wine and to learn how it's made and the various types of wine. Then go visit some local wineries.

- See if any nice restaurants in your area have special meals on Monday nights. Often this is their slow day, so they'll do something special these nights to bring in business, like a prix fixe night featuring a special assortment of wines and a guest speaker to talk about the wines.

- Read Miss Manners or Emily Post to learn proper dinner table etiquette. It's really not intimidating if you understand the basic principles (e.g. use silverware from the outside-in, etc).

- Buy something unfamiliar each trip to the grocery store. go to Wikipedia to learn about it and Supercook.com to find recipes on how to prepare it.

- Attend farmer's markets and chat with the sellers. Buy something there that you haven't tried before, like a new kind of cheese. The vendor will be happy to tell you about it. They'll likely be the person who made it!

- Exercise. All this eating will make you fat, if you're not careful.","1212336509"

My point is that the legal concepts that Roe V Wade is based is a load of hooey. And when you push through your agenda using stuff like penumbras, you open the door (through legal precedent) to the opposite using your tactics against you.

YouTube is legally bound to respond to takedown notices or be held liable when they were properly issued... and based on the number of notices they must receive, there's no way they could possible sort through who does and who does not have the right to request a takedown.  Besides, how would you even be able to prove who does and who does not have the legal authority to request a takedown?  That's often a complicated matter even for a court, let alone a busy company responding to an email.  Should YouTube do a full hearing every time it receives a takedown notice to determine authenticity?

I couldn't disagree more.  Let's just think about Rails for a minute since that was the author's focus.  In order for Rails to gain popularity there need to be less barriers to getting an app online.  Having to pay for a top-performing runtime is a new barrier.  For that reason alone I don't see MagLev becoming the most popular Ruby implementation, at least not in the Rails camp.

Take the case of a woman living alone.  She leaves the seat down 100% of the time, and things are fine.  It's always where she wants it.  Then she moves in with a guy, and now almost 50% of the time, the seat is in a position which is never useful for her.  Thus she has to do more work to use the bathroom than she did before.

Now take the case of a guy who lives alone.  He leaves the seat up when he's done peeing, because there's a chance that next time he goes to use the toilet, he'll be peeing again.  The seat will already be up, and some effort will have been saved.  It's an efficient way of doing things.  Then he moves in with a woman, and the woman leaves the seat in the ""down"" position every time.  He already had to raise the seat some of the time when he lived alone, but now the percentage of time that he has to raise it has increased moderately, so more work has been created for him as well.

The man doesn't notice much difference because he already had to change the seat's position from time to time (because he uses both configurations).  The woman notices a huge difference because now there is a new task (putting the seat in the correct position) that was never necessary before *at all*.

Both feel slightly put out, the adjustment is more annoying for the woman, and she complains, the man doesn't understand because the adjustment was almost imperceptible for him, he thinks the woman is just being crazy, and a war starts.","1212338033"

If a conservative can argue the same thing to get ""special powers"" during wartime he would be full of shit because the amendments only limit government power to intervene with the individual.

If a satellite TV company doesn't want people to see their signal well then don't beam it at their house! Oh and pirating to me would mean taking the content from the signal and selling the content for a profit, which isn't happening.

 It's even worse here in Canada because I can see a US satellite TV signal, it's from a completely different country. But as I said it should matter any since it's just radio waves.

 Although I do agree DirectTV owned the signal and had the right to do whatever they wanted to it and if I suffered because if it, well that's too bad for me.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","This, of course, is the notorious West Midlands Police. 

Two other examples of their fantastic policing:

**One**: A UK tv channel investigated extremism in local mosques and broadcast a very disturbing documentary about them. The police first investigated the production company for hate crimes, then when that failed took on the role of TV critic and referred the documentary to the UK TV regulator. Finally, because the police refused to apologise for their libel, the were taken to court and ordered to pay £100,000 in damages - that's taxpayers' money. Details from the BBC here:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/7401704.stm



**Two**: certain womens' groups have reported that officers at some stations cannot be relied upon to protect women seeking refuge from violent husbands. Zalikha Ahmed of Apna Haq refuge said, *We don't visit the station when certain Asian officers are on because some of them are perpetrators and one of them said that he would not arrest someone who used force on his wife*

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;It is not acceptable if women are forced to choose between a family and a career in science. 

This is the real debate that needs to be had. The career path in science(at least if you want to be a ""senior scientist"") requires not only long hours, but a period of training until at least your mid 30s. You can figure on 4 years of undergrad, 5-8 years of grad school, 4-6 of post doc before you get a potentially permanent academic position. A career path that typically leaves you moving around the country every few years while working 60+ hour weeks doesn't work well with family life, particularly for a woman. However this career path is a really good way to create great scientists. A career path requiring less hours, more stability, and less years would likely result in less amazing science. So, is it better to keep the system even though women will have a hard time navigating it? or alter it to be more friendly to women even if it results in less science?

Of course some minor adjustments clearly should be done. For example blinding the process of grant proposal, and paper reading, could eliminate much of the overt bias. ","1212339174"

That's not a problem.  The point is that only a jury can determine *guilt*.  Anyone, from the police, to a prosecutor, to a judge can determine *innocence*.  Consider what would have to happen for the prosecutor to win this case:

1) He would have to decide it is worth it to prosecute a man he doesn't believe to be innocent, but a man he *knows* to be innocent thanks to the DNA testing

2) He would have to convince a judge to exclude evidence of the man's innocence from the trial, which is not unheard of

This is not the job we, the citizens, pay a prosecutor to do.  Aside from the justice or fairness angle, the reason we don't want prosecutors who railroad innocent people is we don't want them to one day railroad us.","1212339276"

Lots of intelligent people make poor decisions of every sort imaginable.  But *most* smart, rational people usually try to avoid needlessly self-destructive behavior.  Especially something as extreme as ""nigh-inevitable cause of death""  It's a pattern you'll start to notice if you get any older.  Truly, stupid is as stupid does.

&gt;Do you think smokers don't enjoy smoking?

None of them at first.  At first it's the coughing, foul tasting, ""adapting to being cool"" phase.  Them some of them, after the chemical dependency kicks in, ""enjoy"" it for at least a while. 

I'm sure there's even a sweet-spot where crack-heads ""enjoy"" crack cocaine.  

But to pretend there's anything close to a reasoned cost-benefit analysis going on in the mind of a smoker is utterly dishonest.  No one honestly says that the taste of burning leaves is worth dying an agonizing death for.  At best, you'll hear ""enjoyment"" as a rationalization from an addict, but never whole hearted and sober.

&gt;And some of us like the smell of tobacco.

That usually comes after years of inhaling burning gasses and soot have damaged your olfactory senses to the point where your overall sense of smell and taste are damaged beyond complete repair.  

And after the first few mooths it's genuinely hard to separate a conscious ""like"" of the small from the inevitable pavlovian ""that smell--- I'm gonna get my fix so I can feel right again"" response.

You are not alone.  Millions in the US and everywhere are waking up to the void in parenting that started in the 50ies and continues today due multiple reasons (mainly the need for both parents to work, divorce...) but which all lead to the fact that generations of children did not have parenting at some of the most subtle and sensitive times of their development - things related to 'emotional maturity' seem to get hit very hard in these 'latch-key' kids.

also I IMPLORE you to check out ACOA (google-ACOA - Adult Children of Alcoholics) - They are all about fixing this phenomena and the 'alcohol' moniker could be dropped because it has been come to be recognized that alcohol abuse and patterns is just one of many forms this dis-ease takes (parent could have - drugs, hypochondria, work-a-holic, etc. - what matter is that they weren't there for child's development)

GREAT ACOA/Yahoo group that is email ONLY and as anonymous and lurkable as any group could be:

Those who use it for other reasons are basically rogue operators, and they have other names, like ""psychic"" or ""medium"".

The Bible is actually specific about this.  I can't remember the verse, probably somewhere in Acts, but I believe there is story in the Bible of a guy who was basically a psychic/medium/healer/whatever who converted to Christianity and then continued to operate, only under the auspices of Jesus.

Or to put all this a different way, if you've been given the ability to talk to spirits, the Bible maintains that it's important *which ones* you talk to.

You are not alone.  Millions in the US and everywhere are waking up to the void in parenting that started in the 50ies and continues today due multiple reasons (mainly the need for both parents to work, divorce...) but which all lead to the fact that generations of children did not have parenting at some of the most subtle and sensitive times of their development - things related to 'emotional maturity' seem to get hit very hard in these 'latch-key' kids.

Read this kinda hard to read PDF of a chapter from a textbook on psychotherapy (I used this chapter as a model through my recovery):

[http://zombiepsychic.com/WordPress/?page_id=206](http://zombiepsychic.com/WordPress/?page_id=206)

also I IMPLORE you to check out ACOA (google-ACOA - Adult Children of Alcoholics) - They are all about fixing this phenomena and the 'alcohol' moniker could be dropped because it has been come to be recognized that alcohol abuse and patterns is just one of many forms this dis-ease takes (parent could have - drugs, hypochondria, work-a-holic, etc. - what matter is that they weren't there for child's development)

GREAT ACOA/Yahoo group that is email ONLY and as anonymous and lurkable as any group could be:

[http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/aca-acoa/](http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/aca-acoa/)

This is one the next big mental health/awareness advances to come about because not only is it fixing a societal ill (adult children - depression anxiety) it is spurring evolution in that we are creating truly content and happy/loving human beings because this stuff teaches people how to, in a healthy way, be your own good parent by loving the self and supporting and trusting the self.

While I don't believe 13-year-olds should be having sex, I also don't believe these two men should go to prison for what they did.

That piece argued that under Islamic law Obama was an apostate and that therefore would be the target of Muslim assassins. It was a crazy piece, and it was amazing to see it in the Times. (Why would they publish a piece by a neoconservative on Islamic theology? That's like publishing a piece by Pat Buchanan on Jewish dietary laws).

&gt; Anyway, it was all lies. And today the Times flatout admitted it in a long apologia.

&gt; The Luttwak hit job was part of the anti-Obama campaign that is emanating from the tiny right wing of the Jewish community. It's pretty intense.

I believe this is a reference specifically to the Olympics.  As I recall, when you won an event in the ancient Olympics, you didn't get a medal, but instead got a crown made out of some kind of plant, possibly olive branches woven together.

This all reminds me of the time I saw some guy's web site who had concluded that, of all things, drums were evil musical instruments.  Stringed instruments were great, but drums were pure evil and of the devil.  So I e-mailed the guy and asked him about the verse in the Bible that says ""praise Him with the timbrel, and dance"", and asked him how he justified his view in light of the fact that the timbrel is a type of drum (it's basically a tambourine, although possibly without jingles, so just a hoop with a drum head stretched across it).  He e-mailed back claiming that a tambourine isn't a drum, and I think I asked him what type of instrument it *was* if it wasn't a drum.  He didn't have any sort of answer for that and just continued to maintain that even though it has a head and you beat on it and use it as a percussive instrument with a rhythmic function in the music, *it is not a drum*.","1212340692"

Not true. 50-50 I believe it is, and you could stop at 40 and be 100% healthy by 50.

Wrong. So wrong. Nicotine is a drug, it gives you a high. Most people like it. 

&gt; Them some of them, after the chemical dependency kicks in

Takes about a week or so of daily smoking for that to happen. You saying they do something they hate for a week? 

&gt; I'm sure there's even a sweet-spot where crack-heads ""enjoy"" crack cocaine.

They enjoy it every single time. Do you know anything about substance abuse and why people do it? Have you ever even tried normal cocaine? 

&gt; But to pretend there's anything close to a reasoned cost-benefit analysis going on in the mind of a smoker is utterly dishonest.

I never said that, I joked it may in fact be that way while refuting equally dishonest comments about it being not only guaranteed but also hugely draining on healthcare.

&gt; That usually comes after years of inhaling burning gasses and soot have damaged your olfactory senses

Sigh. I'm clearly arguing with someone who doesn't have the first clue. Find a tobacconist and pop your head in the door for a few seconds. Now, most places are now no-smoking but it's not the smoke you want anyway so you won't be risking anything. It's the exotic smells and spices from the various tobaccos. Try it. Just once.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Yes, yes, that's the only way it could be done (this feature was compatible even with Java 1.1!) but something like that's going to be true any *any* language that allows closures.  

The language has this feature:  the fact that it's done with a member variable behind the scenes should be irrelevant as long as it works.

There are really only two choices when you capture a local variable in a frame, closure, inner class, whatever you call it:  either you make a copy of the original variable, or you save the frame somewhere and have a pointer to it.

Having a pointer to the actual frame is very powerful but introduces a lot of issues - for example, you have to be extremely careful if you are using the same frame in different threads and since frames are used in different levels in the system this is quite likely.

Java chooses to make a copy of the variable, which is somewhat less powerful but thread-safe and easy to understand - but most important, works perfectly well in 95% of situations where you simply want easy access to some variables you've computed in the parent frame but are used in the children.

I should add that I'm not a massive Java advocate - though I've spent years writing Java, these days I'm writing Gnu-ish C++ and Python for various reasons - but I wanted to point out that Java's closures are a Good Feature of the language that appear to do pretty well what you want.","1212342036"

I can respect why people choose mac but it still boils down to personal choice, you can only measure superiority on individual elements not overall. OSX is still very expensive for me to justify to myself compared to windows when you count the cost of parts, it's just a preference.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;They're not based on reality and are mostly entirely divorced from it.

That's self-contradictory.  

They're based on reality either as fantasies *about* reality or as effects of a person's psychology.  The mind generates sexual fantasies, they don't just occur independently.

&gt;If you really dig on gym socks or schoolgirl outfits or drawings of anthropomorphic animals, it says absolutely nothing about you as a person, it's just a fantasy.

This I agree with, if you mean 'as a person' as in your morals etc.  For example, a Freudian might say that a rape fantasy means 'you hate yourself', which I think is bullshit; there are other, simpler, moral reasons for such a fantasy.  Maybe you want to give up control for once, or have someone prove they're attracted to your body, etc.  Same with furries; maybe they represent happy innocence to you, or their form is attractive for coloring, texture, etc. based on other preferences of yours (hypothetical 'you').

I'm worried that you have or know someone who has guilty fantasies.  Fantasies are based on reality, but that doesn't mean they're evil/bad/immoral necessarily.  I think a rape fantasy is normally perfectly healthy.  (This feminist's issue isn't her rape fantasy, it's the rest of her bullshit...)","1212342706"

I 've just seen your C modified code
and I have a suggestion to make. I am not sure if it's correct but I hope it is.
In function run2() you are using fputs a lot of time to put only a single char.
Can't you change it, since you know how many time the loop will repeated,
with something like

void run2() {
    int x,y;
    char * temp;
    temp = malloc(39*2*(39*2+1)+1*sizeof(char));
    
    for(y=-39;y&lt;39;y++){
         temp[(y+39)*((39*2)+1)] = '\n';
         for(x=-39;x&lt;39;x++){
             int i = mandelbrot(x/40.0,y/40.0);
             if(i==0)
                 temp[(y+39)*((39*2)+1)+(x+39)+1] = '*';
             else
                 temp[(y+39)*((39*2)+1)+(x+39)+1] = ' ';
         }
    }
    temp[39*2*(39*2+1)]='\n';
    
    fputs(temp,stderr);
}

I hope this make some different.
I think Java did some improve but C is faster.
Of course in both cases it depends on your code/programming skills :-P

"reddit.com","t5_6","Ah, but brevity is the soul of reddit.

You want details of the multiple ways voters are getting screwed on this deal, I can dish. I live in Michigan. 

1) The decision to move the primary date was never put before voters.

2) The date change was immediately contested by the national parties. The media reported this sporadically, and mostly to the effect of ""no one knows if the primary will be allowed to proceed"", so no voters in Michigan really knew for certain whether the primary was going to happen until about the week before.

3) Voters had to use a party ballot, which is not normal in a state that often comes down to swing voters.

4) The primary is usually held in conjunction with voting day for local issues too, but that voting day wasn't changed, which resulted in TWO voting days already this year. Many people didn't get that memo. Whoops!

And these are just the issues that come into play BEFORE you start in on whether citizens get to have their votes counted full, half, not at all; how the voters get to pick up the tab for the cost of double the elections in a state where the economy's in the toilet anyway; whether they even get their candidates on the ballot, etc.","1212343377"

Laws encourage teens to make worse decisions than they would have otherwise.

So- kids go leave the house, drive.. and go out in the woods or to some sketchy dude's apartment and get plastered out of their fucking minds, and then try to drive home.

Consent laws keep people of the same age together- you think that's safer for them??
Do you remember what's going through the mind of a 15 year old male compared to a guy with experience?

your logic is not there. Sure we can play games debating morality all day- but the reality is- legislating morality typically does more damage to the citizen than letting them dabble in peace.

As for your argument on age being a requirement for sophisticated decisions- how do you explain the popularity of fox news? Face it- many adults live their entire lives with the awareness of a 12 year old.. so should we have IQ and logic tests and then make it statutory rape if you have sex with one?
Of course not.

So of course, ""no there really isn't"". I mean, hey, why not? If you bring the same indifference to the question that you would to scratching your knee, of course your idea of perfection will be lazy and useless.

the nut of the article is this:
&gt; The first [reason why there is no such thing as perfection] is that there is an enormous variety of users out there. What’s perfect to one will be unbearable to another. 

So by perfection they mean completely satisfying the wants/needs of a given user. And, *in given respects* (that is, according to any specific person's criteria) it is completely possible that perfection exists. They even say this in the article (apple, google).

The thing they think is not possible is universal perfection, by which they mean ""satisfying all the people all the time"", or, ""satisfying a wide range of mutually exlusive requirements"", which is necessarily impossible.

But for this to even be valid, you first have to buy into the idea that this actually is a good description of what perfection is, and if you do buy into it, you also have to completely ignore cases where the only criteria that matters is your own.

If I want to add correctly and nothing else, and I do 2+2=4, I have achieved my aims perfectly.

Saying there is ""no perfection"" is just a lazy way of using a deeply loaded philosophical term to say ""people have different tastes"", which plasters over the whole problem of individual cases, wherein it's *completely* possible. It's just a way of evading the responsibility of deciding for yourself, what counts as good enough. It's a form of apathy, which I see as validated by the last paragraph of the article.

&gt;The main point of this article is to convince you to stop chasing perfection as a concrete goal.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","You can claim that ""taxes are theft by force"" until you're blue in the face, but the fact remains that people DO consent to live in countries with taxes. Happily. They prefer it to alternatives.

The fact remains that countries with hybrid economies which operate in the interests of people, and provide for needs and interests like healthcare, education, welfare, consumer protection, environmental protection, major infrastructure investments, long-term social programs, and amelioration of conditions for the poor, are **the best nations in the world to live in, according to empirical measures**. 

These nations aren't totalitarian, the borders are porous and people are free to immigrate and emigrate. Which do they choose to do in aggregate? People are voting with their feet.

The underlying motive behind extremist economic ideologies is not ""I want the best society that there can be"" or ""this is the best way to meet everyone's needs"", or even ""I believe that this is truly the most free way to live"", but rather ""*I want more for me and everyone else can go fuck themselves.*""

Rule by the Dollar leads to one situation: where a wealthy elite control the majority of capital, property, industry, and services. Education? Sorry, that's for the rich kids. Health care? If you're lucky to have a job in which it's in the employer's interest to provide it. Housing? Owned by The Company. Want to move away? Pay tolls on the road; but first the private security company guarding it will check if you have any outstanding financial obligations: if so, sorry, you're required to remain here and pay off your debt.

It's a little bit confusing to me. From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus)

    Kxy == x
    Sxyz == xz(yz)

So, for concatenative version, I think the following makes sense:

    [x] [y] k == x 
    [x] [y] [z] s == [z] [[z] y] x
    
So, 

    k = zap i
    s = dup [swap cons] dip swap [swap] dip swap i

I am following the following convention:

- applicative version ==&gt; concatenative version
- `+ 1 2` ==&gt; 1 2 + , not 2 1 +
- `- 1 2` ==&gt; 1 2 -, not 2 1 -

Hrm.. I 'm not sure how curry would look like in concatenative version.

- `(+ 1) 2` ==&gt; 1 [2 +] i ??

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I doubt that a revolutionary fundamentalist regime in Saudi would care what the balance sheets would say.  They're not exactly accountants.

I'm glad you agree that ""killing communists was probably bad"".  I think that you should think about, however, *why* freedom and democracy is good and *why* communism is bad.  Imposing your government's will on other nations is not promoting democracy and freedom, it is removing choice from the local people, thereby making the call of democracy and freedom ring hollow.  

Killing of communists is not less bad than killing capitalists: it is killing.  Communism is bad because of the repression.  (Yes it is a lesser economic system, but it was meant to better the living conditions of people just as capitalism is.)  Killing ""communists"" is the very same repression of people of unwanted ideologies and closer to the root of why communism should be shunned.  What good is capitalism to you are one of the 30,000 Chileans rounded up and tortured?  What good is your vote for a better government when a once modern Iraq now has sewage openly running in the streets, kids dying from water borne disease and medical treatment being too expensive for many Iraqis to afford?  

The US government waves these ideas of ""capitalism"", ""freedom"", ""democracy"" around like flags (for your consumption) and then goes about destroying those very things that are the foundation of those ideals.  It is like a mob stealing people's life savings and then offering a 3% higher interest rate. Well fantastic!

Finally, ""mismanaging the war"" is not the main charge in the eyes of the word: illegally causing the deaths of a million Iraqis is.

In regard to your comment about mixed race relationships, I'd like to clear up that I am not trying to condemn them in any way. I agree that it's probably likely that a lot of the white males or females in those relationships would be people who were curious about Asian culture and ones that would try to familiarize themselves with it. But you'd also have to think that the same would go for the Asian counterparts in those relationships- that they would be ones that would be more open to ""white"" culture and probably have more of a Western/American mindset.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm surprised nobody has mentioned the issue of eras yet!

It is entirely possible to enjoy classical music, but not all periods. There is a medieval period, but I know very little about it. I hear pieces here and there, but have never went in depth into it. Similarly, it's fairly rare to hear someone get excited about renaissance composers, but it's a nice place to start, to get a feeling of how the genre evolved. I'll defer to Wikipedia for the list of composers - their pages on the various eras is good, from what I can tell.

What most people think of ""classical"" music is properly the baroque period. Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi are the best known from this period, but I'd start with Claudio Monteverdi. I'd listen to one of the books of Madrigals, then the vespers of 1610.  

Move on to Henry Purcell. He's a bit of an outlier in the period, being centered in England, but he is known as one of England's finest composers. 

You can dip into a few others if you'd like. If you go into Pachelbel, go to his organ music, which is what he was really known for. (I'm not much for Canon in D, but then again I'm not a large fan of chamber music in general.) 

The next major stop is Vivaldi. I can't help much there, because I'm not a large fan. The 4 seasons is the canonical piece, of course. After that, Telemann was considered Germany's greatest composer of the era. He has 800 credited works, and I'm the wrong one to suggest where to start there. :)

Handel and Johann Sebastian Bach were born in the same year. Handel, Water Music is the non-liturgical piece I'd reccomend. Bach? He had over 1100 works in his lifetime, and was actually thought of as old-fashioned in his own time. The Brandenburg Concertos, some organ works, the Well Tempered Clavier, and some harpsicord works will serve as a basic introduction, though it ignores his liturgical side unfortunately. 

Now, we get to the classical period. Mozart and Beethoven cast a huge shadow, here. However, I'd start off with Franz Joseph Haydn, a central figure in his own right. (Michael Haydn, Joseph's younger brother, was a talented composer in his own right.) He is known as the ""Father of the symphony"", and was an innovator there. Try number 94 (Surprise) and 45 (Farewell). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._45_(Haydn) speaks to a sense of humor about the piece. 

You can find better introductions to Mozart and Beethoven than I can do -- I have never been grabbed by either of them, oddly enough. 

However, late in the period, I suggest Schubert. I suggest Symphony 4 in C minor - the Tragic. Take a dip into his piano works as well, of which he was known in his lifetime.
___

Now, to the romantic period. Sorry, it's getting a bit long here, and by this point you'll probably be developing your own tastes. I'll just mention that Liszt, one of the candidates for the best piano player of all time, is not to be missed. I also enjoy Grieg. _In the Hall of the Mountain King_ is the best known, but there is much more. A bit further away from the epicenter, there was some wonderful music being made by the russians. Rimsky-Korsokov is possibly my favorite of ""the five"" - as the prominent group of them was called at the time. Contrast the five to Tchaikovsky, who was great in his own right but didn't share the nationalist leanings. Taking a tour of the Russian composers is worth it. 

Finally, I suggest some sort of service like rhapsody for this exploration - find out what you like before you start pulling your collection together. Further, you can listen to different interpretations of the same piece, and how much they differ. 

I'll leave the 20th century to you, other than to tell you to listen to Ives's Holiday Symphony a few times to fully appreciate it - it's something that grows on you.","1212345296"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; So, for concatenative version, I think the following makes sense

Your version is absolutely correct if we were just doing a direct translation. The problem is that it doesn't give us a way to access items buried in the stack. This is explained [here](http://tunes.org/~iepos/joy.html#sk).

&gt; ... - 1 2 ==&gt; 1 2 -, not 2 1 -

You actually have this backwards. '- 1 2' would translate to '2 1 -'. In both cases, '1' is therefore the first argument passed to '-'. 

&gt; Hrm.. I 'm not sure how curry would look like in concatenative version. ... (+ 1) 2 ==&gt; 1 [2 +] i ??

For your above example, '(+ 1) 2' would translate to '2 1 +'. You might think this should be '2 [1 +] i' (I'm not sure why you suggested 1 [2 +] i), but that's actually not the case. The reason is that '1 +' itself is already a function. To demonstrate this, we could define 'x' to '1 +' and then do '2 x' and get 3. This is one example of how *function-level* languages like Joy work a bit differently than *functional* languages like ML.

1) If you see the toilet water rising DON""T RUN AWAY! turn off the valve that is usually located behind the toilet as quick as you can.  This will stop the toilet from overflowing with shit.  after awhile you or the janitor can turn it back on and beginning plunging. No, it may not be your job, but do remember that another human being who isn't getting paid enough has to deal with your shit, and they like their shoes, too. Just make the effort.

2) as to why there is a gap underneath the doors, I believe it's for ease of mopping and draining the bathroom. (toilet cleaners UNITE!)

3) I have a vagina, and while I hate it when assholes whine about the plight of single dads on mother's day (it's called father's day, fuck faces!), I do agree that I don't get the whole leave the seat down crap either.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","'Water' cannot be a ""right"", much like education, health-care, food, facilities for the disabled, or any other tangible resource.  Granting governmental access or requiring private investment to these tangible items creates an ""entitlement"" and there is a distinction between the two. 

One previous poster pointed out that most ""rights"" are couched in terms of verbs.  Either to take a specified action or be free of a certain type of action committed by the government.  There is very little cost associated with either providing or preventing the action itself; though with ""rights"" like the U.S.'s right to due process or freedom of speech there is a cost to insure that they are properly enforced.  

The difficulty with ""entitlements"" is that, unlike ""rights,"" when the government creates an ""entitlement"", they've effectively created a societal cost for the provision of that right, and that cost is ultimately borne by the productive members of society.  

This resource redistribution effectively penalizes those who were already productive members of society in favor of unproductive members; which makes very little economic sense under current(^) societal conditions _unless_ you're a politician--because possession of a vote in modern democracies is not dependent on economic status--unlike the old Republics in Greece or the society of the future envisioned by Robert Hienlein.

This investment in the underclass also leads to population growth within that class, because society no longer allows for Hobbes-inian suffering from starvation and the like.  This generates an underclass who's value to society is nothing but a vote at the cost of another belly to be filled.  Look at the history of Rome for one such example of this phenomenon. 

Personally, I believe that the balance between alleviating human suffering &amp; and avoiding the creation of an underclass to make governmental benefits contingent on the agreement to remain childless; on the general theory that if you're generating a societal cost over an extended period, you're probably not a fit parent to begin with.

(^) - The reason that I say under ""current societal conditions"" is that most of the wealthy have to manage the provision of some sort of good or service to maintain their wealth or provide their resources as capital(^^) to those that do so.  In the Feudal or Middle Ages, the only service provided by the ruling class was, effectively, a protection racket.  

(^^) - There are many a amateur economist on Reddit that take issue with our credit based finance system.  I'm also an amateur in the area and believe that the system is flawed as well.  However I believe that it is superior to the alternatives of either a precious metal based or a purely governmentally controlled monetary supply.  The principle behind this is the idea that true amount of value in an economy is not dictated by a supply of a random resource, nor is it something that is foreseeable by government experts.  

The amount of value available for consumption is dictated by the combination of effectively utilized human capital leveraged with intellect and technology.  Credit financing captures this ability to leverage capital inputs with a general optimistic assumption at its base that a person can take a set amount of value and grow it into enough value to have more than he started with, with enough left over to provide his lender with a full return of value plus a reward for the use of the lender's capital, plus enough of a reward (either monetary or psychic) to  justify the borrower's obligation in the first place.","1212346853"

No, you called Gene Rivers a dick.  You seem to be confused about what you are talking about.

You realize that you sound like a moron, don't you.  Dude, ""a foul little ghost of a boy""?  Who talks like that?

&gt; No, my position that gender is an arbitrary distinction when determining if a relationship is ""appropriate"" or not.

No it wasn't.  You said ""gender doesn't make a single bit of difference when it comes to relationships"".

&gt; Quoting somebody isn't proof of a position being right, which you imply.

Oh please.  I imply.  I quoted black people who are offended at the homosexuals pimping the civil rights movement for their own dubious cause.  The point isn't that they are ""right"" (although they are), the point is that it is offensive to blacks.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I am not saying that.   However, if the parents gave the kid access to the gun that killed the people, then yes, they should be accountable for it.

If we hold parents accountable for their kids actions, then parents would take a more active role in their kids lives.  

Lets use an example.  If my son, who is 17, builds a bomb in his bedroom, and kills 30 people.  How should that be handled.  Is it possible for my kid to build a bomb in his room without me knowing.  No.  I activly take part in his life.  Yes, I search his room.  Why, because I am responsible for what type of person he grows up to be.  I am responsible for turning him loose on the world.  Now, if he was able to get the supplies, build said bomb, set off said bomb, and hurt people.  Yes I should be held accountable.  Its borderline negligence for me not to notice these things.  When I was a kid, I could not fart out loud without my parents involved.  And you know what.  I grew up well adjusted with morals.  All because they took an active role.  To many parents want to be the friend instead of the parent.  As a parent, you will be hated, there will be fights, its going to happen.  Its the price of business.

I dont know, call me crazy, but I was rasied and beleive that my children are a reflection of me.  If they do stupid shit, then the world looks at me and thinks I dont know how to raise my kids.  To many parents now dont care.  They lose sight of that fact.  Call it pride as a parent.  Would you be proud of your 13 year old daughter if she did this?  I would not.  I would be proud of my 13 year old if she handled her responsibilities.  I am not saying I want her to go on and be president.  I would like her to conduct herself with dignity, whether she is a waitress, or a senator.  If she does not, then I have failed to teach her those values, and yes, if my daughter did something like this simply because I wasnt paying attention, or taking part in her life, then yes, I would expect me to be held accountable as well.  Now your going to say, different people have different values.  I agree, its up to you to decide what you teach your daughter.  Teach her something though.  Dont just let myspace, the internet, and the TV teach her.  Take a part in her life and teach her.  Doesnt matter what, but teach them something.

Like the old saying.  Kids want attention.  Whether its bad or good, they dont care.  She wants her dads attention and this is how she gets it.  If he spent a day a week with her, just hanging out, chances are things like this would not happen.","1212347540"

One does not change one's mind about whether or not they've read a piece.  They may change the stance on their actions, but changing one's mind is something they do with their opinions not their actions.  Second, I never ""changed my mind on whether I've read it"" - as if you are implying I claimed: A) I didn't read it B) I did C) again, I did not read it.  This would have to be what you are claiming because the other option is: A) I haven't read it B) I've now read it.  And I certainly hope you are not claiming the latter because that will be true with anyone and any text.

As far as the consequences to the people who were filmed: how do you know that the depictions of North Koreans in Vice's video actually led to any punishments? They were filmed doing their jobs, which you claim involve ""only showing them the standard tourist spots."" Why punish them for that? And, even if you are correct, all it shows is that one can't make a decent documentary in North Korea (i.e., one that's not dictated and heavily censored by the DPRK) without dire consequences for any North Koreans that participate. You are delusional if you think North Korea would let its people talk candidly to any documentarian, if only they got the right papers first. The documentary you linked to appears to be interviews with a die-hard Kim regime supporter. I'd bet it's far easier to sit down with a regime supporter and hear about how great North Korea is than to get those brief images Vice acquired of ordinary North Korean villages and traffic in the subway stations.

And, regarding your claim that only normal tourist attractions were shown: I find it hard to believe that a 120,000 man show is a standard event for a single tourist.

Anyway, it's not like Vice could've just wandered away from the tour group and filmed as they pleased. So of course most of their footage is of things the DPRK chose to show them. The film doesn't claim otherwise, and I defy you to show me a documentary about North Korea that manages to film whatever it wants, on its own schedule, and without management by the Kim regime.

Look I don’t know what exactly happened in Chile, but I suspect there was violence going both ways and Pinochet went overboard to try to stop it. But you’re really missing the point. The point isn’t that Pinochet is a bad guy, the point is that we chose the lesser of 2 evils. Through Pinochet we had enough influence and leverage that we turned that place into a prosperous democracy. That would have never happened under communists. What makes you think communists wouldn’t have rounded up 50,000 Chileans and tortured them?


“What good is your vote for a better government when a once modern Iraq now has sewage openly running in the streets, kids dying from water borne disease and medical treatment being too expensive for many Iraqis to afford?”

Iraq by no means was modern before the invasion. I don’t know where people get this crazy notion that everything was great before we came there. Before the invasion the only place that had electricity was Baghdad. Do you call that modern!? When the US came in we spread the electricity around the country, which meant people would get only a few hours of it a day. SO in the end the people that never had it before didn’t really care, and the people in Baghdad were pissed; which is actually the root cause of why a lot of the violence started.


“Finally, ""mismanaging the war"" is not the main charge in the eyes of the word: illegally causing the deaths of a million Iraqis is.”

Oh, so now there is some kind of legal way of killing people? This is a news flash to me. Since when is killing people okay? Look, the people in charge just need to be fired and replaced by more competent people (which I think had been done since Condi came in, and the violence has steadily decreased). I don’t understand why everyone has this need to convict people of war crimes. Is it some kind of revenge thing? You need a little show trial like Nuremburg to satisfy your anger? What is that going to change?

Schumpeter's reasoning was that an overt defense of capitalism would prompt the book only to be read by those who already supported capitalism. Therefore, he believed that he must masquerade as a supporter of socialism to entice the young socialist to read his work. In the end, he hoped to awaken self-recognition in the reader to the flaws of socialism"" that's Jerry Muller, author of ""The Mind and the Market"", 2003.

If you doubt me about why socialism fails, then read F.A. Hayek.  He is a Nobel Prize winning economist, one of the best of the 20th century.  He proved by logic alone why socialism fails.

And be advised that economics is NOT an empirical science.  It is a philosophy.  What you are trying to do is treat economics like you treat the natural sciences.  You think that by looking hard enough at the data, you will be able to prove anything you want.  The fallacy with this line of thinking is that humans do not operate according to mathematical laws like the natural world does, hence knowing the full set of information by using empirical observations is impossible.  If you try to look at, say, the unemployment rate, and you tally by taking a census and statistics, you will only be making a bad guess at the true rate, because whenever you observe data, by the time you make a (bad) conclusion based on that data, the real world has changed and people's tastes have changed.

The problem with people like you is that you consider those people who argue by logic and reason to be the ones living a fantasy world, when in reality, it is people like you who look at government statistics, and think that they know what's really going on.  THAT is living in a fantasy world.

You are nothing but a shell of a person who cannot argue by logic and reason, which is the only thing that distinguishes us from animals, and so you talk down to anyone who argues by logic and reason.  It is people like you who think that logical reasoning in economics is impossible, when the fact is that using the methods of the natural sciences is impossible.

There is a reason why there have been terrible economic periods in our lifetimes and previous lifetimes, even since supposedly intelligent empiricists have developed economic models that  supposedly can ""manage"" the economy.  The fact is that economic models make the crucial mistake of assuming that equilibriums exist in the economy.  Look at any economic model and you will see an equals sign, which means stationarity.  Real life is NOT stationary.  It is forever in flux, and TENDS towards equilibrium.

Your fundamental problem is that you do not trust your own mind's ability to reason, thus you automatically assume that economic reasoning is impossible without connecting one's argument to an empirical study of some sort.  That's why you are questioning me instead of arguing for yourself.  In all your crap, you have not once said ANYTHING of substance.  All you have done is been an irrational skeptic, and assume that this makes you intelligent.

Attempting to point out another's error's without actually making any statement in return is why you will never understand economics.

Economics is, and has always been, a philosophy, not a science.  Unless and until humans operate according to definite mathematical models, it stands to reason that I am right and you are wrong.

People who think like you are the very people who have cause this country's economy to go to shit.  People who think like me are the only ones who have been right all along.  You can be stubborn and think you must be right, but I will tell you that if you put into practice what you are thinking, then the results will be DISASTROUS, as we are seeing today.","1212348252"

It's not like anyone is forcing you to read his blog. Downmode if you like, but calling his blog ""an elaborate scheme for linkjacking"" doesn't reflect the truth.

3) Arrests people in ontario for possession of a drug which is not even currently a crime, and in general across north america, a botched paralmilitary [war on drugs](http://www.cato.org/raidmap).

4) Recent american examples include the immigration protests a year back, where police violently charged on a *huge* crowd, and the RNC2004, where whole blocks of people who weren't even involved in protests were roped in and arrested, and confined in a warehouse filled with chemicals, and then sent throughout the NY 'tombs' in an what became an utter mess

أشهد أن لا إله إلاَّ الله و أشهد أن محمد رسول الله

The stepup is also good if you don't have much leg strength to begin with. Just do that and some thigh thrusts and work yourself up to running or other exercises mentioned.

  At 13 yo a lot of girls are only starting to look feminine.  There are some notable exceptions, but most girls breasts and hips usually haven't reached their adult size yet.  Furthermore, 13 yo girls are still a few inches shorter than their adult height.

A conversation with a 13 yo isn't always as revealing as one would think.  I knew girls when I was in middle school who could hold their own in an adult conversation and I have known adults who don't know stuff that is commonly taught in middle school.  I was always taught that when writing for a general audience to try to write at about a 9th grade level because most adults never master the HS curriculum assuming they ever finished HS.  There aren't a lot of questions that most adults could easily answer that you couldn't find a lot of above average middle school students answering as well.

  Sadly, 13 yo girls trying to hit on much older guys isn't as odd as people think.  Apparently their parents and other adults haven't taught them that having a sexual relationship with an adult man is not only inappropriate, but it could send him to jail.","1212349212"

"technology","t5_2qh16","Vista's crappy indexing is the main reason I tell my clients to stick with XP.  

Actually, what I *tell them* it's that they'll have a hard time figuring where everything went, and that they'll need twice as much RAM and a newer processor just to display transparent windows.  But the *real reason* is that I don't want to spend my days fixing *yet another* horked Outlook inbox that can't be properly repaired because of the asinine search indexing system.  Or yet another horked search index that needs to be rebuilt because it got munged by a corrupted Outlook inbox.

Basically, you have to take Outlook offline, stop the indexing function, run ScanPST to repair the Outlook file store, rebuild and/or restore the search index, reboot the computer, restart the indexing and then **turn off the sleep mode and wait for several hours** for the index to be rebuilt.  After that, you can put Outlook back online and start taking in new emails.

And do it all over again the next time something gets corrupted.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","If you have to ask if something ""should be a human right,"" then it's not a human right. When the founders enumerated the ""intrinsic rights"" of man, such as the right to speech, to free association, to the pursuit of happiness, etc, they enumerated not to grant them, for man inherently possesses these rights, but to instruct the people, and the government, to respect and do their best not to interfere with these rights. That is, no one can stop you from speaking freely, but they can sanction/imprision/kill you for doing so. This is what the founders urged us to avoid, intervening only when the exercise of one person's rights impinged on someone else's rights.

What the author is talking about are not rights, but entitlements. And questions of entitlements should never be asked in that form (""should XYZ be a right?""), because, as the cost society bears to provide that entitlement rises, eventually, at some point, society will say ""no"" 
(or go bankrupt trying to provide it). 

So really it's never appropriate to say ""should XYZ be a right [entitlement]."" The only thing that's fair to do is ask society if it is willing to provide that entitlement at a given cost.

And at all times, remember that organized society is a diversion from man's normal mode of operation. The benefit of participating in a society must always outweigh the cost (at least, for the majority), otherwise man will defect.","1212349397"

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;You'd think that if Obama had anything in his past that he knew about then he would have been smart enough to have outed it himself long ago in order to mitigate this possibility.

Well, few politicians are bright enough to do that.  They're always convinced they've hidden the skeleton so far back in the closet no one will ever find it.

But seriously, at this point, the amount of effort being put into discrediting everyone BUT Obama has pretty much convinced me he doesn't have any actual skeletons, as amazed as I am to be saying that.  The right-wing mouthbreathers have all but managed to prove the negative.  I actually feel *better* about supporting him today, in the wake of all their ridiculous nonsense attacks, then I did when I reluctantly switched over to him after Edwards dropped.

&gt;The problem is that FUD can be just as devastating as a real scandal.. and it's already working - just look at how many people think Obama is a ""secret Muslim"". And I think the polling on this will just get worse over time,

At this point, I'm pretty philosophic about it.  If McCain manages to win based, effectively, on nothing but lies and fear of the scary brown man, then I'll know the republic *is* dead and can start planning accordingly.

(This is not to say, incidentally, that there is no way Obama could lose except through racism, pandering, or fear, but that certainly seems to be the strategy so far.  I've certainly yet to see a hint of intelligence or rational debate from his opposition.)","1212349656"

  I was tutoring a kid for the SAT II math level 2 exam and there was a exponent problem that used simple interest.  The student had no concept about interest on credit cards at all.  A girl in her early 20s though probably has a few credit cards herself and probably has at least a rudimentary idea about how interest rates are calculated.  Since generally speaking 13 yo don't carry credit cards I would be surprised if a 13yo has any concept of simple interest nevermind compounding interest.

  Very few have more than a rudimentary concept about how the government works.  In CA, US History is covered 3 times(5th grade, 8th grade, and 11th grade), but I seriously doubt that most kids learn much about US History until HS.

On the flip side, I have met quite a few adults who seem more ignorant than quite a few HS kids.  I've met adults who seriously believe that older cars are safer and that seat belts have no safety benefit.

These girls may think their rape accusations won't cause the guy too much trouble, especially if the girl says she didn't know the guy.

I'm not justifying girls accusing men of rape, just saying that it's not necessarily done with the intent to hurt the guy.

"self","t5_2qh96","Wait until you've lost the weight and feel better about yourself before going after girls. It's hard to accept for many, but insecurity is a turnoff to a lot of girls. (Being a girl myself, I know this quite well.)

The most important thing right now is for you to gain stability and secureness in your opinion of yourself. Like other people have said, what other people WANT from you or expect from you DOES NOT MATTER. Don't try to prove yourself to other people. Prove yourself to YOU. Do what YOU want to do. And I guarantee you, exercise is the 1st and hugest step. Not only will it help you lose weight, but it will help you feel better mentally, help you sleep, help you eat better, and help your confidence. And who knows, maybe after you lose the weight, it'll make your dick look bigger.

Then take a look at what you're doing in college. Are you not interested in the courses you're taking? What ARE you interested in? Is there something you've always wanted to do, but you're stuck in this stupid course? DROP OUT AND DO WHAT YOU WANT. You're an adult now, you can make your own decisions. Don't do what your family wants you to do if you hate it.

One more thing, balding. Seriously. If it's that bad, shave your head. Bic it. Bald heads are awesome, comb-overs are not. If it's only a little bit of balding but you still have enough hair? Don't grow your hair long, leave it short and it shouldn't matter. 

EDIT: I just thought of another thing. Do you consider yourself to be a total nerd or geek? If so, hang out with other nerds/geeks. Do nerdy/geeky activities. It's not a bad thing. You'll be happier to find people who are interested in the things you're interested in.

First, i do not know any language that has builtin function for network. Python, C#, Java do use extension like libs modules etc.

Just like in C++ you can use sockets that are posix compliant if i'm not wrong. In other word, you could write an application using these sockets but in windows it is winsock that is used. Trolltech can act as the module that does the networking always the same whatever Os you run on. So yes there is networking in C/C++ but it isn't really standart. 

A language shouldn't create libs...libs are made for the language. So there is no reason to add network in the c++ language. There could be a network libs inside the std but it doesn't cause real problem.

as for my comment talking about vb..where the hell did i said this was made in vb. vb guy rarely like c++ and the syntax of the language do look a like vb from what i saw...and someone that is bashing c++ by saying its overly complicated  etc is just probably stupid or a vb programmer....","1212350354"

My point was, they've dedicated decades on building contacts and a relationship of trust to key individuals to be able to make documentaries in the DPRK and I truly respect their effort. My second point was that everyone time someone like VICE comes along and does an unauthorised story on nothing, it screws up theirs (and others) possibilities to do more in-depth work.

For your information I worked as a photojournalist and was in Pyongyang when they blew the bomb in 2006. I know that what VBS films is the standard tourist stuff because I've done that tour myself and know what is. Trust me when I say that they would have no difficulty getting proper permits to shoot what they did. Which brings me back to my main point. The VBS crew is selfish and lazy, have weak principles regarding journalistic ethics and authenticity and put other people at unnecessary risks because of it. I really can't express my opinion any clearer than that. ","1212351102"

This thread was about the current slight controversy over whether or not water should be considered a human right. You've taken it a step further and now contend that FOOD should not even be a human right.

I think you've failed to understand the crux of this discussion, no-one's talking about being required to feed, water or clothe someone without the inclination to provide for themselves, assuming they have the means. 

We're talking about human rights, as in, let's say you have an enemy combatant in prison, if you deprive this person of water, should you be considered to have violated their human rights? Certainly that's the case if you deprive them of food, why shouldn't the same be true of water?

For one thing: the fact that they were distributing Christian pamphlets in a Muslim area means they were trying to get Muslims to convert to Christianity. They may or may not have known that Islam does not allow apostasy. From the Muslim point of view, they weren't proselytizing, they were tempting good Muslims to sin.

Neat idea.  Some details to be worked out, though.  You'd have to define a subtype relation, so if `D` derives from `B`, then `Tuple&lt;C, D&gt;` derives from `Tuple&lt;C,B&gt;`.  Otherwise if you had `(c,d)` and the method `f` is defined in `Tuple&lt;C,B&gt;` you couldn't call `(c,d).f()` since `Tuple&lt;C,D&gt;` wouldn't have it.  Where `C c;` and `D d;` of course.

One problem I see is that it 'artificially' separates various arguments to a method.  By that I mean, from a client's perspective `f(...)` is just an interface.  Why does the client care if some parameters `a,b,c,d` are in this position `(a,b).f(c,d)` vs in this one?  `f(a,b,c,d)`?  It seems to be exposing implementation details, in that the client now needs to know how `f` computes its value (it dispatches on some arguments but not others -- client doesn't care about this).  The Standard Model of `a.b(c,d)` has this disadvantage too, but true multimethods don't.","1212351698"

"business","t5_2qgzg","a) NO!  Inflation is not rising prices.  Inflation is an increase in the supply of money and credit beyond the rate of precious metals.  Stop making the mistake of assuming inflation is rising prices.  Here you fucking tool, I will help you:

in·fla·tion     
1.	Economics. a persistent, substantial rise in the general level of prices related to an increase in the volume of money and resulting in the loss of value of currency (opposed to deflation).

Inflation is NOT merely a rise in prices.  For if that were true, how in the world could prices rise every year for generations?  You say it's just rising prices, but have you ever even thought about what causes rising prices?  Of course not, because you are a hack.

c) The US government prevented oil prices from rising further by putting price controls on oil.  This prevented further exploration of oil in the US which restricted the increase in oil supply.  This restriction in the increase in supply, and massive inflation by the Fed in the 1970's is what caused the price of oil to tend higher.  Stop trying to redefine history.

""Monetarism is one school of economics, other theories are available and may even be based on evidence. Calling it ""proper economics"" is cute.""

I am not deriving my arguments from the Monetarists.  Monetarists believe money should be controlled by the state, not the market.  If you say there are ""many other theories"", well, what are they?  I can demolish all of them, as I have your other arguments.

""Sometimes, frequently, inflation can be caused by an increase in the supply of money but there are times (such as in the UK in the early 1980s) when money supply increases but prices do not rise. In the US in the 1990s inflation because famously unhinged from the money supply.""

If the money supply increases, but there is not a corresponding increase in prices, then it's still inflation!  In the 1990's, the money supply and prices became ""famously unhinged"" (I think the term you are looking for is ""de-coupled"") because all the inflation was exported to foreign business firms and central banks.  These firms banks in turn took those dollars and invested them in the US stock market (that's why there was a stock market bubble to end the 1990's).  Just because prices did not rise as fast as the money supply, it doesn't mean inflation did not occur.  See, you cannot get out of your head that inflation is rising prices only.  It is not.  Rising prices is merely one symptom of inflation.  Other symptoms are stock market bubbles, real estate bubbles, commodities bubbles, loss of purchasing power, wealth transfer from debtors to creditors, capital destruction, scope and extent of government power, loss of confidence in economy, manic depressive investor behavior, and a host of other detrimental effects.  The reason why these detrimental effects occur is because too many people like you think that inflation is merely rising prices only.  If everyone knew the truth, we could stop them from occurring forever.

""Of course the value of gold can increase! If lots of people start demanding gold and there is a fixed supply, the value of gold increases.  That's the most basic principle of economics which you've yet to grasp.""

Yes it can increase...in paper dollars!  If more dollars chase a fixed supply of gold, then the sellers of gold would be able to fetch more paper dollars for their gold.  But the value of gold itself is only a function of how much gold there is, just like all other goods and/or commodities.  See, the fact that you just can't seem to get into your head is that gold is money, and any change in the paper price of gold is mostly a function of how many paper dollars are in existence (people's inflation expectations).  The other, less important reason, is how much the gold supply changes (increases 1 to 2% per year).  

By the way, paper money does not determine the value of goods in the aggregate, as people think GDP measures, it only determines the value of goods relative to each other.  In totality, paper money cannot tell you anything about the whole economy.  GDP just gives a measure for how much money there is in existence.

""Furthermore your misconception that inflation is not revealed by the sustained increase in prices in a basket of goods (i.e. the actual definition)""

No that's the FED'S and the GOVERNMENT'S definition.  I don't care what their definition is, I only care about what the true definition is (see the definition I provided you for the actual definition of inflation).

""This ignores the fact that over the past 100 years the population of the earth has increased and the world economy has grown dramatically in real terms. We are richer and there are more of us.""

Irrelevant to this conversation.

""In the long run demand for gold increases as the world economy grows, just as demand for oil increases.""

No, the total MONEY demand for the totality of all gold is a function of how much money there is.  Same thing for oil.  Oil has no more real MONEY demand today than it has had in over 50 years.  Real money is gold, and the price of oil has been FLAT in real money.  The reason why the money price of oil is increasing is because of two factors.  One, there is more dollars in existence.  Two, the governments of the world purposefully restrict the supply of oil from increasing by regulating the shit out of it.

""Supply cannot match the increase in demand""

This statement makes NO SENSE.  Demand and supply are two DIFFERENT units of measure.  One measures how many paper dollars are being used (demand), the other measures how much physical supply there is (supply).  It is meaningless to say that demand and supply are ""matching"" or ""not matching"".  Markets clear alright!

""The fact is that your entire argument is akin to a man stopped for speeding who says ""Officer I wasn't doing 130. My car was stationary, it was the rest of the world that rushed behind me. NOW PROVE ME WRONG!""""

No, that's what YOU are trying to do with me here.  You have not said anything other than what I could learn for $2.50 in late charges at the public library economics section, and an OLD library at that!

""Absolutely stock market speculation can cause increases in commodity prices, as it clearly has done with oil, and oil has risen when compared to other commodities. Quad erat demonstrandum. You're contradicting yourself and not even noticing it!""

Do you have any idea how oil and commodities speculation even works?  I don't think you do.  Oil and commodities speculation is merely a gamble of the future SPOT PRICES of commodities.  Speculation cannot today nor ever determine what the actual trading price of oil is in the market.  See, oil speculators for example make an educated guess at what the future SPOT price of oil will be, say, 6 months from now.  They'll buy futures for example.  Over time, the price of oil will change on a daily basis based on how much oil USERS are paying for oil for USE in their business.  This means that if the price of oil is $125 a barrel, it means PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY PAYING $125 A BARREL OF OIL TO USE IT.  If the oil speculators thought that the spot price of oil would be $130 a barrel, and the speculators shorted a futures contract, then THEY LOSE MONEY.  On the long side, THEY GAIN.  In both cases, the speculators themselves are POWERLESS to change the actual spot price of oil.

See, what you and almost the whole mainstream media thinks (incorrectly), is that oil futures prices are actual oil spot prices.  They are not.  However, oil speculators are usually the best in the world at GUESSING what the future oil price will be, so everyone just assumes that what the speculators do is what actually CAUSES the oil price to change.  They do not.  Correlation does NOT mean causation, but then again, logic was never your strong point now was it?

""Of course the graph misrepresents data.""

Of course it doesn't.  Merely SAYING it does will not make it so.

""Dogmatic Monetarism""

WOW.  This is FIRST thing you've said said that I actually agree with.  Monetarists ARE dogmatic.  But I'm no monetarist.  The only thing that monetarists and I share is our definition of inflation.  But we are drastically different in what to do to end it forever.

""The fact is the price of oil, relative to other prices in the economy, has risen.""

Yes it has, you're right.  I have never disputed this.  Where we differ is our ideas concerning what causes the price of oil and all other commodities to rise.  You think it's speculators, but I know better.

If you think it's speculators, then have you ever stopped to think why speculators would do this?  Why would they pay such a high price for oil futures, if they did not EXPECT the price of oil to rise?  Have you ever even stopped to consider WHY these people are called SPECULATORS and not USERS of oil?

Does all this make sense?  I hope so, because you are setting yourself up for a rude awakening one of these days.  

Now stop deluding yourself and educate yourself and stop relying on the MSM, i.e. Pravda, for ""knowledge"".

What the above commenter was asking for was a guarantee of fidelity, which most grownups know doesn't exist.  Unless you sew up your partner or put a chastity belt on them, guarantees of fidelity do not exist.

2. The persistent and annoying claim that our taxes mostly go to poor people. Here's a clue: If that were true, THEY WOULDN'T BE FUCKING POOR. Rich people get Social Security benefits as well as poor people -- and they get more, because they paid in more. Fair enough. Medicare also has no income cap.

Medicaid, the largest federal means-tested program, accounts for a whopping 6% of the federal budget. All remaining entitlement programs combined account for another 11%. (And that's including some, like the earned income tax credit, that few people would fuss about.) 

11% is interesting, because that's the exact same percentage that the government uses to pay for itself. Yet I seldom hear bitching about our tax dollars going to pay George W Bush or Nancy Pelosi -- despite the fact that they're the ones levying and spending the taxes in the first place.

And please let me be clear about this: I am not saying taxes shouldn't be lowered. That'd be great. I'm just sick of this myth that the government is taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor in huge amounts. 

I'm thinking that if Jesus comes back anytime soon, 17% for the poor might seem just a little embarrassing.  ","1212352490"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Rights, assuming a government enforcing body, can be divided into two categories: what no one can deny you, and what the government can deny you.  The first group is natural rights, the second civil rights.

Thus, no person may deprive you of your life and property. That's a natural right. If someone illegitimately seeks to deprive you of your property, you may complain, and the violated could be prosecuted. That's a natural right.

The right to a speedy trial, free speech, or to be protected from unwarranted searches and seizures are all civil rights -- they're about what the government can't do. In effect, they're operational guidelines, similar to how a company may have internal rules regarding conflict resolution.

Note that all rights are reactive -- they are about what someone _can't_ do to someone else. 

A natural right to water -- ""no individual may deprive another of water"" -- would be incompatible with the right to property. If I own a bucket of water, and you're dying of thirst, would I be obligated to relinquish the bucket? If so, that violated my right to property.

Countries that adopt socialism do not have a proper functioning price system, that's why they have failed.  This is so amazingly obvious, it is hard for me to think that you are being serious.

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt;True, but it doesn't support the publisher/agent/record-house at all. 

It *is* the publisher/agent/record house. It doesn't need to support them. If the band needs services above and beyond free distribution and meritocratic promotion, they can pay for them just like any other business. 

&gt;Without the backing of a record company they wouldn't be able to afford liability insurance...

And why would the record company pay for this? Because they can make that money back in profit. So can the band.

&gt;This is one of the places where my model shines. Because each user of my model is paying an on-going subscription fee, OVER TIME a tiny number of fans can still accumulate a significant patronage for an unpopular band. Nobody is held hostage to the tastes of the mob.

First, in this case 'the tastes of the mob' refer 'the tastes of the fan base', which, honestly, they're going to to be held to either way. Second, I believe our models are functionally almost equivalent. Consider three cases of users: The first listens to the music and hates it. No donations accrue under either model. The second user listens to the music and likes it, but not enough to support the band. He goes and donates to someone else. No donations accrue in either model. In the third case the user likes the music enough to care if more is produced. He donates under both models. He also donates potentially more under my model, as where I can only spare a small amount of money every month, there are quite a few wealthy individuals who would be willing to potentially donate quite a lot more, who wouldn't under your system (I've already paid for the service, why should I pay more?) 

&gt; The logical extension of this model is to have a minimum subscription fee that covers the infrastructure over head only, and then let users add to their subscription am optional patronage fee that could be anywhere from $0 to whatever they can afford.

The thing about this is that set up properly, the infrastructure overhead costs are zero (if fully distributed), and if curated then still zero with curation costs taken care of by running it as a legitimate, separate business., and then you have reduced your model to mine. Bear in mind, probably the best way to run a curated site would be to have users submit content, and then have someone come by and check it when the fanbase marked the page as complete. The page would then be updated whenever the artist releases new material (probably upon user signal, many eyes &amp;c). That would be reasonably cheap to run, and those costs could be taken care of by businesses wanting for-profit access to the database. Casual users still get it free, of course. :)

&gt;Some people will always end up supporting the one hit wonders and such long after the rest of us wish they were gone... There is no accounting for taste.

Well yes, but their continued support will rely on them still producing music, which was sort of the point. It irks me that these people can live leeching off of royalties for the duration of their natural lives without producing anything more, its the worst kind of societal welfare, one that explicitly allows (if not encourages) not working, as opposed to ameliorating the problems of the present to allow you to get back on your feet.

&gt;Not for free; at the cost of donated resources. There is a difference. People may be less generous in the future.

Generosity never enters the picture, the entire excersise is profitable for the user. The hard drive space donated allows the user to store their music, and the bandwidth donated allows the user to download more music. There is no incentive whatsoever to cut back on any donated resources at all.

&gt; Neither does mine... you pay for a subscription only as long as it has value to you.

The subscription *does* have zero marginal cost. Marginal cost is a concept distinct from the concept of value, marginal cost refers *only* to the resources required to produce something. The marginal cost of a pet rock at the height of its popularity, for instance, was still only a few cents at most. Market value - Marginal cost = Profit (roughly). I wish more people understood this, marginal cost is an incredibly useful concept.

&gt;As long as there is money to be made by ANY mechanism, including your donations, there will always be marketing. 

I was thinking of the sort of centralized marketing campaigns the RIAA conducts to distort the market, but you're right of course, there will always be self promotion. And I'm OK with that. (Reddit wants me to be 'more succinct', but I have more to say, so I'm splitting the post.)","1212352741"

&gt;Allow me to restate: your system does not benefit from the reliable work of full-time professionals, but instead relies upon anonymous volunteers who are inevitably untrained (...) untrustworthy or misinformed.

Correction: My system is set up to not *require* the work of full time professionals, but is perfectly capable of plugging into it if it is available. 

&gt; Could a Wikipedia sized organization coordinate a band's world tour?

Are you serious? I was comparing Wikipedia to a vast curated archive (And let me make this clear, I did some calculations and this archive would be at least ~50 times larger than wikipeida [250 bytes per entry * 400 million songs = 93.1 gigabytes (the text dump of wikipedia is only 2, and the eMule network is estimated to hold over a billion files), and that is *just the songs*, no relational data *whatsoever*], explicitly curating this archive would be an almost unfeasably large task. ) Coordinating a world tour is a *service* the *band* would pay for so they can *make more money*. 

&gt; In a way, there is a partial non-coercive implication in my system: You'll note that the small non-profit pirate that I pondered in my original post is no threat to my system by virtue of the limitations of being small... it therefore is not worth the time or expense to prosecute such a pirate. 

First, your system is still coercive by virtue of anyone not using it still being prosecutable. Second, you tend to assume that this pirate is small by virture of being nonprofit, and yet you seem to misunderstand that modern piracy works via a vast system of voluntary cooperation, all of us are nonprofit. The system I describe represents the limit of what a nonprofit pirate can do, and I happens to be something I kind of intend to do if steps aren't made in that direction reasonably soon (The fact that the RIAA allowed imeem to carry any music for free without fear of prosecution and the recent moves towards DRM free music have been the main things forestalling it). And the 'therefore it is not worth the time and expence to hunt them down' is the argument people made before RIAA decided it wanted to lose millions of dollars every year on spite, pardon me if I'm not convinced. 

&gt;It is simply easier, more friendly, more useful, and faster to look up a band on a web site and see a well organized, well presented, comprehensive list of songs and albums with links to each, than it it is to enter that band's name into a P2P search tool and see an unorganized list of songs that is almost certainly not comprehensive, containing many duplicates, and largely without descriptions or explanations beyond file type.

Well organized and well presented can very easily be done in the client, plus if the client is open source someone *will* make a Firefox plugin for it. As for the comprehensive listing, well, to do it centrally: Assume employees are getting paid ~25$ an hour. This is necessary to ensure expertice, and a good standard of living. Assume there are 1 million artists on this network, I would personally guess there would be more, many many more, but just assume 1 million for now. Assigning each employee to write and maintain biographies for 100 artists each (so ~3 per 8 hour day, necc. to ensure quality), I would need 10000 employees, and their monthly salary comes to (5/7) * 31 * 8 * 25$ * 10000 = 44.2 million dollars a month. Add into that the cost of rent, training employees, etc. It would probably come out to ~60 million dollars a month. The emule network is estimated to hold between 2 and 3 million users, which means that the minimum cost per user to run this sucker in a completely centalised fashion and make a reasonable profit would be around 25-30$ a month, or 300$ a year. At those rates, none of your artists are going to get paid a dime. No one will want to donate on top of that, it would be adding insult to injury. If you want to scale it back a bit then, and cut out all the metadata, you could use existing databases, and cut it to around 10-15$ a month, or 120$ a year. Still probably almost no-one will donate, and certainly not enough for artists to make a proper living, your service will be crap, and it will only carry popular artists because thats what the current databases have. You will have defeated the point of doing it in the first place. You could make it a little better by taking a cut from merchindise revinues or any other of numerous points of contact with the artists, but then you are making your profit off the artists and they would be better off with straight up piracy! And the users would be too, a shiny UI and a sort button are not nearly worth 120$ a year. 

Also, I would like to point out that what you are advocating throughout your post, likely without realizing, *is* piracy. You get music from the artists for free. The only thing you're paying for is a company to keep a listing of the songs for you, which is completely separate endeavor. The fact that they are using centralized hosting rather than distributed hosting doesn't make a bit of difference for the user, it just means that they have to pay the company for something that can be done for free. The only way the artists get paid is through donations, which have some vauge noton of paying for what you just downloaded attached. In my system, you are paying for the artist's creation of music, they get paid when they make music, and that is *as it should be*. 

&gt;To ensure that the metadata is always available, and thus that the search tools work for all hosted content, all description files would have to be hosted on the same server as the associated content file.

There is a centralized wiki-like structure that contains an authoritative description of the band, etc. The actual links between songs (all belonging to the same album, who wrote the song, etc.) are generated by hashing the song's beat\melody and comparing it against the same database; However, the database is mirrored on the network to reduce the search load on the central server. This way, there is a central location for editing the wiki, but the network retains functionality whether it is online or not. And of course, you can add algorithms for controlling user involvement (voting, certifying experts, etc.) to improve the quality of the database if you wish. :) So the way search would work is that say I upload a song with no metadata. The client examines the song and determines its identifier would be 4xxxhashgibberish203. It performes a distributed search for the 4xxxhashgibberish range, and a set of computers assigned to store those songs respond with what they believe the song to be. The way the storage set is chosen can be selected to make it very difficult for an attacker to propagate incorrect data, plus, the system can be set to look for incorrect data upon mirroring the wiki, if it refuses to change the node can be removed. Anyway, some computers respond with 4xxxhashgibberish203 Artist: Blue Man Group&amp;Song: Drumbone&amp;Weirdmetafromwiki: This is field enough users saw fit to include\! The client then attaches that meta data to the file and marks it as available. When someone else comes along and says 'Where is Song: Drumbone'? the network searches for clients with a record containing Song: Drumbone and returns the list of hashes that match it, any associated metadata (which we have ensured is correct during the upload and updater stages), and the client it was found on. The user then selects the version they want and download can begin. Now, say the user wants information about an artist, or anything else that doesn't have a file attached. Then they can say Artist: Blue Man Group and the network would return any metadata on the band itself (Which would look like Artist: Blue Man Group&amp;Article: They're Blue/! or something like that) and display that, as well as a list of songs and albums. All further groupings and sortings can be done reasonably easily on the client itself. Does that answer your question? It could be done fairly easily, and there are likely some obvious improvements I've missed. Please respond, I am immensely enjoying this discussion. :)","1212352762"

If welfare allows a poor family to get their kids a good education, and those kids become productive tax-paying citizens, then it IS a win, and I'd support it.

"programming","t5_2fwo","As a CS graduate, I would argue that very little of the Computer Science field is about this.  Computer Science really begins at a fully functioning hardware device providing primitive operations.  While I agree it is extremely important from a *practical* point of view to understand the low-level architecture, the importance of this understanding is mostly about *efficiency*.  From an *academic* point of view, CS concepts build on top of ""some machine"" where that machine's particular implementation is not relevant.

I believe that such courses should of course be offered, and should count towards a CS degree, but I would argue they should be considered *Electrical Engineering*.

A person can be an excellent academician and develop many useful algorithms and theories without knowing exactly how the abstract machine his work is built upon is actually implemented in practice.  A software engineer can be excellent at his work and understand *what the machine (CPU) provides*, know the full instruction set and their operational properties, without knowing *how it's actually implemented*.

Hardly anyone outside Electrical Engineering actually understands how processors work these days.  They have literally *billions* of transistors.  We who are focused on CS can only hope to learn the fundamental principles (gates), and the high-level concepts (pipelining), unless we decide to become entirely focused on low-level hardware.  CS is a field that is growing in every direction.  A person cannot stay on top of all of it.

There is so much to learn.  I would argue a student could just as validly spend their time instead on:

* Numeric precision and how to implement numeric algorithms in hardware without loss of precision
* Programming languages and type systems
* Cryptography
* Compression
* Optimization systems and machine learning
* AI (which is of a different focus than the above)
* Distributed systems

You could get a PhD and make waves in any of these fields without knowing how machine primitives are implemented in transistors :)

I would argue that low-level systems need most to be understood by people studying *Software Engineering* which is a very related, but distinct, field from CS.  A nice way of describing it might be that CS focuses on the asymptotic properties of algorithms and data structures while SE focuses on minimizing the constant.","1212353856"

Most people believe that the presence of digital satellite TV service, as the only competition to cable TV, has an overall positive impact in the marketplace.

You're not actually stealing from that service provider, because they don't have to opportunity to sell you that signal in the first place, but nonetheless the practice poisons the marketplace and prevents legitimate companies from doing legitimate business, which is something that most people frown upon.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","The Bible forms the basis for two of the world's most popular religions, Judaism and Christianity. I normally don't recommend reading a book just based on popularity, but in this case the work has been so influential that it's worth having a copy handy.

The main text is a compilation of stories that are mostly borrowed from Sumerian and Greek myths that were prevalent several thousand years ago. These were assembled in a rather haphazard fashion to conform to various political and sociological agendas as they changed over the years. The result is a challenging read, in parts contradictory and often repetitive. In several places it's just plain impossible to figure out what's going on, but that's to be expected from a work that has been so thoroughly edited, censored, translated, and rearranged.

Nonetheless, it's worth reading, simply because it has had such an enormous influence on so many human endeavors, from literature to art to law. As such, it provides a helpful context for a broader secular education in almost any field (except science, math, or refrigerator repair/maintenance). Furthermore, many of the stories are very engaging, even though they are written in a somewhat opaque, old-timey style. Most people know the creation and flood myths, but some of the lesser known stories are really gripping too, as long as one doesn't mind a lot of violence.

If I were to ignore everything in the past she has done this would still be bad, in my opinion this is actually in fact one of the worst things she possibly could have done after agreeing not to seat those states.

What was the worst thing? Having a fund raiser when the agreement explicitly said they could have fund raisers? Yet somehow no one finds it at all significant that Obama had TV spots running. Somehow one day of fund raising, though legitimate, was horrible, but a series of TV ads is just fine.

&gt;Your point would be a lot more poignant if it wasn't for the glaring hypocrisy of your ""classic pro-Hilary"" stance. 

Actually I am a ""generic Democrat"" supporter, both Obama and Clinton were on the bottom of my list at the beginning since they are such moderates and both have given me reasons to vote against them during the campaign.

With restaurants, food quality aside, time is money. If you sit down with the customer to talk about the food, educate them, explain it, etc, that spent time adds up at the end of the day. Which in turn means you have fewer table resets reducing the number of paying customers.

Having a sommelier on staff works for a restaurant because he/she sells the wine suggestion to the table as a whole. He or she normally does not suggest/sell each person at the table a certain wine to go with their meal. That makes it more cost effective for the restaurant to have them on staff. It also allows them to upsell as well, but thats another topic. 

Having a couple of food coaches on hand that might spend 5-10 minutes with each customer would just be too time consuming. An average restaurant serving 150+ people a night would never finish dinner service on time. 

That said, having a food coach/guide available for those who want to pay a premium for the service might be more ""doable"" for the restaurant since the fee would lock out the majority of diners who simply don't want to pay $25 to $50 on the luxury. 

Perhaps restaurants should just do a better job training their servers. Although, that would cost more money out of the owners pocket and well, we know how that story goes.","1212355100"

I can see your point. 
If I say it's the law and try to elaborate why I think the law was made like that, that can or can not reflect my own view on the point. However, unless you are -like some people here- lost in paranoia, you might at least acknowledge, that the law of consent age was made with good intentions. If they work or not...... sure, that's another discussion.

I guess we also should agree on, that there's a difference between an adult and a child, and that difference might not be an aboslute difference of IQ but an relative difference of maturity. Relative in the sense that there's certainly not a minimum level everyone will achive in his life. 
If an adult takes a decision, he's less likely to regret it because he is closer to the person he will ever be; whereas a child will undergo many changes and is therefore more likely to regret a decision taken.
We too probably could agree on that little children should be protected from abuse in any form. Also abuse of authority in way that could make them want something they might not really want. And the line at what age a kid should be protected and at what age an adult is responsible for his own decisions is of course artificial. I totally agree with you there. 
Lines always are artificial.

"business","t5_2qgzg","OK, again with the insults, but whatever.

You've picked one example where *communism* led to poverty. But I agree with you on this one. Strict communism does seem to lead to a low level of living for the average person, based on what's happened in communist countries.

I will point out that there were numerous other reasons though, as to why the Soviet Union dissolved, and why Russia ended up being relatively destitute, and these aren't *all* related to the form of government that was in place. 

But now let's choose a country that's obviously socialist nowadays. How about Norway, or France, or Canada? There are other ones that could be picked too, but these would be less valid as they share less in common economically and culturally with the US (so it's hard to rule out any confounding effects). The **average** person in these countries is, at best, better off than the **average** person in the US, and at the worst, just as well off. Having been to all of these countries, as well as having looked at numerous indicators of quality of life, I can also speak from personal experience that the average person is better off in these countries.

Since the US is obviously less socialist than these other mentioned countries, it would follow that citizens in socialist countries tend to do better on average.

Socialism has the effect of narrowing the statistical variation in average income among citizens, so the very rich in socialist countries would be expected to be not as rich as those in less socialist countries.

So, in conclusion, in socialism the richest 10% are poorer then they would be, but the average of the entire population is higher. 

***

As an aside, there are some situations where government regulation trumps economic and market self-regulation. Take health-care for example. Health-care is one of those weird things where supply controls demand. An increase in supply will simply increase demand. As a result, any market-based health-care system, such as that found in the US, will wind up being terribly cost-ineffective, and end up delivering a lower quality of care. As well, free-market-based regulation of systems tends to produce results that are only beneficial in the short term. Companies are legally mandated to do what is best for share-holders for short-term profits. This isn't always what's best in the long run though.

There are many instances where government delivery of services is much more cost-efficient than open-market. Take car insurance in Canada for example. In Manitoba, car insurance is through Manitoba Public Insurance, a service by the provincial government. The rates are one of the lowest in the country, or anywhere really for that matter. Around $1000 a year for a normal car. Compare this to car insurance in Ontario though, which is entirely operated through private businesses. Insurance costs are almost 3x higher then they are in Manitoba.

Markets are good at providing optimum efficiency and value in some things; but fail terribly in endeavors where collaboration, rather than competition, long-term goals, rather than short-term goals, are the point.

Since the well-being of the populace is a long-term goal, and something that requires cooperation between multiple disciplines (economics, health-care, research, engineering, etc), it makes sense that mild forms of socialism, like those found in Europe and Canada, deliver better outcomes in terms of both well-being, and income. 

***

for the record, you 

&gt;stat[ing] that under socialism, people are POORER, and no real economist would doubt this...

...is not proof that this is true. You can go into as much undergraduate level economical theory as you want to try and support yourself, but you still haven't addressed the fact that this doesn't appear to be true in real life.

Why are there less poor people in countries with socialist systems of government? Denying that this is true is just plain stupid, as it's factual. Your regurgitation of your understanding of basic economic theory does nothing to change the fact that your premise that:

&gt;The more socialist we are, the poorer the regular person is.

Second, it also throws out results from 12 - that's right, *12* entire states that ran caucuses, including Iowa (you know, the first state), Washington state, and so on.  

Third - the whole system was based on *delegates*.  If you wanted to count the popular votes, then fine - every state should have been a primary state.  But - it was delegates for a reason.  Some states just wanted to go based on popular vote.  Some states wanted only the participation of ""die hard"" Democratic party members - those who would take the time to get off of work for a whole 3 hours in the evening to debate as a big ass group who they wanted as their presidential pick.  Some would argue the former is a true ""democratic"" process - while others would argue that ""primary votes only"" rewards the ignorant who only know the popular name rather than the actual policies.  Some would argue that caucus states have the truly dedicated and participating party members who really care about the issues deciding who the nominee would be - while others would argue that caucuses discriminate against working people (which, to be honest, I find rather weak - it's not hard to find time off for a few hours months ahead of time).

Either way, that's the system that Senator Clinton agreed to.  To bring up this ""popular vote should rule"" nonsense is like someone arguing that you win at Baseball not based on how many runs, but on how many hits you get.

So - if you *disenfranchise* twelve states, ignore the rules, include states where only one candidate was on the ballot - you can say Senator Clinton is ""winning the popular vote"".    Otherwise, it's an argument that only the ignorant will buy.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Yes! Water is a human right. Thanks for asking but it is sad you would have to. 

Housing is also a human right. So is food. 

The arguments we see from these self-styled libertarians that equate rights with entitlements are essentially red herrings that lead away from the obvious truth that these things are human needs and a society with the means to fulfill human needs must do so. You can argue to the contrary all you want, but you're arguing an anti-human position. 

Beyond that, the arguments are always fatally oversimplified. This is a long-standing weakness in these tired arguments. Take Adam Smith's ideas for instance. In fact, Adam Smith was no fan of globalized trade. This was because he also based his ideas on simple models of village markets where only a limited number of variables needed to be accounted for. 

When someone tries to conclude that by giving a right to water to one man we are taking away water from another this same over-simplified flaw is coming into play. The flaw here is in thinking that all society's work is measured in units of human labor. That hasn't been the case for thousands of years but since the early twentieth century it has been divorced from the reality of economy in a way that was totally inconceivable up to that point --mechanization.

The post-industrial economy no longer operates on the equality of a unit of human labor that you can create these simplistic models on. All of our goods and services are intermediated by machines at multiple levels. These machines are collectively known as capital. 

Should capital be distributed in a manner that is equitable if the means are there for each member of society to have their needs for food, water and housing met? Fucking yes of course. We need not be slaves in an era of excess. Don't buy into this sad rhetoric of a malthusian zero sum game. That fascist game leads to tragedy and we don't need it.

I for one am willing to give up a portion of my meager ass pay check if it means my fellow human beings are provided with the water they need to survive. It irks me how many of you are unwilling act in a humane manner. The idea that water should be privatized is disgusting. These things are even more basic than rights. They are basic needs and if they aren't being met well then there's a disconnect within the society which does not meet these demands.

People who say ""government"" should answer the question are saying that, those in power have a responsibility to provide X and if they do not then that power may be revoked.

So by your logic, my belief that the government should be investing heavily in science education and scientific research (especially with regards to alternative energy) is a request that I have someone else do the hard work for me. Only I'm in school doing research on sources of alternative energy. After which I'll spend some time in the private sector and then head over to Africa or SA to help struggling areas meet their energy needs. But somehow it's morally treasonous for me to ask my government to fund what I believe to be a solution to a problem that is vital to the success of humanity?

That's a legal fiction derived from the ancient belief that children cannot sin, because they can't understand what they're doing. It's no more based on truth than the legal fiction that corporations are people. Don't confuse it with reality.

Teenagers, even 13-year olds, are perfectly capable of consenting. The only valid point is that many of them probably don't fully understand the potential consequences of their actions, but that can also be said about many adults.

Though, of course, even our definition of ""adult"" is arbitrary. Thirteen-year olds used to be sailors, and even low-level officers, in the British Navy less than 200 years ago.

My point is not that sex with 13-year olds should be legal - I don't agree with that. Rather, I'm saying that this girl can consent to sex, and all kinds of other, non-sexual things, like contracts, even if she is likely less sophisticated than an older person. The fact that she repeatedly engaged in sex with older men shows that she knows what she wants and consents to it.

Dear obbop,

It is very difficult to reason about the human aspect of 9/11.  No one knows how many people were involved, or how many of those involved are still alive.

However physical evidence is readily available and doesn't lie.  By simply looking at the WTC footage with a critical eye, we see that the buildings *explosively disintegrate*.  They don't fail because of damage and fire - they *disintegrate* - debris are ejected and the buildings become dust in seconds.

Buildings never, ever disintegrate that way, save for controlled demolitions.  Ever.  It simply is _not possible_ - it goes against common sense, and basic physics.  Buildings may fail from fire and damage, but absolutely not in the way they did.

Now the human aspect remains a mystery.  How could humans do such a horrible thing?  How many people were involved?  Who were they?  We don't know.  But the fact is that some persons committed that crime, and they did it using explosives and thermite in the buildings.

Unless a serious investigation is opened, we'll never know the details.

However these are the sad facts that we must face, as humans.

&gt;One study found that a third of police assumed that at least a quarter of all reports were false. Research actually suggests, though, that numbers of false allegations of rape are no higher than for any other crime. Assumptions of false allegations are plainly dangerous. One case discontinued by police as a ""false allegation"" involved a man who turned out to be a serial sex attacker. Eight years later he was convicted of 24 rapes.
A police officer I spoke to, who asked not to be named, said that officers dealing with rape have recently been told to be ""rigorous"" in their pursuit of false allegations, ""and root them out early on"".
Dave Gee, vice chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) working group on rape denies that police have been given such a directive and believes that false allegations of rape are rare. ""There is no research whatsoever which suggests it's endemic,"" he says. ""Either way, there should be no pre-judging of victims. A report of rape should be treated as rape.""

An excerpt from an ethnography study I found after a quick search (I suck at search engines):

(Social Problems, Vol. 38, No2 May 1991, 217)
DDA's question the woman because the guy only performed one type of rape. ""The only act she complained of was intercourse and in my experience that when they have a victim cornered they very rarely just do one act...""
Later cases are rejected because they see the perp. again (ignoring spouse/bf rape).  Rejected case because the woman didn't want to lose a business deal and didn't report it.  On and on.

Later I got another job, which for a while was 10am to 7pm, and then 9am to 6pm.  I don't think I ever did anything before maybe noon.  There was just no concentration there.

Now, finally, I have a job that doesn't care what hours I work.  I usually show up right in time for lunch, work all afternoon and into the evening.

While almost every issue that impacts resource use can be traced directly or indirectly to current (bad) business practice, the fact is that there are people who do choose to live in environments that cannot naturally support them in the manner they wish to live. Whether it is people in the US, flooding the deserts into a ""west coast paradise"", subsistence farmers in poor countries who are adopting our terrible agricultural practices in the desire for a more prosperous life, or the Chinese damming almost every river they have in misguided feats of civil engineering, people in general are not satisfied to live on what exists around them. It is easy to point the finger at business because it aids, abets, and encourages waste and degradation of resources, but the truth is that if business suddenly became as responsible as we wished them to be, the chances are that we would suddenly be facing much WORSE resource shortages all over the world than we currently are, because it's the overextension and overexploitation by people, through business, that has allowed people to get to where they currently are.

God knows highly anticipated movies of all stripes have been monumentally disappointing, and sequels and movies ending or extending TV programs usually fall into that category easily. 

If women think it was shit, then the movie was indeed a failure. If jackmonkeys like the reviewer here hated it because it was girly, well, it's like some american going off some freaky bollywood production, because it wasn't shitty in a way that he liked. 

As for ""why can't they make good movies for women,"" I'm reminded of that Man in the Box star wars vs sports nerds video on youtube. There are plenty of for men movies out there that are, really, shit outside of the juvenile fantasies of men that they cater to. ""Why can't they make good movies for men?"" Cause it's rare for movies to both feed the obvious appetites of some group and also be well written/done. 

Finally, any rant over this movie from a stereotypical male perspective is a forgone cliché. Pretending that his gender centric romancing of Bond and Star Wars movies are different than the women who fawn of Sex in the City is delusional. Have you seen a line for Star Wars?

A company reinvesting its profits in its operations receives better tax treatment than a company paying out profits in dividends.  This makes no sense; income should be treated the same, whether it is invested inside or outside the company paying it.  The only good reason for the current system is the government's need to tax investors' consumption at some point.  It shouldn't be taxing the movement of money from one investment to another, discouraging economic adjustment.

One solution would be to give everyone an IRA-like account for general-purpose savings.  Withdrawals (which could be done at any time) should be taxed, but no taxes should be paid on money moved around between investments in the account.

For example, after all the maven developers had moved on to maven 2 the entire maven 1 repository was moved to a new directory on ibiblio.

"funny","t5_2qh33","I am a guy, and I have never had this problem, but if a woman asked me to leave the seat down, I would oblige. Here is my reasoning: say 50% of the people who use the toilet are female and the other 50% are male. 100% of the times females use the toilet, they want the seat down. If males poo 40% of the time they use the toilet, they want the seat down for themselves 40% of the time. This means that, total, it is better to have the seat down for 70% of bathroom uses (100%\*50% + 40%\*50%). Whatever number you choose for percent of the time males need to poo, as long as males and females are equally likely to use the bathroom, it is better to leave the seat down.

I actually just thought of a complication of this that I'm not sure of the effect of. Some of the time, the male will put down the seat, only to visit it again before the female does, meaning he wastes energy putting up the seat, while he could have just left it up in the first place. Also, if you said whoever needs the toilet should put the seat in the correct position, neither the woman or the man would be worse off, because the event that the man pees after the woman uses the toilet and the event that the woman uses the toilet after the man pees (the two cases where the seat needs to be moved) have equal probabilities. However, people are more likely to be in a hurry right before they use the toilet than right after.","1212357860"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;A problem remains, and it is a problem, that one's someone's personal wealth generates enough to live on comfortably and then some, they become simply an owner. Their bank account continues to balloon while they aren't productive in any way. This increasing accumulation of wealth creates situations where the majority of people are unable to get ahead and are just working to keep living, while the wealthy enjoy the benefit of owning an increasing share of society's wealth and property.

&gt;That's why income and capital taxes are necessary: so that society doesn't inevitably end up an oligarchy, with the only recourse to the people being revolution.

These arguments about the dangers of oligarchy might justify antitrust actions, individual taxes, or estate taxes, but not high corporate taxes.  Large groups of small shareholders in non-monopoly firms aren't an oligarchy.  Oligarchies come about when small groups come to dominate either the market or the political process.  A system to prevent such a situation should target the problem directly.

&gt;If you want to enjoy the benefits of investor liability protection, then you can deal with larger tax burden.

I agree that some level (i.e. much lower than 35%) of corporate taxation can be justified for liability protection.  However, you should also factor in the many mandates to publicly held firms are subject.  These may balance out at least some of the liability advantage.

&gt;As for taxing resource extraction, and drawing in more externalities such as pollution, deforestation, water depletion etc. I'd love to see it.

Externality taxation is another good idea, as long as the tax is equal to the value of the good destroyed (and as long as the damage is not compensated again through the legal system).  Otherwise the system turns into an arbitrary revenue grab.   ","1212358200"

No. Nobody matches the savagery of christians. Never have and I suspect they never will.

Thats true - to a point. By looking at the extreme end of a hypothetical situation(i.e a man dying of starvation and/or thirst), you're missing the reality that most people actually live in. Yes, if you're dying of thirst all bets are off. Even a libertarian would help himself to another's property to save his life. In fact, if saving one's life required you to end another's, most people would do it - and we would understand. But thats not the reality people find themselves in, in 99.99% of their life. It's certainly not true for Western, or Asian nations. It's not even true for much of Africa. It's bad reasoning to base your proposals for our world by looking on the  extreme and improbable situation. Doubly so since there are [consequences](http://reddit.com/info/6lmih/comments/c0479tw) to this option.

Looking at it another way, if people are starving or dying of thirst, it is because of extraneous situations (most likely war) - in those situations all rights are out the window anyway. In the Rwandan Genocide, you think the Hutu dominated government would have cared about the  Tutsi right to water, when they don't respect their right to life? So the right to water (or food, or shelter or property or life) is as academic as all the other rights. In life or death situations, there are no rights. Under totalitarian, or mob rule, there are no rights.","1212358459"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; As for God, we cannot prove or disprove God's existance

Which is normally science-speak for ""God is an incoherent idea"". But more than that, known science casts a penumbra of theoretical predictions - and the work you must do to validly defy those predictions is *exactly the same as the work to falsify the science that led to them*, even in areas where direct proof is impossible. That's an awesome lot of heavy lifting, so we assign god a vanishingly small probability.

""It's still a chance, it's not disproved""? Probabilities zero and one (perfect disproof, perfect proof) don't exist in the real world. So when you falsify a theory, you aren't proving probability zero. You're showing evidence that reduces the probability to around the level where ""everything we know is a lie"" is the only way to support it. That's exactly where god is. I would not be overstating the case if I said that science has falsified god.

&gt; but I think there is enough evidence of various forms for us to entertain the idea, the possibility of God.

Oh really? If you have evidence, show it. But be aware of the immense weight of countervailing evidence you have to lift. Weak evidence won't be anywhere near enough. If your mere *personal conviction* is all you've got, you would be better advised to label it a delusion.","1212358661"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","This article is bullshit. Obviously written by some naive reporter repeating pentagon crap.

&gt; military analysts have watched with astonishment as the Iraqi government and army have gained control for the first time of the port city of Basra and the sprawling Baghdad neighborhood of Sadr City, routing the Shiite militias that have ruled them for years and sending key militants scurrying to Iran.

First of all: I hardly believe that the Iraqi government controls Sadr City or Basra. Even if they are at the moment able to drive with their US bought Humvees through the streets they don't control it. It's just simple: The Mahdi Army is not just a group of foreigners. The Mahdi Army are the people of Sadr City and the slums of Basra. They are the local group. The kids in the neighbourhood. You can't expel them unless you force every fuckin human out of Basra or Sadr City. They probably just lie down. They did not lose the battle. They just wait and buy their time. That's their way of fighting the war.

Going into a full scale battle with the US/Iraqi Gov would be crazy. The US airpower would leave nothin but dust. So the Mahdi Army waits and plants one or another IED. After a few month the US and Iraqi Army pulls back because they are the foreigners in Basra/Sadr City and have no local support and after that the Mahdi guys are back on the street.

It's simple.

&gt; Iraqi and U.S. forces have pushed forward with a long-promised offensive in Mosul, the last urban refuge of al-Qaeda. So many of its leaders have now been captured or killed that U.S. Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, renowned for his cautious assessments, said that the terrorists have ""never been closer to defeat than they are now.""

C'mon al-Qaeda... There is no ""the al-Qaeda"" and there never was. Whoever is claiming to be some kind of al-Qaeda is a complete different to the bin Laden stuff. There is no real organisation ""al-Qaeda"".

So this whole thing is stupid. Of course the Sunni insurgency dropped after the US did the only thing it is good at: Throw bags and bags of money at them. But you can't build a government on the whole ""Neighbourhood Watchgroup"" shit. As soon as the US is gone the Sunnis will use their (us bought) weapons to be a big player in the civil war again.

&gt; Iraq passed a turning point last fall when the U.S. counterinsurgency campaign launched in early 2007 produced a dramatic drop in violence and quelled the incipient sectarian war between Sunnis and Shiites.

Actually the cease fire from the Madhi guys and buying out the Sunnis did the job.

&gt; and the Iranian-trained ""special groups"" that have used them as cover to wage war against Americans.

""Iranian-trained ""special groups""""? Like the party running the Iraqi army and big parts of the government?

Considering that ATI makes the graphics chips for all of the graphics chips for this current generation of consoles (even the ps3 has some ATI chips in it) the numbers for Linux are even less. Say Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony each sell 20 million, 4 million and 5 million consoles this year. Now say Apple sells 4 million Macs this year of which about half come with an ATI card so 2 million cards for ATI. If the Mac is 6% of the desktop market that means 125.2 million Windows based PCs are sold this year which half of have ATI cards (ignoring Intel and other card manufactures). Now if Linux is 2% of the market (which seems a bit high to me but I'm going to run with it) and, once again, half of those guys have ATI cards then that's only 600,000 cards. Add all the projected cards sold and you end up with about 0.6% of the market being Linux people.

If you assume that ATI has 100 people who make drivers (number pulled out of my ass because it's a nice even number) evenly distributed to reflect their market then you end up with one guy who spends only part of his time making Linux drivers. If you start to take into account that quite a few Linux PCs sold use the cheapest video components that can be found (ie NOT ATI or Nvidia) or are just corporate workstations where the video cards is the last thing to be upgraded it's a miracle that Linux is even supported at all. The fact that Linux is such an statistical non-entity yet gets on the box says to me that Linux users should stop biting the hand that feeds them. If you want to make more of an impact that would justify getting decent drivers you should buy 5 high end cards (the us$500+ kind) and encourage the other thousands of Linux consumers to do the same.

**All you need to consider is energy**:  how much (kinetic) there is before the collision and, and where it went afterwards (when nothing is left moving)  Assuming 100% inelastic collisions, all the energy goes into deforming cars.  

The two-car-60-MPH system has half the energy of the one-car-120-MPH system (1/2 m v^2, etc.), *and* that energy is dumped roughly equally into smooshing two cars.


As far as car-crushing energy goes, the one-car system gets *four* times as much.

If you received an alert dialog in a tab and checked ""stop executing scripts on this page""  before clicking the OK button, JS will be disabled for that tab and a reload won't restore JS.  If that's not happening for you, then something is wrong with your Opera.

&gt; And there's always quick prefs under F12

You can't access the F12 menu when an alert dialog is shown, so you can't use it to disable the script. You also can't use the F12 JS quick preference to renable JS for a tab after you've chosen ""stop executing scripts on this page"".

Exactly. Obama won because he studied the rules, understood the rules, and adopted a strategy to win based on those rules.

*Because* it's a contest for delegates, Obama made the (wise) decision to put his energy and resources into small caucus states, where he could rack up big net delegate margins. The benefit of this strategy was seen on Super Tuesday and the month of February. All this talk of ""winning"" PA, OH, etc are utter nonsense in this context.

Had it been a contest for the popular vote, or even if it had been winner takes all a la the Republicans, *he would have played the game differently*, perhaps investing a lot more in the ""big states"" that Hillary seems to think matter so much because she was playing the wrong game.

The only conceivable reason and impact of making this argument is to feed the idea to her supporters that the election was stolen from her, a la Al Gore in 2000. I hope they kick her the hell out of the party - she can go hang out with Lieberman until her term is up in 2012.","1212360909"

I don't fault Barak too much, since it was an election season, and his team couldn't keep going with the negotiations, since their right to make the deal was at stake. I was just responding to the usual accusation of Arafat rejecting camp david because he ""prefered violence"" Mind you, i loath the man, and I dislike Oslo for the sole reason that it enabled him to enter the occupied territories and placed him in a leadership position.

I was disappointed with the election of Sharon. I'm sure they elected him due to the violence of the intifada, but i was surprised by the israelis' lack of remembering that it was him who fueled it by his visit to the temple mount, knowing it would provoke violence.

Anyways, i believe there's only one solution, and thats having the Geneva Accords/Taba agreements as the basis for a peace deal. Withdrawl to 1967 borders, removal of settlements, and i'm sure they can fork out sharing the water supplies in the west bank. During Taba, the palestinians agreed to let the major settlement blocs remain, since relocating the inhabitants isn't practicable, and the Israelis were willing to give back east jerusalem. This is the international concesus. Mainstream israelis and palestinians agree, the Arab League agrees, and the UN agrees. Only ones opposed are Hamas, the settlers, and the Bush administration (whos ""roadmap"" is nothing but political hogwash distracting form real negotiations). Having Hamas marginalized in Gaza, Israel should take this opportunity and fork out a deal already, I don't know what it's waiting for, i can only guess the settler movement being in opposition, which expalins why the settlements keep expanding without an end in sight.","1212360982"

&gt;by 1916, New York rape law treated all girls below eighteen years of age, the age of consent, as being incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse. Consequently, any man who had sexual intercourse with an underage girl, regardless of the circumstances, was guilty of rape. Mary Odem and Sharon Ullman, the leading historians of the phenomenon of statutory rape in the United States, see prosecutors' concern to portray girls as passive as a reflection of judges' and jurors' desire to control female sexuality, rather than as an attempt to protect girls from sexual violence. The men who decided statutory rape cases read any suggestion that a girl like Rosa had consented to sexual activity as a sign that such a girl possessed sexual desire. In its turn, the attribution of sexual desire to females challenged notions of proper female behavior, leading judges and jurors to treat girls not as victims of sexual violence who deserved their protection, but as wayward individuals who needed to be controlled.","1212361034"

My point is that it is not ""who"" as in what person's hand will build the house from mud but ""what"" as in what cranes will place the steel girders. 

These fascist leaning libertarian arguments only work when you dumb everything down into terms of human labor. The fact is, up until the middle of the nineteenth century ninety percent of the human labor on this planet was employed in agriculture and still frequently faced with starvation. 

Now, in American we live in a world where well less than five percent of the population is actively involved in agricultural production and we have huge surpluses of grains despite allowing massive fertile regions to go unplanted. You see, it's no longer about ""who"" but about ""what"" and that what is capital. How will the capital be distributed? 

So let's rephrase your question. What capital will build these houses? Now we get to the point. It is our capital, the people. People come first, capital comes second. When you put the rights of capital before the rights of people you are on the road to fascism. 

People do have rights. They simply need to demand they be respected. ","1212361452"

Look, I've worked pretty closely with some fairly senior DoD people on humanitarian issues for a couple of years. That hardly makes me an insider, but it does give me a bit of first-hand perspective.

Trust me. They show a lot of deference to the State Department and its wishes, particularly around entities like US AID, and there's a lot of bureaucratic square dancing to try and get everybody on the same page even on simple stuff like research into long-term humanitarian aid solutions.

I don't see any sign of a massive coordinated power grab by anything other than the executive branch. In fact, I think the closer you get to the situation, it's pretty clear that interagency cooperation is something that is being tried, and tried, and tried, with very little tangible success, while the obvious solution of ""give the whole mess to DoD and let them figure it out"" is largely ignored out of deference to the interagency agenda.

I'd suggest a different perspective: the political level of the government has created huge new arenas which require the DoD to look after them. The DoD is attempting to do so. Funding decisions haven't supported other parties to do the work - note that's not under DoD control, that's also at the political level - and the whole mess gets worked through in some interagency fashion.

The article describes something clean, coordinated, planned. If the government was that efficient and effective, I think we'd see some evidence of it. No... it's just a lot of people, some very talented, many deeply average, muddling along trying to implement the madness from above successfully.","1212362394"

"programming","t5_2fwo","This isn't a defect per say, its more of a discussion towards UI trends.

Modal Popups are evil, in any application. The real question, is should a browser start treating alert() as a non modal window?

There are larger implications to this as well. During a modal popup, script execution is halted. Changing alerts behavior to a non modal popup would result in changing its syntax, forcing a event handler closure to be called when the popup is eventually filled out.

Doing this would break the web.

However, with the advent of a tabbed UI, there is no reason why the modal popup should only be modal for a certain tab. So that is the approach I would take for correcting this.

"science","t5_mouw","Meditation practice is often compared to boiling water. If you put pot of water in the stove and put heat on for one minute and then put heat down and do the same thing again next day, you can't boil water, No matter how long you try. To boil water, you must keep the heat on until it boils. It's mostly same in the meditation. When you participate into long retreat, first day may be nice, then when mind starts to really settle down, all kinds of shit comes up in your mind. Concentration may become almost impossible. You may have to fight several days with fears, physical pains, anxieties and ""monkey mind"" until you are able to get more deeper into your practice. 

I once asked from my zen teacher, can people get kensho (the first breaktrough) without going into long retreats. He said that most people who live normal lives get their kensho in 7-day sesshin (intensive week-long retreat), some get it in 4-day sesshins and very few get it outside of these retreats. He considers the absolute minimum for ""serious"" meditation to be 45 minutes per day constantly. 

The main thing in serious practice is to do it constantly every day, not only when you feel it. You have to sit when you don't want, when you are tired, when your mind is agitated, etc. Then things start to happen. ","1212362683"

A lot of these women view the presidency as the ULTIMATE glass ceiling, and as soon as one woman gets elected then the floodgates are going to open and suddenly all the misogyny will be gone.

Unfortunately, second wave feminism -- IMMaleO -- has been a horrible failure. Despite many leading woman CEOs -- Hillary one of the first -- we still see gross pay inequality for many women. The few that do end up on a board somewhere end up with token status (""Oh, you're a woman! You'd love being on our woman's advocacy council!"" and the like). The problem is that it doesn't actually _solve_ any of the problems that some feminists are legitimately bringing up about the system.

To conclude, these women literally do think that Hillary will be a better president because she is not a man. ","1212363868"

But you make a good point. Rights are not really inalienable in the sense that you can be denied them by people that are more powerful than you.  But legally they are inalienable that is if your rights are denied or abrogated the the person or persons responsible are criminals. 

The question is are we to stick with civilization the basis of which is the rule of law -- or should we return to kill or be killed? If you wish to have rights you must grant them to others or get a gun and keep a weather eye on your neighbor.

Personally I don't like the idea of sleeping with one eye open all the time. I've done that and it isn't fun. I want to grant to you the rights that I want in order secure those rights for myself.

Ok, just kidding.  This answer is hard to word without offending, and possibly digging myself holes.  I'd also like to make sure that you know this isn't something I bring up when talking about not my religion, but the other party always does.  I think if I bring it up, it sounds like I'm trying to ""prove"" my religion by ""proving"" others false.  Here we go =)

As far as Muslims, they also believe in the God of Abraham (as do Jews and Christians).  The difference is that they think Jesus was just a prophet, like Muhammad.  At that point, it's not really the Christian God that they believe in.

I think Muhammad, like Joseph Smith and others, is a false prophet.

If by ""does it matter"" you mean do I believe that they will go to Heaven, then no.  In order to go to Heaven as a Christian, you have to: ""confess with your mouth 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God rose Him from the dead, you will be saved.  For it is with your heart you believe and are justified, and your mouth that you confess and are saved.""","1212364348"

Arguably, any answer is right to this question.

The one on moles of lead and helium was also poor.  They ask about the number of *atoms*. Thus, the correct answer comes down to knowing whether or not these two substances, in elemental form, form molecules of more than one atom or not.  Helium is nonreactive, so it is easy to recall that its elemental form will be atoms, not molecules. However, there is no particular reason for someone, as part of their basic physics knowledge, to know whether or not lead hangs out as single atoms, or molecules of multiple lead atoms.","1212364648"

Obama has approved *continued funding* for the war at every opportunity he had to follow the will of the american people and try to end the war.

12/21/05: Obama confirmed his support for war by voting for the Conference Report on the Defense Appropriations Act (HR 2863), Roll call 366, which provided more funding to Halliburton and Blackwater.

3/1/06: Obama voted to pass S2271, the USA PATRIOT Act. Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006, which strengthened and made worse the original USA-PATRIOT Act. Roll call 25

6/15/06: Obama, again, opposed withdrawal of the troops, by voting to table a motion to table a proposed amendment would have required the withdrawal of US. Armed Forces from Iraq and would have urged the convening of an Iraq summit (S Amdt 4269 to S. Amdt 4265 to S2766). Roll Call 174

Obama’s voting record in 2007 establishes that he continues to be pro-war. On March 28, 2007 and March 29th, 2007, he voted for cloture and passage of a bill designed to give Bush over $120 billion to continue the occupation for years to come (with a suspendable time table) and inclusive of funding that could be used to launch a war with Iran. Roll calls 117 and 126.

Check out that link and you can see my reaction to it (thus leading to this admittedly nerdy submission) in the [comments.](http://reddit.com/info/6ll7m/comments/)


The notation in question is referred to as a *leader*. Typically, it indicates that further detail is offered elsewhere in the drawing. The leader is just a kind of a line (or a line with an arrow) connecting to a bubbled (dashed line) area indicating what the remote detail describes and where to find it. The circle describes the drawing number (top number) separated by the sheet or page number (bottom number) on which it can be found with a dash or underline between them. In this case, the drawing is the second drawing on sheet 6.10.

The circle is separated by the dashed line with the line which is called the leader. This is done because drawings can get overly crowded and impossible to read. Unfortunately, the draftsmen actually chose to leave the circle over other pertinent information rather than in a less confusing place off to the side. Ooops. Whose fault? Definitely the contractor for not understanding how to read drawings or having enough oversight over his less-skilled employees.","1212364722"

(Most coffee geeks either brew small quantities for immediate drinking, or use a thermal carafe to keep it at brewing temperature for longer periods -- that covers the 'just sitting there'.)

My impression of the case is that the jury awarded her a 'sympathy settlement' for pursuing the case, and McDonalds threatened to appeal to an appeals court which  would have been much less sympathetic -- so she eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.

Note that this case was not, as popularly believed, the reason for the 'coffee is hot!' warnings on cups; the wikipedia article notes that the warning *was already on that cup*. The  plaintiffs were reduced to arguing that it 'wasn't large enough'. And she had somehow managed to spill the coffee while holding it between her legs *as a passenger*, and was just opening it to add cream and sugar.  It sounds to me like she wasn't capable of operating a coffee cup with a lid, and when she got hurt she was looking for a deep pocket to give her a payday.","1212364781"

Nonetheless, I believe it possible for a 13-year-old to pass for an adult and to obtain the ID or whatever to prove it.  The judge should have had the discretion to consider this, but in today's world, it's easy to see how letting the men go with a light sentence is not in his best interest at all.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","That's only a tautology. ""Right to + a noun"" can very easily be written as as ""right to access + same noun"", which is a ""right + verb"". What's more you very easily make a usable ""right to water law"" by framing it poperly, e.g. ""every person has the right to 10 litres of clean water a day at nominal cost"" with sensible definitions of ""clean"" and ""nominal cost"". With such a law, the government would supply the citizens itself, or more likely, laws to prevent others from denying their neighbours water, but either way everyone has water.

The US right to free speech stems from the fact it was one of the most pressing concerns when the US constitution was framed and amended. Clearly free speech was an issue back then, is rightly enshrined in the US constitution, but availability of water was not a problem when the USA was just a few hundred thousand people on the rainy east coast (ok the numbers might be wrong but the idea will stand).

To suggest that one right (e.g. speech) should be upheld because it is in a document made 230 years ago, but another right (e.g. water) has no place because it wasn't a concern in 1776 that shows thinking that is rather unimaginative and one-dimensional. It's an insult to the founding fathers of the USA to suggest they wouldn't have put in such a right if water supply had been a problem back then.","1212365772"

and in exemple, on linux anjuta is one of the IDE that bring a lot of progress for IDE.

There is a little gui that list all the libs installed on your box. then the only thing you have to do is to check uncheck the libs you need.

seriously programming c++ on windows is a pain in the ass, visual studio is only good for auto completion in my opinion. I do not see any feature that is really missing from open source alternative like anjuta, code::blocks, or even kdeveloper.

On windows, everytime you want to use external libs you have to make a new setup for it.

From what I understand, you're basically going to have to swap out your whole persistence layer, even changing it from a relational engine to a non-relational one in the process.  That sounds to me pretty close to a compete rewrite.   And then once rewritten you are very much locked into Gemstone - you had better hope it is going to work.

"religion","t5_2qh39","In order:

In Christian theology, Jesus *is* God.  Specific phrasings/descriptions vary by denomination.

Again, standard Christian theology: forgiveness by grace is offered, only you can accept it.

This one varies more significantly by denomination, I'll go with my view: anyone who says ""from birth"" is using hyperbole for effect; unbaptized infants do not go to hell (if anyone disagreeing with me, well, I disagree with them).  God does not destine you for hell, your actions do and God offers forgiveness.  If you do not believe your actions have earned you a place in Hell, Christianity really has very little to offer you (except perhaps an excellent community and group of friends, but that varies by church).

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;If you have a right to water, what if you go build a hut in the middle of a desert, surrounded by nothing for miles? Should it be the responsibility of everyone else to make sure you get your water?

No, because if you go off to live by yourself in the desert you don't have a society. The notion of 'rights' only makes sense if you are living in some sort of social arrangement.

So if you have a 'right to water', then all that means is that each member of society is guaranteed water.

It doesn't make sense to talk about the 'rights' of a hermit - if there is no one around to honor his rights, then in what sense do they exist?

&gt;It is tempting to call everything a right, but the thumb rule is, if it involves forcing/coercing other people to do something for you, you don't have that right.

That doesn't work - it suffers from reflexivity problems. Your right to a free speech, a fair trial, etc. forces a just society to honor that right, to give you a fair trial, etc.

In other words, if you're establishing and asserting a right to X, you're also saying that ""others should honor my right to X (they should not violate it)"".

But then, establishing *any right whatsoever* requires some other agent (persons, society, govt) to form a particular disposition.

Your thumb rule needs work. ""Rights"" are tricky things, and to define them precisely takes a bit of work. Here's a hint: the distinction between negative rights (I have a right not to...) and positive rights (I have a right to...) is not that important - it's probably says more about our linguistic psychology than what this abstract thing, a ""right"", really should be.","1212366402"

"reddit.com","t5_6","I would consider myself a strong supporter of equality and respect for both genders. Unfortunately, ignorant things like this are the reason many do not take contemporary feminism seriously.
- Mal is supposed to be a chauvinistic, misogynistic character - that is a personality trait in the writing, not an attempt at hating women by Joss.
- Zoe calls Mal ""Sir"" because they used to be in the military together and thus military formality is natural to them. Did you even pay attention to this show beyond trying to rip it apart to satisfy your bias?
- Prostitution is a real thing (problem?) in our current society and the society Joss has created. Why does admitting prostitutes exist make you sexist?
- How is Zoe and Wash's relationship anti-feminist? Zoe is the dominant character for goodness sakes...

In summary - Joss is portraying a broken world that has many problems similar to our own. The characters are anti-heroes, having nearly as many flaws as good traits, and you shouldn't assume that just because someone isn't some tool that writes happy pretty things that make women perfectly equal power Gods it doesn't make them a misogynist.

My experience was, it was a pain in the fucking ass. I was told that once you got an appropriate whitelist set up, then it pretty much stayed out of your face. This is a lie.

The extra cognitive load of thinking about whether the site needs to be whitelisted in order to see its content is annoying. By the end of my using noscript, I was pretty much just whitelisting any site that seemed like it might need it anyways. And, if it would be that easy to trick me into enabling JS, then what's the point of even having noscript.

Scripts really only even slow my browser down very occasionally anyways. The only real vulnerabilty is an infinite loop of alert()s, which would force me to kill my browser. The cost/benefit ratio of having noscript installed just isn't there.","1212366538"

I have literally dealt with hundreds of people in the past year who left uni after their last exam, blissfully thinking that if they didn't authorise the uni to graduate themselves, their graduation would just go ahead regardless.

The depiction of america is completely warped and sounds like a hodgepodge of the most negative news stories and stereotypes in the national US and global media. The depiction of Russia is completely warped, overly simplified and the the conclusion on every slide is so cartoonish it reads like propaganda.

It's almost certainly true that the general trend in the US is not sustainable, but no other aspect of these slides or the explanation are anything but uninformed speculation based on caricatures, and it's clear that this guy really doesn't understand any of the issues.

For instance, I really wonder if the author has even been to the US. ""Sprawl, dead downtowns""? Detroit, baltimore, a handful of others ... but beyond that, most cities are actually becoming even more vibrant and have been for almost 20 years, so much so that the cores of major cities like Chicago, New York and San Francisco are infinitely nicer than they were in the 70s and 80s and are still booming. His understanding of current urban trends is decades behind what's actually occurring. There is indeed also unsustainable sprawl, but this guy clearly doesn't understand what that actually means and what various factors are involved.

The US is not Russia. It's that simple.

There are two ways to implement closures:

- As a pair, environment plus function pointer. Invoking the closure involves loading the environment into a register, and an indirect jump to the function pointer.

- With 'defunctionalization'. Your closure is an environment plus union tag, and invoking the closure is a dispatch over a union type, which is probably a a series of conditionals and direct jumps. If you apply sufficiently sophisticated control flow analysis and reduce the number of possibilities at each closure call site down to a handful, then this can be more efficient than an indirect jump","1212366926"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","OK, please be gentle.  I'm a slowly reforming right-brained guy who is in training to become a middle-school math teacher.  This past year I've discovered a passion for learning math that I haven't had in 40 years!  I'm jamming a LOT of algebra/geometry/trig/stats and probability/and beginning calculus into my head.  

I ""understand"" - I think - the revolution that calculus was.  I guess what I'm asking is: for day-to-day math problems (non-scientific or engineering or medical applications), does algebra suffice?  I noticed on [this site](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Extras/AlgebraTrigReview/AlgebraTrigIntro.aspx) there was an interesting piece of text, where the instructor said the following:

&gt;&gt;Most of the following set of problems illustrates the kinds of algebra and trig skills that you will need in order to successfully complete any calculus course here at Lamar  University.  The algebra and trig in these problems fall into three categories :

    * Easier than the typical calculus problem,
    * similar to a typical calculus problem, and
    * harder than a typical calculus problem.

Can someone give me an example of a real world problem that you could solve with either algebra or calculus, and why you would choose one method over the other?

Seriously, try to explain this - if possible - to a n00b.  I want to know conceptually why calculus represents the apex of this kind of thinking.  I read stuff like ""you can find the slope of a line""  and even ""the slope of the slope of a line"" - but it just isn't conveying to me the import of the idea of calculus.

Technically, yes, but the force wasn't created by the car seats upon hitting the tree, it was created by the car seats while the car was moving.  Since the car seats are the only thing the occupants are in contact with while the car is accelerating, they provide the force that accelerates the occupants in the first place, such that if that force did not exist, they wouldn't be thrown through the windshield since they wouldn't actually be moving.

&gt;30) An atom is just like a tiny solar system in which the nucleus is like the Sun and electrons are like tiny planets orbiting the nucleus in elliptical paths.

It really depends on how far you stretch the metaphor, I'd say.  I actually answered true to this just because I thought the quiz wanted me to answer true, since technically there are similarities - small particles orbiting a central, larger particle - and since this is a ""basic"" physics savvy quiz and I figured they wouldn't be asking about quantum mechanics.  I think the metaphor of a solar system can be stretched (a lot) in order to make them seem similar, but as the answer says it really isn't anything like that, considering the planets don't hop from one orbit to another without crossing inbetween, nor is the force involved the same (gravity vs. nuclear forces), etc.  Anyway, this question really ought to be a little more specific.

Also, T/F quizzes aren't fun if ~70% of the answers are false.  Might as well call it a ""list of physics myths"" instead of a T/F test if you're just going to make so many answers false.","1212367188"

"science","t5_mouw","They asked if the sensation of hot or cold is a measure of temperature; the answer was false.  I would disagree with the answer.

If something feels hot, it has a higher temperature than you.  If something feels cold, it has a lower temperature than you.  Therefore, the sensation of hot and cold is a measure of temperature, just like whether an object floats or sinks is a measure of density.

I understand that the sensation is caused by heat transfer, but heat transfer is only possible if there is a temperature difference.

An especially bad part of their explanation is:

&gt; For example place your hand in hot water then in warm water and the warm water will feel cold. Place your hand in ice water then in the same container of warm water and the warm water will feel hot.

This is interesting, but not relevant.  My 25 lb dumbbell feels much lighter after curling a 40 lb dumbell, but if the question were ""The difficulty of holding something straight out in front of you is a measure of that thing's weight,"" the correct answer would be yes.

In fact the US constitution doesn't contain a right to free speech, just that congress cannot pass a law forbidding it - the ""right to free speech"" in the literal sense isn't enshrined in the constitution.

Tautologies aside, labelleing someone as ""not productive"" because someone else beat them to the water fountain rather ignores the tenent that some people are rather good at cornering markets and would hold others at ransom for anything if they had half a chance. The cornering of essential goods is something that a good government would try to legislate against, because hunger and food shortages cause civil unrest and civil war, and this leaves virtually everyone worse off in the end.

Finally guaranteeing everyone enough supply isn't going to take anybody's incentive to work away: Giving water away is not a big burden on ""productive"" members of society and there are plenty of other things to work for.","1212367895"

This one is really tricky, and if you ask me (from the perspective of a biologist), not a very good question. I have heard it quoted before.

The tricky part is that the sensation of hot or cold *is* a measure of temperature, but not the temperature of the object you are touching, but you own temperature.

The reason why thing with a high heat capacity/high thermal conductivity seem colder than other things is because they reduce the temperature of your skin faster compared to your own internal heat generation. That leads to a lower equilibrium temperature at your skin.","1212367933"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Calculus is just as much a way of thinking as it is a set of specific techniques.  Calculus deals with breaking down a problem into smaller and smaller divisions, calculating the subproblems, and putting them together.  That's why limits are so crucial to an understanding of calculus.

Take integration.  It's centered around adding up tiny parts, and thus the ""S"" shape of the integral sign for summation.  Look at the birth rates and death rates in a census, and you can approximate the population at a given time by adding up the rates multiplied by a time period.  If the data is fine-grained enough, you might consider using a regression model to create an approximate function for the rates, then integrate them so you don't have to add up all the small parts.

Or let's say you're in charge of a fabrication process.  With enough data, you can model the costs and project revenues, and often using basic calculus, you can optimize it if the model is simple enough.  If you know calculus, certain classes of problems become very simple, even if you can technically do them with basic algebra.

In the real world, you never need perfection.  For that reason, you can often approximate a model that fits a certain set of data, and using calculus, you can analyze it.  And if you know calculus, you're always looking for small changes and small subdivisions.  It's both a matter of technique and a matter of mindset.

Not all books are like that though.  Personally, I read a lot of stuff that's really only available in cheap low-quality paperback in the first place, and would only survive a couple of readthroughs.  It's not really high literature, but merely ephemeral entertainment not much different from a lot of the crap on television.

Who decides what is productive? Why should I be forced to be what you think is productive ? Maybe simply being someone's friend contributes 'more' to society but might not ever 'count' as productivity?  I see this type of mentality all the time where everyone is comparing against each other who worked longer hours or who woke up earlier, etc., when none of it really matters.

While I agree with the idea that gov't and businesses should never by force take wealth away from some to produce this water for others, I believe that as individuals we all have a responsibility to provide water to each other through our own free will but never by force.  I also believe that we have a responsibility to allow others to be free and not constantly compare or try and figure out who isn't pulling their weight.","1212368781"

Right now in America there are hundreds, maybe thousands of so-called [""children who molest""](http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/1996/07/levine.html) -- little kids who have been stigmatized (by adults) because they hugged someone, touched someone, looked at someone, in an ""inappropriate"" way.

I'm not talking about teenagers who raped the girl next door. I'm talking about grade-schoolers who've been taken from their parents, kicked out of school, and sent to group homes along with violent juvenile delinquents, because they pulled down their pants on the playground or were found ""playing doctor"" by a teacher.

It's gone beyond paranoia of nakedness or sexual contact. It's gotten so crazy that [schools are banning hugging](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21690514/) even among platonic friends, for fear of ""public displays of affection"" that are sexualized and abusive only in the minds of perverted adults.","1212368797"

If the tube were narrower than the tank, which I think is what you're implying, all the weight of the water in the tube would be spread out over the area of the tank, and the pressure would be lower.

To be more precise, if you were in a 10-meter-tall by 1-meter-wide tank, the pressure would be the same at any depth as in a lake or ocean (with the same type of water).  If the tank is 1m wide, 1m tall and a tube only 10cm wide is attached above it, the tube would have to be 1km tall to get the same force (roughly 30 metric tons).

Also, if the tube is very narrow, the forces between the water and the tube will mess things up.  Taken to extremes, a long and extremely thin tube can hold water without even being closed off (capillary action).","1212369015"

If/when the company gets sued, the plaintiffs can obtain records on how the company handles incidents regarding sexuality. If the typical response to such incidents is to shrug it off as no big deal, the company will have a tougher time proving its case. If the company errs on the side of harsh discipline even for minor or borderline offenses, it helps their case.

FTA:
&gt; My Grandmother Has Always Been A Christian - LIAR, she does her daily Salat prayers at 5am according to her own interviews. According to the New York Times: ""I am a strong believer of the Islamic faith,"" Ms. Obama, 85, said in a recent interview in Kenya.' Not to mention, Christianity wouldn't allow her to have been one of 14 wives to 1 man.

I want to concentrate on this part:
&gt; Not to mention, Christianity wouldn't allow her to have been one of 14 wives to 1 man.

Well, actually it would. Various sects may make rules of their own, but Christianity *per* *se* has no ban on polygamy nor limit on number of spouses.

The Bible has nothing good to say about polygamy, but not a whole lot bad to say about it, either. It is prohibited for church leaders (see [Titus 1:6](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=TITUS%201:6;&amp;version=31;)), but that's about it.

Islam, on the other hand, certainly would *not* allow a man to have 14 wives. The Koran specifically limits him to 4; see [Sura 4 (""The Women"")](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/koran/koran-idx?type=DIV0&amp;byte=114839), verse 3.","1212369564"

The problem, of course, with the idea of sex as a commodity is that there is no scarcity. People can have as much sex as they want, unless members of the opposite gender refuse to cooperate. Any sex scarcity is therefore artificial.

Two, [it doesn't matter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem), you have not touched the argument which I have presented.

Three, it's deductively unsound because both of your proofs, that he has no ""experience"" and that people with experience will always do well, are contestable.  You never defined ""experience""; what does it mean?  Also, experience does not necessitate good performance.  Thus unsound and unfounded.  To be sound, it has to be definitively true, for example ""Socrates is a man"".

Four, it's deductively invalid because your logic goes something like this:

    #If people have experience, they will always perform their jobs well.
    #Obama has no experience
    _____
    #thus Obama will not perform his job well.

The model would then look something like this

&gt;If A, then B

&gt;Not A

&gt;thus Not B

That's a logical fallacy called [""denying the antecedent""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denying_the_antecedent).  Thus your logic, and your comic, is logically invalid, unsound, and unfounded.

X. Shanda drives around a circular track exactly 12 times in 2 hours.  (Duh, forgot velocity and speed aren't the same thing - yet remembered that in other questions, go figure.)

X. If a car hits a tree, the car’s occupants (assume no seat belts or air bags) will be violently thrown forward due to a force created by the car seats.  (I suspected I was getting this one wrong, but it was getting long and I didn't want to think too long about it.)

X. A cloud's mass consists primarily of water vapor. (They ADMIT this is usually taught wrong in science class.)

X. Voltage is the force which pushes electrons through wires. (Again, they admit this is usually taught wrong.  I immediately thought of ""electromotive force."" Oops.)

Basically they act like a big router. In cable Internet they normally own the cables (coaxial cables) that connect you to the Internet also. 

You need to connect to an ISP so that your information, and request for information, can connect to the backbone of the Internet (and go the the right place), and so that the tones on a phone line are understood to be information instead of sound, or so that your cable can do the same thing. Also you change iPv4 to iPv6 addresses at a ISP, for that matter you need one to even be assigned an iP address.

yes it is more complicated and do more than that, and this is a really bad explanation for people who know but this is in laymen terms. Feel free to get into more detail if you want.

"asm","t5_2qhz5","Not such a great article. The tips here might be good for total beginners, but they're likely to cause more harm than good. Example:

&gt; 14: MOVZX. Use MOVZX to avoid partial register stalls. I use MOVZX a lot. A lot of people XOR the full 32-bit register first. But MOVZX does the equivalent thing without having to have an extra XOR instruction. Also you had to do the XOR enough in advance to give it time to complete.

&gt; 18: XOR...  It also has a side benefit of clearing dependencies on the register.


Yeah. The out-of-order engine on modern CPUs actually aliases *XOR reg1, reg1* not to a real XOR operation, but to a register rename; future operations involving *reg1* will use a new rename register which is automatically cleared before use, breaking dependency chains. So you're not going to get a stall on *reg1*. MOVZX is still useful, but not for this reason.

"science","t5_mouw","I find some of the questions on the quiz a little problematic. They word the questions in very plain vernacular, and then want you to take the questions literally to varying degrees. Why not start with the first question:

""Temperature is the same thing as heat."" Well, no, it's not the same thing as heat *energy*. But I still don't know what you want to hear, because the question doesn't say ""heat energy"".  I don't know if you're not just wondering if I realize temperature measures how hot something is in practical terms.

The author needs to realize that by wording his questions a little vaguely, people who don't know the answers still aren't going to know them... instead, the people who do are just going to be a little confused.

I especially like:

""4) Running a ceiling fan in an enclosed room during the summer will slowly raise the room’s temperature (assuming no heat transfer in or out).""

There is no correct answer to this question. On the one hand, if I assume ""no heat transfer in or out"" means the fan is a perfect engine, no entropy, it's not heating the room up... on the other hand, a law of thermodynamics dictates that some energy will be ""wasted"" through conversion to heat, and it's heating the room up. :P","1212370090"

For example, a father having his daughter play with his penis. You likened this to non-sexual play. I would disagree for a few reasons:

1. Our society, despite your credo of changing the cultural mores, has a current set that most of us live by. If the girl grows up having her father touch her, society will tell her she is a victim. She may feel it is normal, but society's perception of the act will negatively colour how she views herself. It will also ruin her relationship with her father. In changing these norms countless children will undergo this hardship. And for what? To strip away taboos that clearly have a functional mandate:

2. Incest is biologically, thus evolutionarily, detrimental. Birth defects from incest/sexual abuse help no one. The taboo has a biological function. I'd scarcely believe anybody could deny this.

3. As adults (or parents) we usher children into adulthood, giving them lessons that will help them along their way. Sex play is part of growing up (I did it, most everyone I know did). Among those who are like-minded or near the same stage of development, it is the ""I choose you, do you choose me?"" game that most of us practice until monogamy or death. It's a good game: you get shot down sometimes but sometimes you luck out. If you're an adult with a child you rarely get shot down. The reason is that children look up to adults and often follow whatever they say. Adults are teachers, parents, firefighters, police, politicians, etc. We hate police who take bribes as their position is to protect the citizenry. We hate politicians who lie because they should be representing our interests. And we hate adults who engage in sexual activities with our kids because they should be looking out for our children's welfare, not their own.

The dating game takes practice and so does sex. Children have sex play for those reasons. They are learning about their future world. Adults have sex for fun or procreation. Having our fun with someone who looks up to us for guidance is, in my estimation, morally wrong. It confuses what, for me, being an adult to a child is.","1212370700"

([Russian Version](http://www.pravda.ru/world/northamerica/usa-canada/22-04-2008/264865-alaska-0))

It's interesting how they chose to present the topic in English versus Russian versions.  

English Title:  ""Alaska Independence Movement""
Russian Title:  ""Residents of Alaska:  We don't count our selves as Americans.""  (Which is only a half truth - we begrudgingly count ourselves as Americans - we're Alaskan first).

The lead in the English version:  ""There are many potential Kosovos in the international community – a great number of these within the United States of America itself . . .""

The lead in the Russian version:  ""Practically every country has it's own Kosovo: territories wanting to secede and gain independence.  There are more than a few of these problematic corners right in the United States . . .""

The changes are subtle, but the Russian version makes it seem as though Alaskans are tired of being subjugated, and that we really are another Kosovo, which most English language readers, I imagine would read as literary embellishment.  The Alaska Independence Movement is real in Alaska, and most Alaskans I know are sympathetic to the movement, as Alaskans are fiercely proud of Alaskan identity, but would never, ever consider secession.  

Slightly off topic - but it has to do with Russian portrayal and perception of the US and the potential ""collapse.""","1212370921"

To be sound, it has to be definitively true, for example ""Socrates is a man"".

It's also deductively invalid because your logic goes something like this:

    #If people have experience, they will always perform their jobs well.
    #Obama has no experience
    _____
    #thus Obama will not perform his job well.

The model would then look something like this

    If A, then B
    Not A
    _____
    thus Not B

That's a logical fallacy called ""[denying the antecedent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denying_the_antecedent)"". Thus your logic, and your comic, is logically invalid, unsound, and unfounded.

[OpenGL SuperBible](http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/books/SuperBible/)

and ""one"" website that  I used was 

http://www.opengl.org/resources/


However, in my estimation, graphics programming in GL is largely unsatisfactory, because you quickly realize you need a complete system i.e. say a 3DS data importer and a more sophisiticated understanding of working with 3D objects ..and to get graphics going with an ""application"" i.e. (my words) the dreaded Win32 API. Supposedly Visual Studio C++ 2005 redistrubatable makes menus and file I/O and viewports etc easy. Also needed to know is how to use DIrectX to do essentially the same stuff so you can ""easily"" access TCP I/O and sound card and input devices. Anyways last advice is to say ""lighting"" in 3D is really not handled on video cards, at least not with OpenGL ""lighting"" all the fast lighting with hundreds of sources etc is done by coding approximations and clever texture adjustments and using ""pipeline"" code that works on a per vertex/texture that is uploaded code TO THE CARD that runs the code directly on the video card.. check out more about GPU programming

"environment","t5_2qh1n","Photovoltaics are still limited by Carnot in that their limiting efficiency is that of a heat engine being operated between the sun at about 6000C and the Earth at about 25C.  Essentially, a flux of photons has an associated [temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body) which will be related to its theoretical black body temperature but modified by being limited to emitting at the available [energy states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics).  
When [semiconductors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor) absorb photons, the distribution of electrons and holes in their energy states can also be given a representative temperature.  When [""hot electrons""](http://www.siliconfareast.com/hotcarriers.htm) relax to the [band gap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_gap) after photon absorption, this energy loss can also be considered as a change in temperature of the electrons.

The city government does not maintain the roads. There is a North Oaks homeowners' association that maintains the homes and parks. What I don't understand is how a totally private entity like North Oaks can legally incorporate as a city. To me the word ""city"" implies some kind of public function. North Oaks used to have a gate at the main entrance, but there was another way in that was ungated. My father got lost once and accidentally entered North Oaks that way. He was stopped by police (it was obvious he was a nonresident -- he was the wrong colour) and escorted out. That's how I learned about this privately-owned city. I just thought of something, though.

Thirdly, to counterpoint, really you're only talking about the decision itself and speaking nothing of the quantification/qualification behind that decision.

For instance, Lorenzo's life may not be the typical one that your or I have led, but it is his life which drove his parents to make the discovery that has led to the successful treatment of thousands of children, saving them from the fate that he had...or a worse one, death. Indeed, it is his life that led to his parents advocating for victims of this disorder and bringing it to the forefront of public attention with the movie that was made.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","To really see why calculus is important, I think you need to look at why it was developed, where it came from. One of the biggest driving forces behind the development of modern mathematics was the study of physics: to truly understand the relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration, you need to know how to differentiate and how to integrate.

Unfortunately, this is a scientific application that doesn't matter much to most people. To be honest, for ""day-to-day"" tasks, I don't think calculus actually *is* that important; it was developed when we really started investigating the natural world, not before. I'm sure there's some examples of day-to-day problems that are easier to understand in terms of calculus, but I doubt there are many important ones.

More important is understanding the place of calculus in the hierarchy of contemporary mathematics. The idea of *operators* acting on functions just like functions acting on variables is a very important one. If you can operate on a function, what's to stop you from operating on an operator? Continue this line of reasoning in the right direction, and you'll start formulating the key ideas of abstract algebra and group theory--all from one little observation!

I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but one classical problem that comes quickly to mind is finding the area under a parabola: say you want to know the area under  f(x) = 1 - x^2 from -1 to +1. This is a pretty trivial calculus problem, but the Greeks could solve it using only algebra, basic trigonometry, and geometry. I don't know if I could solve it that way; using calculus is simply so much easier that I have trouble thinking of alternate methods. This isn't a completely abstract exercise, either; using the answer to this problem, you can construct Simpson's Rule for numerical integration, which is a common low-order technique for numerically attacking nasty integration problems... which come up reasonably often in the sciences, though not so much in day-to-day life.

I hope this response has helped you a little bit.","1212372413"

So not only did you deceive your potential buyers, but then you released a rushed and buggy game.

Also, the game is nothing like the original (well except for the plot which is very similar, as is the island itself....) as you can not go anywhere and do anything. Also the enemies all seem to take multiple direct hits to die yet in your superior armor and weaponry, you can die in 3 shots... I'd take their body armor over the suit any day for protection.

I played the demo, thought it was fun but never bothered to buy the game, and I even built a gaming system (C2D 3ghz, 8800gts 640, 2gb ram) to play games like it. I'm looking forward to Farcry 2 much more as it seems to have the dynamic world feeling that Crysis failed to deliver.

The 'alternative' is to look at people with autism as people in their own right, who may have a different way of viewing their world, and experience difficulties relating to this. Google 'central coherence' and autism. This is only one example of an area where further research can help feed into interventions which help shape the environment where people with autism experience less distress and provide them with greater opportunities for education and learning.

If there is evidence that there is immune components to autism, by all means it should be researched. Although the research you cite does not indicate that immune factors are causative factors in ASD.And even if that could be proved I really don't see it leading into any biomedical cures for autism. Not this century anyway.Unless there is some sort of intervention that jumpstarts biomedical intervention into neurological/developmental/psychiatric disability there is not going to be any sort of biomedical 'cure' for Autism.

In an interest economy money is moved from those who have less to those who have more and thereby assets are concentrated in the hands of the few.

"reddit.com","t5_6","My workplace has ""incidental use"" allowances in their IT policy.  This means that while it's officially not acceptable to use their computers and network for personal endeavors while you're being paid to work, it's acceptable to use them for personal reasons in your spare time (i.e. lunch break, after work hours).  Since most of us are salaried, this is a very loosely defined rule, and essentially means, ""Yes, you can use our computers to check your own email or look up directions to a restaurant you're going to after work.""

There is the expectation that, as a salaried employee, you will do the work you're expected to do.  If you spend 5 minutes here and there checking your email or reading the news, that's your business.

However, as sn0re pointed out, sexual harassment laws and legal precedents in the U.S. have created an incentive for employers to respond harshly to any sexual comment, behavior, or other incident, in the interest of demonstrating their ""commitment"" to a sexually non-hostile workplace for future lawsuits.

sorry dude, but even if you are sociologically substandard, that's life. i don't mean to be harsh, but if you *are* considerably low on the totem pole in terms of sociological standing (looks, personality, etc) then being overly pensive on those things will only bring you depression. The last thing that someone who is sociologically ""lower"" or insecure needs is to think that in terms of ""if this happens, all the chicks would dig me"", like you say you do here.

Because the people who throw the ceremoy decide to make the rules about who particpates.

Example: Catholics can't get married in a Synagogue. It's not that Catholics are bad people, its just that they're not Jews so they don't get to make the rules about who gets married in the Synagogue.

---

Now under my idea... civil ceremony is the only thing the state recognizes: for heteros, for gays, for everyone. Then by defintion, it has to be recognized through out all states.

Now as for it being recognized in other countries... you'll have to complain to those countries. 

Example: Even if we get gay marriage in America and call it 'marriage', Saudia Arabia is not going to recognize that marriage. Similiarly, calling it a union between a heterosexual couple a civil union doesn't mean that England won't recognize it.","1212372965"

If you want to write a program that takes in someone's name and then spits out ""[name] has a small penis"" like all my friends did in my freshmen year programming class, you'll want to pick up a nice scripting language like Python, Groovy, or Ruby.

Black's Law Dictionary: 

**| entitlement.** An absolute right to a (usu. monetary) benefit, such as social security, granted immediately upon meeting a legal requirement.

As there are 284 entries for the term ""right"": I'll go with #158: 

**|right, n.** 1. That which is proper under law, morality, or ethics &lt;know right from wrong&gt;. 2. Something that is due to a person by just claim, legal guarantee, or moral principle &lt;the right of liberty&gt;. 3. A power, privilege, or immunity secured to a person by law &lt;the right to dispose of one's estate&gt;. 4. A legally enforceable claim that another will do or will not do a given act; a recognized and protected interest the violation of which is a wrong &lt;a breach of duty that infringes one's right&gt;. 5. (often pl.) The interest, claim, or ownership that one has in tangible or intangible property &lt;a debtor's rights in collateral&gt; &lt;publishing rights&gt;. 6. The privilege of corporate shareholders to purchase newly issued securities in amounts proportionate to their holdings. 7. The negotiable certificate granting such a privilege to a corporate shareholder. 

Also relevant:

**| civil liberty.** (usu. pl.) Freedom from undue governmental interference or restraint. • This term usu. refers to freedom of speech or religion. In American law, early civil liberties were promulgated in the Lawes and Libertyes of Massachusetts (1648) and the Bill of Rights (1791). **-- Also termed civil right.**

In those states, each precinct holds a caucus - basically a big meeting of a whole bunch of supporters.  Those supporters basically elect a representative slate of delegates from that precinct to county conventions.

So, for example, let's say in the Clintontown precinct, they were allowed to select a slate of ten delegates, but 350 people showed up at the caucus.  Effectively, each of the delegates on that slate represents 35 people.  This ratio is arbitrary and depends on the turnout at a precinct and the delegates that precinct can nominate, but the ratio is almost always better than 10:1.

The reported totals from those states are of the slated delegate totals from all precincts, NOT the number of votes actually cast.

You mean being unconsciously manipulated by sex appeal?  I doubt that there are many males -- scratch that, many people -- who aren't.  There's a reason that advertisements have attractive people, that movies will drastically diverge from a sane plot in the name of sticking sex appeal in, or that much of the content in current video games exists.  There's a reason that dancing often involves thigh movement -- or even in more genteel forms, at least motion of the human body.  You could find it in the paintings of the Renaissance artists or the sculpture of David.  Sex is and always has been an influential way to affect the human mind.

I would guess that most, if not all, of us are not completely capable of fully understanding of perceiving the full impact that sexual appeal has on our actions.  I remember one afternoon that I was talking to a designer friend.  He started pointing out all the subtle ways in which competent designers integrate particular shapes into their work that influence the mind.  Curves from a body, elements that look like faces, and so forth.

It might be ""creepy"" that people can be unconsciously influenced by sexual appeal or other cues, but it's also pretty much part of being human.","1212373453"

"business","t5_2qgzg","Yes the *most* socialist states that exist today are in poverty... Well actually, no they are not. Take a look at China. While they are undergoing capitalist reforms, they still have large elements of communism in them. The percentage of the population below the [poverty line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_threshold) is 8%, compared to the 12% found in the US (according to the CIA factbook)... hmm... that means that in 'communist' China, 4% more of the total population has enough money to afford the basic needs of life, than in the US - an obviously more capitalistic state.

I agree with Hayek that purely socialist economies have the tendency to not work particularly well in the long run. What seems to work the best though are the so-called 'mixed economies.' These are still socialism, though not in the pure sense.

Yet, in the *most* capitalistic societies today, the average person does not do as well as those societies that combine principles of both. This is my personal view on the matter.

In conclusion, while I agree that pure socialism doesn't work very well, under the type of socialism found in the world today, (ie, the type of socialism that is relevent), the average  person tends to do better than in the more capitalist systems.

As an aside though, I think based on the stats and history I've looked up for the sake of this needlessly large discussion, that maybe Friedman was not entirely right. There definitely seems to be more going on to cause poverty in the USSR and such, than simply flaws inherent to the socialist economic system. ","1212373823"

"asm","t5_2qhz5","The reason you want your code small isn't really L1 cache, or the ""bus being 32 bits wide""; the issue is the decoding stage of the pipeline. It pulls in blocks of fixed size, matches up the x86 instructions, and issues uops to the rest of the pipeline (the execution units). By going from a 6-byte or 5-byte instruction to a 3-byte one, you can get more instructions into the decode fetch window; since these are simple instructions, the decoder ought to issue them straightaway, and they'll execute and retire quickly.

For more complicated instructions (especially microcoded ones), instruction length is not an issue. But for simple instructions on, say, a Core 2 Duo (which can issue up to 4 instructions per clock from its decode stage), you really want your simple instructions to be as short as possible.

This ties in to what IMO is the biggest weakness of modern x86: variable instruction length screws up the decoder horribly, and makes decode fetching especially far more complex than it could be. If I were designing a new ISA, it would probably look a lot like x86 -- but with fixed length instructions!","1212374229"

OK, a related question.  I assume with almost everyone having access to a computer (ubiquitous computation?) it's affected how and why calculus is used (is there any area of math where that isn't the case?) - is that true?

Now if someone walked behind me and SAW a naked woman on the screen, that would be bad.  I could get insta-sued for sexual harassment.

If you're talking about Wilson, he wasn't trying to influence policy either. He was sent to Niger, found the story he was sent to investigate was bogus. He advised his bosses there was nothing to it.

When he heard Bush reference it in the State of the Union, he assumed it had been confirmed by other sources--when he found that wasn't true, he tried to engage the white house privately. When they blew him off, he felt it was important to tell what he had seen.

Outing his wife and ending her career was political payback... Rove's ""she's fair game"" comment. It was also a warning shot to any other whistle blowers.

The investigation into who leaked her name was insisted upon by the CIA--headed by George Tenet, the guy George Bush gave a medal of freedom to.

The prosecution by Patrick Fitzgerald--a republican and republican appointee, who had a history of prosecuting people in both parties.

The judge in the case, another republican appointee.

Fitzgerald's boss, John Ashcroft, working for the Bush DOJ.

Painting this is as some kind of stage-managed show trial run by the Democrats is patently absurd.

The problem is more subtle, and has to do with thermodynamics, not energy alone.

The basic effect is that an internal combustion engine depends on compressing (doing work on) a relatively cool gas, igniting it to create a higher pressure and higher temperature, allowing that to expand and push against the piston to do work, and repeating that cycle.

There are thermodynamic limits to the efficiency of such a cycle; the absolute limit is the ""Carnot efficiency"", which depends on the highest temperature available (namely, the ignited fuel mixture) and the lowest temperature available (namely, the engine coolant). ","1212374835"

What they are trying to get at in the question is that different things at the same temperature might give different sensations of hot or cold, and so you can't use touch to measure absolute temperature.  The metal cup will feel colder than the styrofoam cup at the same temperature.

However, touch is pretty good for detecting relative temperatures of similar materials, or of the same material over time.  So, in some sense touch does measure temperature--it is just using a different scale for different substances.

I guess what it really comes down to is what does it mean for something to be a ""measure"" of something?  Vary the temperature of an item, and what we feel when we touch it will vary.  I'd say that means what we feel is a measure of the temperature.  It isn't a very good measure, but it IS a measure.","1212374866"

I went through about 2 cords last winter with my soap stone woodstove acting as primary heat.

I guess if you wanted to get super fancy, you could run some copper pipe through a composting pile, and then run some water through that for radiant heating...but i see quite a few problems. Mainly, composting mostly shuts down in the winter, so ...bye bye heat. Secondly, you want to leave the heat IN the pile, so it you know, composts :) If you cool the pile off my running cold water through it, you kill or slow the bacteria down...negative feedback loop there. And lastly, you gotta add to and move the pile around and such, which would be very difficult with a pipe in there.

I say, get the wet trash system (baby Genie works excellent, its made for dirty diapers, so its already good at trapping nasty stuff), get a woodstove (a real one, soapstone, and large), and start to manage your land.

I'd rather reroll the dice than have a guaranteed Holocaust.

&gt;I doubt that censoring Mein Kampf would change much, since *most people didn't read it*.

[Are you sure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_kampf#Popularity)?

My understanding of Germany before Adolf Hitler is this: People were highly dissatisfied because they had lost World War I, and they were looking for some sort of national pride to latch onto.  Adolf Hitler, a racist, jingoist lunatic, could not possibly have come at a worse time.  This is based on my public school education; feel free to correct it if you think your knowledge is superior.

If it's a slippery slope you're worried about, then say so.  Just tell me that you think the expected societal cost of effectively censoring Mein Kampf would have been greater than the human cost of [seven million lives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_victims).

* * * * *

EDIT: I had another thought.  I realized that one way you could convince me that all censorship was evil would be to point out the uncertainty of any given lunatic gaining control.  In this case, censorship would only be truly useful when a country's regime was weak, which would be precisely when it was most difficult to execute effectively.

Still, I hope I've made you think about my main point: We shouldn't be making decisions based on axioms like ""no government censorship, ever"".  I would rather reformulate that to ""censorship is only allowed in the rather extreme and highly unlikely case described below.""  That way, it becomes less of a dogmatic struggle and more of a high-minded exchange of ideas.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;It's really not.

 It is. I know of the [Rutherford model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_model) and its shortcomings, (I actually have a degree in Physics). 

 The point is that when you talk to a lay person, you can simplify it to say that there's a nucleus, and there's electrons orbiting around. And that proportions between the actual distances and the size of the particles is huge, and quite similar to the solar system.

 The whole image is a simplistic model of the hydrogen atom, which quite often can be sufficient to explain many phenomena - once again - to a lay person; for example that electrons can transition between ""higher"" and ""lower"" orbits thus emitting or absorbing photons. Explaining quantum amplitudes to describe this process is too much information for lay people to assimilate immediately. You can always preface your explanation by stating that ""it's a simplified model but..."".

 Any self respecting student of physics knows that the Rutherford model has been supplanted by increasingly accurate and precise models which also happen not to pose any of the EM radiation problems either. 

 In any case, like I said originally, I wasn't sure at what level of knowledge they were quizzing. E.g. knowledge that atoms exist and are like so as opposed to thinking that things are made of elementals like Earth Wind and Fire.

"technology","t5_2qh16","Yes, the zero cost issue has been an interesting thing to watch. If you can predict when things arc down to costing nothing you can make wise investment. Information storage for instance, is rapidly approaching zero cost.

The most prevalent example of this is the fact that it used to cost a lot of money to produce, record, and most importantly transmit, audio recording. You needed a bunch of radio stations or a bunch of recording factories. Now you could do with just a few dollars investment in a microphone. This is my example of non capitalism too by the way.

Record companies exist to provide people with access to music on demand. Unfortunately for them they are no longer needed.

Also, fusion is not inherently any more efficient than the conventional fuels at generating electricity, because coal/gas/nuclear/fusion/etc all use or would use heat to produce steam, which turns a turbine which turns a generator.  So, the limiting factor is the temperature of the steam, not the temperature of the fuel, and in turn, the limiting factor is creating turbines and pumps that can handle increasingly hot steam without excessive corrosion/wear/etc.

So instead of net neutrality, a law mandating that existing speeds may not be hindered for Tier 2 service would be acceptable...to encourage companies to build a better, faster Tier 1 service that may make them a few bucks.

in my point of view accusing these people of being involved in the attacks is no different then the way that anti semitic holocaust deniers paint concentration camp survivors as liars and ""proof"" that the holocaust didnt happen precisely because they have spent decades trying to move on and forget what happened and now cant recall the names of every nazi soldier they came across or every fellow prisoner they knew who was murdered.","1212376007"

Al qaeda doesn't actually exist- it's a bland term used by the CIA to represent coordinated terrorist attack as a reprisal against USA foreign policy.
Blowback just wasn't sexy enough to tell the housewives- osama the boogey man's al qaeda is much better propaganda.

For instance- in some of the videos you see osama walking around with his henchmen- those guys were just locals handed some guns and hired for the day's shooting of the video.

The whole idea that al qaeda exists is something we are starting to *make real* by our continual assault on the muslim world- they will have no other option *BUT* to organize and finally become the beast we have been claiming to fight all along.
This is a trick the USA learned from the Israelis- (which isn't that surprising since Washington is currently under occupation of an Israeli spy ring that is running our foreign and domestic security policies. Chertoff, Liebermann, to name just a couple of the *overt* operators- AIPAC is worth a peek too)- You opress the people in their region-
keep telling people that they are terrorists, and leave them with no other option other than to be that terrorist in order to resist your onslaught-back them into a corner- and then.. you proved they exist and the onslaught was justified... right?

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I haven't.  I would be willing to learn how you think the concept would work.  My difficulties with it are in the discussion below; though I again make no claim to being an expert.

The U.S. was able to switch from the gold standard to a fiat currency through two very important legal maneuvers: 

(1) Using the supremacy clause to make the legally significant statement ""This note is legal tender for all debts public and private."" applicable in every court in the land.  The net effect of this was to insure that one loses the right to bring a claim in court if another party offers a legal currency for a debt or satisfaction of other claim. (Caveat: I'm a bit fuzzy whether this was Congress's doing or the  states' adoption of the U.C.C. that insured this result.)  A hypothetical ""Ted's Currency"" would depend on market adoption.  I think that this is why all of our other value transfer mechanisms (stocks, bonds, commodity futures, etc...) are ultimately valued in dollars or other fiat currencies.

(2) Making the fiat currency a valid method of payment for ones taxes, which is how President Lincoln got the greenback into circulation in the first place. Assuming U.S. citizenship for this example; If the government decides to tax your earning of ""Ted's Dollars"" and that's the only currency you have, then you better hope the exchange rate into U.S. dollars is good, because you'll be ponying up in a currency acceptable to the IRS at the end of the day.  Something about being able to keep government goons off of your ass with a currency that adds to its utility and attractiveness. ","1212376330"
"business","t5_2qgzg","Ok, then explain what the hell this is if it's not interest (because there's ""aftersavings""):

&gt;JAK banking is made possible by saving points system: members accumulate saving points during saving periods, they use saving points asking for a loan. The main idea is that one is allowed to take a loan for himself in the same measure he allows other people to have loans, saving into his account. For this reason - asking for a loan - earned saving points must be equal to spent saving points, in order to keep system sustainability. If a member is borrowing more saving points than he has, he is obliged to continue accumulating so-called ""aftersavings"" during repayment period. ""Aftersavings"" are a fixed quota of money that one has to save after his loan was given, in order to continue earning saving points. By this way, at the end of his repayment period, earned saving points will be equal to spent saving points, and at that time he will be able to have back all his aftersavings.","1212376330"

What bothers me is that the same people here who would say that BPA , or hormones in cows (milk), or pthalates, or aspartame is dangerous EVEN THOUGH the longstanding science states otherwise... all side with Global Warming.  

What bugs me is that everyone but the most right wing idiots will be inclined to listen to something claiming to hurt the environment.  We all want to save the environment.  Yet those same people praising Gore get upset if any suggestions are made that would seriously retard our way of life.

Most people here don't trust the media, and don't trust politicians.  Yet they trust the media when they push GW, and they trust politicians when they push GW.  

It also bothers me that the last time climate change was an issue was in the 70s - when we were also having an energy crisis.

And doesn't anyone wonder why no policians are talking about Peak Oil?  Or the fact that Mexico, who supplies 14% of US oil, will be importing oil within the next decade?

E.coli has been around for more than 3 days, yet the Earth is not one great big bacterial mass.  Why Not?  Because, most of Earth is not a viable habitat for E.coli!  Like E.coli, all other lifeforms, even FTL using aliens, have specific habitat requirements.

i see people like you everyday, by the hundreds, living lives of quiet resignation, getting ridden, like a pony gets ridden by a professional broncobuster, ridden by their demeaning boss, their shrew wife or girlfriend, their abusive religion and their fascist government. and through it all, you dare not utter one discouraging word for you're too chickenshit to do anything but kiss their asses. i'm going to beat you like a dog, just the way that all the people in your life treat you, like the sniveling gutless coward that you are. they say, ""jump,"" and you say, ""how high."" they say, ""suck,"" and you say you'll suck right now. you kiss gawd's ass cos that all you're good for, but i kick gawd's ass and he kisses MY ass, cos that's all he's good for.

all the distaste you've expressed at my posts, it's just more of the same you're getting in every other part of your life... yeah, roll it around on your tongue for a while, you know what it is... it's the flavor of getting pissed on. and you love it so much that you'll always keep coming back for more... and i even know why you keep coming back for more... cos the abuse validates your existence and if it wasn't for that abuse, no one would even acknowledge you, and that would be worse than death. so you hold the hand that holds you down because that way, at least you feel like someone wants you around. so you're going to keep coming back, sucking my dick, just like you suck jesus' dick, cos sucking dick is all you know.

I never mentioned anything about public utilities or private utilities - I have an opinion about those but thats not the issue. The existence of a public utility is not the same as treating water as a human right. Most cities have a publicly owned transit system, and yet transit is not a human right. Similarly, the city will have no qualms in shutting down your water when you don't pay your bill - would that be a violation of your human rights if water access is deemed to be a human right? 

Anyway, at the very least this should show you that public ownership of something doesn't necessarily imply a 'human right' for that thing. Which in turn should show you that although you might be able to read, your comprehension skills are lacking.

You're arguing and trying to refute points I never even made.

&gt;In life and death situations, there's no such thing as arithmetic or art or calculus either. So fucking what..

The original poster made the point that rights don't exist when people are starving, therefore  we need a human right to water. But I made the implicit point that this is a contradiction. I argued that a right to water, is as academic as the right to property and the right to life.","1212377253"

MPG is only really interesting because of friction, both with the ground and with the air. Without those things, once you start going, you keep going (""inertia""), and MPG ceases to have any meaning.

It really doesn't take that much work to research it yourself (I guess you don't mind feeding into the stereotype that Americans are ignorant and lazy - sorry, I like making fun fo the US as much as the next person too :P). Just search for 'Canada' in [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada).

We joined WWII before you guys did, independently from Britain, and fought in numerous key battles.

We've been a leader in promoting world peace for ages. 

*Canada has played a leading role in UN peacekeeping efforts. During the Suez Crisis of 1956, Lester B. Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force.[42] Canada has since served in 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989*

Seriously, do your own research if you're curious - or someone else on Reddit will surely list some other things too :P

I'm pretty sure that Canada is comparable with, or surmounts the US in terms of progress, innovation, and economy (right now anyways). Though this is honestly partially because the US isn't exactly a hotbed for innovation or creativity, or successful endeavors (re: Iraq) anymore. Eastern Asia is where that shit is at.

More distant, in the RNC2004 the police there grabbed random people, who were peacefully protesting, and threw them face first into the pavement.

People had no concept of a market economy, they didn't even know what to do with one when the got it after the collapse.  Entire cities were built in places that made no sense except to the central planners and when it all came apart, those cities became ghost towns or people were stranded in far-flung outposts and had no food, fuel, or hope.  People did not just ""stay put"" after the collapse of the USSR, huge changes too place there.

These ""what if"" scenarios are incredibly misleading.  The US may very well be in trouble, but we have an enormous capacity for absorbing big problems.  We have enormous luxuries we can set aside if it comes to austerity.  The Russians had nothing and began from less than nothing after the collapse there because they first had to learn what all the inefficiencies were and state-owned industry quickly fell into hte hands of crooks, which made everything worse.  The US is already in the hands of crooks in many places, so maybe the same outcome would prevail, I don't know.

Oh, and we have millions upon millions of weapons in the hands of private individuals.  And while that may sound like a nightmare scenario, it is actually something that will maintain civil behavior if there is a breakdown of authority.

This is a stupid idea.

Humans created the concept of property rights.  If they don't serve the values we are trying to pursue, then they should be revised.

Property rights are great, they do a lot of good - but ultimately they leave some people out in the cold and that sucks.  A person can't be much of a human if they are tired from working 12 hour days, or lack access to good education, or can't get enough to eat, or don't have time to develop the intellectual skills to participate in government.  All of these things are true of some people right now.

The solution may not be to take your money - there are certainly excellent reasons to let markets solve many of these problems.  But when the market fails, humans should have the will to go beyond it, to punish people who are heartless, to take their property, if need be, to redistribute wealth, if it will solve the problem.

If you don't see this, then, in my opinion, you are not much of a human being.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Humans are able to leverage their effort through mechanized labor, but labor is still the basis of converting raw materials into consumable goods &amp; getting those goods distributed to those that lack them.  

Where did you get your definition of capital?  I'm curious, your post seems well thought out and I'm too lazy to actually say you're mistaken.  I will pick nits by saying it seems more like the definition of ""value"" which, in my mind, can either be consumed or used as leverage for creating even more value; the distinction between ""capital"" and ""value"" being that capital is value that has been alloted to creating/leveraging the creation of more value - as opposed to being consumed.  

In the human terms the portion of value that is in labor food, clothing, and shelter are partially consumed when used in leisure and transformed into capital when used to earn a wage or for maintenance.  

This, in my guess-stimation, is why many of the old-time religious systems placed sloth high on the list of vices; back then when most of human labor was needed to create enough value for human survival, it makes sense that ""hard work"" was a societal imperative. (Incidentally, I also think that the need for an capital investment of time in rest as maintenance was recognized, hence many religions having sabbath's where one is supposed to go easy on the heavy lifting)  Now that we have technology to leverage human labor, we should either work less or get those that are still outside of the system able plugged into the system so they can be productive as well.

If one isn't contributing to the system of production, then they are a drain on it.  Can the system afford some drain?  Yes.  Should we subsidize that behavior into future generations?  No.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Why does fact checking go out the window for stuff like this? A modicum of research into actual Mithraism would disprove most of these points.

Point 8, for example: Mithra was born from the ground itself. Not a virgin mother. But hey, pictures of this relic would be interesting to see.

Point 9 is blatantly false, and I'd like to see a serious link to any proper Mithraic scholar claiming as such.

Points 1 and 5 gets the basics of Persian beliefs very wrong. Mithra was not the highest ranked god the Persians. And he got further demoted to yazata when Zoroastrianism came along - and it was after Zoroastrianism that the Mithraic mystery cults of Rome flourished.
Point 5 calls Ahriman 'good'. He's always been a demon in Persian mythology.

Point 2 is based on a misinterpretation of a piece of Mithraic art incorporating the zodiac. Mithra of Persia had one companion, Mithra of Rome had two.

etc. etc.

The common error all these supposed ""articles"" make is ignoring the one place that Christianity very much derived from Mithraism - the art. Most early Christian art has appropriated the symbols of Mithraic art. Mithra slaying the bull became Samson slaying the lion, Mithra removing an arrow from a rock becomes Moses drawing water from a rock etc. ","1212379748"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;Why must it require state control? Why can't the public simply bring suit against the polluter?

For three reasons: 1) The public space requires a governing body to determine what is and is not public space. Forested areas and other highly productive areas can be very good arable land once cleared, but doing so incrementally damages the ecosystem. No one person is responsible for the whole of the damage, but as a whole society is. Wetlands are an unfortunate example of something that should have been defined as public space but was not originally. So, though private landholders have claim to these areas, they are restricted from building on them because doing so would do incremental damage to the ecosystem.

Which brings me to two, which further emphasizes incremental damage. 2) Because damage is often small and unnoticeable it can be easily hidden from view. It becomes very difficult to lay blame on any one individual or group for doing so. People who are not blatantly dumping poisons into water can still be causing damage, and you may not notice it until hundreds are responsible for the ultimate destruction.

Which brings me to 3)If damage is not restricted and prevented from happening *it is already done* even if you find the culprit. You can't bring back species that have gone extinct nor can your clean toxic water nor get back clear cut trees for habitat. The world becomes slowly less biodiverse, until small interdependencies you did not know existed start killing off things humans truly depend on.

My government provides me with many things that sustain my life.  The police are required to protect my life within reason and according to resources.  Fire fighters will pull me from a burning building, and EMS is required to provide me care whether or not I can pay for it.  These are things that my government (and pretty much every government) has interpreted as falling under the inalienable right to life.   Water is even *less* of a stretch than these things. 

&gt;but it does not entitle you to water or food. those things are property (a different right)

Food and water are very different rights than the right to property.  You don't need property to live.

You admit life is a right.  Then you go on to describe looser interpretations of ""rights"" than I've ever heard any civilization employ.  You seem to be painting a scenario where the government is not only unconcerned with providing basic necessities of life, but also one where someone is allowed to kill and steal  for their needs.

Orlov admits right off the bat that he is not an expert (and the fact he called the heavily regulated and subsidized energy and health care policies of the US ""free market"", proves that he is, at the very least, certainly not an economist), but against my original prejudices, he is spot on in his main thesis.

Basically, though Orlov does not say it explicitly, the communists were better prepared for the collapse of the Soviet Union, because the communism, that was meant to provide for all of there earthly needs, was so hopelessly inefficient and unproductive, that by the time of the collapse, the people were already largely self-sufficient.

The biggest problem with my question above is that, since I (wrongly?) interpreted the tone of Orlov's argument as a socialist vs. capitalist question, I equated the American economy to a free market economy, a move that I have jumped other people's shit for many times. Comparatively, the US is *more* capitalist than USSR, however, the fact is, we have a *mixed* economy that is becoming more and more socialized all the time. I correctly pointed out that our collapse, in all likelihood, just as with the Soviets, will be directly caused by our wasteful, inefficient socialist policies. Orlov was more correct than he probably realized when he said:
&gt;Because government bureaucracies tend to be slow to act, they collapse more slowly.

I would argue that the Communist bureaucracies were, like Social Security and Medicare, collapsing from the very moment they were conceived. But, in the Soviet Union, since there was no private sector to speak of and the Communists were in charge of providing for *every* need of their citizens (not just health care and retirement), the Soviet people learned early and often, the hard way, that they had to be able to provide for themselves to survive.

So it was this learned behavior, along with an infrastructure built on a marked lack of overall economic prosperity, that was actually what saved the people of the former Soviet Union from an even more disastrous collapse. In other words, it was their years of living with a weak economy and low standard of living that saved them when the economy finally tanked.

In America, our historically robust private sector has provided us a very high standard of living and has allowed us to, for example, own our own cars, live away from major cities, and buy essentials, like food, from retail stores. When faced with a Soviet-style economic meltdown, however, all of these positives become sharp negatives, as the economy we depend on is no longer capable of providing us with gasoline for our cars to get us from our homes to our jobs and grocery stores (which will be empty because we can no longer ship products in our diesel trucks).

This doesn't mean that the communist system is in any way superior. Sure, its flaws can mitigate the effects of its own eventual collapse, but that doesn't change the fact that it is both fundamentally flawed and doomed to catastrophic failure.

Capitalism, on the other hand, is what has single-handedly created the high standard of living in every industrialized nation on the planet. Even those Western countries like Norway and Sweden, who are heavily socialized, depend entirely on their highly productive *capitalist* private sectors to fund their socialism. The simple, undeniable truth is that all government socialism is inherently inefficient and unproductive and must leach off of capitalism to survive.

If the US was, in fact, truly a capitalist nation, we would not even be worrying about an Soviet-style economic collapse, because there is absolutely no model for a Soviet-style collapse of a free market system. We, here in the US, live the capitalist lifestyle, but in reality we are very much socialized in a great many aspects of the economy.

What this supposed ""best of both worlds"" approach has given us, in the end, is a clear path to a Soviet-style collapse with none of the mitigating factors that Orlov points out in his presentation. As Orlov puts it, in closing:
&gt;[Leading up to the economic collapse, any] behavior that might result in continued economic growth and prosperity is counterproductive: the higher you jump, the harder you land.","1212380283"

I think this is the proper role of banks and I sure wish I could find one that would do that for me today, because having as much silver and other precious metals around the house as I do makes me nervous. Banks do NOT insure the content of safe deposit boxes. If the content of your safe deposit box is missing when you come to retrieve it, the bank is not liable. What I would like to see is more bonded ""warehouses"" with high security that *do* guarantee their customers deposits of precious metals or whatever they want to store through some form of insurance. 

I have nothing against banks making a profit as long as they do it legitimately without engaging in fraud. It wasn't until they were able to bribe and blackmail congress into enacting the fractional reserve system which allows banks to loan money they do not have to others and charge interest on it that banks really began raking in the dough and engaging in what I think is de-facto fraud (ie; banks not only loan out other people's money, but they're allowed to create money by loaning out nine dollars for every dollar of someone else's money that is on deposit with the bank). This kind of fraud would cause you or me to end up in prison.

"reddit.com","t5_6","This is link to a google translation of the article that was originally written in portuguese. I didn't want to plagiarize it by rewriting and reposting on a blog or something, but will provide a manual translation here (hopefully it will be more intelligible):

&gt;According to [this](http://ultimahora.publico.clix.pt/noticia.aspx?id=1330336) article from the Público (note to non-portuguese redditors: this a portuguese newspaper), in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs all the diplomats are shocked with the fact that they'll all be using an address @foreignministry.pt.

&gt;What's absolutely surreal is to realize that the **official** addresses of the portuguese diplomats are stored in yahoo.fr, wannadoo.fr, tin.it, and free.fr. Meaning, **the email messages of the portuguese diplomats are stored in 3rd parties' servers, including companies that don't offer any guarantees of confidentiality, that don't even abide by the Portuguese Law**. Let me explain that again: the messages of the portuguese diplomats are not in secure servers, protected by a security policy defined by the Portuguese State, without access by foreign companies.

&gt;All it should take is a security flaw (like what happened with **gmail**, for instance) on one of those servers so that the diplomats' emails are disclosed. And the Portuguese State won't be able to do anything to minimize the impact of that flaw.

&gt;I don't have my mail in free servers (portuguese or foreign) because I don't trust in confidentiality, integrity or availability of the same. But the portuguese diplomats do.

&gt;I think there are much bigger problems than to discuss if the address is @foreignministry.pt or @mne.gov.pt","1212380891"

So he's advocating for a Parliamentary system of government?  With some technobabble about cryptographic locks?

This business about shares is supposed to create a measurement of success?

Edit: I understand the article now. It's absolute nonsense.

&gt; This design requires a substantial number of reasonably cogent controllers, whose collective opinion is likely to be trustworthy, and who share a single concept of responsibility.

Umm... this is impossible.  But oh wait!

&gt; Actually, there's one way to do it. We can define responsibility in financial terms. If we think of California as a profitable corporation, a capital asset whose purpose is to maximize its production of cash, we have a definition of responsibility which is not only precise and unambiguous, but indeed quantitative.

The purpose of government isn't to produce wealth. Nor is it ""customer service."" 

What the hell is wrong with this guy? What would this corporation sell? Government services? How do you quantify something like protecting civil rights? There are some fundamental pieces missing here. As it is, it defies understanding.

Train:

Both the P's (change in momentum) are equal. P = P.

Just in the same way, the force the train exerts on the bug is the same the bug exerts on the train. The force is the same, but the effect is different. The train's mass is a hell of a lot more than the bug.

&gt; Think about this for a minute. Steve is responsible to his controllers, who evaluate his performance based on his stewardship of one asset: California. The value of California is the sum of the value of its shares. If one goes up or down, so does the other.

&gt; Which is worth more? California, or California infested by Jew-eating crocodiles? Which can be made to produce more revenue? The former, clearly. Jews pay taxes. Crocodile dung doesn't. And from the perspective of either Steve or the Jews, what is the difference between crocodiles and stormtroopers? At least the former will work for free.

The AK-47 fires a much smaller, weaker cartridge that will push a smaller 122 grain bullet at just over 2300 fps. The 7.62x39 cartridge is actually ballistically inferior to the jolly old .30-30.

Level III and IV plates can stop multiple M80 ball hits. Level IV is rated to stop at least one .30-06 M2AP round, and it can usually stop one of the more modern .308/7.62 NATO armor piercing loads such as M61, M993, etc given sufficient standoff distance.

Though they do save lives and are better than nothing, I'd never bet my life on SAPI plates unless I absolutely had to.

Hon. Peter Van Loan (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons and Minister for Democratic Reform, CPC): 

""Mr. Speaker, the view of this government is that drug addiction, heroin addiction, is very harmful to people's lives and the way we help people with those kinds of addictions is by helping them to get off of those addictions.

The most important harm reduction measure is to get people off drugs. That is why we have incorporated harm reduction into our new anti-drug strategy. It is two-thirds prevention and treatment and one-third enforcement. That is the way that we think we can help people.

Stop fucking whining about reddit turning into digg when you got here after the transition started, like I did. 

I've never followed digg, and I like the fact that reddit occasionally rises above a high school discursive level to actually show some insight and intelligence, but seriously - it's the fucking NSFW reddit, what do you expect? 

For better or worse, the subreddits are a democracy. What people want to see gets upmodded, what people don't want to see gets downmodded. If you're seeing porn rise high in the NSFW subreddit, it's because people want to see porn in the NSFW subreddit. Instead of telling them to go to a porn subreddit, maybe you should start a NSFW-but-not-porn subreddit? As Gandhi said, ""be the change you want to see in your subreddit nomenclature.""

I'll admit I'm being a bit of a prick, and I empathize with your position - I've fought the same fight many times with trying to get politics posts into the politics subreddit. In this case, however, I think people trying to get porn out of the *NSFW* subreddit are splitting hairs.","1212381323"

I was originally refuting this comment by oimeetsgrrl:

I claim that if feminism was genuinely concerned about equal rights (including equal rights for men) then feminism *would have* fought against anti-male bias in our society and in the courts, and those men would not be in jail. Instead, feminists have *encouraged* the kind of skewed view of responsibility and sexuality which has resulted in the laws and atmosphere which put those two men in jail. 

In other words, I argue that those men being in jail is *evidence* that feminism is not for equality. Feminism is for *women's rights*: equal privilege but unequal responsibility.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Actually, it's experience and knowledge.

Here on this anonymous board you admit to an attraction to youth. You are not attracted to the concept of finding your life partner or that perfect someone to build a perfect existence with. The ideal qualities you first think of have little to do with the person's personality, intellect, desire to love or please you, career, life's goals or aspirations, but of that person's physical youth and sexual qualities. Transient qualities. The person you desire is a human in it's larval stage. In it's juvenile stage. A temporary stage it will grow through and out of to the adult stage. Yes. It is true that humans in the juvenile stage are still sexual beings and yes, they have been known to sexually experiment at times with one another. But I will tell you one thing that happens when an adult human jumps into the mix and becomes involved with a sexulized juvenile human. The larval human is still not fully formed and that growth process will not simply stop at being involved with this one adult. This youngster continues to grow and mature and realizes she is growing intellectually beyond her 'mentor'. There is rarely a prospect for a future in such relationships. It is not possible for you to be aware of the harm that you cause, you are on the wrong side of the equation to have the ability to be able to have that awareness. There comes that moment when she is disgusted with the thought of you. Why would someone *your age* touch her? The way your skin sags ever so slightly from your frame. That your cock isn't quite as hard as she imagined (or possibly experienced) a cock to be. In the beginning you may have convinced her to be honored by your attention. And yes, perhaps she is only hungry for a fathers affection that she misses in her life, you take advantage of that. In the long run she is resentful and scarred. There will come a time when you disgust her.

It is an absolute cop out to say that it is not possible to find the qualities you seek in an of age female. Of course you could. It's a huge planet. There are plenty of women that look very, very young, are flat chested, and could have the exact personality should you take the effort to get to know them instead of spending so much time obsessing about children &amp; humans in their larval &amp; not yet fully formed stages. You try to intellectualize and justify your deviant desires, your lack of willingness to face that you have a condition that places you at odds with the society you live in. Instead of simply raising your age requirement ever so slightly to what would be considered legal and searching out a lover with the qualities you desire.

Why is that? My hypothesis, and this is strictly a medical term of course, is that you are totally fucked up.

I may upgrade to a new system before the game is released rather than try to run it on my current computer and enjoy it fully once I upgrade in another 6-12 months. If I chose to upgrade now, not only will I be enjoying Starcraft 2 on full settings but I will also be bale to enjoy other games like Fallout 3 or Spore on full settings as well.

"politics","t5_2cneq","First, Christians aren't loons.  Or stupid, at least in the common sense of the word.  There might be a statistical leaning toward gullibility, but it's not going to be the kind of thing where someone being Christian makes them non-functioning.  It's hard for many non-Christian people to appreciate how difficult it is to break with an upbringing where all major figures, all authority figures and members of one's family and so forth all are encouraged by the church to indoctrinate one.  If your parents want to raise you as a Christian to avoid disappointing *their* parents, it's a bit of a cycle, and that cycle is pretty strong.  I've been through it.  I don't consider myself stupid, and I will quite happily say that it is very mentally difficult -- probably the most difficult thing I've ever done -- to try to completely reshape one's world view.  This is generally done from scratch (since unlike Christian material, atheist material isn't generally littering the ground everywhere).  It means that you may have to independently solve a number of philosophical problems -- how can society continue to operate without a religious basis, where did the universe come from, why did I mysteriously find a ten dollar bill just when I needed one and prayed for one, etc.  It means going against peer pressure and the efforts of family and perhaps the community and the fear of damnation for even allowing such thoughts to creep in.  Rejecting Christianity may mean that thinking that people that one loves and respects are very, very wrong about something that they have chosen to shape their entire lives around.  That's a huge deal.

I consider Christians to be quite inconsistent in view, and to be holding to a pretty absurd set of ideas, but I've also done it, and I think that many people trivialize the ease of dropping those views.

Second, you can choose from the Christian Barack Obama, the Christian Hillary Clinton, or the Christian John McCain, or maybe some Christian third-party candidates.  There isn't really another option.

Third, if Obama wasn't Christian, he wouldn't be a presidential nominee.  There is exactly one openly atheist elected federal official or representative in the United States, out of hundreds -- [Pete Stark](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Pete_Stark) (D-CA).  There has never been an atheist US president; there will probably not *be* an atheist US president for a long time to come.

Obama is currently [46 delegates away from the required count](http://demconwatch.blogspot.com/).

Thirty-one pledged delegates remain.  They all will be assigned less than forty-eight hours from now.  Both Obama and Clinton will win approximately half of these, give or take, due to the proportionality rules.

Which means that Obama will need something like 30 of the remaining 203 superdelegates, or about 15% of them.

1. Explained above: having premarital sex used to be taboo, and the women who did usually felt the societal guilt, felt ashamed internally, lied externally, and if found out ostracized and devalued on the potential mate market. The same thing with being gay up till very recently. Taboos are social constructs, deemed to be undesirable behavior, and when that societal view starts changing those who are the first to 'step out of the closet' so to speak and attempt to normalize that taboo as acceptable behavior will of course face the most of those consequences. Once the behavior is more normalized (gay) the consequences may exist socially but largely no longer legally, and finally when it's largely removed from being taboo (interracial dating/marriage) there are no real legal obstacles, and social ones are largely limited to small pockets of society.
2. I don't think there was anything discussed about procreation - p3do's bent is about sensual and sexual being normal bodily functions absent of difference from any other pleasures or human activities that harm no other.
3. This is the dichotomy of whether or not 'childhood' exists in anything other than an artificial construct in the very recent future - one where we seem to grow our children with an eye towards preventing them from becoming adults (aka protecting their innocence/childhood) instead of the natural way which is to grow them into adults as quickly and resource efficiently as possible. 
Part of a result of the current system is that children do not grow up with adults - peers are largely their companions in all areas of life. So on the one hand they are not permitted to interact in an adult world, and at the same time they are told to respect inherently those who are in the adult world. Thus of course you demand that those in the adult world not cross over to the childhood world for any reason other than to ""look out for their welfare."" This thus excludes any activity which is viewed as benificial to the adult and not to the child - as well as any activity or education that would move them into the adult world which they are prohibited from. 

Sound like a huge artificial construct yet? Well perhaps this should be flipped back to normal where a birthed organism is useless until it is properly nurtured, and once it is capable it is weaned immediately and put to its own existence - where it interacts in all the world and has responsibility in all the world and is responsible for looking out for its own interests when not under the direct and immediate protection of its parent. 

But for some reason that's not the case currently - at some point people started assigning an intrinsic worth to the birthed organism staying in a state of uselessness - funny that.","1212382198"

"reddit.com","t5_6","I agree this isn't all about feminism. The evolutionary consequences of two-sex breeding makes for all sorts of persistent systemic forces. 

For example, I once read that in all the species we've investigated, where parents dedicate non-symmetrical resources to birthing or raising their children, the female dedicates more energy to children, the female is the limiting factor in population growth, and the male is more aggressive than the female... in all but two species. 

In the two species where the female is more aggressive, it is the *male* who donates more resources to offspring and it is therefore the *male* who is the limiting factor for reproduction and population growth. 

Coincidence? Unlikely. 

In other words, whichever sex is the bottleneck becomes the hot commodity. The abundant sex becomes aggressive and competitive. Supply and demand. 

One of those two species is the seahorse, where offspring are incubated in the male's body. 

But this brings up another issue I'm hammering on: if feminism was genuinely about equality, then it would recognize and talk about the reproductive power women have over men, and how to compensate for that power discrepancy in an egalitarian society.

Instead, it seems today's women are doing all they can to use their biological advantage to grind men into the dirt.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","1. you always try to stay ahead of the competition by developing new things. 

USA lost the leadership of developing new and innovative ideas and realized that and instead of trying to allocate resources to genuine basic research, tries to get ahead by repackaging the same gadgets. 

Look at Toyota. They are way ahead of American auto makers. Several people that had worked for GM or ford and Toyota say that everything is so organized and efficient.

Let me see if I understand what you mean by saying 'we don't compete (I assume) with other countries' 

Are you saying that there are no distinct businesses producing same or very similar items but located in different countries. And by located I mean that most of the work is done in the country where the business resides. I find that impossible to believe. Sure, everything is manufactured all over the place, but you can still identify companies that are concentrated laborwise and resourcewise in one political area.

Let's say for each consumer there is import/domestic consumption ratio.
If a consumer wants to buy product X from japan that is overtaxed, he'll still buy it. The only difference is that it'll be at a greater cost which means there will be less money that could go to domestic consumption. Instead, that money is going to government. And I'm sure we all can agree that giving money to government is the worst idea ever, they'll spend it in the dullest way possible and will ask for more.","1212382349"

For every article in the declaration, people can (and have) come up with a dozen reasons, be them economical, political or social-cultural, why that article is unpractical, and should be outright ignored.

For example, your highest modded comment here argues, seemingly seriously, that the **""unproductive members"" of society should at worst be left to die, or at best forbidden to breed**.

Sure, it's wrapped in a lot of economic babble, and you may not explicitly call out for people to be left to die, yet it's clearly suggested as the logical consequence of your argument, with your proposal for denying the right to breed appearing like a saner, softer alternative.

"science","t5_mouw","I got the cloud question ""wrong"" although their answer is incorrect.  The visible part a cloud is tiny drops of liquid water but without close to 100% humidity (water vapour) you would have no cloud, at least not for very long, as the droplets would quickly evaporate into vapour. Thus water vapour is indeed a critical part of the cloud. 

Having established that water vapour is a fundamental part of the cloud we can calculate the mass of the vapour. Fortunately NOAA has saved me the trouble of typing it all in:

http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/fgz/science/cloud.php?wfo=fgz

Actually we are only really interested in the density for pure water vapor of 0.627 kg/m3 and water vapour makes up roughly 0.9% of the air the cloud is in. This gives a water density of roughly 5.6g/m^3 (at 2km and 2.1C). 

Looking at cloud LWC (Liquid Water Concentration):
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_liquid_water_content

We see Cumulonimbus clouds are have the highest water density around 1-3g/m^3.  So the majority of water is still in the vapour phase.

Admittedly as you go higher the water vapour content drops but to say the majority of water in a cloud is always liquid is incorrect.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; The article does not speak of a planned act of ethnic cleansing, that is your words.

This is quoted directly from the article.

&gt; According to Ilan Pappé the Zionists organised a campaign of threats,[29] consisting of the distribution of threatening leaflets, 'violent reconnaissance' and, after the arrival of mortars, the shelling of Arab villages and neighborhoods.[30] The idea of 'violent reconnaissance' was to enter a defenceless village at night, fire at everyone who dared leave his or her house and leave after a few hours.[31] Pappé also notes that the Haganah shifted its policy from retaliation through excessive retaliation to offensive initiatives.[32] During the 'long seminar', a meeting of Ben-Gurion with his chief advisors in January 1948, the departure point was that it was desirable to 'transfer' as many Arabs as possible out of Jewish territory, and the discussion focussed mainly on the implementation.[33] The experiences in a number of attacks in February 1948, notably those on Qisarya and Sa'sa', were used in the development of a plan, detailing how enemy population centers should be handled.[34] According to Pappé plan Dalet was the master plan for the expulsion of the Palestinians.

&gt; Israeli vans with loudspeakers drove through the streets ordering all the inhabitants to evacuate immediately, and such as were reluctant to leave were forcibly ejected from their homes by the triumphant Israelis whose policy was now openly one of clearing out all the Arab civil population before them …. From the surrounding villages and hamlets, during the next two or three days, all the inhabitants were uprooted and set off on the road to Ramallah…. No longer was there any ""reasonable persuasion"". Bluntly, the Arab inhabitants were ejected and forced to flee into Arab territory…. Wherever the Israeli troops advanced into Arab country the Arab population was bulldozed out in front of them.

Explain to me how this clear act of ethnic cleansing, was not so.

&gt; As I have said time and time again, the same thing happened on both sides, but the Arabs were more efficient.

What happened on both sides, and what are the Arabs more efficient at? (ofcourse, the Arabs must always take more blame)...

&gt; You keep ignoring the fact that it happened to teh jews as well.

The Jews left Arabic countries for various reasons. Some left since their religion dictated so. Others left due to pograms and massacres by citizens in Arabic countries.

Show me some evidence where the Arab military mounted a planned effort to expel Jewish people from their homes, forcefully. I have read much about the subject, I have found no evidence where the situation can even be paralled with the Palestinian expulsion, which was undoutedly an act of ethnic cleansing.

&gt; What I have a problem with is people ignoring that the reason there is only an Arab refugee problem now is that the Arabs did not take in the refugees, but left them to suffer.

Why are the Arabs responsible for the Palestinian refugee situation, which was planned and carried out by Israel? Why are they blamed for not accepting Palestinians when the Palestinians have their homes in Israel and that is their homeland. Or do you deny that Palestinians have a right to return to their homes, or that Israel by denying the Palestinians the right to return, is not criminal, racist or to be blamed for doing so?

&gt; You are either ignorant to the palestinian crisis or lack the ability to critically think. In 1948 the Israelis did not keep the palestinians from moving to anywhere other than Israel. This is the entire difference. The Zionists did not throw the palestinians INTO anywhere, only out of Israel. The Nazis through the Israelis into ghettos. 

So, the Palestinians were thrown into an area that would later become a ghetto, and would remain so do to military occupation for decades. I fail to see how the Palestinians were not thrown into ghettos and not restricted the movement of to their homes, and you not given any evidence either.

&gt;  I, on the other hand, do not do this.

Keep telling yourself that.

&gt; You do the same for the Arab world.

When did I even say this? I fully support the right of Jews to return back to Arabic countries. The difference is, that the Jews left due to their own will, while the Palestinians were forcefully removed. Moreover, why would Zionists move from their own preferred state of living (Israel) to another state now? That is why there is no significant movement of Jews who wish to return to their former Arabic countries.

&gt; I agree that some palestinians were displaced,

I like how you use the word displaced to describe the expulsion of the Palestinian people. That's historical revisionism in action right there.

&gt;  I just disagree that there fate is entirely Israel's fault.

Of course you don't. Like you said before, the Arabs are more efficient at ethnic cleansing. And when Israel does it, it is not entirely their fault. Here is yet another example of your bigotry.

&gt; Before 1948, those jews living in Egypt, Syria, etc. could have moved to Jerusalem and live comprable lives (as Dhimmis to the Arab majority), but instead they stayed.

The creation of a Jewish state in Israel obviously would be more preferable for them than living in an Arabic Jerusalem. That is why, like their religion itself says, they would have moved there.

&gt; Your bigoted view that all of those jews wanted to leave is ridiculous.

You are making statements and then putting them in my mouth. I never said that all the Jews wanted to leave. I can see that you are running out of evidence to support your revisionist claims, but you do not have to fall to this low.

&gt; I am not the one who thinks that a jew and Arab should be treated differently,

Except you have no problems when Israel denies citizenship to all Palestinians, and do not see how racist that is. Like you said, people living in glass houses should not throw stones...

&gt; Oh, how dare I believe that a palestinian leader is honest .. how hateful of me to take them at their word.

Ironic that you would take the Palestinian leader whose views are historically incorrect and fit the Zionist worldview to be honest. Do you think that Palestinian leader is also honest who says that Israel is an apartheid state or that the Palestinians were ethnically cleansed? Or do you just accept those Palestinian leaders who share the same lies as you?

&gt; Show me one place where I say or infer that all palestinians are terrorists ... I do not believe this and never stated it.

Here is your bigoted quote that clearly paints all Palestinians as terrorists who attack Israelis.

&gt; If Israel allowed married non-Israeli Palestinians to move to Israel based on marriage there would be attacks.

As you said, people living in glass houses, should truly not be throwing stones. Especially racists like you.","1212383160"

Thompson was not about to go down. He was slightly dazed yes, but not about to go down. And an ear cut does NOT warrant a stoppage. Unless he has eyes below his ears

"reddit.com","t5_6","I think you're still one step removed from p3do's world view.

You're still on the plane that the daughter somehow loses in that interaction. That the father is taking something from her due to his having the advantage of greater understanding and playing off the love she has of him.

If a mother wanted her daughter to brush her hair either because the mother liked the feel of it and took pleasure from it or was too lazy to do it herself you would not see this as abuse - the daughter did not get harmed, she did not lose anything. 
Perhaps the daughter likes doing her mother's hair, or perhaps she hates it but loves her mother and thus does it anyway, or perhaps she just absolutely hates it - but even still if her mother forced her to do it you'd be 'well, that sucks, but she's your mother you'd best do as your told' rather than cry abuse.


So in this vastly different hypothetical world p3do is constructing unless you can put forth a reason why that interaction would be more harmful than a daughter brushing her mother's hair - how she gets hurt or what she loses, in p3do's world it's just a sensual (in his example sexual) experience and even if it is one sided, as long as the other is not hurt or loses something, a big Laissez faire 'why not?' is his response.","1212383209"

"science","t5_mouw","&gt; THe Pauli exclusion principle is not a force.

True, though I never said it was.  I merely said that it keeps them apart.

&gt; It doesn't repel anything.

False.

&gt; The exclusion principle states that two identical fermions can't occupy the same quantum state at the same time. All fermions (an electron is a fermion) have half integer spin, which means their wavefunctions are antisymmetric.

Yeah, that's pretty much exactly what the Wikipedia article says.

The Pauli principle itself is not a force, but attempting to push two fermions together results in an ""exchange force"" that repels them.  This is not a ""real"" force, but a result of the probability of finding the two particles closer being less than that of finding them farther apart.  The net effect is exactly that of ""repelling,"" in that it takes more force to get them closer together.

The probability of finding two electrons at exactly the same location is zero, it simply cannot happen, but the probability of finding them extremely close together is non-zero.  Thus it is possible to push them much closer together than you would usually find them with extremely dense magnetic or gravitational fields, for example with neutrons in a neutron star.

In this example, it's the exclusion of the electrons in the two atoms' orbitals that keeps the atoms apart.  There is no ""wall"" at which they simply cannot get closer together, it's very much like electromagnetic force where the reactive force is a function of the distance between the particles, except that in the case of the Pauli principle the reactive force increases *without bound* as the positions converge.

When you push two atoms together, they do get closer the more force is applied.  This repulsion quickly increases to exceed the strength of any molecular bond, however, so it's impossible to see any measurable ""give"" in the contact between two macroscopic objects.

When considering why objects ""feel"" solid, there is an equilibrium reached between the repulsive force caused by the Pauli principle and the force of our touch.  This determines exactly how far the materials rest from each other.  As I said earlier, this is only the reason that the atoms are kept apart, however, the concepts of molecular bonds, crystalline structure, etc., are also needed to explain why macroscopic objects stay solid when touched rather than merely having all their atoms pushed out of the way, and thus falling to dust in our hands.","1212383438"

Yes logic is my strong point, so I will break this down to the two things we fundamentally disagree on.

1) Your unsourced, self-serving definition of inflation made me laugh.  It's a disgrace to logic to include the point you are trying to prove in the very definition of the thing you are trying to explain.

Look up:

Begging the question
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begs_the_question

Or circular reasoning:
http://ksuweb.kennesaw.edu/~shagin/logfal-pbc-circular.htm

Karl Popper is spinning in his grave!

2) The idea that the value of something is not affected by how many people want it demonstrates to me that you are so fundamentally deficient in your understanding of economics that arguing with you any further is like trying to disagree with an automated recording.  Again you hold *by definition* the value of gold to be fixed throughout human history regardless of the size of the economy and whether there are actually any people around to want it or care about it.   Like the man stopped for speeding, gold stands still and the world rushes behind it.

You are trying to include the things that you are trying to prove in the definitions of the words you are using, because that saves you the bother having to prove something by means of evidence and logical argument.

I am a high school drop out, I had all Fs in school because homework bored me.  Instead I would skip class, go home, smoke pot and play video games.  One day I decided I wanted to learn how video games were made so I rode my bike to the mall and bought a book on C programming. 

I am now 31 and run a successful software company that specializes in medical software.  I still smoke pot almost every day.

School is overrated.

I would say that the kids are not challenged to learn.  They should have vocational schools as an option where they can specialize in a single trade instead of being forced to learn stuff they realistically think they will never use.  Math, science, english should all be mandatory.  Hmm.. computer skills should be manditory now days too I think.  But since that's such a moving target it's not like you can (or even need) to teach the kids, they will figure that shit out on their own if you just give them computers to play with.  

Learning should be FUN.

The prison system of schools is insane and idiotic.

Now, back to Obama.  Even if he is on the CFR, even if he is Elite, so what??  There are tons of powerful people in the world all in competition with each other... you're just a pawn dude.  You don't matter.

So Obama hit it big!  Great, good for him!  He still genuinly seems to care about people.  He seems to want to do the right thing.  He's a politician, he's got to play the game and make allies and enemies.  The CFR is a powerful ally.  Wouldn't you want them on your side so you could ask them for favors if you were president?  He's not their puppet.  It doesn't work like that.  There is no man behind the curtain.  It's a bunch of wealthy and powerful organizations all over the world all in competition with each other.

Vote for the guys who remember that humanity matters more than dollars.  And that a balance is possible.  There are some good guys who are playing an evil game on your behalf.  Support them.

Obama is one of those good guys.  He's not perfect, but he doesn't claim to be.  Of the people who have a **realistic** shot of winning he's your best hope for a brighter future.

It's OK if you enjoy a story that takes FOREVER to get moving. It's a neat idea/concept and I really wished it well but it seems pretty clear once you get to the 8th episode or so just how slow it is moving.

But yes, it is cool and imaginative and it is science fiction for sure. Not only that but the characters are well-developed and there are a few twists and turns that you won't expect.

Biological variation. It happens a lot.

And if two men have been with a woman during one ovulation, your chance of impregnation goes to- you guessed it-50%!

The only way a man can be sure that this hasn't occured is if the woman is a virgin. 

Don't pass judgement on what men are programmed to desire. A man wanting a woman with relatively unused parts isn't immoral- its natural.

The thing that scares me about this is that I was in the navy for 10 years and never heard a whisper about this.  I had no idea.  How far is the american government willing to go?  When this breaks world wide, and becomes major news, and it will.  We lose.  We are no longer the america of old.  We no longer can claim to be a beacon of democracy.  Everything that everyone for 2 centuries has fought to preserve and hold true is lost. 

I know I sound mushy and like a serious geek, but this truly saddens me.  I honestly never thought I would see the day that I was literally ashamed to be an american.  This is what it must have felt like to be a german citizen in 1939.  How can this happen in this day and age?  I mean, I know greed runs the world, but this is on a whole new level.  This, other than the jews, is so far beyond Hitler.  This is something that will take a century to recover from.  This is the final shot in the fall of america in my opinion.

Thats the scary thing to me.  Hitler didnt one day just take over.  It was a process that took several years to accomplish.  Laws were passed in a specific order.  Rights were stripped away slowly and methodically.  The signs are there.  The laws and presidental orders are on the books.  Several people have connected the dots, but no one will listen.  They are nuts and loonys.  A police state is a very real fear.  Its a very real possiblity that for the most part no one sees or cares about.  

I have just contacted the Canadian immigration office for information on moving to canada and becoming a citizen.  I cannot change the election with my one vote.  I cannot stop the wheels in motion.  I can however take my family away from this situation before its too late and we are not aloud to leave.  Does anyone remember traveling papers that Hitler made everyone carry?  Yeah, welcome to the new federal ID.  Better have your papers and support the ruler or else.  

Fuck that.  I am out of here.  You can laugh and call me an idiot if you want.  When the chickens come home to roost, and the fruit that Bush 1 and Bush 2 have planted is reaped, I wont be here to even tell you all its too late.  

I cannot stand idly by and let this happen.  I cant change it, so I will leave.  Its a sad day when someone has to leave their own country in shame of their government.

Come on. Who believes that mathematical notation is unambiguous, or even always concise? If it were, [these guys](http://funmath.be/) wouldn't have anything left to do.

Example [from here](http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/00/spe1/spe1.pdf):

&gt; It is all too common to use the form of the argument of a function to define the function. 
&gt; For example, *x(n)* is a discrete-time signal, while *x(t)* is a continuous-time signal.
&gt;This leads to mathematical nonsense like the *x(n) = x(nT)* to define sampling. Similarly, many authors use *ω* for frequency
in radians per second (unnormalized) and *Ω* for frequency in radians per sample (normalized). This means that *X(Ω)≠ X(ω)* even when *Ω = ω*.


Python may not be the most natural language to express vector subtraction in. But if you want ""concise and unambiguous"" you need to write a parser. In this specific example, a Fortress code sample might be ideal.","1212385224"

In the beginning, games were fun, but it was a different type of fun.  It was like pinball: a test of skill and reflexes and luck, but nothing more.

Compare that to today's games, which are more comparable to movies than to pinball machines.  You have a protagonist, a plot (with a twist or two), and character development.  Game producers take into account things like shot framing and lighting.  You have full orchestral soundtracks and professional voice acting. Sure, the tests of skill and reflexes are still there, but they're not the driving force behind games that they used to be.
