Women guests will wear knee length or tea length dresses or suits with hats or fascinators. No one is mistaking a guest for the bride or “upstaging” her.

So yeah. That's the strat, destroy the left and right base,  there should be enough room to edge around the pulses(you can also use war trucks for transporting big squads ) and the take the centre relic to stop the pulses and then it's just kicking in the main door.

"australian","t5_2qmdy","1) yes, but, the proposal -> which ive not expressed any view on -< is to provide housing (presumably things like clothing too)... so the general Australian COL is materially less relevant.

2) replace brick-layer with your other prefered trade, like traffic controller then. Though, i struggle to accept bricklayers on the largest govt infrastructure projects are only on 50k-90k.

3) the thought process is we have a shortage of *insert relevant tradie type, like bricklayer*, so impact on salary wont be significant, and if there is an impact it'll bring salary down to more ""normal"" amounts. Obviously, this would need managing withcareful consideration of how many tl bring across.

4) i mean, part of my professional job is, literally, to manage and oversight a team of professionals in India doing work that historically would have been done in Australia.... its a similar concept, albeit different.

5) sure, but, its a matter of degrees, right? If, say, Govt of Tasmania wanted to build a new football stadium on a strict budget, hiring 100 foreign bricklayers for that specific project wouldnt have a gigantic effect on bricklaying wages -> again, replace bricklaying with whatever trade you think is most appropriate (e.g traffic control).

6) i think the OP is suggesting things like container housing for the length of their work, yes.

7) firstly, yes, i want more competition. Producitivity is too low, and productivity hasnt increased fast enough to be optimal.

Secondly, the other pro is more projects can go ahead quicker. Specifically with trades, some projects are delayed due to not enough trades to complete all desired projects simultaneously. How have you missed this?


8) yes, sure. Lets make trades more accessible.... arent they ready accessible though? What am i missing?",1709251200.0

Welcome to r/HomeworkHelp! It seems like you have not attempted to structure your post title to classify your question's level and discipline/topic enclosed with **square brackets** as a title prefix.

**e.g.** **[AS Level Physics: Light]** Please explain how they’re getting their numbers in part a

###Positive Examples

|Examples|**square brackets** is being used at prefix (must) + topic (optional) + clear question|
|:-|:-|
|includes syllabus|\**[GCE 'O' Level Calculus: Differentiation\]** How to differentiate e?|
||**\[AP English: Essay Writing\]** Should all adverts be factual?|
|includes grade|**\[Grade 8 Algebra: Complete the square\]** How to factorise ax^(2)\+bx+c?|
||**\[University Chemistry: Titration\]** What is my qs?|

###Bad Examples

|Examples|*It still works, but strongly discouraged*|
|:-|:-|
|Grade/level is not specific enough|**\[High School Math\]** What is my qs?|
|What is your question?|\[Grade 8 Algebra\] **Helpppp!**|
|Do not attempt to circumvent square brackets requirement. Classify your question with square brackets|**\[Q\]** What is my question?|

I do have transferable skills (electrical, service industry, welding soon) and a slight plan, but am also aware of the possibility that none of my plans work the way I imagine 

As far as community, that’s something that I have no problem building slowly over time. I by no means expect the natives to appreciate my company, at least not for a long time.

But I’d like to think if I’m a respectful, active member of the community, and do my share to care for the island and the culture, then eventually I may be more accepted. 

I also don’t mind being homeless for a while, and would be ok minding my own business with no possessions other than my surf craft, but still don’t want to contribute to something already potentially negatively impacting native islanders",1709251200.0

"Dragonballsuper","t5_380mp","Why not? For one, Vegeta didn't know what Cabba's level actually was until he revealed he couldn't turn SSJ. Before that, he was actively testing his strength as that was the purpose of the entire tournament. Goku and Vegeta wanted to see how strong the other universe was. On top of that, you have to remember that Vegeta was [originally set to rule the Saiyans](https://ibb.co/7n7rvCK) before Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta. So it's [established](https://ibb.co/z2dxtNY) that because of that, Vegeta decided to go ahead and train him. Since even though Cabba is from another universe, he's still a fellow Saiyan. Meaning his power level wasn't entirely what was important in this instance but rather their relationship as being part of the same race.

Goku was also stated many times to be [very fatigued](https://ibb.co/4Tjv2Kd) so he just wouldn't be god level when he's literally running on fumes. It's also evident by the fact that he then proceeded to struggle with basically every opponent that came his way and constantly needed assistance from his teammates to handle them. Now Kale actually _is_ legitimately displayed to be god level when she's in either her Berserk form or later her Controlled Berserk form during the tournament, but only Kale. If anything, the ToP actually _further_ proved that both Cabba and Caulifla weren't on Goku and Vegeta's level at all. For example, Caulifla was pushed into going SSJ2 to fight the Pride Troopers, while just base Goku and 18 were enough to handle them. Cabba was also forced to turn SSJ2 against Monna while base Vegeta very casually blasted her all the way to the other side of the stage. So there's a very clear _massive_ gap between Goku/Vegeta and Cabba/Caulifla.",1709251201.0

Abortion in many cases...is taking responsibility.

The typical woman getting an abortion is in her late 20s and already has one child.  She is taking responsibility for making sure the child or children she already has have a chance at a good life.   And can eat and can go to college or trade school, and can survive and can have a home with enough space to breathe.

Children shouldn't be a suffering punishment for having the audacity to share physical affection with someone. 

A pregnancy is more a part of the pregnant person's body than it is anything autonomous.  It's not sentient, it's not alive, and even if it were an 8 year old child you would STILL need informed, written, medical consent to donate part of a liver, or even your blood or marrow to help them in a medical situation, even those are much shorter, less risky, and more painless than even the easiest pregnancy.",1709251202.0

"BPDlovedones","t5_33dd6","I feel you dude I treated mine like an angel then I lost my shit on her for the mountain of lies, infidelity, and crazy transgressions that I uncovered. Perfect way for her to paint me as the bad guy and move on to the next one right after telling me I was the love of her life and her biggest regret in life was hurting me. When I reached out offering support she said she doesn’t know how to communicate with me anymore without reopening old wounds and triggering her darkness. Like she’s on some kind of healing journey with faith and therapy but I doubt she’s doing a damn thing except telling people what a monster/narcissist I was.

It truly pisses me off that she’s out there doing that and playing the next fool and running my good name through the mud. I don’t have proof of that but she bad mouthed her previous ex when I found out he did nothing wrong and she left him hanging high and dry for me making him out to be some kind of psycho showing me all of his texts to her that she apparently didn’t respond to. I can relate because being with a BPD will make the most stable person absolutely lose their minds. I know this is how they operate to bait the next guy to be their white knight. I’m 3 months out and in a new relationship but I get so irritable and pissed off sometimes when I think about it. I’m mostly angry at myself like you.

Luckily my new girlfriend is patient and understanding with me and has a BPD sister so she knows exactly the grief process I’m going through. I almost want to push her away too because I’m holding on to this pain. Almost like I’ve caught BPD “fleas”. I’ve been in therapy and the gym has been my best friend in controlling that anger. Wish you the best man. Don’t let them ruin your bright future. If they reach out just know that things went south with their new “partner” and that they don’t actually want you back or to reconcile. They just need validation from anyone and everyone. They never loved you and can never love any one.

Long story short: fuck them and the horse that they rode in on.",1709251202.0

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Something similar happened to someone my mother knew- she worked a lot with victims of domestic violence. Husband was suspicious the wife might cheat or leave him, so decided to 'make sure no one else would want her' - by throwing boiling water over her while she was in the shower. Claimed he didnt realise how hot it was at the time, and was only discovered after friends of his told her that he'd been joking for months about 'making sure she couldnt leave him'. 

I cant say his intent for 100% op - no one here can, but.. I think you know in your heart that someone can't accidentally throw an entire pot of boiling water on someone. Thats why you came here. You know, deep down, that there is no way it was a joke; that theres is no way he didnt know it was hot. That it wasnt some freak accident. He made a conscious choice, to insist on cooking out of the blue that day, to stand there boiling water over the stove, waiting for you to come in. To turn as soon as you got close enough, and throw that boiling water over you.

People are so very good at hiding their true nature. No one dates someone if they think theyll turn abusive; almost every abusive relationship was once a relationship the abused was genuinely happy in, where they had no concerns at all about them. My mum was abused severely by my father, and she tells me often- abusers can be so charismatic, so loving. You wont suspect a thing, and then youll make excuses for their behaviour when it starts - because you love them, because they 'cant be that type', because it couldnt happen to you. Theyll trick you into believing that youre overreacting, and it will only continue to escalate. Please, be safe.",1709251203.0

"Marvel","t5_2r40o","That’s the thing tho, he and the rest of the Illuminati never destroyed any world that had people in it. They were only destroying worlds that had no life.

Yes Namor did push a button later and blew up the Great Society’s planet and Tony did make the device, but he and the rest hesitated to do so. Namor did it because he is a dickhead (and has some balls lol)

Regarding Civil War, I have no counter to that except, he was way out of character, but it is what it is.

That being said, if you read his stuff, he was never a dickhead people think he was during CW. He would have never signed with the Pro side.

A guy, who told Nick Fury himself to F off because he is not making him any weapons (80s stuff) then got betrayed by Fury and Fury took his company, only for Tony to come back and reclaim his assets and push SHIELD out because they were wrong. That’s actual Tony.

The guy who can sometimes make decisions that people like Spidey or Cap won’t.

Is he a sweetheart like Petey or Steve. No.

But a bad guy, that’s a bit too much.

2) Go bigger. Go for the M Comp. 617 hp. Much much higher resale value. Striking colors, features.



To your original question, when getting a BMW CPO X5:

- Don't accept any excuses. If the car has previous accidents, dings, dents, missing key, etc. they usually come with stories: don't accept it. Ask for deep discounts for them.

- Check lifetime mpg. You won't do better.

- Know that you're picking up the bill on a $5-7k warranty. It's overpriced. It only adds +1 year. It's not that great. 

- Make sure you're calculating the total cost of ownership correctly. Some service costs are calculated depending on # of cylinders.

- Look at trade-in values before buying. Know how much you're getting fleeced for the CPO + the sales guy's summer house and consider leasing brand new.",1709251203.0

"thyroidcancer","t5_3e8dw","Sometimes the overall type like papillary vs follicular vs medullary will be identified in the FNA, but typically the post-surgery pathology is where that is confirmed with much more detail because they’re looking at much more sample.

I would expect many surgeons to do additional ultrasounds before surgery - mine did it in both the pre-surgery consult and as the start of the procedure.  Pre-surgery they need to decide whether it’s a simpler central neck procedure or also involves lateral lymph nodes up the neck.  Either way, once they’re in the surgery they’ll be actively looking at the lymph nodes including some that hide behind the thyroid and may test in real time during the surgery any that look suspicious.  Like my surgeon saw a few local lymph nodes that looked bigger so took out all 19 nodes in the central neck, of which 5/19 came back with metastases.

Don’t know on isthmus… great question for the surgeons.

Keys to this mission:

1. Move your people in place instantly to take out the SRM launchers and the other units (Bulldogs if I remember correctly). You can even move one or two up to step on them IF those units have jump jets to move out quickly. The sooner they're gone, the sooner your people take over the turrets and start shooting. If it takes more than two turns to eliminate all of those units, restart the mission because you're already mostly screwed.

2. You should have units coming out the top of the cliff the instant the turrets take over. Why? Because you're a great target and that Centurion and Dragon are going to want to take potshots at you. Usually the turrets will blow the fuck out of that Trebuchet first (and that's a GOOD thing because less LRMs in your direction.) Try to concentrate your fire on the Centurion first to get that AC/10 out of commission. If the Trebuchet isn't finished off, hit it with what you can. Everyone should be moving as much of they can while still being able to fire EXCEPT for your designated runner/jumper. Have them run first, then have them jump once they get to the bottom. The Shadow Hawk CAN'T do this job unless you've changed the standard weapons loadout (once you get to the building you have to blow it up after all, and it's a medium range fighter, not a close range one.) The Spider won't survive; it'll eventually get mauled and the weapons loadout is too puny anyway. You need something else. Usually I've had a Griffin (referenced in one of your other posts here in this thread) do the job with 3 ml and two SRM 6s. I will take a little armor off to get more heat sinks.

Back to the turrets. Since that Dragon, Jenner, Hunchback and Centurion - and in most cases, the Panther - are both trying to take you out as your ass uses them for target practice, they get attacked from behind. Usually the Hunchback is the secondary target for the turrets once the Trebuchet is out of the picture...but it's really what the computer thinks is ""best hit chance"". Sometimes  you get lucky here, sometimes you don't. Yes that Hunchback is absolutely your primary threat but if you are evading enough they'll miss. Remember what Deadeye Unther taught you in MW2: Mercenaries: ""You go slow, you die.""",1709251203.0

"deadbydaylight","t5_3cb2g","I know it's a skill issue on my part, but I hate Windows. When I drop a chase with a decent survivor using it, I always end up getting in another pallet and jungle gym infested chase with someone else running it. 

People claim to mainly use it to see which pallets have been dropped while not in voice chat with friends, but if it was changed, I wonder how popular it would remain. 

I mocked up a change to look something like this: Breakable Walls, Pallets, and Windows within a 32/48/64-meter range for 6/8/10 seconds at the start of the trial. When a pallet is dropped, vaulted, or interacted with by a survivor (Any means Necessary, Chemical Trap), Broken or interreacted with by the killer, (Feral Vault, Bound Vault, Scamper) all Breakable Walls, Pallets, and Windows within a 32/48/64-meter range are revealed for 6/8/10 seconds. 

I guess it would be more of a chase perk at that point, but I think it keeps in line with teaching new players spawn points, while not holding their hand the entire time to rely on the perk, while solo players can still see dropped pallets when it happens, and solo players can see what state a pallet is in based on the killer and survivor interacting with it, without the aura being constantly up.",1709251204.0

I don't think most people have the emotional intelligence and communication skills to manage this, sadly.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","The main types are just bunkers and crashsites/derelict settlements. There are a couple unique ones based on planets (such as the Repel Raid on Orison, and the Boarding in Progress near microTech)

Generally bunkers are easier, because it’s in a confined and brightly lit location. Others are mostly in open areas, and if it happens to be at night, it is going to be quite hard to see anything.

Provided if you can see them, by either taking missions on the day side, or using a ship with good headlight, the crashsites and derelict settlements are fairly okay. They generally have fewer enemies positioned in clusters. Or you could shoot them with your ship’s weapons, though keep in mind that they can shoot back. 

Other tips for FPS combat:

- **Avoid Rappel**. If you see a mission wanting you to evict illegal occupants from Rappel, don’t take it. This can spawn 300-600 NPCs at Rappel when you arrive, proceeding to plummet your frame rates and affect the entire server.

- **Bring a silencer**. NPCs have fairly poor sight, but excellent hearing. If they hear a gunshot, they’ll swarm over. Bringing a silencer is quite effective in avoiding detection.

- **Keep an eye on server fps**. NPC behaviours are tied to server fps, the higher it is, the more deadly they are. Playing on servers with 20+ fps would grant enemies perfect night vision and pinpoint accuracy, capable of sniping you with a shotgun across the room the moment you pop your head out of cover. The usual sweet spot is somewhere around 10 server fps.",1709251204.0

Starting in the next week or so, gr 12 semester 1 final marks will be playing a big role in the offers going out. They just weren't available to the schools until now. For the next two months 1st semester finals will be the main source, but it's top 6 average, and if you don't have 6 4U/M marks, then they'll use 3U/M marks to fill in the remaining marks.

A guy named Marty Weeme, an engineer at an ammo development company called Teppo Jutsu, designed .458 SOCOM as a concept in 2000 to give better stopping power. It was based around being used with a 10.5” barrel and ideally would be used with a GemTech suppressor for the 600 gr subsonic loads. 

The name is a bit of a misnomer. The SOCOM name was chosen just cause they originally came up with the round after talking to some guys in SOCOM. There may have been one or two units that tested it, but ultimately it never saw any service",1709251205.0

"AEWOfficial","t5_ubkze","AEW is my favorite company, but there's almost zero chance this happens:

1- Giulia's leaving Stardom after March to go to Rossy Ogawa's new company. Ogawa and Tony don't like each other, and there's zero chance of any sort of partnership (specially after Tony celebrated Rossy's firing on Twitter weeks ago)

2- She will most likely drop the STRONG women's title a week from Sunday to Stephanie Vaquer, as she's already confirmed she ain't working any Bushiroad (NJPW/Stardom) after her deal is up, which means no Windy City Riot for her

3- Free agency wise, it's been reported for a while she's WWE bound after a small run to help set up Rossy's new company. In fact, it was even reported AEW weren't interested in her cause they didn't see much in her 🥴🥴🥴

So long story short, the only way Mercedes vs Giulia happens would be if they found a way for it to happen next month, which is possible but not that likely.

"ask","t5_2qhlj","Tylenol and NSAIDS are both absorbed in the GI tract and largely metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. 

It’s the metabolites that cause toxicity with Tylenol.

*Consistently taking NDAIDS and Tylenol can lead to increased risk of kidney damage.*

Prolonged use of NSAIDS cause GI irritation/dyspepsia, GI bleeding, and decrease the effectiveness of the NSAID itself. NSAIDS can decrease the effectiveness of blood pressure medication, and increase the risk of hypoglycemia for those taking insulin or other diabetic medications. 

No medication, OTC or otherwise is exactly *safe*, just more safe for the majority of people without chronic health conditions. If your taking a daily does of either ibuprofen or Tylenol there’s a better than average chance you aren’t without a chronic problem. And if your doctor is telling you explicitly not to take one (or how to take one) their advice should be followed because every medication effects how our organs function to a greater or lesser extent and interacts with every other medication that we take.

The fun part of medicine is balancing the positive effects with the negative effects of our interventions. (/s)",1709251205.0

However, comments from the past few years (“yeah, the Nakba was an ethnic cleansing, but better them than us”; Palestinians are like wild beasts and need to be kept in cages”) has sort of damaged some of his credibility. And his more recent stuff reflects that change in his thinking and is a lot more slanted towards Israel.

“Plain English with Derek Thompson” did a podcast ep on the history of the conflict hosting both Benny Morris and a historian of Palestinian history. Facts don’t change, they’re facts; but interpretations certainly do. Thompson is a US Jew genuinely trying to learn; he pushes them both but doesn’t have a stance himself. That one gave me a lot of insight into the history. You’ll get a bunch of facts and 2 interpretations, and can what yours is.

As for this specific thing: I've seen similar injuries from them running on snow or sand: their feet can really take a beating if they run around on anything but soft soil.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I think it might just be the genre getting played out. It started with Diablo which was masterful but IMO by accident. Because it was a turn based grid game converted to real time action rpg, but gameplay loop still relies on the player using the environment to their advantage I.e. funneling enemies into narrow corridors or around obstacles, using corners, doors etc especially in the early game when you’re weak as a kitten.  Plus with the horror elements it was a particularly unique game.

D2 pushed the action envelope but still had some of that strategic factor (not as much, and not as much horror), plus it wasn’t nearly as metagamed back then as everything is today (takes 30s to look up an optimized build guide) and from then on it was all about how fast can you melt the screen and run the slot machine. 

It definitely need a shakeup as you suggest, and I’m sure it’ll happen at some point. I think the natural way for it to go is to make the combat strategic again with more control over your character, more dodging, parrying, maybe some more verticality etc. I don’t want to say souls like but SOME of those elements. The trade off is that the screen probably won’t be constantly exploding in giblets so some ARPG die hards will be turned off.",1709251207.0

Those are obviously extremes but which was closer to the actual truth? Did you let it build up and eventually blow a gasket before discussing the situation? We've had a no cell phone at dinner rule for decades, our kids of 19 and 30 have carried on in their households.

That's a pretty big difference in the amount of ISK you can make! Of course it comes with a risk. Systems with a BRM of 150% are those where enemies regularly come through and kill things (or get killed). The risk is that one of those kills might be you.",1709251207.0

• Video Integration: You can now add videos to your frames. Perfect for those moments when a still photo isn't enough.

• Frame Filters & Favorites: I've added filters to make it easier to find the frame you want. And if you've got a favorite frame, you can save it! Your favorites will stick around for next time you use the app, so you won't have to search for them again.

• Added missing single photo mode, picking photo from the entire album was a pain, now you can choose a single photo for your frame without the hassle.

Your feedback has been incredibly helpful in shaping these new features, and I can't thank you enough for that. As always, please keep the feedback coming!",1709251207.0

• TNT have stated that for Pocket Neopets, they will not accept the rare item codes from them unless you have the original receipt (to prove it hasn't had the code used before by you or a previous owner.)

• However, because yours is unopened, that should be enough proof that the prize code has never been redeemed.

• So if you do decide to open it and try to ""win the game"" to get the prize code, contact TNT before opening it, so you can provide adequate proof that it is currently unopened.


**Important info regarding acquiring the rare item code**


• Make sure to name your Pocket Neopet the same name as one of your actual Neopets you have on the Neopets site. (It doesn't have to be the same species.)


• You have to win first place trophies in all three games in order to acquire the rare item code. 


• Make sure to have spare batteries available for when they die. You don't want to lose your progress.",1709251207.0

"WorldBuildingMemes","t5_51q11i","I have varying degrees of this depending on the planet, but the underlying rules are these: the laws of the universe are determined by code, that, locally, exists within the metaphysical realm. I.e, laws in some places are different in others.

These can be changed by expending energy in the metaphysical realm. That changes the local laws, and allows for magic.

The other stuff: you can't do this directly, usually. On some planets, like Shollusk, there are extenuating circumstances that, in it's example, make the bridge from physical to metaphysical so small that most biological structures regularly go between them, and instead of a top down metaphysical-physical structure everything is equal, with some natural 'mirroring' of objects and places across the border, mostly kept up by biological processes.

If not? You have to trade, or already have a foothold there. For example, on Atritus, you have to trade with the Prea, a metaphysical and intelligent nation that was basically space magic America in the good old days. Other guys didn't like them, tried to fight back, got nuked, and then most metaphysical beings got destroyed by, as the SCP universe would call it, a narrative vacuum. Someone outside the universe *rammed* into it, causing a momentary emptiness that killed any metaphysical being not rooted in the physical realm. The reason those survived and the others didn't is a side effect of the metaphysical realm being almost entirely a vague energy and information, nothing outside of that. Kinda like how to destroy a text on a computer you can shift right click and delete permanently, but you can't do that on a book, you have to actually burn it.

Anyways, you trade energy with the Prea for magic on that planet, with the downside being that they latch onto you for the rest of your life and being bound to one and using magic regularly extends your life *and* warps your body and mind, turning you into an eldritch horror. Fun!

Sometimes, though, this energy can coil around itself and appear as a physical substance. These substances are special and usually a one-per-planet thing. Atritus has crystals that were designed by the Prea for interaction with the physical realm directly, and on Kalka it's substance that can mimic other substances, with some neat chemistry on top, and the designer of that substance also altering thd bodies of the Kalkans to be able to use/process it without it *instantly* killing them. Oh, you have to ingest it to use it, and it's still super-poison, but as long as you push it into an object fast enough it's fine.",1709251208.0

"AskOldPeople","t5_2yg69","I read a lot of comparative mythology and religion years ago. I came to the belief that we are all hard wired to believe in something. That being said, I also think that dogmatic religion at the layman level misses the point. It’s not about have to please a god that has rigid rules and as a reward you exist in some other state after your life. It’s about how you interact with the universe. 

To me, the idea of a god with human emotions and desires is ridiculous and laughable. At the same time, I suspect I am not the highest entity in existence. I describe myself as an agnostic in the classical sense in that I know I cannot prove the existence or nonexistence of god through rational means. At the same time I can have faith in concepts that there could be a creator out there. 

I was raised in Protestant church . I no longer hold those beliefs or even describe myself as a Christian. I do believe that the proper roots of  Christianity are in compassion, which literally means “suffering with”. That’s the hill I am going to die on. I’m going to try to live my life with compassion.",1709251208.0

Not just for the BS but the wayward has to be honest with themselves.  It’s childhood trauma rearing it’s ugly head, because it was never dealt with and they do not know how to cope with life and emotions and disappointments and sadness and are always searching for that dopamine hit. It’s depression that was never recognized and treated. So many things. 
I feel my WH and have made it. He is still working on himself. There are still things that I see being a problem. But now he’s doing therapy and willing to look at those things about himself that he couldn’t face before.  He has a new understanding and a realization that cheating wasn’t “oh I fell in love and couldn’t help it”.

I'm totally making assumptions here so forgive me if I got it all wrong.

I would've taken more time to talk to your daughter and create a safe space to find out why she hasn't told him, and have open dialogue discussions of what she can do. Asking her if she ever thinks about that instance and feels guilty, for example. It seems like she got pissed at you and stormed out, and you responded by immediately telling John...which right there makes you an asshole. Not that you told him in general, but that you didn't make more of an effort to understand your daughter and why she made that decision.

Of course if your daughter had refused to talk to you about the situation further over time, then I'd say maybe she would become the asshole...but I'm a believer that we all have more agency than we think to create safe spaces for people to reach open dialogue.

Either way, you may not be the asshole but you fucked up and you know it. I suggest you become the mediator between John and your daughter so you can bring them together and help them figure out their relationship. Get them into that counseling John is resisting.

A single instance of cheating 3 years prior in a 4 year marriage that has been a 10 year relationship....seems like this is recoverable and this event can bring some better communication into the relationship. Good luck.",1709251209.0

A large number of (almost always female) posters will often find themselves getting a number of chat requests and/or direct messages - oftentimes vulgar or inappropriate. We encourage you to ping the mod team with screenshots - they will be permanently banned. You can also temporarily disable chat and DMs. We feel like this should go without saying, but messaging minors is also not okay. It will result in a report to the admins which more often than not will lead to the loss of your account. DO NOT MESSAGE ANY POSTERS FROM OUR COMMUNITY.

A few notes, if you post (or comment) in this subreddit and you have an OnlyFans account, or if you have posted links to OnlyFans elsewhere on Reddit, our automatic moderation bot will flag your account and you will be banned - we are kid-friendly and E-rated and due to the incessant spamming by literally hundreds of people before you, we've been forced to moderate this subreddit this way. This also includes accounts that post explicit content anywhere else on Reddit.


Please do not SPAM the group with reposts. This means posting a new pic when you've recently posted, or deleting your old post and reposting a new pic a day or two later, especially if you've not interacted with guessers in the first post (aka you're farming karma). We do notice, and that will result in a temporary or permanent ban, depending on how grouchy your mod team is that day.


Please REPORT comments on your post that are creepy, insulting, harassing, comment on your appearance (positive or negative) or otherwise shitty. We do take them seriously and will ban people who behave like this, with no exceptions.


We will delete any posts where we suspect you are posting someone else's photo. You will be banned and asked to provide a verification picture to remove the ban. (Screenshots are a big red flag).


Do not engage with trolls - two wrongs do not make a right. We do take action when comments/posts are reported... give us the time to review, we're not here 24/7.


Any other questions? You can always send your mod team a mail message.

"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","Just for completeness, C1 is very appreciated by many Neuvillette mains because of the comfort the IR provides, allowing you to move more aggressively without a shielder, and the flexibility in team building since it allows you to use Furina (or another character of an element already in the team) without losing the third draconic stack, which is usually a 14~17% team damage increase in those scenarios. Still, I personally think it’s overrated: unless you use Xiangling with Neuvi without a shield, as mentioned earlier you can kite most attacks without problems, also there are scenarios where you can still get the third draconic stack even without 4 elements in the team. [This is an example](https://youtu.be/idEmLeTVAWY?si=cF-cgIYwGWmIX2jn). Neuvillette is also so flexible and resilient that as long as you give him stacks and potentially some buffs you can build many weird but functional teams. [Here I replace Fischl from the previous team with Gorou](https://youtu.be/d5MNWrVWz44?si=Qx1rSr5iWMMl1b8p) for the Petra buff and some crystallise shields that help with interruption while I stay still to maximise my AoE against enemies not perfectly grouped up, or if you promise to not cringe [this was my first experiment with Neuvi in Abyss](https://youtu.be/NYsXWS-sF5c?si=pRGyEtKeXAK7BGTX), using Xiangling for draconic stacks and some vapes with burgeons while Beidou gives me off field damage, some interruption resistance with her burst and other reactions. Just have fun with him, you don’t “need” anything special to make him work, even Kazuha while being among his very best teammates isn’t that necessary.

About 5S to aim for, honestly Fontaine has mixed things up a lot, so now we have Neuvillette and Furina being meta defining, while Nahida still holds amazingly thanks to her amazing potential for dendro, then I would consider characters like Kazuha, arguably Yelan, maybe Raiden (I don’t have her nor I want her tbh)… Arlecchino will likely be playable soon and she might be very strong too, we can’t tell for sure (even though a bird told me she will be).

Once these changes were made, she's suddenly a multiple-time champion and being referred to as a legend.

Cody has used his legacy, but certainly hasn't been handed his entire career on a platter.

So NOT because women won two ultra marathons.

The cops collected the goat and brought it to the auctioneers company and the goat was slaughtered.

I echo what the other poster said. You need to start with a full fecal panel. Go to the vet and ask for the pooper scooper thing and get the samples to your vet. 

Once they can rule out any infections or bacteria or parasite, or any physical reason why he’s constantly having the runs, then you should turn to a diet of elimination. Could be a protein he’s intolerant to, or some ingredient. But right now, a diet change might not be the right approach until you can eliminate other causes first. 

Not sure if you take pup swimming at all. But some dogs can be sensitive to salt water or maybe not so clean fresh water. 

My pup had diarrhoea for 2 weeks straight. Couldn’t sleep due to the pain etc. through this process we figured out she had developed an intolerance to poultry, which was causing her bowels to be inflamed.",1709251213.0

"EasternCatholic","t5_36hva","Mar is a respectful title, nothing else really. All bishops are called ""Mar."" When it comes to the Anaphora of Mar Nestorius, it was not writtne by him, it is just a title ascribed to it. We use it 3 or 5 times a year, I forgot, but my church uses it on Pesaha (Holy Thursday.) It is such a beautiful Anaphora, the latinized eparchies certainly have lost an important treasure of the Church. Now coming to Friday of the Greek  Teachers, it is true that he is one of the three Holy Greek Heirarchs, however, in the Synod of Diamper changed it to Mar Gregorios, Baselios, and Yowanis (St. Gregory, St. Basil, and St John Chrystosom. It is the same as what the Greeks say.) All official prayers dedicated to the Greek Fathers will mention the new list. Sure, some more traditional ones mention Nestorious, like with the Eparchy of Great Britain, but that was a facebook post. I've seen their Ramsha prayer (Vespers) and during the 2nd Karozuza (kinda of like the Litany of Peace) they said Mar Gregorios, Mar Baselios, etc etc. Now are their extreme traditionalists who venerate him? Definitely. But we can't judge them if Rome is fine with venerating Mar Gregorios Palamas or Mar Markose of Ephesus, who in my opinion are much more controversial. And most recent developments argue that Mar Nestorius was actually Orthodox in belief, and many go as far as to blame Mar Cyril of Alexandria for corruption, but that again is another story. I hope this clears things up, people have used this argument against the revival of our ancient traditions.",1709251213.0

They never said “oh wow make sure you immediately mention this to your doctor and get them involved” they just had me keep coming back in for adjustments and electro stim (which i still love and use every day). 
i saw chiro like pretty religiously until 2022 and then i reaaaally researched the stats and science of it all and just decided to quit going.

The reason you see more negative comments here and fewer elsewhere is that all the other platforms are being controlled. They delete comments. Asim has his midgets from his gym who react with fire emojis to everything he says.   
  
Sure, KC44 was great, but he only had a little to do with its success, IMO. Before he arrived, it was already announced, and in the making, yet he took all the credit? What does that say about him, a fraud? Do you think Rome was built in a day? This league has been running for more than five years and was bound to succeed regardless.   
  
All the new fighters are washed out or journeymen, with only a few exceptions. The big hit, Craig Jones, announced he will headlining a UFC Fight Pass event. Where are Pettis and Bendo now? The former leadership seemed to have a vision and was building something from the ground up; this league had an identity. Even before, there were non-karate participants—people from Glory, Taekwondo, and Muay Thai—but the balance was good.   
  
KC has been downgraded to a local MMA show where all you see is a conflict of interest, which is one of the biggest problems with MMA promotions. This was never seen before with KC. For example, Azem's and his favoritism towards his stepson, the Pakistani boy, managed by the 'first lady' is mind-blowing. The Goatshed team has already ruined promotions like Titan and Combate. I don't know how this will be any different. People complain because we had something for this league and are unhappy with most changes. Not all changes are bad, but it is hard to separate because the focus is not on the fighters and the organization but on a twerking coach.

And at the same time, there are people who are against smoking weed but wouldn’t give up their family to the police for it. 

All I was trying to do with my example was to give a situation where hardly nobody would turn on their family for and a situation where a lot of people would turn on them for.

"vedicastrology","t5_2qp1r","Guidelines which will help in getting the right answers:
* G1: Please state a very specific question or topic in your posts title e.g M28, what are the prospects of a PhD education? **Posts about relationships need age and gender included** Posts must have a question in the title or they will be removed.
* G2: Don’t ask what we think of your chart, or what is interesting, or anything general or vague or about fame or mental illnesses. Do not ask for synastry readings since they are too time consuming and this is not a matrimonial forum. **Do not ask for a general reading, only specific questions.**
* G3: For drawing charts use the pinned links in the sticky post or sidebar rule 4. Jhora screenshots will be preferred. Do not post tropical charts or western circular charts. Random site charts can have errors, missing information or issues of readability. **All charts should have the planet degree positions displayed on the chart.** Post full charts, not lists of placements.
* G4: Don't use incorrect terminology such as houses in vargas. e.g - a house in vedic astrology spans 30 degrees in the D1 chart and there are 12 houses, each house in turn contains 9 divisions spanning 3 degrees and 20 mins so we get 12 x 9 = 108 such divisions which are called navamsas. The navamsa chart shows this collection of 108 navamsas and not 12 houses. So statements such as the following are **incorrect** e.g my 7th house in my navamsa chart has venus in it. **A 30 degree portion cannot be inside a 3 degree portion**. Your post will be removed for this.
* G5: general question about placements or yourself or hypothetical stuff require your chart too. Please don't post charts on behalf of other people like your exes or crushes etc.
* G6: If your post does not meet these conditions, please delete it and repost. Otherwise it may be removed. [The subreddit rules are here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/vedicastrology/about/rules)

This ends the Penix speculation in my opinion. He's too old. Can't draft him and have him sit for a whole season or more.

"ftmspunished","t5_addfp","ALERT! Here are some common issues with comments that may result in removal. It is also solid advice and doing you a favor if you were planning on just sending a few characters in response. It’s not too late to edit!

 - Too little effort: only saying “DM me.”

 - Too little consent: introducing a new kink without asking, that the OP did not reference. Try to aim for what seems like is being asked for. With something like a humiliation flair, yes, misgendering or body-shaming can be part of humiliation, but you don’t want to assume if it’s not referenced by OP.

 - Here’s how to horny-comment just right: your comment should interact with the kink (post, title, flair) and person (user flair, profile). If you’d like to play in DMs, you may ask if they’d like to chat further, or go ahead and DM them if they don’t say not to in their post, pinned posts, or bio. The OP can and may also DM you themselves if they like your comment.

He committed bank fraud to get more favorable loan conditions. That's 100% corporate fraud, for a very similar reason to the fact that Ponzi schemes are illegal.

He epitomized roll the basketball out there and see what happens.

No I don't. I said Jerry Green erasure, and then CONCEDED that you could be right about the talent devlopment (I disagree completely but didn't really care to get into it) and then said that Jerry Green was a wild success here and then compared him to his two predecessors.

Is very hard to compare Ghost of Tsushima and Spiderman , 2 Awsome games made with care that are critcally acclaimed from critics and players to SSKTJ a sample of a game that used 9 year of a studio.

All games are repetitive, the action of playing a game is repetition, this game: 

# repetitiveness its beyond most games you played to the point is boring and makes you question how they waist 8-9 year in this.

Also this is live service the requires internet connection all time and till now there is a lot of people that bought this game and still cant play it because of Critical Server Issue,

I would stay away from this game till it reaches deepsale and buy spiderman 2 right now, a game that improves on the original and is a very good game unlike this one sadly.",1709251218.0

Quite possibly the most important thing the game doesnt tell you- the exposed weak points like their armorless butt take only 10% damage from non-explosive weapons. 

They can be frustrating, but it honest sounds like you've farmed your way to level 50 just to max out your level without actually taking the time to learn the mechanics in depth. I could be wrong, and theres no wrong way to play, but Im down at a comparitively paultry level 26 and while they are a genuine threat, they arent nearly as frustrating, at least to me, as your list of complaints make them out to be. Of course thats just my anecodatal stuff, so im not about to discount that im sure they are an absolute pain in the ass, they are difficult when you dont know the tricks.

With the three layers rsninvolvednin zenethal, it's definitely thick enough, plus it's primer, so as long as it's covered it's probably good.

"historyteachers","t5_2t7s5","I usually try to give them examples that have relevance to them and their lives or are, at the very least, the bare bones basics.

I would start with something like: 

Think about a guy making a sandwich. This guy has the bread, the meat, the toppings, but he’s missing his favorite cheese. That guy over there has guy 1’s favorite cheese, and he might be willing to trade for it, but he’s a little worried about what happened last time he tried to trade with guy 1 (guy 1 stole his mayonnaise and promised to bring him a sandwich; he never did).

Not only that, but guy 1 doesn’t necessarily want to trade any of his bread, meat, or toppings because then it would be hard to make a whole sandwich. Maybe they could work together to make a sandwich, but he’s not interested in teamwork. That sandwich is *his*.

So guy 1 steals the cheese anyway. Now the guy with cheese has nothing, and guy 1 gets to enjoy the sandwich all for himself. 

Then you can begin to introduce what each element of this scenario means, symbolizes, etc. It’s stupid, obviously, but if it helps them understand the very basics, I say it’s a win!",1709251219.0

"UFOs","t5_2qhds","After Lazar went public with the George Knapp news series, a bunch of us were inspired to actually go there and check it out. Which we did, long before the whole scene/phenomenon exploded. This was before the internet age, required some interesting gumshoe sleuthing - I did not live in Nevada and ended up calling other Ufologists etc. In 1993 there was a conference in Rachel of sorts, where Lazar and others spoke. We organized a camping trip, grabbed our film/video cameras, and off we went. It was a lot of fun mingling with all the characters there. Also met John Lear and Bill Hamilton, hung out with a reporter from the LA Times. Even met some abductees for whom this event was almost a spiritual pilgrimage. It was a slice. 

I don't doubt the US gov knows more than we do. I don't even doubt there are programs to back-engineer or model UAP craft. That makes sense. But Lazar's tale pulls strongly  from the zeitgeist of the late 80s, it's maybe harder for younger people to sense this, but his story wasn't all that fresh when he got going. Variants of it had been rumored for a long time. What was unique was his element 115/gravity wave/science-geek presentation.

Having met Bob, I think he's (a) smart (b) creative (c) has spun one of the great modern UFO myths. Bob missed his true calling as a Science Fiction author imho. If he had more self-discipline he might have even been able to get past Junior College level physics. But that's not his intellectual strong suit.

"Megaman","t5_2rq0l","Alright, let's get the important stuff out of the way first. I'm gonna try something a bit different with the requests, for the rest of the spin-off games. If you like to submit requests, or just like to look at them, pay attention.  
  
1. I'll start mixing requests, whenever they don't contradict each other. So if a request tells me to beat a boss without sliding, and another tells me to beat the same boss without charging my buster, I'll do both. If you don't want your request to be mixed with someone else's, make sure to specify that, and I'll respect and abide by your choice, no ifs, no buts.   
2. Until we get to the X series, you'll only need to submit your request once, during the entirety of a game. So if you submit a request for Wily today, and don't re-submit it later, I'll still do it when we get to Wily, and you'll still be credited. No need to submit it right before Wily. This will be the case for every single boss. So let's say that Person A submits a request for Oil Man. But for 4 days in a row, I don't do Oil Man, leaving him for last. During these 4 days, Person A won't need to re-submit their request, as I'll note it down, and possibly cover it when I finally decide to do Oil Man.  
  
I have no idea if this format is here to stay or not, it really depends on how things go. But right now, is the perfect time to experiment with it. We're just messing around with the non-canon stuff for a few days, so it won't hurt to change this rule. If you're wondering why I decided to do this, welp, it's for two reasons. One for each point. For the first point, I think mixing requests could add a lot to these videos, by making them more complex, harder, whatever. As for the other point, I think it'll encourage more people to submit requests, without having to deal with submitting them over, and over, and over again. Let me know what you think of the changes, and if they should be here to stay, or nah. We're keeping these rules until we get to the X series, no matter what.   
  
We decided on the non-canon spin-offs we'd be covering. Here's the list.  
  
\>Mega Man 3 DOS  
\>Mega Man & Bass Challenger From The Future  
\>Mega Man Powered Up  
\>Street Fighter X Mega Man  
  
If there's a game that you think should be included, let me know, by suggesting it. I'm open to any and all suggestions, but make sure you specify how I should handle the game's requests. I excluded some non-canon stuff due to them not being compatible with the request/daily format.   
  
Thanks for the request, u/KonroMan & u/EL4702 ! Alright, so! This is our first double request in the series, I believe. Here's what Konro's request asked me to do:  
\>Beat Bit Man while only hitting him with Torch Arm once every cycle, whenever he charges at you, like a bull fight.  
And here's what EL's request asked me to do:  
\>Beat Bit Man while only hitting him once every cycle, whenever you're between him and his projectile,  
So, I mixed both, and here we are! Bit Man can only be hit when he's doing his charge animation, and that's his only attack, so mixing these two worked juuuust fine. Even if I were to do them individually, this method would still work for both. I don't have much to say about this video as a whole. Bit Man's fight is pretty bland, and I recorded this in just half an hour. 25 minutes out of said half an hour were me getting Torch Man's weapon, and going through the stage. Speaking of stages... Rant time!  
This game has the worst level design in the entire franchise. Every stage, as far as I can tell, is a literal labyrinth. Background objects and platforms blend together constantly. There's a shit ton of unkillable enemies. And the stages themes make no fucking sense. TORCH Man's stage is a sewer (Wave Man and Shark Man are a thing in this game). BIT Man's stage is an Oil Factory (Oil Man is a thing in this game). I'll let you in on more dumb shit like this as I experience the game.   
  
One down! Five to go!:  
  
\>Torch Man  
\>Shark Man  
\>Wave Man  
\>Oil Man  
\>Blade Man  
  
Also, there's no intro card for the bosses in this game. Me and my friend, u/Shy__Frost , had to come up with something, and we ended up recreating the one in the first game. Shy's the one who did all the editing and whatnot. He's also the person who's been making the borders for every emulated game.   
  
That's all for today, everyone! Stay safe, and I'll see ya tomorrow!",1709251220.0

Things like this happen in projects all the time, and when it's a 12V or 5V thing, it's not going to hurt someone.  But when it's mains, that's a different story.  There's 1800W (US) or 2300W (UK) on that circuit that is just waiting for path to dissipate.  The project has to be designed to protect against that.

I've had to learn a lot about mains protection recently (and thankfully, I'm up to speed now), and this is the reason that all mains-powered devices are supposed to be certified.  (Don't get me started on the foreign-made specials that claim to be certified but aren't).  Especially with a device that's supposed to get up to 245C in temperature, the protection needs to be there otherwise it's a fire/electrocution hazard.",1709251220.0

I am visibly trans, and my voice is fucking abysmal. I have made out-of-work friends with a few coworkers and I'm on chatty terms with most of them in the office.

You know how many times me being trans has come up? Zero times. Not once. Not ever. Because I don't make it my personality (not saying you do) and honestly if you meet me, it's one of the least interesting things about me. I have a fuckload of other hobbies and interests I've poured my soul into and those are what I use for staring points talking to people.

You know how it goes. I hate it so much but there is literally nothing to do I can't just isolate myself because I'm embarrassed about it or I'll fucking kms.

First, let’s assume they magically had a space bodysuit, because the actual Apollo suits weighed 30 pounds…in lunar gravity.

[Wired actually did a piece on this](https://www.wired.com/story/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-physics-of-running-on-the-moon/), and found that people could run faster…in a straight line, because not having to spend as much force on pushing up against gravity means you can push more in the horizontal direction.

Unfortunately, the problem is turning. The friction force in a circular turn is proportional to how much the ground pushes up on a person, so the necessary friction force to make a turn is lower under F = mv^2 / R, but remember that the person is also going faster so they’d need to make much wider turns. It’s the same reason why you can’t make tight turns on ice if you’re driving too fast.",1709251221.0

"ElderScrolls","t5_2s2ja","should have clarified recent elder scrolls

and even then i should’ve clarified modern BGS in general lol

i’ve heard some good things about the storytelling in ESO (for an MMO) obviously intermingled with the criticisms of how it butchered certain lore

but no redguard, morrowind, obviously daggerfall and other games that floated around that time period imho executed roleplaying elements and the ideologies that accompany them much better. since then the only choices you have are violence or refraining, with no way to change factions from the outside *or* the inside. like, are you pro forsworn? do cihdna mine and then leave them alone cuz they stay hostile. anti forsworn? cihdna mine and then keep killing them. anti thalmor? kill them on the roads with no major difference in the world after. pro thalmor? walk away. n i obviously don’t have to get into the whole deal with Paarthunax, consensus on that has been repeated enough.

not to be the typa bitch to needlessly flick my bean to daydreams about Morrowind and FNV but going from games where you could choose incompatible factions and change them from within (Morrowind) and where the guy you spend the first chunk of the game finding can be fucked in his hotel and then freed from his fascist captives (FNV) to a game where people can do.. *obviously* unethical and inconsistent shit without the player ever really engaging with that is a letdown. like if modern Bethesda did FNV you’d have to kill Benny no matter what and if you didn’t want to you’d have to avoid the main quest (or maybe his death would be inevitable some other way anyhow.) like, we really can’t ask Ulfric about the segregation in his city? we can’t kill ulfric until the story decides we get to? we really can’t ask Delphine about the Paarthunax issue beyond “remind me why you want him dead?” and then choose between more than “do or do not kill him”? like fuck lol, can you give me more than two competing teams that have the same core ideology? and if not, can you give me something to say or do within that? can you make it seem morally grey instead of two seemingly equal evils that give you no freedom to engage with members of each faction in an actual convo abt that? endless examples of that approach to storytelling and choice n i could obviously go on but like be fr yk",1709251221.0

And you should expect that doing so will immediately cause him to escalate because just his texts drip abusive mentality so aggressively that everyone here picked up on it immediately.

From now on, treat him like you've divorced. If he's hungry, he needs to feed himself. If he's upset that he's not receiving the care and attention he wants, he's free to go find it. He wants you to stop thinking? No problem, you're done thinking about him. If it's not about your daughter, there's no reason to discuss it.

- claims that he works two jobs, a “day” job from noon until 8pm ish (if I remember correctly) and then he’ll drive for Uber all night, and go to bed around 5am


- claims that part of why he has to work so much is because the “funds weren’t used properly” without him knowing, so he’s still paying for what they owe on their previous apartment


- claims that because of this misappropriation of funds he’s now losing the apartment he’s currently in, as well as the down payment he had made on it 


- claims he’s been lied to and that Isabel was never truthful


- claims his underwear business is done and he now has absolutely nothing, “starting from ground zero”",1709251221.0

"AmericaBad","t5_10gh3w","Blue Samurai,

Their basic argumentation would go that either   
1. the US isn't a continuation of American Indian society, or else   
2. the American Indians weren't developed enough to count as ""history"" before they became literate.

The first argument seems legitimate, but you could also argue the contrary. So for instance on one hand, George Washington fought wars against the American Indians to pacify them, which is an example of the US and colonists conquering the American Indians. But on the other hand, the English and American colonists  did have American Indian allies. So the issue is multi-sided.

The second argument is kind of pedantic or supremacist. Some people argue that history depends on records like literature, and they count American Indians as a ""prehistoric"" society. This seems kind of debatable. The American Indians did have ""oral history"", and the Puebloans did build impressive stone and brick cities. They weren't ""cave men"" with grunts for language. On the European scale of development, I suppose that they would count as ""Copper Age"" because they had copper tools.

American Indians have actually been a long part of American textbooks going back to the mid 19th century at least. Europeans and European settlers as a whole probably had a mix of respect, arrogance, and discrimination toward the American Indians since Columbus' time up into the 20th century. Probably there are cases where it still occurs.",1709251221.0

There’s nothing wrong with making the first home a rental, if anything, given the current rates, they will probably profit. Once a solid tenant is secured, there’s also absolutely nothing wrong with saving for a down payment and buying a second home. Most can do it with 5% down as well.",1709251222.0

"Philippines","t5_2qjov","Was walking earlier sa One Ayala on the way home from work. Felt a little lost, daming iniisip. Stressed sa work, sa mga gastusin. Also wasn't feeling great since kulang ako sa tulog. So I was at my lowest, both physically and emotionally.

Habang naghihintay ako ng bus, biglang kumalam tiyan ko. Sakto may stall na nagbebenta ng hotdog sandwich sa gilid. So lumapit ako para bumili, nahihiya pa ako magtanong kung open na since nagseset-up palang si Ate na seller.

Siguro sobrang lakas ng vibes ko na pagod na sa buhay, naramdaman ata ni Ate. Tinigil niya ginagawa niya para tanungin kung okay lang ako. Ako naman, saktong ""Okay lang po, pagod lang haha"" kasi nakakahiyang magbreakdown sa gitna ng bus station.

So bumili ako ng isang hotdog sandwich, tapos nung kinakain ko na, tangina solid. Alam niyo yung bagong luto yung hotdog, tas fresh na fresh yung bun na umuusok pa? Solid talaga, as in. Not to be dramatic pero parang gumaan loob ko bigla. Naiyak akonng onti randomly. It's the little things that count nga talaga minsan.

It also seems like the ship could trivially defend itself just fine from the admech and marines boarding in the story - so crew staying on the ship should in turn also have been fine. It seems like the laziest form of writing to wholly ignore the amount of suspension of disbelief necessary to accept that its entire crew was that suicidally inept and poorly equipped without environmental suits, weapons, armor, utility  fog, drone servants, transport vehicles, teleporters, tractor beams, mass drivers, shields, or any other technology that would immediately render them immune from angry primitives.",1709251222.0

First, if you wouldn't kill it, maybe you shouldn't be eating it. That's just cowardly. 

Second, buying and consuming meat makes a market for... meat. If no one ate it, they'd stop producing it. 

Also, just on a basic level, eating the flesh off a corpse is disgusting. 

Your grandma dies. Are you going to eat her (or let your friend make grandma roast)? What's wrong with that? You didn't kill her, so seems fine, right?

>. However, I am not convinced (yet) that this is a great argument. The effect of my individual actions on encouraging the $1.6 trillion meat market is surely so minuscule that it's morally irrelevant.

This is the dopiest thing, honestly. Your vote doesn't matter either. Or if you kill just one person, right? It's just one. Morally irrelevant.

"Libraries","t5_2qidr","So, based on other comments, it looks like the reason for the denial has to do with their policies (very interesting reading, tbh! we don't charge for our rooms or require insurance).

At our library, we'd allow your request. But, we're a small city on the east coast, not LAPL. Sadly, I'm jaded enough to say that I like how exclusive their rules are, if only because ours are so permissive that groups have abused the situation. As a librarian, in a system that big with a population that diverse, I kind of get their reasoning even if it doesn't seem to make sense with the library ethos. The rules come about for a reason, and I'm guessing their rooms must be in very high demand and/or they've had some pretty serious issues in the past. It's LA, so both are likely. I'm just spit balling/speculating here.

I wonder... is there a table/area where you could just setup and do it in the library proper? You'd have to be flexible and possibly just do it on the fly, but they may be able to recommend a good time for you to come. People do this all the time at our library. Bring your own stuff, clean up your mess, don't make a huge scene or a TON of noise (normal noise is ok!)... we wouldn't even blink at you (assuming the group isn't like 10-15 people).",1709251223.0

"Elektron","t5_2u82u","My approach FWIW (and I also use Samples From Mars samples)…

1) Create a super logical and clear subfolder structure within your own personal ‘Digitakt samples’ folder on your computer. I have something like *Drums > Drum Machines > Roland > 909* with multiple sub branches at each point (eg Linn instead of Roland, and 808 instead of 909 etc etc). The goal is to make it really fast and obvious where specific types of samples are stored within your main sample folder. 

2) Once you have got your samples folder sorted, import the whole thing into the DT Drive+ using Transfer. Transfer will import all sub-folders (and sub sub folders) intact. 

3) When you realise that there are certain samples you use regularly (eg a 909 kick or a 808 clap or whatever), get the track settings the way you want (amp, filter, delay etc) and then save the sound into your sound library. Over time you’ll build up a kind of core library of specific sample+track settings (ie sounds) that you can also tag for easy searching. The more you do it, the more comprehensive that sounds library will become over time. Just don’t forget to back it up to your computer (via Transfer again) regularly!",1709251224.0

**Is this post from a sextortion scammer?**

Sextortion scammers often visit personal request subreddits like this one and coerce victims into sending sexual images of themselves, then threaten to share these images unless you comply with their demands. Below are some signs this poster may be a sextortion scammer. Please report any post you come across that breaks our rules!

1. This poster wants to communicate on Instagram, Snapchat, Discord, Kik, Telegram or any other app where you may inadvertently give out personal details about yourself, family, friends, school, employer or any other entity that may be used against you in a blackmail attempt.

2. This poster wants you to send them compromising images of yourself. A sextortion scammer will likely threaten to send these photos to your relatives, friend group, crush, and/or employer unless you obey their demands.  

3. This post contains references to ""Friends With Benefits"" and/or ""Long-Term Relationships"". The false impression that a deepened relationship is possible may lead you to let your guard down and ignore red flags.

4. This post is targeted towards readers from a specific city, state or country. Knowing your location helps sextortion scammers narrow down their search of your personal information. The false hope that an in-person hookup is possible may also lead you to let your guard down and ignore red flags.

5. Sextortion scammers often use default, randomly generated Reddit usernames along the lines of ""Adjective_Noun_1234"" instead of thoughtful usernames. Since these accounts are reported and banned so frequently, scammers often do not take the extra time to create a meaningful username.

6. A common theme amongst suspected sextortion posts in this community is the inclusion of various kinks in the original post. If you read a post where the OP says something along the lines of, ""Here are my kinks:"", proceed with caution.

As far as I know Texas doesn't really regulate this kind of fee. Everything's set up so landlords can terminate leases in a hurry but tenants have to go through court procedures for remedies. 

Your best bet is probably to start talking to your neighbors, form a group, and get a lot of people to threaten to not renew at the same time. The main reason shit sucks is people forgot there's always more people at the bottom than the top.

And we have not endured since the Bronze Age by neglecting the traditions of our ancestors.  

Do you love her enough to keep Shabbat, keep kosher, fast on Yom Kippur and other fast days, go to shul regularly, get circumcised, circumcise your sons, clean for Pesach, hold a seder, check your wool suit for linen, say blessings before meals and longer ones after?  Are you fascinated by this enough to break up with her for a year or three while you study and practice these things, because a beit din won't take you seriously if they think that your interest in Judaism is contingent on a romantic relationship?

"NPD","t5_2u6be","Naah, G, I can't imagine that. That's very schizoid. I was observing myself the past 2 days. I went to work at the office and almost all of my colleagues were there. Usually I am the funny guy a.k.a. the clown and guess what, it's precisely for the reason that it's one of the things that has always brought me ''validation'' from others. 

And even though I was observing myself and how I acted, even though I'd catch myself starting to SWIM (*I'm telling you, it's like ecstasy, almost like a rush of adrenaline levels of joy*) in the validation that the others give me in the form of laughs, I'd still couldn't really control it.   
  
The ego has an insatiable hunger for validation, and it is so in control (apparently) that the DAMN impulses make me say one joke after another, and it basically makes me not be able to stop until I try HARD AF to control the urge to say something. And having strong ADHD tendencies doesn't help at all, to be fair. 

So it's almost the same as it was before ''becoming self-aware'' - I just catch and analyse myself waaay more now. Which I guess is some start, but we'll see about that, I wouldn't be surprised if it only ends up making me self-loathe even more for not being able to control myself.",1709251225.0

Since God by definition created all concepts including the basic concept of ""idea"" (which was according to you discovered by the ancient Greeks), creation cannot logically be a process based on an idea, no matter how perfectly precise. The concept of an idea, and then the specific idea itself, would have to be created first, and only then could the world be ""created"" by a perfectly precise conceptualization of the aforementioned idea, which would only be true because Kant says so without any logical or evidential basis of any sort.

Palestine/Israel/Zion/ whatever you want to call it can only have one nation of people. 80 years of two states hasn’t worked, there’s too much animosity that is baked into the identity of both groups. I’ve never seen two groups of people hate each other this much and they claim the same land so its impossible to properly separate them to maintain peace through distance. Even with militarized borders, a UN presence, and outside powers trying to maintain a status quo there is always conflict. I dont just mean soldiers shooting each other. I mean they are trying to erase the other group from existence. 

To identify as an Israeli or Palestinian means that the other side are intruders on your LITERAL God-given land. Therefore this is a God-sanctioned holy war where your violence is righteous, just and expected. Theres some optimists that say they can get along but they’ve shown they can’t unless they abandon their religious beliefs (impossible) or leave the region forever (unlikely).",1709251226.0

Fuuko can't control her powers even in loop 101. She can now redirect through specific means, but she knows that how much of a risk she is.  People know her, but knows that her power is dangerous. 

* Possession vs Uncontrollable Power. 

It doesn't really matter if it is permanently, but the fact that they died matters.

We certainly don't know what is the approach UU Series going to take. 

* Would the characters are the same as their past versions?
* Or same soul, but varies too much to be even considered the same person now. 
   * As I said before, is Gina (100) the same as Gina (101)? Same Tragedy, but completely different experiences. 
   * If not, it would be Gina (100) is permanently dead. Gina (101) is considered her own character.

Loop 100 version are all officially dead except for Andy and Fuuko if we follow the 2nd approach. I think people believe the 2nd approach more as people aren't treating Juiz and Julia as same characters.

This is an interesting conversation.

I think the reason why you think Yuji suffer more is due how each series handles their conviction. 

* Yuji had a normal life which spirally into chaos where he has the most vile being living inside him. 
   * Like other shounen, he tries to give himself a resolve. However unlike others, his resolve shatters numerous times.
   * He isn't like other main characters, he got a breaking point
   * His final resolve is a suicide mission to make sure Sukuna goes down so the fallen could rest in peace. 
* Fuuko had a shitty life since she was a little girl. 
   * Andy gave her hope and introduce a new world to her. 
   * She went from depressing to hopeful. 
   * Her final resolve is to ensure everyone makes it out alive giving everyone a happy ending.",1709251226.0

"wec","t5_2tr3a","The only series I can think of that does endurance races without an IMSA/WEC style class structure is the GT world challenge. Even then, they have different classes for different calibres of drivers.

Any endurance race will naturally have traffic. Larger differences in speed simply offer more of a challenge for the drivers through passing/managing being passed. There's a saying the no 2 laps are the same at le mans for this reason.

So how does the GTWC create that traffic when everyone is in the same type of cars? By having a massive number of them. 70 cars at last year's spa 24h. That's 70 cars for 7km . Or 1 car every 100m. Even then, WEC and imsa are more interesting.

Here's a thought exercise to make the point more clear. If an F1 race was 6h, would it be interesting? It would be novel sure. But it wouldn't be as interesting to watch as a WEC race.",1709251227.0

Mizuchi-hen > Himeutsugi-hen > Karakurenai/Utsutsu-hen > Iroha-hen

Every LI in the game has routes in each game except for in Iroha-hen. Utsutsu *only* shows up starting Karakurenai/Utsutsu-hen

When playing the routes I recommend leaving Iroha’s route for last because it has the most plot. It’s optional for the first two games but it’s mandatory in the third game, and the fourth game is purely Iroha’s, no other routes. Also when playing the third game, leave Utsutsu’s route as your last route before Iroha’s",1709251227.0

"MarkMyWords","t5_2xezv","Everyone has the legal right to challenge election results through the legal system. That's the right of every candidate and every American. No democrat has a problem with the fact that Trump challenged the election results in court and asked for recounts in places he was entitled to them. That's his right. The problem is that EVERY. SINGLE. CASE. was ruled against him. He didn't win a single one. Most people with more than two brain cells to rub together understand that when 100% of your legal challenges don't pan out, you're the common denominator. But Trump and MAGA do not get this. Also, I'm pretty sure your single example that you're waiting to bust out is Stacy Abrams, who ADMITTED she did not get enough votes. Her legal challenge was almost entirely based on a legit criticism that Kemp did potentially illegal things *before* the election to help him win. And there is actually no question that he DID do those things, like clear the voter rolls disproportionally of registered democrats and reducing polling locations in democratic areas. Not letting, or making it significantly harder for, voters of a certain political inclination to vote should, by all reasonable logic, be illegal. But the courts are heavily republican so they allow it. What democrats claim is that it unfairly reduces democratic votes and tilts results to not be representative of the constituency, which it almost certainly does. Similarly, democrats have challenged electoral maps in many places. That is a legal right they have, and they do it before the election. AND they have won a majority of those cases! Democrats have asked for recounts in races, that is also legal. What they have not done is tried to bribe or talk *government officials* into changing election results, *stopped the counting of ballots*, or *physically attempted to prevent official results from being legally enacted.* All of that has been done by republicans, and not even all of them by Trump.",1709251227.0

Most popular form of media overall worldwide is live-action television, by far. More specifically, in terms of genre, dramas and comedy shows tend to go hand in hand as being the most popular, at least specifically in the US (but globally too I’d wager).

"Healthygamergg","t5_26y265","well, the good news is that you are at least getting to a first date. that means that people are initially interested in you at the very least. i wouldnt be so quick to draw the conclusion that youre somehow messing things up though. dating is hard and the people of the world are fickle, our attention spans are short and we are impatient and want immediate gratification. if you are online dating, this is the type of person youre likely running into - someone who might want love but they are not really ready for it. so if they dont feel a magical spark right away, they write the whole thing off completely. because theyre trying to fill a void or avoid the inner work they have to do rather than trying to connect person-to-person (and i suspect you might be doing the same given how closely your self-worth seems to be tied to how dating is going). 

although its possible that you are doing something off-putting or hurtful, it could just be a coincidence. sometimes the other person just isnt vibing with us, they're not feeling it. that's not a reflection of something being wrong with us, we're just not for them. besides, even if it was your doing and they ran away because of something you did, an emotionally mature person would talk to you about it. they'd give you the benefit of the doubt and try to understand you and work together with you to come to a solution that works for both of you. 

but the problem is that many people prefer to avoid conflict, especially with people theyre not that close to because its just not worth the trouble. these people youre meeting are not invested enough in you to do that. which brings me to my next point. you gotta stop online dating dude. there's no structure in it, so there's not much motivation there. people are lazy. if they don't have to be somewhere, they won't be. at least, not for long. 

focus on your hobbies and interests and meet people through those. meet for reasons other than dating and befriending people. you need to have a common goal that forces you to be in the same vicinity. i strongly suggest meeting people in an organic way, without the intention of dating. dont expect anything out of the situation. instead, let it unfold and be curious about what will happen. dont try to force or predict a specific outcome. stay blindfolded (figuratively speaking), stop trying to jump ahead to the ending.

let liking and momentum develop naturally, flirt if it feels right, accept their flirting too if it feels right, and THEN ask if they wanna take it in a romantic direction. let it build up first. many people are slow to warm up to others and just generally unmotivated about everything, that includes dating. so no offense but they are not gonna be too interested in a stranger who they have no reason to care about.

you want people to like you? you want them to want more of you? that comes from time. you need to spend more and more time together. buy yourself some time so that they (and you) can develop an emotional attachment. without it, nobody's gonna be putting an effort. unless it's out of desperation the way you're doing. i say this with love, i hope im not coming off disrespectful because thats not how i feel. im not looking down on you at all. i know what it's like to have a love void and be desperate. the stuff im telling you is stuff that i personally am working on, but damn is it hard to let go of attachment to outcomes and i still find myself wanting to fast-track intimacy and get to the relationship part already. but it doesn't work like that.
 
and btw, nothing is ever really personal. whether someone likes you or dislikes you has very little to do with you and has more to do with the associations they've formed throughout their life experiences. sometimes we will remind people of negative associations they've got stored and they're just not gonna like us. other people will be the opposite. the traits one person hates in us may be loved by someone else who has developed a completely different set of associations throughout their life. 

youre just fine. there is nothing wrong with you.",1709251229.0

For me specifically our house hold went from two cars to one. 

It's been a savings since day 1 for us in terms of cost for two car payments/insurance/ gas. 

I think I recall reading for the general population that it will take I think anywhere from 4-6 year or 130k KM to average out the cost of owning an EV over an ICE vehicle to cover that extra cost. Which some can afford, but many can't, especially in this economy.

Unless the federal government seizes control over EV distribution of charging I don't think we will see full EV adoption like we want to for 2035 honestly.

"ZeroCovidCommunity","t5_7a63lg","This stuff is happening worldwide with regular people, health authorities, and governments. I just spent a month in NZ visiting my partner, and almost no one but us and a few older people were wearing masks there, even though his region has numbers starting to tick way up now that it's the end of their summer and school is back in session. A high school had to close on its second day back from holiday break because 40 teachers were sick with Covid. It's in the media, but not on a grand scale, and with the more right leaning government the country recently elected, the country that had one of the best covid policies and reactions is going in the far opposite direction. People from there on a local post were asking if everyone is getting sick with Covid again and a bunch of people said it was ripping through their workplaces. Others said they weren't getting Covid leave anymore and had to go in sick.   


Hell, I'm really pissed off on my partner's behalf today. He posted a link on their family chat group with info about the updated vax becoming available there in early March. Two of his brothers (men in their 40s and 50s) responded, ""What is Covid, I've never heard of it?"" and the other said, ""Yes, you just have to get with it, don't let it rule your life. (GF) and I had the flu that was far worse than Covid."" He responded back with some info about higher chances of LC with each infection and the brother just responded with some stupid meme pic being a total dick. Hell, even his elderly parents aren't all that cautious even though his mom has some serious health issues and got Covid in the hospital when she went in for another problem. They had it again before he was set to visit me last summer even though they assured him they'd wear masks and be extra careful in the weeks leading up to his departure. We lost a week together that was 3 years in the making because of their carelessness since he was potentially exposed and had to wait it out to make sure he was ok. It's all just so selfish and maddening. 

I told them how bad it was in the US this winter, and it looks like it's already coming their way. Gave them the latest info and told them it would be wise to wear their masks again. I hope some of it got through. Thankfully my partner has his own space, but can't avoid them completely. If we can wear an N95 for 16 hours straight on a plane, then they can wear one for a 30 min trip to the fucking grocery store.",1709251230.0

Actually, their behavior indicated they didn't want the cops there. A third party who does not live at the home called the cops, invited them inside, and cops didn't bother to ask who owned the place or whether the witness had authority.

Judge rules against us, and I ask about the implied consent argument, stating the DA's response didn't disclose any supporting authority for that argument, and I didn't come across any during my research. Judge said ""Mr. Tingle, let's just say I'm not surprised.""

"delta","t5_2scjv","I have traveled with dogs and cats, both in the passenger cabin and under the plane on multiple airlines, and what I have learned is that despite the published policy, it is completely up to the person in front of you how they will interpret that policy.  

One time, I have arrived at the airport (like the OP) with triple confirmation only to be turned away, I was supposed to bring my dog with me on the plane only to be told she had to go under the plane (I had the airline policy printed out and highlighted with me, but the ticket agent wasn't having it).  She also made me buy (a very expensive) hard sided carrier as the soft sided one that I was going to have my small dog ride in under the seat couldn't be checked under the plane.  Again, this was her personal interpretation that didn't align with the airline's published policy online.  The  supervisor backed her.  Despite protests, escallations, calls, and emails even after the trip, the airline just sort of shrugged and said, ""yeah, that's our policy, but the agent has the final say"".  

VERY frustrating!  I understand why people circumvent trying to do the right thing and just saying that their pet is a service animal.  Trying to do the right thing in these instances can sometimes be far worse than cheating the system.",1709251232.0

They may have found a playstyle that works for now (a bandaid solution), but this team has fundamental issues. They generally don’t understand how certain comps should be played out, or how to play to their comps win cons.
They pick scaling and opt into early fights, or pick early game and do nothing. Or pick  poke and play it in any other way than a poke comp

They also lack the understanding of which players need to be played around in certain comps.

While this teams ceiling is so high, rn their fundamentals and floor is so low that i wouldn’t be surprised if they limp into playoffs and then just end up losing in quarters. The other teams have raised their floors and improved fundamentals, which is why the league is so competitive

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","I went to Planned Parenthood when I first got pregnant. It was too early at that point to see anything. They prescribed me prenatal, did a urine sample, and gave me a bunch of information. Also was able to ask them questions about any symptoms, what to eat/not eat, etc. I went back again two weeks later and they gave me another transvaginal ultrasound and was able to see baby. They offered help to set up prenatal stuff with a doctor as well. They don’t do any appointments past the confirmation and setting you up to get care for your pregnancy, though. 

This was all under the [Pregnancy Access Bridge](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-orange-san-bernardino/patients/services/pregnancy-access-bridge) appointment. 

It helped to ease my mind and get me started. Not sure if 12 weeks is too late but they still might be able to help.",1709251233.0

"KingdomHearts","t5_2s3jo","Disney adds as much if not less than FF. You could have removed all the Disney from KH3 and the actual story would have been the same. KH doesn't need FF, but it doesn't need Disney either. This is even more true now with them going to entirely new world with a new story arc focused on Strelitzia who has no Disney ties, and the old union leaders who have no Disney ties. You could soft reboot the series here to have only original characters and it wouldn't actually lose anything as far as core story is concerned. 

The Disney world's are at their best when they are used to expand upon the themes and emotional arcs characters are going through. The final fantasy worlds were then used to progress the story and the series is at its best when those two elements would combine together such as Maleficent tempting Riku while Sora makes new friends. If those worlds aren't doing that, which I would argue the didn't in KH3, they serve no purpose other than filler and fanservice and could be replaced with anything else.",1709251233.0

"shacomains","t5_37875","... Here's the thing: Current, and past Shaco - has always had a Kit that enables him to be a menace **TO ANY UNAWARE Medium to Low HP CARRY -** While at the same time, being a CONTROL MAGE.

Hence why we have the divide with AD/AP - When he should REALLY be a FULL HYBRID.

Since we effectively DO NOT have Hybrid items anymore (Because of ""Balance"" Issues - lmao) - You generally get stuck with choosing ONE or the Other; Or just do Everything - But MUCH worse than if you picked ONE thing to do (Which is why  most people choose either Full AD or Full AP).

IF we had proper HYBRID items - then Shaco's power potential would SPIKE like CRAZY, and he would promptly be permanently banned and then nerfed the next patch.

So yeah - Shaco's identity is the same as always; but since we don't have proper Hybrid items, we cannot PROPERLY use Shaco to his kits FULL potential - we always have to choose which parts of the Kit we want to focus on, rather then getting the full effect of ALL of the Kit - like MOST OTHER CHAMPS GET.

Tbh - I believe it is intentional; because if we could Properly use the FULL power of Shacos kit; Shaco would be God-tier and more or less unkillable once he got a kill or two.",1709251233.0

In short, trying to bring yourself from extremes of ""fight or flight"" into ""all's fine.""  To accomplish this, I find body-centered activities more helpful (after all  your BODY and brain have decided trauma is happening NOW with lots of emotions and adrenaline, etc. racing).

Regulator says: assume you can invest in some risk free asset like bonds.

To work out how many of these assets you need now to cover your liability, you discount at the risk fee rate.

Insurer says: wait, we don’t invest in risk free stuff, we actually invest in these bonds with higher  yields. That means we should be able to use a higher discount rate. Let’s say our bonds return risk free + 2%

Regulator says: that 2% uplift on the risk free rate is good, but there’s a reason they yield more. That 2% is made up of some credit risk component and a liquidity component. We don’t want you reducing your liabilities by taking on more credit risk, so we’re not letting you discount by the full additional 2%. Let’s work out how much the liquidity component contributes to the 2% and we’ll let you discount using that amount instead.

End result is insurer gets to discount their liabilities at the yield they get on their corporate bonds, minus the premium they get for taking on credit risk.",1709251233.0

Instead, that power is checked by the legislative system. So if a sitting president were to murder a US citizen, the first hurdle is whether the action or actions taken or ordered by the president was part of their acting as the chief executive. If it was then it is up to the house to impeach and the senate to try him. If it wasn't, say the president was joyriding and ran someone over, then immunity would likely be denied.

I think no matter what the experience is, we just have to ask ourselves what is more likely: that god exists and is communicating with me, or I am on some level mistaken about what I think I am experiencing. I think to assume the former is quite hubristic. 

>then wouldn't rejecting all of those kinds of experiences mean you completely reject trust in your senses and/or sanity?

No, because we can already recognise that there can be things that we can be wrong/delusional about, without assuming that the senses are always faulty. By this logic you would be commited to rejecting trust the senses after a single instance of being taken in by an optical illusion.",1709251235.0

In countries where debit cards are more common, card fees are ridiculously low. Denmark's Dankort was free when it was introduced in the 1980's - because government funded it - but nowadays transaction fees are ~20 cents, no percentage.

All the Nordic countries have national mobile payment solutions backed by all the major banks, giving people free, instant money transfer between each other, and companies and organisations can receive payments for a low fixed fee of ~20 cents as well.

"atletico","t5_2v6bc","I said this in the match tread. I'm just gonna post it again here.

The problem, in my POV, is the game plan more than the players. Criticize the players all you want but what I see is that our players don't have any passing option most of the time when they receive/have the ball.

I think the problem is that we don't attack in the middle at all. We don't even have players standing in the middle of our team. Our midfielders either have to drop to the back line to build up or to stand in the front line to wait for the ball to score. Our midfield is basically empty recently. In this match, we stands like a circle (forwards-wings-defenders) around opponent almost all the time. That made our opponent had it all in the middle and our players will have to run their ass off to defend every single time we lose the ball. We just have no one standing there to defend or cut the ball, let alone providing any attacking threat. I think we played in the middle more in the beginning of the season (which our performance was insane). 

Another point (which is more or less the same point above) is that there's no one supporting or providing passing options for each other at all. When we played really good in the beginning of the season, our players basically were rich of options as everyone helped providing it constantly. We were passing in the final third a LOT in the beginning of the season. Now, we pass so little, always try to run first instead of passing. Our combination play is just completely gone. Lacking of systematic play or combination play means we have to rely on individual skill more, to the extend that our players basically have to be Messi at this point with this lack of supporting by teammates. They just be so alone when they have the ball.

So, this is on Cholo, if you ask me. I don't hate him and I don't want him to go. I wish he will fix this soon. I believe we'll be far better if we fix this. Getting rid of half of the players isn't very practical and we played so good with the same squad only few months ago.",1709251236.0

So, do you dare to grasp this opportunity and embrace the wisdom of conceding when the battle is lost? Or shall you persist in your folly, entangled in the web of your own misjudgments? The choice, my friend, is yours to make.",1709251237.0

"MemeVideos","t5_36r7b","I dont consider myself a homophobe or somebody who detests gay, lesbian, transgender or whatever the hell else people. 

But I feel like the LGBTQ movement has definitely made people alot more scared to speak their mind, especially on the internet and especially when the situation demands for it.

I think this is due to the movement being, for lack of a better word, a bit ""snowflakey"". I also believe that this is why alot of people act this way towards the LGTBQ. Sometimes it will stem from real hate, but usually not. The situation is a lot more nuanced than most people make it out to be.

But I'm not gay or transgender or whatever so maybe you have a different perspective to share which I would be happy to hear.",1709251237.0
"askgaybros","t5_2vgfw","Since you took some time to read what I said . 

Well he didn’t tell me a thing about being hetero romantic I didn’t even know he was into women to be begin with . 

I was finishing my treatment when we met and he proposed to help me bring my stuff back to my car cause I was weak . The. When I ringed that bell to say I’m finally tumor free he kissed me . That was a month ago right . I thought that’s it that’s my man . Then he said hold on I said what … 

He said that he was bi .. since I got burned before by one who left me as soon as I removed my eye which is fine I think a gay one would’ve left me too . 
But hey I still feel beautiful now .

This one didn’t tell me he was sleeping with this girl we both knew I was shocked but with the illness and me finally saved from it and healed I was not going to let it destroy my health . So yeah but I broke up with him , I said you can stay friends but that’s all . Anyway he became salty and started using slurs at times like lil twink faggot etc ..

That’s all there is to say . 

I’m not looking for pity don’t worry people are dying everyday wars and babies torn apart . People dying of hunger and also seen kids die in my hospital where I stayed that humbled me real good . 
 I may had been that annoying gay twink before but now I value life and my family and what I have more than. Anything else and especially my health god forbid we could die at any moment . 

What hurts me is how reddits gays and bisexuals are painting me as .. just cause I wrote a text that was long discussion baiting loneliness and being called fag or left for a woman that’s all .

I never said bi men were not valid , never said I was the hottest , never said I was perfect person . It’s just people here jump on your jugular fast man . I’m an actual very sweet person in real life and quite peaceful, not loud not noisy . 

They’re calling me schizophrenic you think that’s schizophrenia.. an illness that leaves unable to live a normal life Hearing voices seeing things that’s don’t exist etc ? Or someone said salt baths ….. I don’t even know how they look like … or that I’m an incel when I had many gay sexual partners … 

I don’t get all these assumptions … I think they like to front and hate as soon as someone says the truth that’s all . They need to be more human instead of",1709251237.0

"ChronicPain","t5_2rdpj","I find that taking things one step, not even one day, but one step at a time helps to ground me. I love to do figure skating, much like your love for hockey, it has kept me sane while I walk with my madness and pain. I am diagnosed with endometriosis, fibromyalgia, and precancerous cervical tissues. All of which debilitate me on a daily basis, all day long, every single day. I have not found relief- despite going through a multitude of minor& major surgical procedures. I often ask myself “how much longer can I do this?” How will I continue to fight through this pain? It’s only been a handful of years, and I’m ready to give up now. I find myself thinking that I’m not afraid of my diagnosis killing me, because it would finally bring me relief.

However, I really do love being alive. I love the feeling of my skates touching the ice that makes me forget about my condition. I love driving my car and going out with my friends. I love to try new music, new movies, new food on a somewhat regular basis to keep my life ‘interesting’ and I find it helps to always have something to look forward to. Whether that be going to hockey practice, spending time with your kids, going on a brief vacation, trying a new restaurant with your wife, planning new date ideas. 

I think the one piece of advice I can give you is to try not too worry so much about your future and what you will do then. Try to accept the ‘peace’ your body currently offers you instead of contemplating what you will do when you’ve ran out of time.  (though I know peace is subjective for us with chronic pain. We truly never find peace… we can only get so close.) It’s so hard not to worry about the future, but it steals so much joy from the current moment. Much love to you. I hope you find healing and relief.",1709251237.0

"RPGdesign","t5_31cnk","*Design goals are only useful inasmuch as you can use them to measure your progress.* 

&#x200B;

I have to say I strongly disagree.  The most useful point of having design values/goals/priorities in my mind is solving design decisions and preventing decision paralysis.  


The main questions we get on this sub most of the time are something like ""is this good?"" or ""Should I do this?"" and this is almost never a question if you first determine what you value about your system and how that ties to your game's identity.    


The only time it becomes an issue is if you're not married to a particular solution and 2 options are equally viable and you need the community to help you pro/con each side of a decision since there's always trade offs.  


As such I think using them as progression benchmarks is a way to use them, but by far the less useful option, though ymmv.  


*But most of yours are too ambiguous to be useful.*  


Maybe not useful to you... I have used them to great effect, and the point wasn't to do a 30 page essay to explain the ins and outs of every bit of my design process, but rather to give an example of how to approach making design values, and the second part of each one, in most cases shows how I achieved that, for example, since you brought it up:  


Intuitive states specifically that I'm using commonly understood vernacular and conventions (just with my own design spin on it).  As an example, I could call rolling 2 sets of dice squeezleblarp, or I could call it advantage, which is going to immediately resonate with most players?  Are there specifics of how my design use of advantage works?  Yes.  But that's for rules explanation, the intuitive understanding of rolling 2 sets of dice is what is implied.  


*And your solutions don't give us enough to infer who your intended audience is.*  


This was not the intent of showing this, it was to explain how to approach doing this through demonstration, simply because a lot of people get lost when I explain to them they need to figure out their product identity and design values.  


As far as who my game is for, it's first for me, second for my personal play ground.  It's third for anyone that likes what I made and might be naturally drawn to the themes, but what those are aren't really part of the scope of the thread.  If you're personally interested in what my game is offering, most of it is locked at this time due to being in not even really alpha shape, but what is available is [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1993142787742991/permalink/1993259081064695), in the media thread.  


I feel like because I didn't do specifically the things you want with this exercise you want to cut it down, which isn't really a great way to win friends and influence people.  As I mentioned in the OP, this isn't for everyone.  I'm very glad you have your design values sorted.  Not everyone does and a lot of people seem to have trouble with it.  That's who this thread is for.  Indicating by average upvote value of my actual threads, I'd say this is precisely what I expected, it's not hugely popular but it helps a small amount of folks who are struggling with that aspect, and to that end I'm happy with the results.  


If you'd like to know more about how I think about design, feel free to go [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dci_c4eCuHMLmSFTjduSNpBB0vohFGQNJX5mknAZprc/edit#heading=h.a48unw6c3qam).",1709251238.0

My instructor was quite relaxed in the way she was like ""you book whatever, I'll sort"" for the most part as she'd rather I got a test when I needed one and change around lessons than me missing out. She told me the ones she definitely couldn't do and then just said she'd make it work with any other dates. 

Admittedly, my first test was on the same day as another of her pupils but she had long enough to make it work in-between - we both failed though so not a good day!",1709251238.0

Maybe a good way to introduce her is have the first guards they meet in town be really mean and see if it’s spirals into a confrontation. Once they realize that they’ve bit off more then they can chew and they’re in a dodgy situation, she can come up to them as a mediator. This way she’s shown to be more cool headed then what the gung ho culture of the kingdom tries to push, and it’s a good way to have them see her as an ally . I could also make her a little rebellious herself in someways , openly voicing disdain for the king and his militaristic behavior. Some quotes along the line of “ if I wasn’t bound to the kings pesky rules , the town would be more like ______”. A common practice in the kingdom is for people of importance to have a servant planar bound to them,( as per the spell) and the rarer and more powerful that servant is , the ire prestigious they are .

""Não é possível, como ele conseguiu e eu não? Pra que que eu vou me esforçar, simular algo que eu não sou, fingir uma confiança que eu não tenho pra continuar sozinho? Quer saber de uma coisa, EU NÃO PRECISO, POSSO VIVER MUITO BEM SOZINHO!""

Superei a fase de raiva e frustração e agora sinto um bloqueio tão forte que não consigo me imaginar num relacionamento, só consigo me imaginar sozinho e isolado",1709251238.0

I'll give you the First People though. The US were straight up colonizers genocided them much in the same way that China wants to against the Uyghur.

But I'll put it simply. 

Currently, the US is the only thing stopping China (South China Sea), Russia (Ukraine and all the former Baltic states), and Houthi rebels from being worse than the US has in the past. 

Yes, European nations are starting to spend more in their own military budget to be their own deterrent against Russia, and possibly China. But the results of that spending won't be seen for a few years.

Commodification has alienated us from finding and end in ourselves, instead we find an end in production which is supposed to ‘serve’ our general interest in the abstract. So I would be saying that because we no longer use instrumental reasoning to serve our own purpose, but rather the purpose of commodity production/consumption, maybe we displace our existential angst into the commodities themselves (hence the perfect image aesthetic to make us forget about our own death).",1709251239.0

The tooltip shows data for all the lines, not just one. I think there was a workaround with DAX potentially, but the project got pushed to the back burner so I haven’t looked at it again yet. But it’s such a simple thing, and it seemed so convoluted to get it do that very simple thing. It’s a bit unintuitive. Plus I’m not a fan of the DAX syntax tbh…",1709251239.0

"PCOS","t5_2ryc6","I have to agree to there is a real demonization of birth control that I would’ve never expected. For instance, I saw a TikTok recently of a newlywed who said that she and her husband had only had sex 3 times and she fell pregnant with twins and it was destroying her. She got pregnant because she “did a lot of research” and decided her body “couldn’t handle” hormonal birth control. Except now her body is about to be brutalized by a twin pregnancy when she didn’t even want one baby. 

Birth control is such a huge shift for women’s autonomy. The option to take birth control or not is  an absolutely huge luxury. Yes, there are many different formulations that affect us all differently. It took me 5-7 options to find something perfect but personally I’d rather keep going through different methods/pills than having to become a mother in 2024.

Your question answers itself.

Considering how important religion was in the Middle Ages, it's a fucking miracle that Roman Catholicism even ever came to the aid of Eastern Orthodoxy in the first place, in the form of the Crusades.

By the time the Ottomans were calling themselves Ottomans, Roman Catholic Europe was much more interested in carving out their own pieces of the last of the Eastern Orthodox Empire than in some kind of ecumenical effort.  That kind of thing smacked of heresy.",1709251239.0

"Bluetooth_Speakers","t5_3cvxy","Just wanted to share my latest find that's been a game-changer for my backyard hangouts - the TrebLab HD77 Bluetooth speaker. So, I was in this dilemma, eyeing brands like Sony and JBL, but my wallet was like, ""let's not go crazy,"" you know? That's when I found the TrebLab HD77, and it was exactly what I needed!

I bought two of these bad boys, setting them up across my deck, and the difference is night and day. The stereo sound they kick out creates this awesome vibe that's just unmatched. It's not just about volume; the bass, treble, and midrange - everything's on point. I played around with a basic EQ app, which somehow made this great speaker even more incredible. But honestly, they're a hit straight out of the box.

Battery-wise, these guys are marathon runners. Had them out for a few BBQs running 3-5 hours, and they didn't even break a sweat. And if you're considering doubling up for that sweet stereo sound, don't sweat the pairing process. It's straightforward once you get the hang of it.

Design-wise, they're a looker! Picked the blue one for a pop of color, but the black's just as sleek. Plus, they're tough as nails. Dropped mine more than I care to admit, and it's still like, ""Is that all you got?""

To sum it up, if you're on the fence about outdoor speakers, the TrebLab HD77 is a no-brainer. Covers all bases - sound quality, battery life, and it's even kind to your wallet.",1709251239.0

2. If you’re using a pen name use that as your Etsy username. Out your real legal info in there as the account owner. Use your real name with Amazon. You can have multiple pen names on the same KDP account. 

3. The book is as long as it needs to be. Don’t add filler. Your readers will notice.

4. Put your books up on Amazon. Order 10 author copies of each. Sell the author copies on Etsy. If you have a ln ebook in Kindle Unlimited (also called Kindle Select) you can NOT list it anywhere else. If your book is not enrolled in KU then you can sell your ebook anywhere you want including Etsy.

5. You’ll want to own your own isbn since you can’t use Amazon’s isbn off Amazon. In the US you buy them from Bowker. Each unique version needs its own isbn so a hardcover needs one, a paperback needs one, and an audiobook need one totaling three. Ebooks technically don’t need an isbn but I assign one to them anyway.

Don’t buy hundreds of copies of your books until you know they’ll actually sell. Everyone always thinks their books are going to fly off the shelf. Very few do, especially in the beginning when you don’t know what you’re doing and nobody knows who you are.

Make sure your covers are on point and genre appropriate. Definitely don’t use AI. I don’t know much about marketing non-fiction books.",1709251241.0

1 could get attention and not be ignored (interestingly the right wing new York post has had better coverage than most left wing msm) 

2 wouldn't be discredited as ""hateful"" and suppressed in that basis, which would drive up more censorship support

Most self immolation can be regarded as mental illness that gets exploited and even encouraged for politics, and gets forgotten

>David Buckel, a prominent civil rights lawyer turned environmental advocate, also set himself on fire in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park in 2018 to protest climate change and died. In a letter beforehand, Mr. Buckel alluded to the spiritual roots of self-immolation in protests, including in Tibet.

I’ve always packed lunches and snacks (and all the other kids in their classes do too) so meals outside of the house have never been an issue. They started taking snacks to preschool at 2 but didn’t have a lunch at preschool until 4. We never ordered from kids menus (they can get adult meals if we go out) because my kids never liked Mac and cheese and that’s 90% of the menus! We never did pouches or puffs or anything of that. I always gave the babies disassembled versions of what we ate without salt. I’d salt all our food at the end but I’d use all the spices throughout. Always had little ice packs and lunches boxes for our snacks on the go. I breastfeed my kids until they were 3 and 4 (I’m sure there are opinions there but anyways), so they got protein from that. I wouldn’t over stress about protein though. Kids need a very small amount. Other sources: all types of beans, lentils (we did a lot of lentils and curries with non-Upf coconut milk), cheese, plain yogurt with fruit mix ins, tofu, egg, nut butters, homemade hummus, the very occasional salmon. Don’t forget grains have protein too—quinoa, rice, farro, barley, oats, millet (and even ww pastas and Ezekiel bread if those are okay).

"auscorp","t5_89z0n1","I'd prefer transparency too. Applying for a role properly takes a lot of work. Reviewing candidates does too. Misalignment of salary expectations wastes everyone's time.

There are two things I do that help. Make sure your salary band is set to what you expect in any job seeking apps you use. They have to include one even of its not visible. That helps filter out roles that are outside your band of tolerance.

Second, if I think I'm a strong candidate I call the hiring manager if one is listed. I tell them I meet all the criteria and have x many years experience. I tell them I don't want to waste either of our time can they please provide me the minimum range (at least) for the role. I've only had one negative response - if money is all you care about then we may not be the employer for you. Which told me what I needed to know anyway.

If you're approached directly by a recruiter trying to poach then it's even easier to say this is my expectilation otherwise this conversation is over.

Money isn't everything, I care about the values of the organisation and what I can contribute. But I'm not doing it for 20% less than similar ropes are paid.",1709251244.0

It shows you have no knowledge regarding these things. Listen, take 1 step at a time, give your 10th boards, go to 11th, open your books of PCMB+Cs and see how the first 2-3 months go. Then decide.

"LineageOS","t5_3htpk","Here's what you have to do:

- Download the zip from GitHub ( https://github.com/ssut/payload-dumper-go/releases/ ). For macOS it's either darwin_amd64 (intel mac) or darwin_arm64 (M1/2/3).

- Unzip the download. Move the `payload-dumper-go` file to your desktop.

- Download and unzip your stock ROM/firmware, there should be a large `payload.bin` in there (if macOS fails to unzip, use a 3rd party app like Keka).

- Open the terminal app (cmd+space bar, search for ""terminal"").

- Type `cd ~/Desktop` and press enter (this will take you to the Desktop directory where `payload-dumper-go` is).

- Type `./payload-dumper-go ` (notice the space at the end) and then drag the `payload.bin` file to the terminal window and press enter. (you're essentially telling `payload-dumper-go`to work with that `payload.bin` file, drag and drop just fills the path to the `payload.bin` file). [Note: if for some reason it doesn't work, run that command you mentioned. That makes it an ""executable"".]

After doing this, `payload-dumper-go` should start doing its thing... A new folder called something like `extracted_20240229_231743` will be created on your desktop (because that's where `payload-dumper-go` is), that's where the firmware is. This can take a few minutes.

# Installing adb/fastboot?

Then I assume you'll need to flash the firmware on your phone?

You'll need adb/sideload to be installed. In my experience, the easiest way to do this is to use a package manager like Homebrew. Go to their website ( https://brew.sh/ ) and copy the command they have on the home page. Paste it on the terminal and ""enter"". This will install homebrew. I don't remember if you need to reboot... but it will tell you if needed.

When Homebrew is installed, you install android tools. Again, just copy and paste the command on your terminal and run/click enter: https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/android-platform-tools#default

After doing this, you have adb/fastboot installed. You can run `fastboot` and `adb` commands from your terminal and from any folder.

# Flashing the firmware on your phone

I'll also assume that you'll need to flash that firmware to your phone.

Open the terminal window, type `cd ` (there's a space after ""cd"") and drag and drop the folder where the firmware is. Then press enter. You should be inside the folder with the firmware now. Type `ls` (and enter) if you want to see the folder's content.

Now you just have to run the commands to install the firmware on the phone. There's usually a page on LineageOS' wiki for the phone with instructions. For example, for the OnePlus Nord: https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/avicii/fw_update/

# Some notes

Looking at your other comments, I think part of the problem is that you don't understand how a terminal works. I only know the basic, essentially you have to move between folders and tell it where the files are.

When terminal told you that ""No such file or directory"", it's because you're in a directory (probably inside your user folder, where the downlods, music, etc, folders, are) and not where that `payload-dumper-go` executable is. You don't have go to the folder where it is, but you have to tell it where it is at least. For example, to run that command you mentioned, let's say you have it on your desktop and haven't used `cd ~/Desktop` to go to your desktop, you can type `chmod +x ~/Desktop/payload-dumper-go`. This essentially means ""give excutable permissions to this file at /Desktop/payload-dumper-go"".

Later on when you have to flash the recovery, you'll have to run a command like `fastboot flash recovery recovery.img`. This will only work if you're already on the same folder as the ""recovery.img"" file though. If you're not, instead of typing ""recovery.img"", just drag the file to the terminal window and it will fill in the path to the file, eg: `fastboot flash recovery /Users/MatineHen/Downloads/recovery.img`.

Some commands that are useful:

- cd: go to a directory. `cd ~/Desktop` takes you to your desktop directory. After you're there, you can go to another directory, eg: `cd extracted_20240229_231743` will take you to the firmware folder (to use the folder name I used above), where you then can flash the firmware on the phone"".

- `cd ..`, go to the directory above the one you're currently in.

- `ls`, lists the content of the directory.

- `rm`, removes something. Eg: `rm image.jpg` deletes ""image.jpg"" that is inside the same directory. `rm -r foldername` removes a folder, you need the `-r` (""recursive"") there to remove everything inside too.

- the `~` before a directory name/path, essentially puts you inside the ""home"" directory. `cd ~/Downloads` is the same as `cd /Users/MatineHen/Downloads/`, but much shorter.

- `mkdir` creates a directory/folder. `mkdir ~/Desktop/test` will create a folder called ""test"" in your desktop. You can navigate to it by typing `cd ~/Desktop/test`.  `cd ..` takes you to the desktop directory. `rm -r test` deletes the test folder.

I hope this helps. And keep it simple. It looks very difficult, but it's not that hard... trust me, I was you not long ago... as soon I understood the basic idea of how the terminal works, it became much, much easier.",1709251246.0

I could probably even squeeze a lip/chin in there. It really is a quick treatment. The laser can be programmed to fire very quickly (I typically do about 2 pulses a second and am continuously moving), and not all machines beep or need to be lifted off the skin like the other commenter is mentioning. The machine I use glides over with a pretty large spot size. Videos online are typically showing technique so they’re moving slower. If you have concerns you should absolutely speak up, a good tech will not consider that “confrontational” and should be happy to take the time to talk it over with you. I always want my patients to be informed and happy with what we’re doing, and I appreciate it when they take the time to check in and ask questions. It’s not offensive at all!

Also, the other commenter is correct about the pain- if there’s no hair in the follicle, there’s nothing for the laser to hit, so you won’t feel anything in those areas.",1709251246.0

Extensive background developing optimizations by hand, creating totally custom automation solutions from scratch, lots of Python, OOP, & inventing workflows from thin air.

I remember this clearly because at that time, this was a plus! A quick check on Genesis showed that they were the largest digital currency lender and they only lent to institutional customers and high net worth individuals able to put down 1 million in collateral.

Therefore (and because of bigotry and prejudice) human cultures look down on it for different reasons. To some it’s tantamount to bestiality (though the monsters are intelligent and consent) or a traitorous action against humanity, or blasphemous.

It's possible there were multiple nautiloids, I can't remember off the top of my mind.

But of course if you're Durge, >!it was Orin.!< So the emperor is n/a.

Also side note about the intro cutscene: it was actually done by an outside cgi studio. Neil Newbon mentioned it in one of his streams. So I do agree that we can't go off of the emperor's fit and eye color. I didn't play EA but if the cutscene was present then, it was before the emperor even existed right?

"TankieTheDeprogram","t5_aejr0i","So I *decided* to look into Carlos Martinez’s sources. This is the entire quote:

“By this time, however, the Western powers were engaged in a massive ‘rollback’ programme, supporting rebellions against progressive governments in Angola, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Cambodia and South Yemen. **Vijay Prashad (2014)** writes that the CIA and the Pentagon ‘abandoned the idea of the mere “containment” of communism in favour of using military force to push back against its exertions – even when these were met with massive popular support’. All the states under attack had an urgent need for military and civilian aid, which the Soviet Union had little choice but to provide. In 1983 the United States took advantage of the chaotic situation in Grenada’s ruling New Jewel Movement to overturn the Grenadian Revolution by means of military invasion. Meanwhile, Vietnam and Cuba continued to be very reliant on Soviet generosity. The USSR was becoming over-extended, spending up to 30 per cent of its GDP on arms and sponsoring its allies to the tune of tens of billions of dollars each year. This spending may well have been unavoidable – it is hardly reasonable to deny the state of siege imposed on the socialist world by the capitalist world – but it inevitably had an adverse impact on domestic living conditions.”

This comes from the citations from the end of the book: “Prashad, Vijay. 2014. The Poorer Nations: A Possible History of the Global South. Verso.”

I never read that book, I’m sure there’s a free PDF out there somewhere where you can look through it.

He also talks about USSR military expenditures and aid in this journal in page 400. Interestingly, he came up with an even higher number, 40%. This article is free: https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.13169/worlrevipoliecon.11.2.0189

“Peaceful coexistence has required compromises, one of which has been China relinquishing a direct leadership role in the global transition to socialism. The Soviet Union took on a heavy responsibility as the global center of anti-imperialist forces, giving extensive practical solidarity to socialist states, national liberation movements, and progressive governments around the world—including vast eco- nomic support to the People’s Republic of China between 1949 and 1959; military and economic support to Cuba, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Angola, Nicaragua, Korea, Ethiopia, and elsewhere; training, aid, and weapons to the ANC (African National Congress) in South Africa, Frelimo in Mozambique, Swapo in South West Africa (now Namibia), PAIGC (Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde) in Guinea Bissau, and others.
In addition to direct aid, the Soviet role as the protector of the progressive world—and its position as one of two “superpowers”—meant that it was forced to devote an extraordinary portion of its resources to military development. The figures vary wildly, but Russian-American historian Alexander Pantsov estimates that, “at the start of Gorbachev’s perestroika, in 1985, the Soviets were spending **40 percent of their budget on defence.**” Indeed, Pantsov concludes that “the economy of the USSR collapsed under the burden of military expenditures” (Pantsov and Levine 2015, 432). US President Ronald Reagan developed a “full-court press” strategy in the early 1980s that sought to vastly increase US military expenditure, forcing the USSR to follow suit and thereby deepen its economic difficulties.”",1709251248.0

"stenography","t5_30gp9","I was a captioner for 7 years with one of the largest, if not the largest, closed captioning company in the US. If you have the discipline to work from home and don't want to make as much money as you could make court reporting in certain states, it's just okay. At my company, you got unlimited days off, but they are unpaid, and you can only get the day off if the allotted RTO slots aren't already filled up. You also only get one holiday off per year of the major five, and it's not paid. And so...the schedule is AWFUL. In my entire time there, I only had one year where I had two days off in a row, and it was Sundays and Mondays. Before that I had Sundays and Wednesdays off. 

There is a mandatory minimum amount of hours that you have to write on your weekend days (usually around 6.5 hours) and a minimum of 22 hours a week. If you're only on air 22 hours a week, that's not a bad schedule, but you only get paid for the hours you're on air, so at $49/hour, that's only $1,078 a week pretax. 

Then you think, ""Okay, I'll increase my writing to 35 hours/week to make a livable wage."" But you have to have half an hour between each program, 15 minutes of which you have to set up for the next show (and don't get paid for that either).  You are at the mercy of others who decide what programs you get out of the preferred selections that you send in. You also have to have 2 coverage hours on your schedule every week, and you only get paid $13/hour for those.

So here's what a ""long day"" totaling only 6 hours of paid work might look like:

12pm-1pm NEWS = 1 HOUR

2pm-2:30pm RANDOM SHOW = .5 HOURS

3pm-4pm COVERAGE - 1 HOUR (only get paid $13/hour)

5pm-6pm NEWS = 1 HOUR

9pm-12am SPORTING EVENT = 3 HOURS

And this is if you're lucky enough to get a sports event that's a big chunk all at once. If instead it was three individual hours of writing, that adds 1.5 hours to your working time but not to your paycheck and spreads out your day even more.

Personally I see porn like a condom; once I’ve “finished with it’ it’s simply discarded, not given a second thought once it’s served its purpose.

But the editing, the uploading, that takes time (and frankly *both hands*m so it’s isn’t just an urge, to him this has drifted from an urge, to a fascination, to a hobby, to an obsession

So if they start filming in May, we’ll definitely get an announcement in April. I feel like they want to start filming as soon as they can since they were supposed to be filming a while ago, but they couldn’t because of the strikes. I don’t think they’ll factor into whether or not s3 has started airing because they’re off schedule anyway and s4 was supposed to start filming after s3 aired. So this will probably be the only time that they announce the s4 leads before the previous season starts airing. I personally think we’ll get an announcement before s3 drops. I’m betting on April because I know Luke has his play in May and once he finishes that up, I think he’s going right to filming. Maybe not immediately, but close to the end date of his play. There is no way they’re going to start filming or pre production without anything getting further exposed, so yeah, I don’t think they’ll wait to announce in June or after s3. The strikes have been over for a while, they’re definitely ready to start filming season 4 soon.",1709251250.0

This is a city builder made by one guy who is some kind of optimization wizard. It goes from city builder to a Total War style mid-late game. Think if you played the Roman Empire but you had to build Rome.

Templar Battleforce:
Not Space Marines vs Not Tyranids in turn based tactics game. A pretty simple get points buy new gear tech tree and is actually quite tough. You move through missions completing the objective, on high difficulties the game throws enemies at you and you have to keep moving and killing.  

Highfleet:
This game is sick. My favourite overworld interface ever. Probably the most impactful combat I've ever played too. Play this game.

The thing to consider is that the residents generally separate from one another and reside with people with the same race or background, making communities have different majorities.

This makes me infer that either the median household income for the Arab communities is lower as they may either have more blue collar jobs or fewer people working jobs per household, or a lower municipality tax rate as a result of the livability. I believe there needs to be some affirmative action needed to be taken to reach the equilibrium you want in the education system.

"queensland","t5_2ugmv","OP doesn't want solutions, OP wants ""them"" to go ""away"".

Obviously a justice system needs... Justice. But a ""just"" system should also provide early intervention, opportunities, and rehabilitation. At the moment society creates a geographic ""too hard basket"", everything from infrastructure like roads and hospitals, schools, and job opportunities are less funded in poor areas. People in those areas receive sub-par education (private schools receive more government funding than government schools), they are excluded from higher education in academic sense and economic sense (a ""free"" degree still requires four years without a job, access to the Internet, books, travel, time...), excluded from high paying jobs, and traditionally have fewer positive role models or representation.

El desarrollo de la vacuna Covid comenzó durante el susto del sars en 2002-2003, y las vacunas de ARNm en la década de 1990 para ratones, y la primera vacuna de ARNm humano contra la rabia se probó en 2013. De 2002 a 2020 son 18 años. Las vacunas de covid tienen contraindicaciones, qué tú no las conozcas es diferente.

Unsure about special nutritional needs, but it’s always good to rotate foods for a varied diet.

Live plants are always great. My favorites are Anubis’s, tie it to a rock and drop in the tank, don’t bury. And Amazon Swords, bury the roots. The more the merrier, keeps the water quality good and fish love swimming in and out of them.

Fish sometime “color up” as they age and transition into bigger healthier tanks. It is not a guarantee though, but not uncommon at all, in a couple of months he could be totally different colors.

Personally, I think Bettas love exploring. I like to put something tank-safe but new in my bettas tank for him to swim around or in, like a mug, a bowl, a new rock, etc. They learn to recognize you and begin greeting you at the glass, I like to spend coffee time with mine in the morning. Some bettas can learn tricks like swim through hoops or jumping for food, but I have a lidless tank so I don’t encourage jumping.

And there’s definitely no way there are any flaws in that article right?

“ basic human activity” is where we disagree.

I don’t think having children is a basic human activity. I think it’s a conscious decision, and should be avoided when you are impoverished.

I agree that there are systemic causes to poverty. 

I also believe that those can be overcome with personal responsibility.

"WaltDisneyWorld","t5_2te6p","OP, I just want to say that I completely understand where you’re coming from. It hurts to experience the magic and not want it for your family NOW - contrary to what others might think, taking your babies and littles to Disney, for me, is a joy like no other that you can’t get back. 

A small bit of advice, for what it’s worth - when we moved to FL a few years ago, we raced to get passes - not because we really could afford to financially, but because we thought the FOMO of living fairly close (1.5 hrs) would eat us alive if we didn’t. However, in hindsight..sometimes we get jealous of non-AP’s. There’s something to be said about feeling forced to make a trip happen - not emotionally forced, but financially forced - that affects the magic a little. My two cents would be to plan one epic trip a year. There are plenty of nice offsite hotels, or splurge on a couple nights onsite near the end of the trip.  Utilize the Florida resident hotel discounts, which are really almost just as good as the AP discounts. Time goes fast, and that trip will come quickly every year. But if it’s that important to you guys, make it happen. Just avoid the debt because that will affect the magic. Trust me, we’ve been there. 

In the meantime, dive into the world of Disney vlogging, Disney thrift hunting, Disney decorating or recipes - whatever gives you a little bit of the magic. And find joy in planning for the day in the future when you’ll be financially ready to go bigger! Plan epic trips just for fun. 

And don’t let anyone criticize you for the Disney love. Everyone has their hobbies, and some people drop big money on theirs. At least Disney is a place that can foster your family’s bonding and happiest lifetime memories together.",1709251253.0
"hospice","t5_2tjrq","Virtual hugs.  Your story reads that dad is close to dying and my condolences for your upcoming loss.

Please do not blame yourself. Unless you have a strong medical background, detecting infections in those older than us is an art. And even those of us with training don't always detect early; we are human too.

Stage 4 of any cancer, especially with metastasis, is often futile to pursue treatment; so even if there was no infection, the cancer still would have won outside of a miracle.  Some patients and families still pursue treatment out of the hope for buying more time.  The drain tube may or may not have allowed for more time... but then again, even with the drain, the chemo drained so much of him that he may not have had quality for whatever time remains.

So far I've only tried a couple of games using their proprietary software and gyro-as-joystick mode.  The games I chose do not allow mnk+gamepad so I'm already getting familiar with that shortcoming.  

Steam input won't recognize the vader in a way that allows binding the extra buttons, but supposedly reWASD does.  I plan to try that software, which allows emulating full mnk control with profiles for individual games just like steam input. 

It's certainly unfortunate that using gyro effectively involves so many compromises and complications, but I have already begun to appreciate the intuitive control it offers, even in gyro-as-joystick mode.  I don't necessarily recommend the vader 3 (because it can't use the roll axis in dinput or xinput) but I'm gonna stick with it.",1709251253.0

"math","t5_2qh0n","A set is enumerable if it can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the naturals. We call such a one-to-one matching a bijection, and it means the two sets have the same cardinality. So an enumerable set has the same cardinality as the naturals.

Some occasionally talk about computably enumerable sets, which are the sets which can be enumerated by an algorithm rather than the naturals. But that's not what you're describing here.

The naturals are by definition enumerable, there must be a bijection from the naturals to themselves (for example the identity map which maps n to n).

It might look like you can try to apply Cantor's diagonalization argument for the reals onto the naturals, but it fails. He creates a new real number that has a different digit in every decimal place, but this is only possible because real numbers can have infinite decimal places. Natural numbers cannot, a number which has infinite digits is not a natural. There is no bound on the number of digits a natural can have, but each natural must end. And there is no longest natural which you can extend to create a natural which is not in the bijection. After all, if there were a longest natural that would imply that the naturals are finite.

You might want to look at Cantor's theorem instead, for some people it's more concrete: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_theorem

I will note that Cantor's theorem is ugly to some. It's important to note that the set he constructs (the set of all elements in A which are not in their image under f *must* be in P(A), since every subset of A is in the powerset of A). Even if the set he constructs happens to be the empty set it still leads to a contradiction.

Cantor's theorem proves there are multiple infinities, and it also proves that the cardinality of the naturals is less than the cardinality of the reals (you can show that the reals are equinumerous with the powerset of the naturals).

It's quite important that there are multiple infinities, it comes up a lot in statistics. And in computer science, where you can show that almost all decision problems don't have a program which solves them. Programs are strings (which are equinumerous with the naturals), but decision problems are sets of strings (the input strings for which the decision should be yes). Therefore the set of decision problems is the powerset of the set of strings, and thus there are decision problems which have no program to solve them.",1709251254.0

- First: **no one can predict how long your purge will last!** Be patient, and accept this robot hug while you wait: [ ]. The purge can be tough but so many people have gotten through it - you can too!
- Second: **no one can predict whether or not you will purge!** If you don't currently have active acne, it's less likely but still possible.
- Third: If your purge lasts for longer than 12 weeks or seems really extreme, talk to your dermatologist! NO PURGE SHOULD LAST LONGER THAN 3 MONTHS - if you're still purging after 3 months, talk to your doctor or ask us for help!
- Lastly: We have a very [helpful wiki!](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRQmcAj-x5A8JIQygtW2Rg89uPsJPR5JLH_dLxLNCW4eazWW4i49bsrF0e2YYx10wx00ctaUnyvHfyD/pub) It contains lots of tips about starting out, including specific routine recommendations.

And there are Japanese learning apps on the Play Store that are free and great for building reading skills (Wordbit, Lingo Legend, Todaii, Infinite Japanese, Kana Runner, Kanji Quest, etc.) 

I think immersion is good for keeping your motivation up in the sense of ""I don't understand much or anything they're saying but I wish I could"" but it hasn't been too useful for actual learning for me. I put my mental energy into studying and then do immersion in-between as more passive learning.

He's projecting his issues onto you and telling you that you're weird for wanting intimacy. Don't put yourself through that. It's not all about him. It's about you and what you need too.

In my opinion, you should date other people. The fact that you think you acted selfishly by crying and having hurt feelings, and that he felt free to tell you that you're weird and blame you when you were crying tells me that you're not being taken care of in this relationship.

"pittsburgh","t5_2qhrn",">According to a joint report last year compiled by the controller’s offices of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, the five largest tax-exempt organizations locally are UPMC, Allegheny Health Network, the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University.

"Smite","t5_2stl8","Well to be honest the build was made when both Trans and Soul Eater had CDR on them. So if I tried to Squeeze in Vigor in the build with Bumba's Spear, Mantle of Discord, Trans and SE, a Jotuun's Vigor would hage made the build over cap by 20% CDR. However that's not the case anymore and the build actually meeds 20% more to fill it out.

You probably could do with shifting SE with Jotuun's Vigor, I havent done much testing with it tbh. Im like a vet (I have been playing since S2) so if a build works and still works, don't fix it you know? Lol. 
If you ard more comforable with Vigor instead of SE, go ahead, personally I like being more ""in control"" of passives. 


Lets say you're 4 items in and just got done fighting and you went back at the jungle at 40% HP. You clear 2 camps, Jotuun's Vigor doesn't proc, and it doesn't have lifesteal on it so the only sustain yours getting is from Bumba's Dagger and Basic attacks from Bloodforge. Youll probably get back to ~50% HP, making ganking still a bit risky, 50% HP is nothing to some Junglers or if you get CCd. With the SE build, clearing the same camps, you'll get more Lifesteal from Basic attacks and your Autos, with those 2 camps you would have probably 60%, maybe even 70% which is a more comfortable HP to be at lol. 

But everyone's play style is different. What works for one is gonna be totally different from another. And personally, Not getting Jotuun's just works for me. From my Smiteguru history, the last time I went Negative in a Lancelot Jungle, was YESTERDAY lmao (I had a solo lane DC in 3 minutes) but before that was 6 months ago. Even the games were I lost, was still Positive by a nice margin.


If you could substitute it in, i would try for either Soul Eater of Bloodforge 
. or maybe go Vigor first and then SE, or whatever the game is looking like.


He has many items that are good for him, some items ars just better though. Hydra's, Heartseeker, Arondite, Titan's Bane are a good on him. Before Season 11, Shell use to be a great pick up on him in any role. Shell would give a Shield and with one of the T3 upgrades it would give like 15% damage mitigation once the shield pops. So you could pop Shell, ult in and get a kill and with Bloodforge you'd basically have 3 shields. Once they get rid of the ""Shell"" Shield (which is the first one), they would have to get through **The whole** Bloodforge and Horse Shield with 15% mitigation applied, you were NOT getting knocked off of it lol. But Shell was changed to just be HP and the mitigations part of it went to Thorns, so that was a strat that died in S11.


Try what works out for you, it could be better",1709251256.0
"leaf","t5_2sfej","According to various magazines Both Gas and Electric (Not Electronic) vehicles both take a range hit in extreme cold.  Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs or just EVs)  about a 30% hit in range (MPGe) in extreme cold, whereas gas vehicles get about a 15% hit in range (MPG). Like any driver YMMV (Your Milage May Vary) depending on you driving style and the elevation  changes. If you want more range, get a Plus Trim.  Depending on your use case, you might not need the plus model that has a longer range. 

In my real-world experience, the range is about 200 miles with the Plus Trip commuting between NYC  and the Suburbs, which is a City/Hwy mix and almost exactly the EPA estimated range. 

However, the range is between ~160 to 180 mile range at Highway posted speed limits, that vary between 55 to 70 MPH, in my road trip’s between NY and OH. I do multiple 460 mile each way trips per year over the I-80 corridor.  Going up the mountain its 160 mile range, going down its 180 mile range. Of course this depends on the weather conditions. I have pulled into charging stations with less than 1% on the dashboard. 

I only got stranded once, in about 7 years. When the charging station was out of order, when I got there. Nissan’s free (included, with a new car purchase) roadside assistance, towed my car on a flat bed truck with me to the next (in the direction I was traveling) DCQC (Direct Current Quick Charge) station. 

Road Trips require planning and now that the charging infrastructure is getting better and with the use of the PlugShare and ABRP (A Better Route Planner) Apps, it is rare that I get down to 1% charge left, before pulling into a charging station. I also use the Leaf Spy Pro App that shares realtime data with the ABRP app to reduce my range anxiety,

I hope this helps in your decision. If you are not using the Leaf for Roadtrips, even the non-plus trim level might suit your needs,",1709251256.0

>Not every game needs to be a huge competition to crush and destroy everyone else.

What makes you think a game developer adding more content to the game is about ""crushing and destroying everyone else""? Lol.. it's about adding value to the game and giving their customers more to do in their game.

>Of course, you can compete with the people you are playing with, but its mostly just to have fun.

Oh totally, and I would personally have **even more** fun if they added some daily/weekly/monthly tasks or goals to complete, a battle pass, or something similar to give us more to unlock and work towards after completing the hidden balls and putter. That's not so much to ask to further gamify a video game, is it? 

>I and many other people love that this game doesn't have that aspect to it.

Nice! I'm assuming you like that it doesn't have these things because you don't care or don't enjoy achievements, cosmetics, or reaching goals. This is okay, and there are many more people just like you. However, there are also people like myself who enjoy achievements and reaching goals in video games, so I would like to have these things added in the game because that's what I enjoy. If these things were implemented, **you** don't have to engage with them and still enjoy the same old game that **you enjoy**. But why handicap the game just because **you** desire less? That's not thinking for anyone other than yourself.

It's hilarious to me that you think you wouldn't be able to enjoy the game anymore if it suddenly had a battle pass. Why? Because your ego prevents you from enjoying games with battle passes? Just ignore it and keep playing how **you** enjoy, it should be that simple right? I simply do not understand the hate, but maybe there's something I don't know 🤷",1709251257.0

"4tran4","t5_91kdmu","I’ve always had a lot of feminine interests and that includes fashion and visual aesthetics. I definitely get you being uncomfortable with it due to it being forced on you though. Currently I’m dressing and trying to look as masculine as possible to pass as male and my mom is trying to push me to be more feminine, which I don’t like.

For me, my dysphoria is more related to my physical sex characteristics rather than masculine/feminine gender stereotypes and expectations. I always wish I was born in a cis male body and want those physical characteristics.

I think my desire is probably just a personality/interest thing, and I don’t really believe in or support enforced gender roles and expectations.",1709251257.0

Second, usually when people make statements like the one you were referring to, they aren't referring to every single Trump voter.  They clearly said ""most"".  So, let's say somewhere between 15-20% of the population, then.

Sometimes the spidey sense is dead on…  

Plus RV’s are largely pieced together with 5-6 different manufacturers - ford frame, ford engine, but the rest is 3000 different parts that change wildly from year to year - so make it very clear that it’s an “estimate only” and will be billed accordingly

"GypsyRoseBlanchard","t5_1yrciw","HIPPA only applies to medical professionals, nurses, office staff, and insurance workers who have direct access to your medical records.

It does not apply to your boss, your best friend, your neighbor, some girl you met in prison, or that bully from high school. If, for any reason, you, or someone with access, gave them your files.. They can realistically do with them as they please. They can only go after a doctor, nurse, office admin, insurance personnel, or anyone who works directly with access to medical files, for releasing that information to someone you did not specifically authorize. 

So, let's say you signed a form stating your medical files could be released to your mother. And then your mother gave copies of those files to your neighbor.. This is not a HIPPA violation. Your mother gained those files legally. The doctor who released them was in compliance because you signed a form stating they could be shared with your mother. This form says nothing about what your mother is allowed to do with them. She could plaster them all over a public billboard if she wanted to.

However, if your neighbor called and said Hi, I'm so and so's neighbor, I want their vaccination files, or whatever, and your doctors office gave your files to your neighbor without obtaining your signed permission, THAT would be a HIPPA violation.

The only people who can be sued or be in violation of HIPPA are medical professionals or those who have direct working access to your files, such as a Receptionist at your doctors office, or a rep for your medical insurance company.

Regular folk aren't bound by HIPPA. They can pretty much do whatever they want once they've obtained those files.",1709251257.0

Then 10 people in a group follow suit a month later.

Now I'm thinking, oh shit, something needs to happen because there's no way 11 people are crazy about the exact same issue. There's something to this issue. Now I'm looking into this because it's now a fascinating political moment.

Now 100 more people go the next month. At this point, 111 people have burnt to death in highly public scenarios for this specific purpose.

I'm pushing for independence at this point because it's become clear that the political establishment desires the status quo on this issue, even if people are organizing mass suicides to oppose the status quo.

#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

>Ｘ What is the difference between の and が ?

>◯ I saw a book called 日本人の知らない日本語 , why is の used there instead of が ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

>Ｘ What does this mean?

>◯ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

>Ｘ What's the difference between 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意?

>◯ Jisho says 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意 all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does 全く同感です。 work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between は and が ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

"Roofing","t5_2s0ys","Agreed.   That's partly why I'm on the lookout for roof damage.   Penetrations look OK as far as I can see, but any penetration is a failure opportunity, of course.   We're in CA, so lot of sun and the electricity rates are sky-high, so ROI should be <6yr based on my calculations, not including roof damage.

I'm really quite surprised how much they damaged the new roof though during the install---and unnecessary damage too.   Multiple divots like the picture above, simply by dropping the panels into the shingles when they were moving them about, and they walked up and down the hips during the install, so some of those shingles are messed up too.",1709251258.0

Connecting with the spirits requires willpower and what would likely be called “hallucinogenic substances,” and, of course, training.

How the magic works?

Do you need to handle emergencies in a 24x7 environment, or do you need to be available for password resets and shit? How often does a person typically work outside of normal business hours? These need to be answered first. 

I've been available 24x7 for the last 25 years and it's not a big deal for me. These are 24x7 global environments. I get alerts on my phone. Alerts escalate to phone calls if an alert is ongoing for too long. Phone calls are needed so I wake up if it's the middle of the night. 

I build and manage my environments well enough that issues and alerts are rare. 2-3 minor issues a month with fixes that take minutes, and 1 - 2 bigger issues per year that require real time. I also have a small team and we all agree that nobody wants to be ""on call"". Because ""on call"" means you HAVE to be available and deal with the issue. You can NOT be out of reach. So Instead, we all get the alerts. Whoever is available to handle it will reply to the group and let us know they got it. If nobody handles it, I have to. 

My team is great and things just get handled. I make sure to do more than my share. 

So, yeah... If you have a shit environment that's always busted, or a shit team, or a shit boss who wants you resetting passwords in the middle of the night, then 24x7 would really suck. But honestly, so would 8x5.",1709251258.0

I actually have my Power Mode set to turn off the display after 3-5 min. And then the monitor just goes on Standby vs. 'On' with a blank screensaver.

Why would we believe that an influencer, someone who relies on social media for a living, would intentionally post something that would not generate money? It’s like seeing those Valentine’s Day posts with the super long captions and we all know that they’re compensating for something. It’s the same with influencers. They think in content and likes and trends. They see what’s popular and they post what they think is relatable, like private moments where she apologizes to her children. If she were genuine, why is she taking the time to set up the tripod? She will only post what she thinks will give her more views. I’m so tired of this delusional mindset where we think that influencers are so “real” and “relatable” and “deserving”. Like no, none of them are deserving of a bora bora trip. They literally don’t use the products. They can afford their own trip. They aren’t genuine, they are bringing in the money so they can buy nice things, hire nannies and watch their jobless husbands sit on the couch.

First, get your fitness in order.  You don't want to fuck with a bad back or sore knees.

Then, it's hair.  I keep my hair long and luscious.  I shave or wax my hair.  Shaving requires some after-care to help prevent pimples also and I got some anti acne scrub and facial wash.


No nail polished or nails unless AP is into it.


I don't do facial treatments, especially don't do anything that has a downtime like microneedling.  Usually a good quality serum, day cream, etc is enough.  I also like to pack a nice serum and cream so my face continues to look like a doll even after many hours :)  I even pack some light make-up.


I also use anti cellulite oils and pack a nice lotion.  Again to keep things supple.


Stay away from anything that will leave a mark or a scent.


I am very much body conscious so I am more self conscious about how I look.

Are you telling me you don't know how many (gold standard) studies were done on these products before they were rolled out to the public at scale and who conducted them?

And you are lecturing me?

They were publicly available, there's no excuse for not having read them and analyzing them thoroughly before advising others to take them.

A) How would you know,

"wow","t5_2qio8","If you're not too burnt out on world content, one thing that can help is leveling your alts through whatever zone the Dreamsurge is in that week.  You get a bit of a buff to XP (25%).  Doing the campaign quests in a zone with a Dreamsurge up should net 3-4 levels, and you can get a bit more with doing world quests (which also have buffed XP; I think the map still shows pre-buff XP, but when you complete, you'll see the correct XP given in the chat window).  Bonus, the WQs give you 10 essence each, and mobs still drop it even if you're not level 70, so you can start collecting it to either get 415 gear the moment you hit 70 for any slots you need it in, or, at ""worst,"" use it to buy gear that you can convert to (IIRC) the LFR version of your Aberrus tier set (and it doesn't use any Catalyst charges to convert the Dreamsurge gear to Aberrus gear).

I've started using that method to help level alts quicker and not do too much of the same thing, has helped a bit.  But I do like questing and world content.  If you're not that into it, might still feel a bit boring and/or tedious.",1709251259

"intermittentfasting","t5_2tluu","My hard limit is 50 hours.
I think it’s important to read Fast Feast Repeat for the basics very thoroughly explained. 

I am either OMAD or ADF so for OMAD I just eat.  Anything longer than OMAD to 50 hours (my personal limit) I make sure I have a free feed / refeed / minimally 2 meals sometimes 3.

The least amount I will fast is 16 hours, but I really do prefer nothing less than 18.

At 50 hours I don’t need anything special.  I had an accidental 69 hour fast I got busy in the yard and time got away from me.  I didn’t / don’t need anything special food wise - but refeed is important.  I make whole food / healthier choices.  That’s not always the case today I had a chipotle bowl.  

I don’t have any signs of distress to watch for - I clean fast / hydrate and refeed properly for me.  I also focus on sleep.  

Folks who fast 72 may have things they watch for.  It probably is very individualized as well - anything body really is.",1709251259
"UniversalOrlando","t5_2uwju","You mention that you have Express for both days; just confirming, by that you mean the unlimited Express benefits that come included with your hotel room, correct? No need to buy Express if you're staying at Royal Pacific.

Islands of Adventure has more rides and is probably the more well-rounded park at the moment. That said, I think Diagon Alley at Universal Studios as a themed area is better done than Hogsmeade at Islands, though Hogsmeade has the better rides. 

I echo the Horror Make-Up Show recommendation, should be fun for the kids. Bourne Stuntacular is also a great show showing off some really cool stage tech. Both of these shows are at the Studios park.

The article doesn't mention it either. The guy works for a third-party service provider, so Amazon itself won't be involved in the firing, just the resolution process.  


I read a bunch of news reports on this one, and it seems like they are all sympathetic to the guy in the wheelchair, which is a little silly to me.  


The guy in the wheelchair laid hands on the driver and admits to telling him he wasn't going to allow him to leave, and would call the police. The guy admits to threatening to, and attempting to forcefully detain the driver because the driver didn't finish the deliveries to the building manager's satisfaction.  


IMO, building manager was in the right to complain to Amazon that one of their drivers was just dumping packages at the reception desk rather than delivering the packages to their final addresses. That probably would have resulted in discipline for the driver. Where this went wrong, as when the guy in the wheelchair felt entitled to physically attack the driver and attempt to hold him against his will until police could arrive to sort out what was absolutely not a criminal matter.  


Regardless of whether you are in a wheelchair, laying hands on someone is an assault on their person, and while British citizens have the right to use force to prevent crimes, you don't have the right to use force to apprehend people on the basis of civil offenses like trespassing or littering. Once the driver's property or person was grabbed by the building manager, and the driver had reason to believe a criminal offense was being committed against him (as admitted by the building manager), the driver was fully in the right to use force to protect himself according to British law.",1709251261.0

She *helped them* not because of selfless shit, but because the status quo of lies is convenient for her, so she can keep Kazuya on a leash.

In that case, Ruka would have sided with Mami. Keeping their lie going doesn't benefit her at all; the current cohabitation arc is proof of that—it doesn't benefit her in any shape or form. Lol, what leash is Kazuya on right now? Ruka helping Kazuya and Chizuru was indeed an unselfish act because she gained nothing from it. 

>Kazuya downright lying to her and ommitting info about his real living conditions may drive her into full final boss territory tho. He has to tell her the truth and expect the consequence to not be that serious... ngl, there are going to be consequences.

Of course, Ruka is going to break up with Kazuya. For a while now, going back to when Kazuya first attempted to break up with her, Ruka contemplated why she kept putting herself through that. And once she learns that Kazuya was living with Mizuhara, there is no way she's going to pretend like it's okay and continue the relationship.

"poker","t5_2qhix","Not bad beats. You’re being results oriented because somehow both times you got the money in good and got sucked out on but in general everything you did would still make you a loser long term. Not trying to be a dick but that’s the honest truth. 

First hand- you just flat with JJ in the sb. Don’t flat the sb. It’s a very -EV thing to do especially online where players tend to be better and more aggressive. You should be playing 3bet or fold in that position and this is a hand you should be 3betting. 

Why are you raising all in vs his c-bet on the flop? It’s bad and makes little to no sense unless you can see his cards there. Think of what you’re trying to accomplish? In general you never get called by worse. Here you did but 8/10 times you probably don’t and when you do it’s usually a much better draw. You never get aces or a king to fold, you don’t get any two pair to fold, and you don’t get sets to fold. You get called by better hands and take away all of his bluffs that you want him to have on the turn and river if you call flop. You got lucky in the sense this guy is willing to call with a gutter which is worse than your all in but generally that never happens. 

Second hand- you’re once again in the sb. See a pattern? Even most pros are losing money in the sb over time because it’s the worst and most difficult spot to play. Facing a raise just fold this hand. This hand is trash that’s pretty to new players but not good. You’re off-suit and out of position. Position is very important in poker which you’re going to learn on this flop. 

On the flop you hit top pair. This is why playing this hand out of position is bad. Flopping top pair with a marginal kicker is not a good situation to be in. You donk bet flop which is almost never good. There are a few boards and spots where you can like very low boards when you are in the bb. That’s because you have a range advantage vs other players in that spot with that flop. This flop is not one you do that on. Again what are you wanting to accomplish? You get no better hands to fold, worse hands that may bluff fold, worse hands that call have equity, and you can’t stand getting reraised. You can’t beat anything but draws and most draws that raise you are going to be winning a lot of the time so you just have to fold this hand vs a raise. Not to mention you have the Jd in your hand so you block some of the big draws that should be raising. Which weighs any raises toward value. The flop bet is bad and that’s why you should fold this hand out of position. This is the trouble it causes. 

Turn-if you get to this spot your bet is fine and this may seem nitty but if you get raised your hand is probably a fold. Again you got lucky that this person turned out to be a maniac and jammed with Kd6d but generally if you get raised there you’re drawing to a full house.",1709251262.0

"leftcommunism","t5_2tx0h","People who say that empires must fit Lenin's conception of imperialism to be an empire haven't read Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism. That book is an account of how imperialism arises out of late-stage monopoly capitalism, NOT a rubric against which to define imperialism generally:

>Colonial policy and imperialism existed before the latest stage of capitalism, and even before capitalism. Rome, founded on slavery, pursued a colonial policy and practised imperialism. But “general” disquisitions on imperialism, which ignore, or put into the background, the fundamental difference between socio-economic formations, inevitably turn into the most vapid banality or bragging, like the comparison: “Greater Rome and Greater Britain.” [5] Even the capitalist colonial policy of previous stages of capitalism is essentially different from the colonial policy of finance capital.

"Eugene","t5_2qp4p","The star voting website for Eugene has a video, here it is.


https://youtu.be/3-mOeUXAkV0?feature=shared


It's really simple. Every candidate's stars get added together, and then the 2  candidates with the most amount of stars get into the automatic run off. 


From here, every single ballot is checked again to see which candidate was preferred. 


Let's say there's 2 liberal candidates, one is progressive and one is moderate and theres 3 conservative candidates. 1 is a maga candidate, 2 are moderate.  In this scenario let's say you're progressive.


In an area like Eugene that leans liberal, it's far more likely that the 2 liberal candidates will make it to the run off. 


Since you want a progressive candidate to win, you give the progressive liberal candidate 5 stars and the moderate candidate 4 stars. 


If you really don't want the 1 maga candidate to win, then you mark that one as a zero, and you mark the 2 moderate Republicans with 1 or 2 stars.  Even though you might not want any of the Republican candidates to win, you can still rank your choices between them.


This way, you can ensure you vote Against the maga candidate if they happen to manage to make it into the automatic runoff. 


Then if it is the two liberal candidates that make it to the run off, your 5 star choice is where your ""vote"" goes to. ",1709251263.0

"DragonballLegends","t5_h1zup","I mean if we're talking pity yea no, but if we're talking sheer rates, frequency of free steps, and how much premium currency legends gives.

On a month by month basis legends I shit you not gives out 2-5 times more premium currency compared to other gachas, (you get 25 multis on average every month not counting free steps) and it's rates for lfs are pretty solid at .5% for the featured which seems to be ab average.

"gianmarcosoresi","t5_8jpwxe","I'm really trying to control my emotions as it relates to this and communicate in a way that is effective here. But this hits home for me. My wife was impregnated by another man and everyone who knew kept their mouths shut. I certainly wish people would have told me. But no, instead I had to find out that everyone knew and didn't care enough to let me know. You're robbing the man who raised you of the right to make his own decisions. You're betraying his trust. You're treating him like a child who needs to be protected. If he ever finds out, I'm telling you from experience that it will hurt him far worse that you kept it from him. Can he trust no one?  


You yourself had your son take a DNA test. I imagine that's because even if the truth was scary and horrible, you want to know it anyway. The message you've sent your own son is that you'd rather know. Do you really think your Dad is so different? Imagine the results from your son's test came back as ""We've decided we know what's best for you. We've talked it over with the other DNA labs and decided you can't handle the truth.""   


You might say you're all not telling him for his benefit. But are you sure it's not coming from a selfish place where you all really don't care enough about him to deal with the trouble it will cause for yourselves? I'm not here to act like I have always made perfect decisions. I knew about a friend cheating on his wife and didn't say anything to her. But the day I felt outraged that no one told me, I realized I had unfinished business with the woman who I was doing the same thing to. I immediately went to her home, told her everything I knew and asked for her forgiveness. Her husband was my squad leader in the Army, and I risked no shortage of repercussions. But I would have gladly suffered far worse to be able to look this person in the eye without feeling like part of the problem.  


I don't know you, and I'm on the internet killing time instead of doing difficult but meaningful things this very moment. I've got no Ivory Tower to look down from in judgment. I just know how it feels to be in your Dad's position. There is room for diverse opinions on this topic. My OPINION just happens to be that absent having consent from your Dad directly by asking him, ""If I knew an unpleasant truth, would you want me to keep it from you to preserve your happiness?"" that you are fucking up.  


Finally, to step back a bit from just reliving my own painful experience, I'm sorry this has happened to you and your siblings. Your mother's lies have been catastrophically damaging. It's not an easy thing to deal with and I hope things work out as best they can for everyone involved. Best of luck, brother.",1709251263.0

Lastly, the companies you invest in may own factories and make money, but you'll never see a penny of it.   There are of course some companies which pay dividends, but for the most part those days are over.  The dividend rates are pitiful.  And that is the reason why stocks can lose 50% in a month.   You may think they have intrinsic value, but they really don't.  Of course at the end of the day, it's all a matter of definition.

"synthesizers","t5_2rdyc","So, I have a minilogue xd and a hydrasynth deluxe. There are a couple of real key differences between them, obviously not counting the hugeness (73 keys) of the deluxe. 

The XD is pretty quick and easy as far as falling into a good sound. It takes less twiddling around with controls to get to a pretty good sounding place. It's harder to get to an amazing, unique sound because you have much less control over the signal than a hydra. Limited LFOs, envelopes, waveforms, only one filter type, etc. This does make the XD a little easier to navigate in a way, because you're more limited...which is not always a bad thing. You can make a cool retro sound in 20 seconds on it if you know what you're going for, hydra has a lot more going on. Also...a sequencer. This is big if you like to sorta one man jam. Hydra lacks one.

The hydra is a sort of limitless machine, but it can be harder to figure out where you're trying to go. Even with that module by module control scheme, which I think is sort of genius. Hydra has double the voices, so 8 notes can be played simultaneously. 16 on the deluxe. 219 waveforms, bunches of ways of modifying them (wavetables and mutants, fm, etc). Mod matrix, poly aftertouch. The polytouch is big for me, I came from guitar and the polytouch adds a sort of expressiveness that I was missing with the XD.

They're both good. They're very very different. Hydra is one you can grow into a bit more and really delve the depths of sound design. XD you can just grab and start playing a little easier, and at the right settings can sound damn powerful.",1709251264.0

Sexual contact doesn't have to mean directly touching private parts.

With how OFTEN Gaijin uses “real specs” as a reason to NOT do something, its mind boggling when they do the exact opposite and add/remove things “just because”. 

Especially amusing when Gaijon had them in the game and then removed the tracer rounds because THEY DONT EXIST… and now they pull this and say its for QoL… which is it?

Do we balance off of QoL and the game lacking features, or do we balance off real life specification? Because it seems like they just do whatever the hell they feel like just because, and add/remove or refuse to add/remove things based on whatever the hell they want. Its not realistic!

Same with organ harvesting, weapon smuggling, drug manufacture and distribution, all of which get people killed or maimed daily. Should star sector itself be banned because of that?

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","I work for a software company and one of my duties, which I coincidentally happen to be offloading as of today, is investigating fraudulent behavior for the mobile game made by one of my company's divisions. (This is not my main job, it's not even my division, but our CEO thought I'd be good at it, and I was.)

We have made mistakes in our investigations, some people do fall into gray areas, but it's honestly like one in a thousand. Part of my duties included double checking for errors, and I haven't found an error in our checks in... probably a year or more.

The devs can absolutely tell. If our little mobile game by our little software company with a quarter of the users ESO has contains enough data to easily check on that, ESO most *assuredly* does.

Meanwhile, I've been in voice chat with people ranting about getting banned and then admitting to the ban-worthy offense in the same breath. Same thing has happened in the course of my investigations - people will admit to what they did and tell me I should unban them because it wasn't a big deal, or it shouldn't be against the rules, or they deserve to be able to break the rules, etc. (Our game has tangible, big-ticket prizes paid for by the company, if that tells you anything about how serious cheating is.)

"disneyporn","t5_2w0s9","Heres the issue.  The artist and anti AI folks are usually not very educated as to how AI software actually works beyond what everyone knows on the standard website generators.  Most don't know anything about how actual controlled generators like Stable Diffusion work.  But realistically, they don't care.  They have found a cause to get behind, and they will attack anyone on the opposite side without hesitation and with extreme aggression.  They feel their livelihoods are threatened and they will be replaced.....which is true for most peoples jobs over the next few decades as AI takes over.  

&#x200B;

I could write up a great response on how they are only focusing on what is loss with AI and not what is gained, or how its a new industrial revolution for humanity...but once again, they won't care.  Because they have chosen their side.  The world will go on without them.  AI will take over many industries.  And artist will still create art by hand.  But those poor artist, who struggle to get people to pay them for their scribbles are now even less likely because the supply of their product has skyrocketed and at a much better quality than most of them produce.  So their community is scared.  Fear turns to anger and anger to hate.  We all know the line.    


Should this subreddit allow it? They already do honestly.  And cmon, its a smut subreddit for disney porn.  You would think the horny fucks wouldn't care if their art is organic and vegan.  But here we are.  With nonstop hate because of all the fear and it's not really up to them, its up to the mods, they make the rules here.",1709251268.0

you have to tell the bot 2 times that you want to speak to an agent for it to go thru, just expect 2 sentence long answers and literally no concern for you problems lol.

* Please run a Google lens check on the profile you intend to chat with, [see here for how](https://www.supereasy.com/how-to-find-out-if-someone-is-using-fake-pictures/).

* Do not send naked pictures with your face in them, you will be blackmailed.
* New accounts, with no comments, or low post history, are suspicious. Stay away.
* Do not use personal accounts with friends & family contacts on it, you will be blackmailed.
* If the user has Free karma posts, or one line quote posts, they are suspicious. Stay away.

"Grimdank","t5_3ilna","Everyone can have their own opinions, I don’t intend to insult people that like vulkan and the salamanders, I just will never understand the appeal. 

Because if you want a guy that never wanted to be a warrior, with a better storyline and not perpetual plot armor, you have Lorgar. Lorgar wanted to be a priest, and actually converted planets to the imperium without fire and violence like “good guy” vulkan. 

Or if you wanted “good guys” that still fit into a grimdark setting, you have multiple factions in Age of Sigmar. The Stormcast Eternals are immortal souls of heroes, but after every revival there is a chance they lose a bit of their humanity until they’re mindless automatons. Both dwarf factions have extreme flaws but usually don’t go around murdering innocents. 

Meanwhile we know Vulkan will be back and it’s just going to be the same old Vulkan. Reddit will have a field day, and that honestly may just be the point where I stop caring about 40K lore. 

Because Lion coming back and a large part of the Fallen being redeemed was also stupid to me. I hate the imperium and especially its genocidal demigods being heroic.",1709251269.0

Yeah, some people basically stop being attracted to anyone but their partner, but that's far from the default. Most people just decide that they don't need anyone but their partner. But looking at someone else without any intentions is no big deal. 

Also, you should probably be careful with the term ""gay panic"" It's originally a legal term that was used to justify violence against gay people.

"Workers_And_Resources","t5_y8j84","Ideally all waste should be pre-sorted at the source and then routed to the appropriate recycling or disposal facility. Early on only industrial buildings can do this, but they tend to produce the most anyway. Some waste cannot be pre-sorted though (like hazardous waste), so you will have to sort it first. I usually just send it through a general separation plant instead of the specialized plants because I don't think the extra small amounts are worth the hassle.

Each waste type is then dealt with in its own way:

* I usually turn construction waste into gravel or cement and then export the excess.
   * Construction waste can also be handled as an aggregate, which is good for getting more utility out of existing aggregate vehicles and facilities.
* Hazardous waste is treated and then sent to the separation plant. 
   * You can also just burn it for a lot of pollution instead of treating it, but this creates a lot of pollution and extra ash and you lose out on plastic waste.
   * Do not use the large open stands to collect hazardous waste from hospitals, as it will decay and create a lot of pollution while in the stand. Small bins do not have this issue.
* All scrap and plastic waste is recycled at the areas steel/aluminum/plastic are made or to a nearby industrial zone that can use these products.
* Biological waste is sent to be converted into fertilizer until no more fertilizer is needed, at which point you want to burn the extra as biological waste, as burning fertilizer generates extra ash and less power/heat.
   * Biological waste will decay into fertilizer in dumps, even if mixed with other waste types.
* Solid fertilizer is only useful for farms and then only when not mixed with other waste types.
   * Vehicles can load fertilizer from biological-waste/fertilizer mixes as long as the fertilizer portion stays over 30% of the mix.
* ""Other"" waste and burnable waste should just be burnt. Burnable waste is the best waste ""fuel"" for power/heat generation, while ""other"" waste is one of the worst.
   * When you sort anything, the portion that wasn't extracted becomes ""other waste.""
* Ash should be either exported for a fee or put into dumps and allowed to decay into nothing over time.
   * You will likely need several dumps to get the ash decay rate high enough to match your republic's generation rate. Ash also creates pollution while decaying.
   * Make sure to set the incinerator's ash dump to ""mixed waste"" to allow ash to be placed into it if only construction waste or metal scrap remain in it.",1709251270.0

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","Women like muscles at least as much as gay men... they just don't like to admit it.

Honestly though, I don't really see the actual evidence for gay guys being the fitness gods Reddit thinks they are. They seem to hold exactly zero records in powerlifting, bodybuilding, and strongman, and they seem to win exactly zero major competitions/meets/shows every year.

No disrespect to Rob Kearney, dude is a beast.... but we all know he's not gonna win anything major. 

I also just don't actually experience day to day that gay men rule the gym. I've been lifting for ten years, juicing for four in July, and I've got a lot of very muscular friends. They're all straight. 

I'm not trying to be a dick or shit on gays. If you guys lift, that's cool. I just kinda hate feeling gaslighted by this claim. It wouldn't make me upset if gay guys started dominating strength sports and were generally the biggest guys in the gym. I just never see it so I'm kinda sick of hearing it.",1709251270.0

So that’s one little detail done. But you still need a million other details and, you know, the core content that is important (characters, major set pieces, etc). So they may need 100-200+ artists.

Not trying to diverge the topic, but hopefully that gives a valid reason to continue to talk when it seems ridiculous. It's going to be important to have the most amount of information available for everyone to make their own informed decisions on things, like namely an upcoming election. I fully agree there is genocide happening, and it's not justified. That said, I can completely understand if Israel has decided to take the gloves off and doesn't care about their world image. Their actions that lead to the attacks cannot be ignored, but at a certain point I'm guessing in war you stop thinking about the terrible things you become okay with to reach an end. WW2 veterans describe winning the war by proving they could be more atrocious, and to such a degree that it horrified the enemy to not want to continue war. How many more years would the Pacific theater lasted if Japan didn't surrender? Could have lasted decades since we didn't share any physical boarders, and would have been who can send more over to the other...

"television","t5_2qh6e","Yeah... while I truly do understand the practical considerations you mentioned, I find it challenging to fully grasp or respect the choices made. There are plenty of actors proficient in both Portuguese and English (way more than Japanese, by the way), making the inclusion of authentic multilingual dialogue feasible. Nevertheless, I recognize that creative decisions involve various factors and constraints.   
  
But in such cases, I truly believe the responsibility for this likely falls on buttoned-up executives who insist on American media being delivered solely in English. This is a long-standing trend, often driven by the assumption that they need to cater to an audience they perceive as less intelligent than they truly are. It seems Hollywood executives may have a tendency to underestimate the intelligence of the American audience. And as someone who appreciates the high level production of American content, I often find myself frustrated by certain decisions and the amount screenplays butchered for the sake of those choices.   
  
But anyway, despite these reservations, I'm still committed to watching the show. It's well-crafted, and while it could have been something much more special with genuine multilingual representation, it has its own merits for sure.   
  
Like I said, it's my only complaint. I honestly don't think I'm being unfair to the show here, not at all.",1709251271.0

"weightlifting","t5_2rlwc","These aren't bad for a beginner! The second is a better-executed clean overall - you get more leg drive and pull under more aggressively (your feet come up off the floor). 

Starting, and staying, over the bar will improve your bar path and pulling mechanics. That's what starting with higher hips should help you with - you'll be able to lean out a little more over the bar in your setup. You want your chest and shoulders over the bar, all the way up to the point where you start to extend. 

This will also help you extend at the right time. In your current lifts, you are extending too early - the bar is leaving your legs at mid/low thigh, when it should be leaving them when it's just below your hip crease. This is partly because you get ""behind"" the bar too soon. You want to be over the bar right up to when you move into power position (knees bent, back vertical, bar on your upper thigh just below your hip crease).

It may actually help you to practice cleaning from power position - video from Catalyst Athletics [here.](https://youtu.be/VBYmpgC2XiM) Great for understanding leg drive and timing. Everything you do in the earlier part of the lift is just to get your body to that position as efficiently as possible, so that you can drive vertically with your legs and then pull under. So, it's worth really dialing that in.",1709251271.0

"canada","t5_2qh68","Pierre has said plenty of times that he will tie housing starts to immigration.  I asked you already what would it be other than a linear relationship and you can't answer? It always will be a linear relation ship. There will always be a need for a x number of houses per y people. It is that simple and you don't need to make it complicated. Also for some odd reason, people seem to think that the Conservatives need to release their whole entire election platform when there isn't even an election yet.   
  
Yeah I looked at the stats for everything before commenting. I wouldn't say increasing housing starts from 200k to 250k is meaningful considering immigration has gone up like 4x. That is consistent with every post I have made so far. If the Federal Government decides they're going to accept to that much immigration, it is their responsibility to ensure we're accepting an amount that municipalities and provinces can absorb responsibly.   
  
The norm now is new immigrants getting crammed into the basements with 6 other people because of lack of housing but yet some how you think

> and is likely actually actively harmful if he actually follows through with the threats.

Harmful how lol? Definitely not harmful compared to what Liberal immigration policies are doing to this country. It's not the feds responsibility to fund municipalities. If they want fed money, they should increase housing permits. 

>Hopefully looking at how housing starts were rising faster than population growth for almost five years and housing prices kept going up

Housing prices go up, because we have more immigrants than housing. A lot of immigrants have no choice but to live with a bunch of room mates. The result though is house prices increase because they can be rented out for more because now there's like 6 incomes in a single house. 

I've already dismantled your argument about population change. If Canada reaches 100 Million population and we keep growing at around 1%. It's obvious that we will need 10/4 the houses of what we need at  40 million population at 1% growth. Even though the percent growth in the same, the number of houses needed will need to 2.5x. This same concept apples in 2015-2023.",1709251271.0

"SameGrassButGreener","t5_2u6j8","I agree and disagree with you. 

I think Chicago is the best city in the US for COL, economy, culture, infrastructure, institutions, diversity when you combine all those factors. What Chicago offers at its price you just can’t beat it. 

However aside from the standard weather complaints and crime (I agree on both), there is one thing that most never mention: Midwest culture. 

Midwesterners are nice but I just cannot connect with them. So many folks flood Chicago from their surrounding states and just have this Midwest culture I find to be nice, but also not genuine and insular. They also bring with them a segregated attitude. 

I love Chicago, and by all means it’s a global city in what it offers, but its culture is not cosmopolitan at all. Once you enter the white collar professional world in Chicago you really see that Midwest mentality and culture dominate.",1709251272.0

While Mario are characters are like Popeye and Bugs bunny. They are gag characters that are usually very unimpressive and have relatively normal strength feats, but every so often, they will perform some of the most insane feats you will ever see.

The average Sonic fan has probably no idea of what happens in the RPGs or the extensive list of power ups that Mario could use. If they go purely by mainline games, then Mario is absolutely not impressive when compared to Sonic.

I think your misunderstanding of my question comes from not recognizing that basis for all human systems is the individual and collective psyche..it's like you are answeing about the events, but not about what is driving those events. That's my impression. Your answer is not unhelpful, and for me it has interesting points, but it's not what I was asking about.

To ask it another way – what processes in human psyche are the basis of USA being so much greedier and violent than any other country in the world?

https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1b3buck/pilot_reports_ufo_sighting_i_didnt_see_any_wings/

While I very well understand that the most likely explanation is balloons, there is still doubt in my mind. I mean, Kirkpatrick himself told us about metallic spheres all around the world, and in February, three UAPs were shot down over the US.

So, I'd like to know if there could be a way for us to distinguish between a balloon and a metallic sphere of unknown technology. Let's just imagine we know for a fact that they exist. Kirkpatrick mentioned something during a NASA conference about light reflection being a clue. If it reflects X amount of light in X situation, then it's anomalous.

PAs are amazing and if I was going into a different field I may have gone the PA route, but for psych, I feel like the training and direct patient care experience I get as an RN before going into a good DNP is invaluable. Also, I’ve heard a lot of PA’s say they don’t feel like they got enough psych training to be a psych PA. If I graduate nursing school and become an ER nurse before switching to psych for a few years before going to school to be a PMHNP, I’m almost guaranteed to get a lot of valuable good experience that I don’t know I would get before PA school.

PG is a respected player and has been a great player in this league, but he has never been known for leadership and/or the mental fortitude needed to win a championship.

Here’s what you want. Replace the light with a normal one (without integrated pir). Add a separate pir that switches both the light and the fan. The simplest way is to put the pir where the blanking plate is as you have all the cables you need there. Permanent live switch live and fan cables.

There's just so much interesting interactions they could have, and the Final Fantasy characters don't even need to take the spotlight, just give them some attention and screentime. Olympus has actually had the best track record for that, considering how it involved Auron and Zack in the story well, so why not just give us more of that?

"PropagandaPosters","t5_2rm3n","A lot of early zionists who weren’t Jewish (like Belfor) were extremely antisemitic and wanted Israel as a place to send Jews away to so they weren’t a “problem” in their own countries anymore. They didn’t think that the people living in Palestine already were actually people, more like an annoying problem to be dealt with. Now those people still exist, some like neo-nazi Richard Spencer still support Israel while other antisemites will always criticise Jewish people no matter where they live, they don’t really like Palestinians either but will support them at tined because of how obsessively they hate Jewish people. Then there is the modern free Palestine movement which is anti zionist but doesn’t not believe Jewish people should be expelled from countries or that Jewish people are in any way a problem population. It’s the actions specifically of the Israeli state and its supporters that use the similar tactics as old school colonial powers to disenfranchise, displace and disempower the population who lived on the land before Israel arrived. I think there’s arguments for and against Israel being a settler colonial state ([early zionists called it settler colonialism that needed to be supported by perpetual violence for example](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Wall_(essay)), before it was considered a bad word for example) but I think the actions look very similar to how colonialism worked and it’s out of sync with modern values. [Shaun has a good video about it](https://youtu.be/3xottY-7m3k?si=7Q_5HcMAfLGAf8BR). 

Anyway, just to finish up I want to say I will always fight against antisemitism and people who try and exclude Jewish people from our country. We have fucking neo-nazis marching here in Australia and I am so sorry to you and all Jewish people experiencing antisemitism right now, including from those Palestinian activists who should not be part of that movement.",1709251276.0

Jemesin's Broken Earth trilogy does this really well: you have people born with magic who are very evidently an oppressed class and we see what exactly it means for them to be an oppressed class, and you also have regular old racism that we see intersect with wizardism and see how the two (as well as other avenues of oppression) connect and build off each other.

They don't prioritize productive job creation because it doesn't align with their interests, which are primarily concerned with maximizing profits and maintaining economic hegemony.

Also, the influx of immigrants is often a direct consequence of the imperialistic policies that have destabilized their home countries. These individuals are not migrating by choice but by necessity, driven from their homes by the very same forces of economic domination that the capitalist system perpetuates.

It's a cyclical trap: imperialism damages economies, displaces populations, and then those same displaced individuals enter the workforce in the imperial core, often exploited for cheap labor, which in turn feeds back into the system of capital accumulation for the elite. It's a global chain reaction where the root causes are inextricably linked to the systemic operations of monopoly capitalism.",1709251278.0

My soon probably refused 50 bottles over the course of two and a half months, from both me and others.

In the weeks leading up to going to back to work and putting my son in daycare, I *agonised* over how it was going to be for him.  All I could think about was him crying for me, being hungry and tired and alone in a cot and not knowing where I was.

I agonised for nothing though.  My daycare provider only has another three children in her care, and she had the time and professional nous to be able to get my son sleeping in a cot for long stretches of time and also drinking from a bottle almost immediately.

If a person holds a view that they believe strongly about, they may not be asking ""what do you think"" in order to only find out what you think, but also to decide if they want to associate with you. It may upset them to be presented with someone who holds the opposite view. 

It can also be threatening to them, depending on the topic in question. If the topic involves their personal identify and potentially their safety, you holding an opposing view might make you a threat to them even if you have no personal desire to harm them.",1709251279.0

The ""act"" is **refusal** to serve food. If you aren't willing to recognize what we are talking about then why are we continuing?

"Dramione","t5_2sdgl","Your post has been removed because your Reddit account does not meet the 10 combined karma minimum required to post in this subreddit. If you're new to r\/Dramione, please take a moment to **[review our rules](https://reddit.com/r/dramione/wiki/rules)** and make sure your post meets the sub's posting requirements. If you're new to posting on Reddit, please read the information below, and if you have any questions, please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Dramione).

## Why was my post removed?

Like many subreddits, r/dramione requires users to have a specific amount of ""karma"" before they can submit posts in the community. A bot automatically removes a post if the OP (original poster) does not have a combined karma score of 10 or higher.

## What is karma? 

Karma is like your ""reputation score"" on Reddit. The more positive interactions you have on Reddit, the more karma you gain. It shows that you understand how to interact in ways that are appropriate to the communities you engage with.

Karma that comes from comments is “comment karma”, while karma that comes from posts is “post karma”. Adding the comment karma and post karma scores together provides your “combined karma” amount. 

## Why is a minimum karma amount required to post?

The 10 combined karma minimum on r/dramione is intended to prevent spam, bots, and trolls from making new accounts just to solicit or harass people in our community. However, it also means that new Redditors (or prolific lurkers) need to earn some karma before they can post on r/dramione.

## How do I get karma?

You can gain karma from both comments and posts you make anywhere on Reddit. When other users upvote a comment or post you’ve made, you it gives you karma. 

For r/dramione, you don't need a specific amount of karma to comment on existing posts, so look for posts with topics you have experience or interest in, and start commenting to contribute the discussion and start earning karma.

## How much karma will my comment get?

When you make a comment, it automatically starts with 1 karma point. When other users upvote your comment, you earn one additional karma point per upvote. You lose karma only if your comments or posts are downvoted. 

- 1 comment + 0 upvotes = 1 karma

- 1 comment + 1 upvote = 2 karma

- 1 comment + 1 downvote = 0 karma

## How do I avoid being downvoted?

Some subreddits are quite strict about how you can interact, but r/dramione is very beginner friendly. On r/dramione, downvoting is usually limited to comments that are disrespectful, off-topic, or violate the subreddit rules in some way — so it's important that you [read the rules](https://reddit.com/r/dramione/wiki/rules) to understand the best ways to engage. You can also browse existing posts to learn how other members successfully interact before you start participating. 

**If you want to earn karma quickly, leave comments that contribute to the post’s topic and avoid starting arguments.**

## How do I know how much karma I have?

You can find your karma scores in your account profile. Anywhere you see a number labelled “Karma”, that is your combined (total) karma amount.

- **On desktop:** In the upper-right corner, you should see your username. The number directly underneath it is your combined karma amount.

- **On mobile:** Tap on your avatar in the upper-right corner. A menu panel will expand and you will see a number labelled “Karma”. That is your combined karma amount. 

   - **If you don’t see your avatar,** look for a navigation bar at the bottom of your screen. Press the “Home” icon until your avatar is displayed in the top-right.

   - **If you don’t see a bottom navigation bar,** press the back button/arrow in the top-left of the screen until you do.

To my understanding, his individual properties are leveraged to the tits and beyond. Some of the properties might have enough net value after clearing liens against them, but *selling* them is illiquid, and he's been credibly accused of defrauding lenders in the exact same way he would need lenders to give him loans against his properties. Selling a property short to drum up cash would likely cause a run on his credit by existing lenders snowballing and asking for his loans due immediately, which would collapse the entire enterprise.

Bankruptcy hasn't stopped him before, but I'm guessing he's now at the end of his Useful Idiot run for foreign influence.

"CombatFootage","t5_2v0c6","except its important to remember that you cant really quantify animosity and backlash. Nazi germany was absolutely eviscerated after world war 2, split in two with its people having it hammered into their heads that its all their fault, and they live entirely at the mercy of the ones who defeated them and bombed their homes. that they are fortunate that they, as a national entity, still existed to begin with.

contrast that with germany after ww1, whos punishment was an economic slap on the wrist after the treaty of versailles was essentially reduced by more than half, and germany was allowed to rebuild its army. or contrast it with the confederacy, who started a war to defend slavery, promptly lost it, and then went out of their way to spin the most atrocious tale of revisionist history since the romance of three kingdoms. all because they were treated nicely enough to have the leeway nessecary to engage in widescale political revisionism. revisionism which went on to result in over a century of economic, racial and political division which still sees the south become economically, socially and technologically backwards. a century onwards and they still view the ""authoritarian yankee"" with more disdain than a french jew views germany.

Except Ukraine did not invade russia, so their animosity is not based on humiliation in case they lose, its based on the sheer hubris of invasion in the first place.

in contrast, Russia's history is filled to the brim with examples of them losing wars disastriously and then overcompensating violently against the people who defeated them and trading land for blood.

IB might be the “best IB” program in the country - but what does that really even mean? An international business degree itself doesn’t really get you anywhere, especially as an undergrad degree. The honors college is great too, but not at the same level as more prestigious schools if you want to be in the most prestigious jobs in finance, which is all about where you went to school and/or who you know.

But, I believe in the IB program you have to get two degrees. If your second degree is accounting or finance, then the IB degree is a great complement to those. But don’t think that doing a lesser degree like marketing is somehow made up for by doing an IB degree. 

If you want to do accounting - USC is great. If you want to finance - USC is great. Big 4 all recruit out of USC, and that’s all that matters.

but a more prestigious school would be better long term if you want to go into management consulting or investment banking. 

But if you want to do accounting/finance with an IB degree - I would challenge that as the best idea. Accounting/finance + something like information systems would take you far further than accounting/finance + IB. Yeah it’s the most prestigious IB program, but no one really cares about an IB undergrad.",1709251280.0

"truezelda","t5_2tfzp","Were you around back then? I'd literally open up the game magazines and read about interviews where they were asked point black and they said there is no official timeline; make of it what you will as fans; etc. Hey, I get it; I'm a nerd too. The people who frequent these subs are really hardcore fans who want there to be a master tapestry that binds all the lore together, and a Silmarillion or a complete Ferengi Rules of Acquisition. But there isn't. I appreciate that there are people here who have spent hundreds of hours pouring over historical records to prove a cohesive theory of everything Zelda. And yes each successive game was inspired by at least some of the previous games and they share loose or notional commonalities, and they play off of each other. But you also have prominent members of the team who have said that the story was an afterthought pretty late into development while writing the game manual because that's just how they did things back in the 90s because the big man, Miyamoto, wouldn't bother with story. So what you have is different people working on these games with different ideas that are sometimes consistent and sometimes inconsistent. And sometimes they like to say things about how the games are related to get customers hyped. It's pretty clear there's no one unifying voice like a Pope saying what is true and not true. Nintendo isn't taking it super literally. This is a children's toy company. I take them as seriously as I take Hasbro's lore on the back of Transformers boxes. This is the company that thought it'd be a good idea for the second game in the series to have two Zeldas alive at the same time. So, no you shouldn't give much weight to the ""official timeline"" because it's clearly been outmoded. Just as the timeline was once official, so too must it now be official that there were two to three imprisoning wars as of BotW, likely two Ganondorfs who lived overlapping lives as of TotK, etc. Nintendo isn't taking it that seriously and clearly show they aren't beholden to a strict interpretation of what came before. ",1709251281.0

The Marvel's is just a fun film, it's nothing amazing but it's perfectly watchable.

Lastly , I have the spray in the 59 scent and i absolutely love it !

"politics","t5_2cneq","There is a rather substantial cultural divide between the urban and the rural area of our country.   The rural areas are of course rather isolated.  They get most of their view of the rest of the country through a very small number of media sources that tell them to not trust any other source.    Mainly Fox News, OANN, and Truth Social, among a few others.   These outlets act as vehement propaganda machines that take their marching orders from a small, powerful, and well organized group of think tanks and PR firms.    These news outlets get put on and left on all day in all sorts of locations in these rural areas, and even in some suburban and urban areas as well.   They’re ubiquitous.  

So vast swathes of our county are fed a constant stream of lies and deceit.  They are told that any dissenting opinions are evil.   And since just about everyone around them feels the same, they internalize it and it becomes their reality.

"HomeNetworking","t5_2s4pd","I'm sorry but I do disagree. I believe this is a misguided and inaccurate statement for the average user, and only with exception to those who are tech savvy. 

Most home internet users in the US (Not sure about anywhere else in the world) are still using copper internet services such as cable. Even fiber these days are run via copper sometimes (Hybrid networks). What is misguided is the fact that you counting on:  


1. A stable internet connection
2. Consistent speed
3. Consistent quality
4. Consistency

Most cable companies these days offer (At least in my area) 10/1 ratio, 10 down and 1 up. It will depending upon the company, the ownership of the lines, and signal strength. 

What's not accounted for is:

Example 400 / 40 internet

Cable companies no longer offer such high minimum guaranteed speed and or if they do it's 60% - 70% of the service. 

Your internet speed is now 280 / 28

Now let's take into account the  variability in infrastructure quality , congestion, signal strength, quality, equipment (including the type of modem and line conditions. Remember this is the average user, and the average user uses the standard cable modem.), area, splits along the line, stealers, interference, quality of service, and so much more. On copper that's probably bringing it down to 120ish during peak times, and depending upon the area. As of now, your average user is probably hitting a bottle neck. So now because they chose a lower speed instead of higher, it has created a problem. Now admiringly I am not sure if this is still relevant now a days, but it was about 10 - 15 years ago, priority was Business, then higher speed users. 

Essentially, it comes to the average user, does the average user need it? No. 

Would it better to have some leave way in terms of bandwith? Yes.

By limiting it you may create a possible problem for them in the future if they want to expand, and or add devices. You are not leaving room for adding devices, improvements and or determining if it's a good fit, you are stating a speed for the tech savvy customer who can do a speedtest and maintain their networking infrastructure. 

So personally I would suggest for each device up to 8, each device should be estimated at or around 125 for each device. Not all devices will need that, however, I believe that is a good calculation for the average user. This accounts for any trouble, or issues, and allows for expansion on the network without it interfering with the others. So if they only plan on using 3 devices, then 400 would be good, however, let's say they want to add devices later on, 400 would not be enough, then the next step is 600. Let's say they have friends or family come over a lot and they tend to use the internet a lot, then it's going to a problem real quick without the proper provisioned speed.",1709251282.0

"GroundedGame","t5_28fh29","No “abandoned child” is not a psychology term. Abandoned child syndrome is a psychological disorder though. Is that what you are referring to? Because that’s still not at all how you described your situation. You can’t just use parts of medical phrases that have common applications and then say you weren’t using them in a  laymen sense. Firstly, because no you weren’t you just weren’t using the correct and/or accurate phrase. Also, it’s “layman’s terms” you would never make laymen plural in the context of that colloquial phrase. 

Now for the “dismissing arguments” claim. That’s just not true. Plenty of people have given you well-reasoned, rational ways to beat the boss. What about the person who you “refused to believe” when they told you how to keep the spider’s movement contained? Or the person telling you that you used the wrong armor? Or the person telling you you didn’t prepare enough?

In regards to your argument that phase three was easy, who said phase three is supposed to be harder? Where in the game does it say that? Have you thought to consider that the strategy you’re using is effective for phase three but not phase two (like the person that used different load outs for different parts of the fight suggested)?

"AttackOnRetards","t5_4bhj60","Tbf even in the real world, a big percentage of the world's population is centered in a relatively small circle that includes most of China, India and Indonesia. So I don't think the 80% is impossible, though truth be told I think complaints along this route are very nitpicky and not very interesting to talk about. The ecological disaster observations I'd also put under this category, since we've long thrown out physics or science out the window in this show, as do most stories that have fantastical elements. The premise of the Rumbling and its purpose are pretty simple to follow and allow for whatever character drama to unfold just fine, so again I find it a boring thing to discuss.

The societal impact complaints have more merit to them, and I'd love an epilogue chapter of sorts to explore the post-Rumbling world a little more. I wouldn't even require too much of it, but its addition would pretty much make the ending perfect for me, even though I'm personally 80-90% the way there already. One of Isayama's strengths is that in my evaluation he's incredibly skilled at constructing archetypical pieces that are interesting, clever and fit into the story, but he does on rare occasion forget to be fully dilligent on his execution, and the negotiation/diplomatic talks that are implied post-ending is one such case. I am very disappointed that what's going to be the last AoT content is going to be just more Levi content, because I sincerely doubt that's going to add anything meaningful that we already didn't know or couldn't tell and I suspect it's a bit of fanservice for the immense amount of Levi fans in Japan (and abroad).",1709251284.0

* Discount business hours for those who can WFH or with non office jobs
   * Bonus - get a few rooms for phone calls so people can have confidence that they can take a surprise meeting
* in my city prime time can be \~$70 or more but im in an expensive market
* specials for NFL games or whatever sport is big in your city (specials with food but not bay rates)
* specials for golf season - play the same course as the pros for a leauge in the summer
   * business will be harder in the summer obviously
* As others have said - lower price and get the liquor license, until then BYOB and higher price?
* partner with golf coaches that can get people in there
* get GSPro if your equipment supports it, runs lots of famous courses like Augusta

Both sides are for the rights of children. Neither are fully correct.

"trans","t5_2shbb","Soooo yeah. It does work with glasses like me but what I end up doing is getting on the counter and sitting like inches from the mirror.

I do it in separate parts instead of one move like a lot of people. I brace my elbow on my leg or table. I start with a wing. From the outer corner of my eye, I swipe upwards using a brush or felt tip eye liner. It will will thin out naturally. I then put the point of the tip on my inner eye and do a thin line up and towards the middle of my eye. From there I can readjust and draw a line drom the apex of my eye toward the initial wing. I try to curl it so it has a sharper look. You're looking to connect this line about halfway into the wing line. This should give you a triangle of eyeliner for the wing but still have a thin tail protruding. Lastly, I just color in the void area between where I drew my line and the wing.


It took me a long time. To practice I would come home from work and JUST practice this method. I'd do it then wipe itnoff and re do it like 8 times until my eye was raw. It just takes practice. I'm still bad at using my off hand to draw my right eye.",1709251286.0

Now, I don't hold it against her at all because she does what she's able to do in her limited time and it's not out of laziness or whatever. So I guess my mindset is if this is the way it has to be I'd like to at least feel that it's appreciated. I don't know if that makes sense.",1709251287.0

"askmath","t5_2qm4f","The Julian Calendar was adopted in 46 BC. You correctly noted that we are starting our calculation in 1 AD

Thats 506 leap days according to the Julian Calendar.

The Gregorian Calendar was introduced in 1582, which skips a leap year every 100 years, but reintroduces it every 400 years. This means we need to skip leap years in 1700, 1800, and 1900, so that's 503 leap years.

If we assume the Gregorian Calendar for the entire duration, we also need to exclude 100, 200, 300, 500... that brings us to 491 leap days.

However, the Gregorian Calendar skipped 10 days to put it back in sync with the season. Do those count as negative leap days? And what about England. They didn't adopt the Gregorian Calendar until 1752, and had to skip 11 days to be brought in sync.",1709251287.0

We create thousands of MW of renewables every year. Germany is 50% renewables, Denmark even more. What more evidence do you need? Alberta is 17% renewables with very little as hydro.

>I'm surprised you think this is simple. It's extremely challenging to build new transmission. 

It's literally done all over Europe and North America.

Are you really going to die on the hill that nuclear and carbon capture are less challenging than transmission of energy you know that thing we do literally everywhere.

Honestly it boggles my mind how people like you will argue this long on a topic you're so uninformed on? The only reason I respond is cause I have a YouTube channel and your answers help me make content to help educate people who are as misinformed/ uninformed on these topics. So thank you.

"Sino","t5_38jyn","It’s really gross.

The ‘Rules based international order’ is an artficial, imaginary creation, specifically designed to undermind the authority of UN institutions, as US global geopolitical influence slowly weakens.

When the G77 was created in 1964, the West’s reactionary response was to create the G5 in 1973 in order to counter them. This later mutated in to the current version of the G7 that we have today. 

To oversimplify, the G7 is a Western economic bloc, NATO is a Western military bloc, and the intangible “Rules-based order” is a Western neoliberal ideological bloc that seeks to export Western political institutions around the world, in order to influence/overthrow local governments and use them as political proxies.

In other words, the “Rules-based order” is a political bloc that operates under the direct guidance of US Intelligence services.",1709251288.0

"HealthAnxiety","t5_2vmoc","First of all, you are NOT pathetic. HA can be debilitating and I empathize deeply with your fears. I’ve had multiple MRI’s and CT scans (including a brain MRI for migraines which sent me into a deeeep spiral of panic for the week leading up to it). Here’s what I like to remind myself-you say the fear you have is that they’ll find something like C on the imaging, so you don’t go and get said imaging done. Not getting that imaging done, however, does not affect whether or not the root of the problem exists-it only prevents you from treating it. In the EXTREMELY rare case it would be anything serious and worthy of treatment, you getting that imaging done would just put you a step ahead for treating it and being healthy! :)
I know it’s so scary, when I got my brain MRI I was terrified that they were going to find a brain tumor-they didn’t, everything was fine, totally beautiful brain! I also had to get an ultrasound for pelvic pain last year, was convinced I had another tumor-no tumor, just a little common ovarian cyst that went away on its own!
Also, if you’re afraid of the actual process of an MRI or CT scan, let me reassure you there that it’s a breeze. The only thing that sucks is it’s just boring lol Some are 15 mins long, others are an hour, but time truly FLIES. I had a 30 minute MRI done once and when they pulled me out I was like “wait why’d you stop it early” and they were like “…we didn’t, that was 30 minutes….” lmao I hope some of this helps you feel better. Please try not to beat yourself up though, you are not pathetic!",1709251289.0

It seems like you are assuming a lot of things when you body is directly telling you the opposite, like eating below what you think your maintenance is and not losing weight. 

&#x200B;

Honestly it sounds like you need to refocus on diet and tracking your food and go from there. Maybe you are burnt out with trying to lose weight, if so there is no shame in maintaining your weight for a a bit to give yourself a break. But if you are recomping/at maintenance then you will be losing 0kg a week. That shouldn't be an issue because it seems like that is already the case for you.",1709251289.0

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","Those two guys with the book I mentioned weren't talking about anything short term so I don't think they intended it to win the next election. It was more to goad Democrats into an ideological shift. (I could be very wrong on this as it wasn't really a topic in the book and I have no idea what the ideological composition of the swing districts are.)

>Cook Partisan Voter Index...

Hey that looks interesting. It looks like (I'm looking at their house split) this is a surface level analysis though. Like there's no data set or survey information describing voters in the swing districts. So you're kind of like implicitly assuming no ideological shift within either party by assuming those numbers carry forward. (Maybe there's a pay walled data set though.) But it also certainly implies that their'd be no benefit in pushing out the NDC types if they're concentrated in districts which prefer that sort of tripe and concentrated in swing districts.

It's weird though there might be a kind of short term-ism dysfunctional equilibrium thing going on. This kind of set up seems to say they're hyper focused on these seats because the delta between the party preference is low but there might be competitive seats down in the safe territory of the other party after some ideological shifts go on.

Like MI-10 for example, shouldn't be too pleased with neoliberal economic policy, but also socially conservative, so they're turned off by basically all of the Democratic parties policies. I'd need more information to be sure though there's a lot of engineering design firms up there so they might be relatively inured from NAFTA aftereffects and I don't actually spend a lot of time in that district. (I lived in MI-12 or MI-13 for 35 years.) PA-01 might be similar and that's farther down the list in terms of delta between parties.

Eh I'd need a good data set that describes deindustrialisation in *fly-over-country* to do anything more serious. I'm pretty sure that doesn't exist or will be difficult to construct myself.",1709251290.0

He contributed maximum donations to both Coakley and her primary rival Warren Tolman in their 2014 bids for governor. Just months after the AG office, in January of 2015, declined to enforce its 2011 no-close agreement at Quincy Medical Center, Torre contributed a maxxed-out donation to the new AG, Maura Healey, presumably to help her pay off campaign debt. He continued to make maximum contributions to Healey in her 2018 re-election bid and her 2022 bid for governor.

>  this last yield curve inversion was literally the most broadcasted inversion ever, as in everyone had a years notice that the Fed was going to climb quickly and to a target. This allowed companies to get cheap debt and cut expenses early.

My understanding is that avoiding the recession was largely due to massive government stimulus spending in the pandemic. Given how massive the stimulus was, I think it would hard to find evidence for the borrow-early-and-cut-expenses hypothesis, but it seems you have some. I'd be interested in finding out more if you can share it.

> Also the yield curve is inverted because they expect rates to go down; after rates start going down a recession starts

You need to follow the procedure, and fill in your change form to be submitted for later review. You get a change form by filling out the 'Request to Change' form and submitting that first.""

Some companies try to stave it off, like the quote I heard about Amazon: ""Amazon is a multi-billion dollar company that still acts like a start-up."" But I'm betting even that will change over time.

There's obviously still pros to the slower, standardized, more methodical method. And spaceflight requires lots of methodical processes. I'm just saying, I bet there will be a time when SpaceX slows down too, the question is just when.",1709251292.0

"docker","t5_2y00f","The fact that some coders are 100% OK with CLI is the most typical nerd thing.

They don't have the sensibility for aesthetics or convenience. 

Instead, they love boredom and ugliness, they enjoy and actively pursue them.

It is perfectly OK, until they are tasked to design something for other ppl, even if these other ppl are also coders but less nerdy.

Take myself as an example, the moment I look at a CLI I want to throw up. I cannot stand using something from 40 years ago in the year of 2024.

Unfortunately this is what happened to a lot of software/libraries including Docker: the devs' purpose is to create a GUI to make less-nerdy coders' lives easier, but their nature makes them incapable of doing so.

Therefore,

1. for all IT companies please hire someone who knows UX to do the design work, don't bother the coders, they will screw everything up. 
2. you sound like simplicity and convenience mean nothing to coders, **which is another common mentality shared by lots of devs**. Some coders actually like things being difficult, because this way you can boast your intelligence and outcompete others, but let me tell you that you are against the trend. Not even one single area in this world appreciates difficultness instead of simplicity. Otherwise, why Python was even invented when we already had C and Java? Isn't it only because it is easier? With that said, do coders really pay no attention to simplicity?",1709251292.0

"gardening","t5_2qhkh","I just went down the proverbial rabbit hole and came up with an interesting concept. What if you set up a large reservoir of water on the north end of your greenhouse, and then connected pipes through the greenhouse to just outside the southern face, down at the base of the greenhouse. There, on the outside of the southern base, you could paint the pipe as black as possible and use reflectors to make sunlight heat the water in the pipes. 

Because the external, heated portion is the lowest point in the system, the warmer water will flow up through the pipes until it reaches the northern end. This would efficiently heat the water and allow for warm water flow throughout the greenhouse without power.",1709251293.0
"comicbookmovies","t5_2qx71","That really just adds to my point. Those guys are all big name directors, most of them qualifying for full-on auteur status, so their productions don't get much involvement from the suits; they're trusted to produce individually successful works in isolation. 

A Marvel movie isn't like that, at all. The expectation is that the director will make the kind of movie the suits want, and they'll meddle as they like to ensure that, regardless of what the director thinks is best. Like, there's a reason the director of Black Widow lists a few shorts, a couple indie movies, and mostly television work on her IMDB.",1709251293.0

I have two magic mice. First is the old AA battery version. With Bluetooth off it won’t connect.

Second mouse is a newer Magic Mouse two (rechargeable with lightning port). Have tried plugging this into the Mac which has connected it in the past, but doesn’t seem to be working now (presumably because Bluetooth is off).

Tried using keyboard short cuts to go Spotlight > Settings > Bluetooth. Somewhat successful in that I can get to where I can see the Bluetooth settings (toggle is right there!) but Tab and arrow keys don’t seem to be working to move me from the left column of the Settings window to the rights side where the toggle is.

By definition, half the population is below average intelligence, that's just reality. I'm not saying only dumb people vote Trump and only intelligent people vote Democrat, but there's a hell of a correlation between educational attainment and voting intentions.

And that's just general voting. With Trump, it's this on steroids. He's managed to build a Cult of Personality around him and if you hear just half the things they excuse him of, you'll realise why they are brainwashed.

This is a man that has repeated judgements about his financial, moral and political lack of capability and must voters either claim it's all fraud or they accept it and still vote anyway. If that's not brainwashed, what is it? Say what you want about the lack of worthiness of the Republicans in general, but this man is so singularly unworthy to hold any elected office, it's unprecedented in scale.

I don't believe 46% are all brainwashed, but the saying that if you have ten normal men and a Nazi voting on issues, you have eleven Nazis is true.

Then the years went on and the shit got more ridiculous with blatant lies with the proof out in the open and the followers dug in more. The more shit he made up the more they believed him. Once Covid started they’d rather believe his lives and die than be wrong. Famous examples are Herman Cain, Meatloaf, and Trump Himself was almost killed by his disregard for masks or safety.

If you are experiencing problems like this I would try to seek out help, no matter what the source of the help was if I were desperate enough, however one of the very last groups I would seek out for help is the CIA.

From what it sounds like you are experiencing either:

1. Altered states of consciousness.
2. Some kind of psychosis or hallucinatory disorder (probably from the LSD).
3. A combination of 1 and 2.

My advice:

Discontinue drug use. Approach a clinic for psychological counceling. Even if you are not insane, they may have valuable advice or resources that can help you not have such terrible experiences.

"residentevil","t5_2s0lb","I would agree with you about the AI being decent until I played the game solo on professional. Shit was wack. My Sheva was constantly on defense and yet she would waste all ammo, heals and would run in front of enemy fire with no hesitation. 

When you resort to making your AI partner a mule for the items you have no space for there's something to be said  about how poorly it works on higher difficulties. Again, that's only on pro, any other difficulty I had no problems.

Why... Why would they ever do that. Minors don't volunteer for that; not without outside influence and then you've got someone to prosecute. And if on the off chance that someone did decide to do so, any doctor who assisted with that would be rightly crucified and struck off.

But this is similar line of thinking to the scenario, ""Why shouldn't someone in prison be able to be president? There's no law against it!""

Also, how did the sliding glass door get knocked off the tracks if there was a stick in the way preventing it from moving and it was supposedly locked? Even if yanking super hard on a locked sliding door in its tracks WITH A STICK WEDGED IN TO PREVENT IT FROM SLIDING it would be mighty difficult to knock it off its tracks. Dude didn’t even try to just break the glass to get in? If it’s locked, most people aren’t going to sit there spending so much effort yanking and yanking to try to get the thing open, they’d search for another point of entry. Plus everything else pointed out in the comments about her supposedly having her pew pew on her but not wanting to traumatize Jace, despite her having no issue pulling it out in front of him for a dumb road rage incident… and her repeatedly saying “muh 14 year old son” instead of addressing him by name? We all know what his name is. Saying “14 year old son” over and over is a really weird way to add to the story.

So many holes in this absolute BS of a narrative… you’re not fooling anyone, Nelly. I hope this story comes back to bite her in the ass…",1709251296.0

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","Most of the time it is true, in that the person does have a form of autism, but my comment was primarily for the scenarios where it isn't true and are other factors, which then adds further strains to the system because parents or person have spent 4 years reading about their symptoms online or from friends/family, and then when being told they don't, they want a 2nd opinion.

Truism happens all the time, in many scenarios.

"fantanoforever","t5_310jd","I'm legit happy to see so many others enjoyed Trench as much as I did. And the thing is, I wouldn't say I was much of a fan of their stuff beyond a couple songs from previous albums. Something about Trench really took hold of me the year it came out, and I never expected to give it as much attention as I did because it started as a random ""let's listen to this, I guess"" sort of thing. The replay factor of it was crazy, and I enjoyed all the experimentation / styles they were digging in to. I have fond memories of letting the cassette tape loop over and over in my car the year it came out. It also has a sort of personal connection and nostalgia for me now, too, because it was what I had playing all the time when I first met my girlfriend. Transports me right back to Fall of 2018 whenever I listen.

"themagnusprotocol","t5_9l5lb8","""Yes and."" 

I think Smirke's List was a useful way to denote and understand manifestations of different Entities within the TMA, because the manifestations often aligned quite well with one specific Fear or another. We had weird outliers of manifestations that were multiple Entities - Martin, as an overt example - but most of the time the observers (the fanbase IRL, the Institute in-universe) could look at something and say ""Oh, that's a manifestation of the Entity known as the Vast"" or ""Buried"" and feel pretty confident, because we understood Vast and Buried to be both a) conceptually distinct and b) motivated towards different, sometimes contradictory goals. Implicit in both these statements was the underlying idea that the Entity in question *existed* as a distinct thing.

I would argue that in The Magnus Protocol world, Entities... don't. There are definitely weirdos - looking at you, Needles - but those aren't manifestations of different kinds of Fears that exist outside spacetime. Rather, Needles is something tainted by some meta-Entity - **The Fear** (love that) - manifesting in a very personal and unique way through Needles. If we get another needle-centric manifestation - the syringe scene from Saw, for example - that wouldn't be proof of an unique Entity centered on li'l pokey bits, but rather a case of two distinct manifestations of **The Fear** being kinda alike.",1709251297.0

He's like LeBron or Tom Brady, maybe you can point to some huge flashes of success (Pac & Biggie) or some pretty good sustained runs (Wayne, Cole, Drake, etc.), but he's cemented GOAT status imo.

It varies depending on job. There are pretty much only dual training jobs now in UK. IT is generally much more clinically focused. 

Where I mainly work and train we are heavily encouraged to be patient facing and do tons of ward reviews/consults MDTs, clinical and itu ward rounds.  Other places might be more phone advice lab based micro but that way if acting is rightfully dying off. Labs are more autonomous and authorising hundreds of urine results should really be a thing of the past. There is no real bench work (we do lab dops and ill occasionally look at plates/ grams etc) but it's more the knowledge that's required than any ongoing bench work (bms do this very well and will always be better than us at it)

Today example - I'm the ID reg at a specialist bone infection unit. I did a busy mdt clinic with ortho and plastics, followed by mini ward round then MDT as well as answering consults/advice emails. 

Happy to answer any questions (my experience is probably a bit atypical but I've done dgh lab micro in 2 different centres as well)",1709251298.0

"BeardedDragons","t5_2sove","So what you do is get down on eye level with them and the greens and stick out your tongue with a bit lettuce on it because they forget all the time how to eat greens! Be careful because they might try to snatch the one in your mouth but usually it’s an Ah-ha moment for them and they suddenly remember what foods are. Basically you gotta entice them by eating a salad in front of them like it’s the best thing ever and wait for that light bulb moment, you know? 

Scolding my beardie also works. I tell him no worms, no mind controlling of the cats, no running around the house like a mad man, until he eats his greens! He may sulk for an hour or so but he damn well gobbles up his greens if he knows what’s good for him.

I also replaced my previous caruncles with a new version of my own (FN doesn’t provide caruncles).   
**What I’m sharing here is:** 

[Version A: Eyes & caruncles replaced with \*current\* lighting - 
Version B: Eyes & caruncles replaced with new SSS (scale increase from .1 to .35 as radius wasn’t making a difference)
Version C: Eyes & caruncles replaced with new SSS AND new lighting](https://ibb.co/album/HhWmsk?sort=date_asc)  
*\*\*\*Please keep in mind these are 1K renders( as opposed to 2K in the initial post image). Also there’s some funky DOF stuff near the ears and hair, disregard for now\*\*\**  
With that in mind: specific to eyes, caruncles, SSS, or lighting- do any of these three versions succeed where my original post image on this thread failed?  I personally think Version C or B are the winners. Thank you for your thoughts in advance!",1709251300.0

"avatartrading","t5_6wm3u3","**Hey u/-PrecYse-, make sure your post follows our trading guidelines:**

You may only use the trading flair for trading for premium avatars. Premium avatars are Gen 1 to 5 avatars that were originally sold via the shop.

---

* **DO NOT trust trade!** 
There are **free swap tools** like **[ampule.io](https://ampule.io)** that allow you to create a p2p *safe swap* with avatars + MATIC/WETH to guarantee both sides send their half, and that the specified assets are genuine. 

* **Be careful!** 
If you choose not to use a free swap tool and just send your avatars over, or choose to use another swap tool that is not safe, *you are taking unnecessary risks* and it is **your loss if you lose avatars/tokens**. Unfortunately not everyone has genuine intentions here.

* Check the floorprices on [RCAX](https://rcax.io) or [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)
* Include the link to the item on OpenSea in your listing.
* Be hesitant when responding to direct messages.
* When trading with Redditors, please check their account age, activity and karma. New accounts are very likely out there to scam you.
* Only trade using RCAX, OpenSea, or using a *free* safe swap tool like [ampule.io](https://ampule.io) and look for the verified checkmark + orange Reddit snoo logo.
* You can only post using the Trading/Selling/Buying flair **once each every 24 hours**. So, make it count.
* Please stick to listing information only. Personal reasons on why you are trading is not relevant. 
* Listing posts are not the place to start discussions on the value/worth of avatars, if this happens please report the comments.

You can check if a member is **banned** at all times via the **[Universal Scammer List](https://www.universalscammerlist.com/)** by looking up their username. Remember that banned members can still reach out to you via DM. So to be safe, do a quick check!

We couldn't ask to search anything or even accuse someone without concrete and definite proof. We couldn't put hands on anyone, and couldn't prevent someone from leaving the store if they tried to push past us. If we accused someone and it turned out they didn't steal anything that was one of TWO possible strikes against your job. 

We were trained to deflect attacks and literally ASK people to stop trying to hurt us. If we fought back, we'd be fired. I've had guys literally pull knives out on me when I worked in Jersey City. I couldn't do anything about it without losing my job, and if I let the merch go, I'll still get scolded somehow.

Normally it's higher in urban combat, for example if it was like the U.S invasion of Iraq's numbers the civilian death toll would be tripled. This means that the IDF is actually preserving life better than most other modern armies in urban warfare according to the numbers.

"joinsquad","t5_33zyg","I am very skeptical about offensive air assets. I have nothing against them in principle, but games like Squad just aren't well designed with those features in mind. You can't **just** add Anti-air and flares. Just about everything can be made ""fair"" in a competitive sense, which is why it's a very weak argument on it's own. OWI will take the game where they want, but my impression (and hope) is that they want a more deliberate and tactical shooter compared to what we had in the past. 

The constant push for cool offensive assets, like we see a lot among certain audiences, has a tendency to destroy tactical/strategical nuance. This is a pitfall tactical games run into in general. Let's say you have category of assets who's function is to fight infantry. If you over-saturate the game with this category,  the game designer either has to nerf the effectiveness of said category (with all it's implications) or you have to create nuance and/or add more niches (requiring more utility)to the game. This is why people advocate for more flares and more AA. The problem with that is that we simply arrive where we were 2 decades ago. Do we really want to go back to that?

To cut it short, and I know this is blasphemy for many. IMO the easiest of way going forward **and** balancing a game that wants to be more tactical and strategical compared to it's roots is to start adding non-player controlled assets and/or spreading players out over more assets. For example 1 player controls 1 tank. Of course at this point we are talking about a widely different game, hence my apprehension. The issues are fundamental. Maps are too small. The players too few. (current) coordination overhead is too much. (current) tactics and strategical aspect too thin, which is argueably where we/OWI want to go judging by the ICO.

A wall of text can be written here, but right now outside of roleplay, you are not placing a small AA team at a clever place for map control. Generally speaking there are 3-4 blobs infantry squad blobs moving around the map, and players are happy if all of them are in one of two relevant places. The constant piling of tacticool assets incurs debt in terms of finding niches and (wholistically) balancing things.

So secondly what people then argue is to major fleshing out of strategical aspect of the game. Squad types. Slower game (ICO) for more deliberate placement and map control. More involved commander. More commitment in a match (SL dictated squad composition). Makes infantry death less painful in various way in order to make room for more anti-infantry assets. Embracing the fictional, in order to lean into more modern and/or speculative stuff  like electronic countermeasures in order to get more creative balancing (or else you end up at the same place we were 2 decades ago). On that same note, flesh intel out for the same reasons because game designers are always boxed in authentic games for obvious reasons.",1709251301.0

You might want to look into theories of personal identity. Some of them will say that there is no continuity of personal identity in your experiment.

Now, in terms of internal thoughts, then yes, it's conceivable that a Boltzmann brain could think/feel that it was simply the continuation of a first Boltzmann brain that existed and disappeared some million years before. Simply because the material makeup of such a brain would trick it into that illusion (here I'm assuming your hypothesis that brains create minds).


However, if we are talking about Boltzmann brains of arbitrary composition, this actual chain of continuity that your thought experiment describes is not needed: you could simply have a brand new Boltzmann brain existing with a fake memory that it has existed in a continuous magnetfor billions of years. That could, in principle, provide the very same thoughts in any of the Boltzmann brains that could exist in your ""chain of Boltzmann brains"" experiment.

Getting in range of Sri Lanka basically just required direct conquest all the way along the coast despite stacking every diplo range tech in the game.

Therefore it is not the same?

It's obviously not clear because a good chunk of the country doesn't agree with you.  It's obvious to you maybe, because you take it for granted.  They are bad guys and you're the good guy and that framework is never questioned.

3) Look up cognitive distortions. Don’t overgeneralize this mistake. 

4) Use the issue as an opportunity to improve operations. How can you setup processes so this doesn’t happen. Setup a discussion with management who has the authority to make changes and spend money. Explain the problem, work with them, show them why it’s happening and come up with solutions. Talk in terms of ROI.

The tutorial is several hours long and is boring as fuck.  If they had more seamlessly woven it into the story, it would have worked better.  But it really broke my immersion with how aware I was that I was playing through the tutorial.

And the story was not great.  Mostly because the sense of humor that makes the first game so good just wasn't there.  I had more fun running around, shooting other outlaws, hunting and just exploring then I did playing the story.  It's a beautiful game; the mechanics are fine, the graphics and locations are gorgeous.  but it lacks the charm that I enjoy about other Rockstar games.  

If other people enjoyed it, that's fine.  But it was, for me, a let down after all the hype.  Here's hoping GTA 6 doesn't get the same treatment.",1709251304.0

"MarriedAtFirstSight","t5_32lsa","Brennan was ready to have a discussion during dinner, but when Emily squints her eyes, it’s all going to shit in a hurry.  She clearly is negative in situations, he pointed out.  The show graciously showed highlights of it, but she was enraged at Brennan bringing this up…is the least negative person, blah, blah.  There was no civil conversation to be had and Emily inexplicably ends up hanging out on a public bathroom floor of which she is no stranger, but I digress.

Clare is another one who is never wrong.  Something early on ruined it for her and she was done.  She didn’t care if she was rude after that.  But she suddenly cares deeply for him and she is always available to comfort the other girls, although I think her hair, makeup and clothes are her main concern.

Becca sat there on Afterparty last week, continuously smirking with Clare as if she had taken the high road during her doomed marriage.  Nothing could be further from her truth.  She couldn’t have made herself any more unattractive if she tried during the marriage and cried that Austin wasn’t interested in having sex.

"fountainpens","t5_2s0ew",">The Sailor is a little lighter than my Jinhao. I would have liked it to be a bit weightier.

I have several Pro Gear Slims and Jinhao 82s. I was convinced the Pro Gear Slims were heavier, so I weighed several of both on my food scale, along with their converters. They weigh the same, at least within my scale's margin of error. The weight *distributions* are slightly different, because both pens sit differently when resting on a desk, but overall weight of comparable parts (caps, barrels, etc.) are the same. If you actually weighed them and the Sailor was lighter, I'm curious to know how much lighter it was.



>The plastic body is a let down. It's the same, if not lighter, plastic as my Jinhao. I knew it was plastic, but I figured it would be...better quality?

You listed the same con twice, unless I'm missing something here? My Jinhao 82s have...waviness, I guess you could call it...in the plastic that my Sailors don't. The Jinhao 82s with transparent finials (which I realize you may not have) are cloudy rather than fully transparent. The Jinhaos have more obvious seams, plus often have little burrs and things that weren't cleaned up on the seams. These little finishing touches do contribute to the cost of the pen.

Jinhao 82s are also easy to completely disassemble. This makes them lots of fun to frankenpen, but it also means that parts may come off when you don't want them to. Not always! Some parts are looser than others. I have a finial on one frankenpen that I had to use pliers to remove. But on another, which I used to penable a friend, the two pieces of the cap (upper part with clip and finial, and lower part with cap band) actually came apart when my friend tried to uncap the pen.



>I'm not gonna lie, they wrote pretty comparably. The Sailor is less scratchy, and holds ink better, but I was really expecting a drastic difference.

This con confuses me somewhat, because in the pros you said that your Jinhao hard starts sometimes. Wouldn't that already be a noticeable difference?



>Did the $235 Sailor pen really outclass my $3 AliExpress Jinaho pen?

This is subjective. You're paying for better finishing, a gold nib, better quality control, higher labor costs (probably?), and...tbh...the brand name. People are willing to pay for Sailors...but in a way, that also helped Jinhao, because it let them just replicate the styling of a pen that was already popular.



>Am I just an uncultured swine, or is it truly not as hype as people make it?

This is also subjective. If you don't like the Sailor, then you don't like the Sailor.",1709251305.0

My husband is close to his mom, they have a short convo at least several times a week and sometimes daily. The way men are raised effects the relationship they have with their family. The same goes for women. The way you raise your sons is how they will act and it's not looking good for any of you with the way you are talking. 

You need to go to that therapy soon. I'm highly concerned for both of your sons. I also am concerned for them if you ever had a girl that they may be neglected.

If she has more custody or even just a lower salary with equal custody, then child support payments from the man to the woman are right and fair. Just like if he has more custody or she has a higher salary, then child support payments from the woman to the man are right and fair.",1709251306.0

Ah okay, so if it's just the Seller's solicitors refusing the DOV at this stage that's pretty normal and not too worrying. It often takes a surveyor to independently provide a valuation for the premium, and if so the seller would have to pay that fee too. 


When acting for a seller I'd push not to have to deal with the DOV either as it's simply not in the sellers interest to do so. And to be honest 90% of the time the buyer will just accept the indemnity policy. Most buyers are so excited to get in the house they barely take the time to consider the issues. 


Perhaps speak to your conveyancer and ask them to report to your lender, check whether they'd take issue with the policy? If they insist on DOV then you've got a strong argument. ",1709251306.0

Jules is Monica. 

Laurie is Phoebe. 

Ellie is Rachel. 

Grayson is Ross (main love interest character). 

Andy is Chandler. (Which is flipped from friends).  

Bobby is Joey.

Travis doesn’t have a counterpart but he plays a Chandler like role. 

Tom is Gunther.",1709251307.0

And the day I happened to be just around the corner in the school offices when he told the vice principal ""I don't want to go to mom's house for winter break! SHE HITS ME!"" and hearing the reply ""Now (name) you know there's nothing I can do about that.""  


So proud of that kid's shiny spine, he had to save himself! Packed his school laptop in his backpack and took off for the walk to dad's house while mom was in the bathtub.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b",">The movie is very explicit that ""mormon extremists"" settled in the arachnid quarantine zone

It's also very explicit that they were ""disregarding Federation warnings"" in order to do so, and you yourself just referred to it as a ""quarantine zone"" i.e. a place where you are *not supposed* to go. The bugs are an invasive and expansive species, they talk explicitly about how they travel from planet to planet via asteroids. In both the book and the movie, the war between the Federation and the Bugs is presented as two expansionist entities coming into conflict with each other.

>Everyone talking about how the society is nice actually seem utterly nonplussed by the incredibly graphic dead and dying people everywhere, or how half the main cast is dead and Johnny is implied to be heading the exact same way as Rasczak.

The fact that it's gory has nothing to do with the morality. I mean you literally listed Saving Private Ryan as another example of a gory movie, does that mean the United States was morally wrong to fight the Nazis? Of course it's not pleasant to be torn apart by bugs, but if it's going to happen anyways, wouldn't you rather have a gun in your hand?

>The main thrust of the film is ""this society works, but the only thing it's good for is killing bugs. Would you really want to live here?"" Like that's what the ""do you want to know more?"" thing is all about.

It's ""good for killing bugs"" but guess what: the bugs are real and (as far as the average audience member can tell) they are an aggressive and encroaching threat. The fact that people in this society are battered and broken, and that they're resorting to using *kids* by the end of the movie, is a sign that the bugs are genuinely winning the war and represent a sincere threat to humanity.",1709251308.0

But I totally agree they'd be selling tickets by now for 2024. However, I don't think Imagine's future is totally dead. We might not get it this year, but Imagine is one of those festivals you go for, for the music. Unlike Bonnaroo or other big time festivals where there's much more to do other than see artists, Imagine, has always had stacked lineups, it's about the music. The lineup last year was fucking amazing but the turnout wasn't that great. Iris really needs to figure their shit out or risk being bought out by the likes of insomniac, as the rumors suggest.

"AskStatistics","t5_2sioa","A couple more thoughts:

- There must be some theory behind the form the weight/S-value relationship should sensibly take, in terms of allometric scaling and so forth.  I'd guess that for at least some of these source/target combinations, body composition/relative compartment sizes would matter in ways that could explain some nonlinearity at the high end of the weight range.  A 180 lb man might be effectively a scaled-up 120 lb man in terms of body composition, but a 300 lb man will necessarily be different because it's almost impossible to get that size without a very high fat percentage.  Do you have patient height data to compute a BMI?

- If you had a theory-driven model for how weight and S-value related, which implied some functional form about the shape of that relationship and had some parameters that could be fitted to the particular 100 data points for each source/target combo, you could then come up with a summary value for the goodness of fit for that theoretical model in each source/target situation.  Then you could see which source-target combos it applied better or worse to.  Are there certain sources and or targets that reliably have the model fit well or poorly?  Why might that be?  Then you could visually your conjectures about that by comparing that goodness-of-fit measure across different source/target groups.",1709251309.0

It actually gets better fuel economy by a few MPG and has a better turn radius.

It doesn't have the ""snap"" of a regular hotdog when you bite through the skin but it's definitely not mushy at all whatsoever. It also smells EXACTLY like one. I actually prefer this one over a regular hotdog just because it tastes nearly the same, isn't meat, won't make me feel greasy, and won't make me feel like shit for eating an animal. I got the classic smoked pack. 

Another surprising substitute that is more often than not better than the real thing is Gardein crab cakes. Always sold out, but whenever I can get them, they're spectacular. And I LOVE seafood. They nail the texture and flavor, it's nuts.

"foodhacks","t5_2u5q1","A thorough rinsing and using less water will help.  All the packages suggest a 2 parts water to 1 part rice ratio, but slightly less will give you a dryer, fluffier rice.   I use about 1 3/4 c. Water for 1 cup of rice and it usually turns out well.  Also let your rice stand, with the lid on (or off it’s slightly wetter than you’d like) for 10 min after you remove it from the heat.  This allows the starches to gel and give you a firmer, less mushy rice.",1709251311.0

If it's cheap and good, it won't be fast.    

I imagine the same could be said of creating a sword. It's going to take a certain amount of time, resources, and experience to achieve something of proper weight and balance to achieve a sword that would effectively accomplish the job it was historically designed to do.   

You cannot have all three, so you have to make a sacrifice.

It’s really not as bad as it sounds, tinking is literally unknitting your knitting. You carefully find the stitch you knitted into, slip your needle into it (them, if you did a K2tog) and take out your new yarn. So then you are back to where you were; the old stitch is back in the needle, the latest stitch undone. And you go like this very carefully until you are past your errors. 

There will undoubtedly be a few YouTube videos on tinking. 

Lace Land is a bit like being a trapeze artist, dancing around these big airy spaces amongst the stitches, throwing stitches together into tight pairings to create a shape, embrace the adrenaline of this, and going backward is eminently useful as a skill. We all muff up our pattern counts. It will make you great at reading your knitting. Sometimes it takes me ages to spot the misdemeanour that sends my count or repeat off. When you return to Stockinette Land  you will be invincible.",1709251312.0

Remember that the Callaghan government experimented with monetarist policies in the late 70's and Healey was Chancellor at that time.

There would be no nationalisation because Thatcher's privatizations didn't really kick off until 1984: BT, gas, water, etc. would all still be in public ownership if Thatcher lost in 83. Since Thatcher played a big role in popularizing privatization internationally, it's entirely possible that her loss has a broader effect on political economics outside of Britain. Privatization of state assets might be a rarer thing internationally in this tl without the Thatcher case study to popularize it.

"PSVR","t5_3102i","As Chronotaru mentioned, there is likely an issue with the triggers preventing other buttons from working correctly while in game. This is a semi-commonly reported issue with new devices, but the good news is it's very fixable. Here's some instructions for how to resolve it.

• Plug your problematic controller (probably the right controller but try both, separately) up to a computer with the included USB cable and go to [https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad](https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad) - it should detect your Sense controller and display button inputs on screen.

• Try pressing the trigger (R2 or L2).

• When not touching the trigger, the value for the trigger (shown as **Axis 2** on the site) is supposed to be -1.00000, and it should go to 1.00000 when fully pressed.

• If instead of -1.00000 or 1.00000 the value you're seeing for Axis 2 is something like -0.97234 (or any value in between), you know you have this issue.

• Try blowing air into the area of the trigger, either with your mouth or with a can of compressed air, and holding the trigger in and letting go so it flicks back out to the normal position. Keep trying this and see if the value changes, and keep going until you get the value to be -1.00000 (or 1.00000 when held down fully). You're trying to remove any debris blocking the trigger.

If you succeed, your controller should work correctly in all your games.

If it is this issue and you aren't able to resolve it, you may want to schedule a replacement to be sent out to you from Sony, or from the place where you bought it.

Hope this helps! Let us know if it fixes it for you.",1709251313.0

Bueno, el Karma, en pocas palabras son puntos que no tienen un valor en sí, pero entre uno más tenga, mayor ""caché"" tiene, demostrando cuánto has aportado a la comunidad. Hay cierto paralelismo con el karma como función metafísica.

En sí el karma se consigue ganando upvotes, el general un upvote es un karma, aunque puede llegar a ser raro cómo se suma y/o multiplica. Cuando un post tiene una buena repercusión es donde comienzan a llegar los upvotes y con ellos el Karma, para conseguir muchos upvotes necesitas una gran audiencia que guste tu contenido, es por eso que postear en lugares con muchos usuarios, en especial subreddit en inglés algo que les agrade, es bueno para atraer upvotes. También, cabe destacar, que en algunos subreddit (como este) se necesita un mínimo de karma para hacer posts o comentar.

Ojo, en muchos lugares por acá no está bien visto pedirlos o rogar por ellos. Tomando por ejemplo de otras redes sociales como YouTube o Facebook, que en sí no suman nada más que tu ego los likes y reacciones. Pedir o rogar por los mismos es causa de que recibas lo contrario: downvotes.

También, aunque sin gran peso en cuanto al Karma, son los Awards (ya removidos), que al darlos y recibirlos te suman cierto número de karma.",1709251314.0

4. Fewer software bugs

7. Ability to use without light seal
8. Ability to see keyboard in environments
9. More environments

This subsequent offering will be a transaction between BDs and NBH only and will generate funds that may or may not be paid to shareholders as a dividend.

"ZombieSurvivalTactics","t5_2ta4y","Thank you! It's fun to lean into these kinds of prompts instead of being a Debby Downer like some others on this post. 

I imagine that it would be an upside-down bell curve. 

At the beginning, guns are abound. Plenty of ammo, plenty of lead slingers. 

As the apocalypse progresses, ammo becomes scarce, and the number of guns even starts to outnumber the amount of ammunition. People scrounge for rarer and rarer caliber weapons as those are the only caliber of rounds that are still available. Gun smiths become invaluable, being the only people around able to recycle ammunition. 

But, because of the nomadic nature of the flotillas, it becomes impossible to create propellant and ammo molds. Allthewhile, people start practicing martial arts (Kendo, renaissance sword fighting, formation fighting, pikeman training, etc.) and start fashioning or salvaging spears and swords, slings and slingshots, and crude body armor. Guns become sacred and seldom-used, eventually rusting away to dust or being salvaged for their precious metal. Eventually, I would imagine that only Enforcer crews would have guns on account of their highly dangerous missions, especially when fighting bandits and rogue elements. 

Much later in this timeline, towards the final quarter of my 800 year projection, cities in liberated countries start recreating lost science: weapons, advanced fabrication, gunpowder, going from crude smooth bore flintlock to belt fed machine guns and carbon fiber weave over the span of that final quarter.",1709251315.0

Name: Kanon
Role: Sub dps, debuffer

Skill1: Released a powerful blade which debuffs the enemy attacks for one round (Can stack to 9)

Skill2: Based on the number of blades the enemy has been hit with, the attack increased and the stack reset (If it stacks up to 3, another enemy will be hit by it. This also means if someone has 9 stacks, 3 enemies will be hit at random with a single attack. 

Passive: If an ally falls, it will give permanent debuffs to the enemies (Unless Kanon dies)

Ultimate: Released a powerful attack on all of the enemies at once and gives a debuff to them for 2 rounds

More oxygen in Parent's bloodstream means more oxygen to the placenta, which in turn means more oxygen for Baby. Sometimes, that's enough to remedy the situation, and nothing else is needed. Sometimes, it's not enough to fix the problem, which means L&D nurses need to continue to watch Baby's health and move on to further action if necessary. If this occurs over an extended period or a certain frequency of times, they'll call us to attend the delivery and evaluate Baby once they arrive. 

Low oxygen during labor can have a huge impact on a child's health, capabilities, and the entire family (long-term health issues use a ton of physical, emotional, time, and financial resources).

 This is a community of support for Pet owners whose Pets have passed away. It is actively moderated.

 Pet owners, as loving, caring people, often have strong opinions on pet care practices. Some of these are controversial. This is not a forum 
 for debate on such issues, nor is it a place to scold a contributor for a perceived mistake in managing their pet. We intend to provide a safe 
 haven of understanding and support. Strident, mean-spirited posts or comments will be deleted. Those who persist in preaching versus caring may 
 be warned and then banned or may be banned permanently based on nature of the topic. If a conversational thread meanders into a discussion 
 unrelated to pet loss support, it will be truncated.

 Those who post here are vulnerable and hurting. Even a minor slap has a hard sting. Those of us who are lucky enough to be able to turn away 
 from our computers or put down our phones and hug a healthy, happy pet are truly blessed. Threads must remain supportive and caring, even if 
 one disagrees with something that has been said.

"Warzone","t5_2su6x","I understand what you’re saying and I can see some of the shots are missing just by scrolling the video slowly. My point is that’s an SMG and all guns have a certain amount of accuracy over a range, with SMG inaccuracy multiplying over distance. It’s the same reason why barrel stuffing someone with a sniper doesn’t always result in a hit even though the barrel is in the opponents chest on screen.

Years ago in OG MW2 and the older games to a certain point, the way the game registered shots was slightly different and if the sight was on the person it was a guaranteed hit depending on server latency compared to player position, really basically and I guess linear in the way hit registration was calculated. That’s why original quickscoping was so deadly, it was perfectly accurate at an instant where the server would read your aim point and calculate if the opponent was in that aim point at the point of firing, without fail.

With the introduction of warzone though they added a lot of mechanics to how hit registration works as to not make it so simple mechanics wise, like bullet velocity and weapon accuracy. On this game you can shoot sighted in at the same exact point and get multiple different outcomes and it’s not by much but it is definitely there, even in the firing range you can see it. Sometimes it will shoot a little right, left up or down. If you can come up with a similar build for this gun I would challenge you to set a standing still training dummy to 3 plates and record your accuracy holding down the right trigger, full auto and let me know what your best number is because I promise you wouldn’t be able to keep up with this.

My point is that the aim is perfect. Frame by frame, the aim is at a constant lead at chest level. No variance at all. Even on the friend who jumps at the beginning. The tracking is perfect and a normal human wouldn’t even take the time to track the jump if they weren’t planning to shoot, let alone actually be able to follow it considering how it happens almost randomly. I see no additional compensation movement in the killcam either, as in there’s no vertical recoil at all, and as the OP is running you can see microscopic rigid adjustments, some of which would be in opposite directions of your right stick to offset the immediate recoil and keep the dot sight at a constant aim point.

My third point is from a logical perspective. Over time the people that make aimbots know that people with 100% accuracy are easy to ban. Why would the aimbot want to hit 100% of its shots? If you ever look at the control panel of an aimbot, you can see options where you can control headshots (which most people turn off in favor of chest shots) as well as an approximation of accuracy as a percent value (0-100). Basic aim assist you get from the game feels like a 5 out of 100, with 100 being a literal laser beam which would miss less than 1% of shots (because remember, there are more variables involved in calculating a hit now). 

I just really don’t think this one could be legit, any way you look at it. Don’t get me wrong I’m all for discrediting this stuff because there are times people get lucky but this one is hard to say that it isn’t. Like no matter what recoil should be a factor here and there would be significant overcompensation for that which isn’t present.",1709251318.0

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","I think they have accepted that. Right now there are fast queue times (for the most part) and the ability to queue with friends of varying ranks (2 ranks apart, for the most part). To deal with the inability to perfectly balance every comp game, they use an algorithm in the ranking system that determines how many points you win/lose for a loss and show you whether or not you were favored to win.

I think they understand exactly how balanced and unbalanced the matches are and the fact that there are so many reversals shows that even in a system where we had to wait an hour to get a “perfectly” balanced match, steamrolls would still happen often.",1709251318.0

Like, Picasso was a raging misogynist, but he's also been dead for 50 years. You can't support him in real life even if you wanted to. Kanye West is still actively going around promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories and, if you buy his stuff, you're giving him money that he will use to do that more. If you buy his music then it doesn't matter if you *agree* with him, you're still demonstrably *supporting* him. When he shows up and talks about how Hitler did nothing wrong, you're one of the people who funded that.

It's a remarried empress done right. 

It has the same usual strength pulling the themes about a female surviving in a male dominant world from her coming from a neglect situation to becoming the best person she can be. 

The ""woman cannot do anything."" mentality is a portrait on the story it basically is to serve and put some pressure on the protagonist to actually strive. I do think her character is very consistent and not too girlboss or too passive considering the context she is in.

So, I recommended if you did like remarried empress but cannot touch the original because of all of those problems and a story with a capable, but still challenged protagonist. (and if you have a liking for protagonist revolitionazing their worlds, still not in that point, but seems like it's heading there.)",1709251319.0

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I lost a lot of weight for me (about 40% of my body weight at the time) and was really surprised by the fact that I all of a sudden had a major appetite change after I added a few new things to my diet, specifically more fruit and a LOT more fiber.  All of a sudden the constant hunger/craving was GONE.  Note:  I didn't reduce my intake, just changed the things I was eating.  Total calories were not that much different.

I read a study recently that looked at fecal transplants that basically showed if bacteria from overweight mice were given to normal mice, they became overweight, and vice versa.  Couple that with the fact that your gut bacteria produce a ton of neurotransmitter chemicals, it seems pretty likely that gut bacteria play a big role in eating behavior.

I think the fruit/fiber and cutting out white starches made a huge difference in my case.  I still eat sweet things when i want sometimes, still eat fatty things almost daily, kept the weight off.",1709251319

"zelda","t5_2r61g","This is an excellently worded response! I'll probably make another post regarding Skyward Sword, but I'll clarify a few things here that I think warrant being explained.

1) Demise's Curse

I'll be the first to admit, I didn't know about the japanese translation being so different. I couldn't find a translation when looking for it, but that is a fault on my end. That being said, what I said still works. Twilight Princess has a scrapped monologue from Ganondorf that is almost identical to Demise's curse monologue in the western localisation. To quote the relevant part in the Japanese translation:  *""Whenever those bearing the crests appear in this world An age of bloodshed will come, as often as need be. Do not think everything ends with this. Think of this as the beginning of a bloodsmeared history of light and darkness!""*

Even if you were to argue that because it's scrapped it isn't canon, I would argue that only proves it's not canon in regards to TP. The fact the Japanese translation is so similar to the western translation of the SS monologue tells me that it was intended for this curse to refer to Demise's hatred following Link and Zelda's descendants.

2) Ganon and Ganondorf

Aside from the HH stating that it is the same Ganon(dorf) every time except in FS, Miyamoto has gone on record to say that every Ganon(dorf) is the same (he apparently doesn't exclude FS, but that could just be he forgot in the moment). This is canon.

3) Hytopia Link

The developers have confirmed that TFH ""takes place several years after A Link Between Worlds and features the same hero""

4) Ganon in AoL

Even if Ganon is killed in LoZ and it's implied by the game over of AoL that his minions just revive him, it is still the same Link, and the game still takes place immediately after

5) Sages sealing Ganon

I'm going out of order here, But the reason the sages needed the hero to defeat Ganon is because the only way to seal him otherwise is to trap him within the sacred realm. I'll need to double check, but I'm fairly certain it isn't shown that the sages seal Ganon if Link dies at the end (correct me if I'm wrong), which does open up the possibility that different sages seal him, perhaps during the Imprisoning War (which is different to the one in TotK, allowing both to be true.

6) ""New Hyrule""

Yes, you're right it's never called ""New Hyrule"". Honestly I just call it that to differentiate. It is a different place to the one from WW, PH, and by extension OoT, even if the name is the same, as the whole point of PH is Link and Tetra's crew set out to find land big enough to rebuild Hyrule, and got interrupted by the events of the game.",1709251320.0

"theHunter","t5_2tx8d","FPS is far less important than bullet energy when talking hunting. At 1000 fps a 500 grain bullet delivers roughly 1100 lb/ft of energy. 

For comparison, when fired from a 1911 a 230 grain .45 acp bullet out of a 6 inch barrel only delivers 304 lb/ft of energy.  That much energy typically resuls in 11 to 27 inches of ballistic gel penetration. That was enough to win 2 world wars so triple that energy with a round that's over twice as heavy will be plenty of stopping power for a 200-250 lb animal.

Then his actions end up getting Shinji killed by someone else, causing all the other party members a lot of pain.!< 

You can totally understand where Amada's character comes from, but the fact is >!he got another way more popular character killed because of his edgy revenge mission!<, so there isn't enough redeeming him. What makes things worse is the version of him in most of the spinoff games - dancing, Q, Q2 - is this worst version who is >!planning to kill his friend!<.

Hair thinning, i see everyone mention it and you know that i feel like you weren’t even aware of it so, and thats heartbreaking because being a girl with thin hair myself, its heartbreaking to hear it each time. Ive had thin hair my whole life but I definitely had my hair thinning more during my burn out. Hormones unbalanced and adrenaline working overtime etc. And that is what I recognise! But apart from me you have beautiful clear skin!! 

So hair vitamins, if you also see a change in hair in the past 2 to 5 years. Otherwise still perhaps worth to try.

Mainly: bangs! I found this actually work great for me, just greasy hair I have to deal with because my hair is thin. Which a dry shampoo can fix, or a small fringe wash at the sink hehe

Further, how does a first half U.S. History teacher teach those if the 10 Commandments had no bearing on the ideas of the founding fathers (their study consisted of enlightenment and free market thinkers), and the national motto was “e pluribus unum” until Cold War panic began to push Christianity as a propaganda tool to push funding for Cold War colonialism? History teachers are going to be caught between a rock and a hard place.

Natürlich ist das meine sehr subjektive Meinung, aber ein lebenslanges Verbot an ein Geburtsjahr zu knüpfen und allen älteren Einwohnern weiterhin alles bisherigen Freiheiten zu gewähren, ist einfach nicht fair und wohl der Angst vor den langjährigen Stammwählern geschuldet. Entweder man hat die Eier und verbietet es für alle, oder nicht. Wenn nicht, gibt es auch noch viele andere Maßnahmen die man umsetzen kann um Rauchen unattraktiv zu machen.

"desabafos","t5_395lw","Muito provável que a falta de apetite seja pelo enjôo que mulheres grávidas têm tendência a ter nos três primeiros meses — o sistema olfativo fica bastante sensível, e isso reflete no paladar —, a fazendo criar repulsa por coisas que possuem odores. 

Outra possibilidade é um distúrbio alimentar causado pela ansiedade ou outros fatores atípicos, como a depressão. Quando se fica ansioso ou melancólico, há quem tenha o comportamento de estar em estado de dormência, indisposto de fazer algo pelo duro esforço ou pelo receio das consequências — mulheres quando grávidas possuem inseguranças das transformações de seu corpo e como os demais a enxergam.

Avalie como ela anda se portando para considerar as soluções mais palpáveis. Do que ela mais gosta de comer ou gostaria de comer mais vezes? Pode considerar pela noite, já que tem a demanda do trabalho, preparar marmitas para a semana com ingredientes mais leves — feijão e frituras são muito pesadas e de cheiro forte, evite usar —, com verduras,  vegetais e grãos fibrosos. Pode também deixar na geladeira frutas fatiadas e sobremesas para ela comer no dia seguinte e no café da manhã. 

Pode também lembrá-la colocando post-it ou recados na geladeira e em cima do celular dela, do que está na geladeira para comer e para lhe ligar ou enviar mensagem caso ela queira que você compre algo de diferente no caminhobde casa. 

Nesse momento inicial ela precisa de suporte emocional e de uma motivação para manter a disciplina e se preocupar com o filho, a fazer sempre se lembrar do quanto ela é amada e o quanto você deseja que o bebê nasça saudável deixará as coisas mais fáceis para vocês.",1709251323.0

"formula1","t5_2qimj","I think what it is looking at being is...

- He's been doing a naughty and having an affair to some degree.

- Something has happened in the growth of that relationship where he has been inappropriate OR looked to end it when she did not want to.

- She reported things internally be it because he was inappropriate or she was peeved he broke things off.

- Red Bull people deemed this a possible scandal and tried to burry it/drag it on

- At some point Horney tried to buy her off

- She said no to the buy off and has gone to 1 media outlet to get things where we are today. She has the receipts.

- With the death of the owner at Red Bull and various parties including Ford involved with various aspects of RB F1 there have been various power plays etc behind the scenes and some clearly latched on to all of this to try and get what they want.

I think this is still on going, I think there is still more to come and we only have half the story.

Clearly ""Horney"" has lied to some degree over this and I think his approach to it and Red Bull's has not been correct.  
You can say ""independent investigation"" all you want but it was internally done at the end of the day and it is NOT a court, they can say anything they want in the outcome to that.

Even if company wise they happy that an affair or flirting or inappropriate chatter with a member of staff is fine but many of us will not.

IF this continues to lead to be what is happening his marriage is in trouble, his integrity is ruined and Red Bulls rep is tarnished.  
More to come.  
I think you still may see Red Bull reverse and go into damage control and he will ""retire"" or something. His marriage will be on the ropes if not ending up in divorce.  
Red Bull will likely be out of favour with F1 and FIA and their internal power play struggles will cause harm before anything settles down.",1709251324.0

"NewTubers","t5_2ujnz","That’s not a bad result no. There are two things that matter:

1. The length of your video - YouTube does not care about the percentage of your video viewed, they care about the amount of actual time the user is spending watching your video. So, a 21% AVD is a completely different number depending on the length of your video. If your video is short, then 21% is pretty low. If it’s around 10 minutes, then that’s pretty average. 

2. The amount of views you get will affect your AVD massively. If you have 200 views, your AVD will most certainly be higher than if you have 1.6k views. The more impressions you get, the broader your audience, and the more likely you are to come across people who just aren’t that interested in your video. 

My AVD is around 33% for an 8 minute video. So you’re talking like anywhere between 2:30 to 3 minutes. That’s pretty normal, and the majority of viewers don’t watch the whole thing. Only youtubers with a faithful audience will have high AVD’s. The more of an audience you build, the better this will get.",1709251324.0

She charged Trump.  Engoron then took over and declared Trump guilty.   And then proceeded to the penalty phase.  Anytime you want to chime in with a jury's involvement, you go ahead.

Now what your post mainly overlooks is that 1) prosecutors can famously indict a ""ham sandwich"" so grand juries aren't proof of guilt, 2) forum shopping is a primary tactic of the get trump crowd, hence NY and DC trials, and 3) the political nature of the prosecutions is exposed by the fact that other people aren't charged for the same behavior (see the rant by Kevin O'Leary and note that numerous presidents and Veeps and Hillary have taken documents with no charges brough)",1709251325.0

Do you really think striking inside of Russia with American missiles is a good idea? What happens when you corner a dog? That’s great way to end the lives of billions not just millions.

The Russians DID want grave concessions at the start of the war. But now it looks like they’ll get what they wanted anyway, and in the process shook off sanctions and battle hardened their military forces. And is currently ramping up military production far past what the US or EU is with the caveat of not funding a whole separate genocide (USA.)

Meanwhile the average Ukrainian fighter is in their 40s. Which means you probably have 60 year olds somewhere on the front line. Their industrial base is gone, their people are gone, they are kidnapping to conscript.

I like cooking, architecture and interior design, sewing and fashion, reading and writing fiction--and I'm as straight as one can be. Now, this has been very fruitful for me throughout my life with *women*, but not with men.

Ah, but I don't want either men or women friends these days, it's just so much work, and there's always, *always* drama--shit I just don't care about at all anymore. I've had enough drama in my life, I don't want to talk about someone else's drama. I don't want to get another person in to rehab, I don't want to watch someone die from cancer, I don't want to listen about divorce, I've done it, and I'm done with it.

How so? I'm stating basic economics. If we as a society want a grab and go bagel available to us then we need to be willing to pay for the labor of the people who provide that service. 

If we don't want to pay a price that enables a living wage then we are not entitled to the fruits of that labor. 

Any other view is in my opinion pure entitlement on your part. 

>And I wouldn't consider it super laborious to grab a bagel from the display case and walk it two feet to the register for a sale...

Ok, then I suggest you go ahead and take the 2 days of time and the effort to make your bagels from scratch, hand form them, boil, and bake them.

There's never been any sort of evidence to suggest this.

Amos just doesn’t understand and he asks Alex if family is so important why aren’t you with your actual family on mars. 

Alex gets pissed, and shoves Amos, which of course is dumb as shit, Amos retaliates by practically bending Alex in half over the rail of the stairs. 

Alex pleads with him to stop, no one else is around, and he does. 

Amos next moments are him saying something to the effect of “don’t make me fight you Alex, because then who will fly the ship”, but his face is this mixture of confusion, anger, and he looks like he’s about to cry almost.

This post does not appear to have your age in the title so we removed it. The bad news, on Reddit **you can't edit the title of a post**  You must  **make a new post that includes your age** in the title.  

**All posts must include your age in the title** before we can post them on r/Selfies.**  Our rules are found here https://www.reddit.com/r/selfie/wiki/index/   Reddit's rules state read the rules before posting in our community.   

If you are over 18, and don't want to put that exact number, don't worry, ""Over 18"" is just fine, but you have to have some age in there before your post will go up on our wall.  The age must be in number form and not spelled out: *25 not Twenty-Five*  **Gender is not required to be in your title**

You may have seen a few posts on r/Selfie without an age in the title, let us explain.   When a user verifies with us, we set the Over or Under 18 flair for them and they never have to put their age in a title again.  This could be your life if you're interested. Just see our Wiki on Verification and you'll have spiffy new flair in no time!  https://www.reddit.com/r/selfie/wiki/verification.

There's also a lot of fear about AI and automation affecting our industry as well, especially at the entry level, so I'm not sure it'll be any more safe or stable than anything else.

"zen","t5_2qhmf",">blemish less 'screen

I found that idea helpful when first getting introduced to these ideas via Rupert. What's interesting is that it inherently creates duality (i.e. screen vs objects projected/reflected on the screen). 

>This screen is naturally 'empty' of all objective qualities

Wouldn't this apply to all things, not just the screen?

>So original mind is always there, but it is never directly experienced.

Are you sure? Hongzhi tells us, ""When you see into the source of reality, with no obstruction whatever, it is open and formless, like water in autumn, clear and bright, like the moon taking away the darkness of night.""

Just keep the plane loitering safely behind your frontline/aa network and you'll significantly deter bombers.

For example, the way the UI & website are designed - simple. The username system (with #s), it made it super clear to everyone that it was a Discord username (surely it hurts their brand recognition to get rid of this? seeing someone type a username with a #0000 after it would automatically make me think of Discord, it could be any old app now).

"aoe4","t5_2xiqj","Japan has a ton of safe food, from berries, which are gathered faster than most civs, to free farms, boosted by the TC.


Other civs have an issue when they finish their sheep, they have slow berries, a slow /expensive farm transition and or exposed hunts.


Getting stone from gold and vice versa means they have a higher net income through mining than most civs, it also means those Res last longer meaning delaying exposure.


Farmhouse saves wood, that other civs would spend on a mill.


Getting 1/3 wheel barrow significantly sooner is an eco utility bonus in itself. Aside for the eco, it means fewer Vil losses.


Having power units like samurai that numerous civs literally do not have a counter to, or a monster raider like onnas is a significant advantage in some cases.

"rpg_brasil","t5_felz6","Cada versão do sistema muda a maneira como algumas coisas são feitas, resolvidas e evoluídas, e não compatíveis entre si. É claro que nesses suplementos de RPG tem a parte descritiva e a parte mecânica, mas geralmente a parte descritiva está alinhada com o padrão mecânico da edição, então, é mais adequado consumir os suplementos da edição que você for jogar mesmo. Você não precisa mudar de sistema se não quiser, toda edição funciona e tem seus suplementos, mas a empresa uma hora deixa de produzir conteúdo de uma edição e começa a fazer só da mais recente. Quando lançaram D&D 5a edição, a 4a edição foi descontinuada. Isso não significa que as pessoas não possam jogar a 4a edição, mas o foco da empresa será na 5a.

É claro que tem elementos comuns entre as edições de um mesmo sistema, por exemplo, no D&D os atributos principais se mantêm, os dados utilizados, a maneira como se faz um teste é mais ou menos parecida (1d20 + bônus contra uma dificuldade), conceitos de classes etc. Mas outros elementos precisam ser reaprendidos, especialmente porque alguns outros testes são diferentes, a progressão do personagem também costuma mudar de edição para edição e outros detalhes. Você não consegue usar regras de uma edição na outra. E embora todas as edições de D&D sejam fantasia medieval, também é melhor você usar o suplemento de cenário da edição que você está usando no momento.",1709251331.0

Sure, some builds may be easier than others but that doesn't mean you cheated by using strong builds. If anything, after having played other Fromsoftware games first, DS1 doesn't offer much of a challenge anyways, so you may as well just ""cheese"" your way through it.

Hell, if you don't enjoy the challenge to begin with but want to experience the game, then cheese all the way. It's your game and it's you whose fun is the focus.

In the end, you used something the game had to offer to make it easier for yourself.

I also replaced my previous caruncles with a new version of my own (FN doesn’t provide caruncles).   
What I’m sharing here is:   
[Version A: Eyes & caruncles replaced with \*current\* lighting - 
Version B: Eyes & caruncles replaced with new SSS (scale increase from .1 to .35 as radius wasn’t making a difference)
Version C: Eyes & caruncles replaced with new SSS AND new lighting](https://ibb.co/album/HhWmsk?sort=date_asc)  
\*\*\*Please keep in mind these are 1K renders( as opposed to 2K in the initial post image). Also there’s some funky DOF stuff near the ears and hair, disregard for now\*\*\*

It also helps make the L a better feeder/distributor for individuals who need to get somewhere via Metra or Amtrak. For example, if we had an underground loop, someone who’s coming in from the suburbs to a Sox or Cubs game could get off their train at Union/Ogilvie, ride through the underground loop until Jackson or Washington, and then transfer to the Red Line at Jackson or Lake via underground tunnel, respectively, and then get on a Red Line train to 35th or Addison, all without having to step outside. 

To put it in perspective, Canal is 500 West, meaning that someone who wanted to get on the Red Line would be walking at least a half mile from their train station to State St to get on the subway. That’s a long distance to walk, and direct subway connections from the train stations to the L would significantly cut down on that distance.",1709251332.0

With the Cell saga literally ending by starting a new chapter. And the Freeza Saga literally ended at the start of the Cell saga. Like the chapter where they wished everyone back from the Freeza Saga was also the chapter Freeza showed back up on Earth. So it was clearly never intended as an ending. If you think it should’ve ended there, that’s perfectly fine. I just personally feel there were too many loose ends.",1709251333.0
"algeria","t5_2qihd","What do you mean I'm anti Algeria? I'm Algerian so just because I'm against the corrupt and incompetent Mafia that controls the country, means I'm anti Algeria?  This is why we are so underdeveloped and one of the poorest countries in the world. 

As far as Morocco, then yes it's because the stupid generals that run our country made Morocco our number one enemy. Western Sahara is none of our business and we should stay out of it but we chose to make it the biggest foreign issue for us just to be enemies with Morocco so the military can justify having one of the largest military budgets in the world. We spend about 5% of our GDP on military and that is one of the top 5 in the world! Meanwhile, there are Algerians literally starving  because they can't afford to eat and our youth die every year in the Mediterranean sea trying to cross to Europe and escape the hell that is Algeria. 

As far as the Sahel region then I hate to tell you that it was Chengriha and our stupid government who brough Wagner and the UAE to our borders. Wagner came through Algeria to Mali and I wouldn't be surprised if Mali attacked us in the coming months. 

I'm not against Algeria. I'm against people like you who worship this military junta that turned a paradise into hell that no one can live in it.",1709251333.0

My nguardians were *totally* like that, diabetes threats and all 🙄 every diet the nwife was on (or her kids) i had to be on or ""no one will ever love you"", ""youll get sick and die"", or she'd make pig snorting noises at me when i'd walk into the kitchen. The nhusband would regularly tell me i'd get diabetes and die young, when he has diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, heart disease, and was told he wouldn't live to get his next pacemaker. But *i* was the one not taking their health seriously and who definitely was gonna get diabetes. It was all projection for sure

The worst one was he has this whole story about how god supposedly cured my diabetes (that i never had) if he got sober, so he did cause he's *such* a good person. But every chance he got hed tell people how little self control i had and how fat and ugly and unlovable id always be, not to mention what a bad Christian i am to ignore god 🙄 guess who still drinks?

If you think that an appropriate punishment for sin is a headache then you and God have fundamentally very different ways of viewing sin. Were you God, you could make this the appropriate punishment. But you're not. Again, we're starting to talk about things the Bible is silent on.

I think I did a pretty good job explaining a potential logic for why an infinite debt can be paid in a finite moment by a being like Jesus (as he is himself infinite); whereas the same debt would be experienced as eternal duration for finite beings such as ourselves.

Perhaps more importantly, I likewise mentioned how the Bible doesn't actually give us these specifics, so we could have this discussion, and you could ""lose"" it, and we'd still not be any closer to a definite answer.",1709251334.0

Bax is ""stronger"" than Weavile in a literal sense due to higher Atk sure, but so is Glastrier, so it's clearly not (just) raw power that's required to get banned as an Ice. Bax got banned for bulky setup sets, a role that Weavile cannot perform at all, so comparing them in that regard is weird.

And, this is a concept that's sometimes hard to understand for newer players (including the person you're referring to with that statement--they're a bit of a meme on the sub for their shallow takes that they keep repeating) but a banned Pokémon is not necessarily the best Pokémon in the format. Note how Dracovish was like an A- mon on the VR when it got banned and some people argued that was still too high. Weavile is a great mon because even when you prep for it it consistently puts in work, and it fits on a lot of teams, but it has numerous exploitable flaws that give every teamstyle outs to it. Things like Kyurem and (at least before Alolatales dropped) Bax are ""worse"" in this regard because there are teams that they do very little into, or they need a lot more support to work, but can still be more banworthy if they either just demolish entire team archetypes or can win games off set versatility even if each individual set is worse than what Weavile is capable of pulling off.",1709251334.0

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","""Playing hand games"" written unironically was a tipoff.

Dnd is sweet, but I wouldn't force it with relatively limited social access at that age.

They were dicks. They were rude again to diminish your feelings telling you to drop it...but also you gotta either drop it or bail on them as homies.

Some friends at 17/18 are friends for life, but the vast majority are transitional. Them saying drop it and not acknowledging their rudeness is lame, but it's also them saying ""dnd isnt that important to us"".

 If you like them as friends, either DM knowing it's for you, not them, with low expectations, or do something else with them since DMing is a lotta work.

If you are so-so on them and the main motivation to interact was to play dnd...well they just told you dnd isn't important to them, so i wouldnt recommend pursuing a well-developed campaign with them.

Also, this isn't at all to blame you; you sound nice, but consider if they maybe gave signs that this theme was not for them. Did they feel forced into playing a weird theme? Did they feel like the narrative was forced? I'm not asking if the theme or narrative really were. Im suggesting that may have been their perception.

"PERSoNA","t5_2rg0t","Persona 2 Eternal Punishment had a PSP scenario that released the same year as Persona 4 Golden that outright denies the idea that the Izanami we see in P4 is actually divinity. Instead, she's a collective existence given enough cognitive consideration to become an entity, like all gods and demons are(P3 Nyx is a can of worms of its own that defines Ryoji as divinity as far as human comprehension goes). Both Aigis and Teddie work under similar concepts along those lines, as they perceive their individuality, they begin to manifest human traits. Aigis in The Answer's ending is a baffling existence to the party because one of her core faculties to function is fried, yet she's still there. Cognitive concepts have been tied to the Persona series since the very beginning, that only P5 gave an actual name to, but still. Teddie wished to be human to experience life with his friends, he grew a body, Marie wanted to be herself and so she did, inheriting the cognitive benefits that became very real around Inaba, her seat of power. Morgana didn't want to leave his found family behind and so he didn't. And Ryoji wanted to be a real friend to the protagonist and thanks to being touched by his humanity, had been capable of growing his own identity. Morgana is likely a cat because of his ties to being a manifestation of humanity's hopes, but if he were to relinquish or have those taken away, he should be capable of existing as an independent entity, like Marie technically would have been had Izanami not wanted all her power back. And truthfully, we were able to see reverse Personas summoned in Persona 2 by shadows, so seeing a shadow gain a persona all of its own is not surprising, nor is any of the other incidents here. I know the OP mentioned specifically 3/4/5 but 2 EP did rerelease after 3/4 and the extra content was written to flow with other already established lore, which is why I cite it here.",1709251335.0

"Dimension20","t5_pgc6w","That's a much better comparison, and really makes me like the fact that Kristen is running for office even more. 

I was mostly filtering it through Kristen having come from a cult of Helio, and her interactions with Sol in season 2. I agree it is imperfect, but I do think Cult Leaders still have an unfortunate power to make people *think* they are being helped, and often use ploys to manipulate them into believing they need them. In a world where Divine power does not require worship I think they are still close to cult like figures.   


From what I understood, Helio worship isn't monotheistic, but the culture of it in Spyre don't respect/worship the power of other gods, and so seek to undermined the power of other gods to empower Helio. With that charge led by the Harvestmen behind the scenes.   
Less that they are monotheistic, and more they seek to try and change the world into monotheism by making Helio the One True God. Kristen's family weren't quite Harvestmen, but has fallen into the trappings of the Harvestmen's requirement, and had begun closing themselves off from other ""sinful"" gods and cultures.",1709251335.0

"The10thDentist","t5_233710","I kinda mostly agree. Last semester I had a Korean comp sci professor. It was my first semester and he didn't speak great English and I wouldn't understand something's he says but I ended up with a very high grade because he would have us work on stuff in class and worked with us directly and individually. This definitely helped to the point where his English wasn't a huge problem. This semester I've a Indian professor. Same problem but without the solution. There are often times I can't understand what she says, the instructions can be unclear in her assignments due to grammar issues, and I will sometimes Google stuff in class instead of paying attention. Poor English def doesn't help but I think it's up to the professor's teaching style in the end




As a sidenote. Here in BC Canada, my brother went to Surrey (a municipality within Vancouver. I think that's how it works anyways) for a pharmacy tech course. One of his professor's taught from India via webcam. He told me how he stopped coming to the lectures cause he couldn't understand anything.

Once my appearance started becoming ambiguous, I just didn't want things to be weird (around men OR women), so I stopped using gendered spaces. I either used the family changing room, or the handicapped (single occupancy) bathroom stall, or if the place didn't have either of those, I didn't attend that place. Alternatively, for some sports events, I would throw on a hoodie, and go home straight after exercise and change there.

After I started to become pretty passable, I started attending women's changing rooms.

I was pretty terrified of showing my body pre-SRS (like at the pool) while presenting feminine. I genuinely feared some sort of violent repercussions in case my tuck wasn't perfect. So there was a gap of a few years where I stopped going to the pool altogether.",1709251335.0

So they do differentiate themselves, but ONLY through things that have relatively close appeal to voters.

If a candidate loses by a wide margin, their party goes back to the drawing board. What exactly was it that made them unappealing? This might result in them fielding a different candidate. It may result in a change of priorities by the candidate. So they either double down on their differences with their opponent, or they get closer to their opponents stance.

I personally think it's a thing that happens to people with ""mind problems"" (the term mental health illness makes some people uncomfortable). I know this problem because i've had it incessantly. What it is is that you get so enveloped in your problems (specifically depression) that you either gradually and/or suddenly drift out of touch from all of your loved ones or associates because you either don't notice that it's been so long since you spoke to them, you can't think of the right words to reinitiate the relationship after a long time has passed, and/or something about your situation makes you feel like you literally can't speak to them untill later ( like for example your embarassed by not making as much progress in your life as you might have wanted and if you talk to them again you might have to admit that to them so you can't talk to them until you've made the progress at which point you might also act like you made it a long time ago). The problem with this is that it might cause you to think that you can't talk to them at all because it's been too long now so now they might not care to talk with you and if you found that to be true it would kill you inside so you have even more trouble mustering up the right circumstances to talk to them or worse you might just decide that you're better off moving on from each other rather than face the potential pain/guilt of their apathy or even contempt from you having taken so long to get back to them. That could be what it is. So you might not want to continue the poems for too long and instead maybe just resume them when the relationship resumes and tell her that in the following message to her. But other than that hold on to the memory of her forever. That doesn't necessarily mean to hold on to the notion that she'll come back to you at some capacity, but it should mean that you'd be fully willing to accept her back into your life if she did, as if no time had passed at all if possible. You can tell her that in one of your messages to her as well. If you want to say any more feel free to do so, and if you want me to say any more then feel free to ask.",1709251337.0

That still has nothing to do with the movie itself though.

That comic (and the the the ROTF comic adaptation itself) are based on an earlier draft of the script where The Fallen was trapped in a sarcophagus rather than just hanging out on a spaceship in exile, and are part of a separate continuity from the actual film. They've even been given separate Universal Stream designations - the IDW movie comics take place in Universal Stream[ Tyran 207.28 Gamma](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Tyran_207.28_Gamma), while the movies themselves take place in [Tyran 707.04 Delta](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Tyran_707.04_Delta).

But even if they didn't go to the trouble of splitting the movies and the comics off into different universes, it still wouldn't matter because the movies are the movies and the comics are the comics. They're made by different creative teams telling different stories. Yes, the comics are *based* on the movies, but that's a one way street - information from the comics doesn't filter back into the movies.

I'm going to use non-Transformers example so maybe you can get where I'm coming from.

The original Marvel comics adaptation of Star Wars included a deleted scene where Jabba the Hutt confronted Han in the Millennium Falcon's docking bay. Nowadays we know Jabba the Hutt is a big slug creature, but back then the scene was filmed with a human actor in a furry coat, and George Lucas had wanted to replace the actor with some sort of alien creature in post-production.

But because no design for an alien Jabba existed at the time, Marvel just used a random background alien from the cantina scene:

https://preview.redd.it/mj0wbcta4mlc1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=95056c0c3900ffcf3c2994e24d297820a2ab3303

  
Jabba didn't just happen to turn into a different type of alien for a day, and everyone just kind of accepts that the movie and the comic are telling different versions of the same story.  


The same is true for Transformers. The comics are telling one story, the movies are telling another.

In the comics, The Fallen and the Primes visited Earth much later on in the timeline. In the movie, they visited in 17,000 BC and the Solar Harvester just sat uncovered until humanity had advanced far enough to build a pyramid over it.

This is fine - it's okay to take the movies at their word and think about the implications left by the gaps rather than to try to fill them with material that may not be appropriate.",1709251337.0

"Denver","t5_2qn3i","my wife and I (32) seriously considered moving there from the Denver area a few years ago for a job opportunity for her (and I work remote).  Ultimately contract negotiations on the job opportunity didn't work out but I think we would have been happy there.  We're very into the outdoors (though montrose is still \~1.5 h from Telluride for skiing), planning to start a family soon, and not super social, so fewer bars/restaurants/shows etc wasn't a huge factor for us.  I don't think I would have considered moving there if I was single (pretty introverted), but if you're outgoing and put in the effort you will meet people.  My sense is there are probably more yopros there now than 5 years ago with the remote work shift, but it seems to still be mainly farming and a retirement area.  A notable plus is there were like 7 flights a day to Denver, so still relatively easy to travel.  As far as the politics end of things that others have mentioned, yeah it's definitely a conservative area but I wouldn't make that a reason not to move there, there are plenty of people everywhere whose lives don't revolve around politics.  I'd highly recommend spending a weekend there to get a feel for things.",1709251338.0

"Pathfinder2e","t5_gkc60","RAW this may or may not work. 

From Grand Bazaar page 88 ""Accessory runes are runes that provide enhancements or abilities to **mundane clothing, items, shields, and vehicles**. Accessory runes must be physically applied to  items through a special process to convey their effects, like all runes. You can apply an accessory rune to any mundane item that meets the criteria in the accessory rune’s Usage entry. If allowed by the Usage entry, you can even apply an accessory rune to a magic item that doesn’t have the invested trait, such as a shield. When you inscribe an item with an accessory rune, it gains the invested trait, requiring you to invest the item to gain its magical benefits. An item that already has the invested trait can never have an accessory rune inscribed on it.""

It depends on if they include weapons inside of items but the fact they split clothing and shield out from items makes me think the lack of weapons and armor is on purpose especially since later on it states ""Many armor runes can also be applied to explorer’s clothing, and these runes have accessory rune counterparts that can be applied to a coat, cloak, jacket, shirt or similar clothing. The following accessory runes function just as they would if they were etched onto armor: energy-resistant, ethereal, shadow, slick, and stanching (page 39)."" Deliberately stating that there are accessory rune version of armor runes for clothing that isn't armor makes me think leaving out weapons and armor is on purpose.

Would it be broken or op to allow Called to be on a weapon? Absolutely not. But RAW its a maybe and RAI feels like its a no.",1709251338.0

"Disneyland","t5_2s0df","The *easiest* thing for both you and them would be to send them a Disney gift card - like enough for a treat, snack, toy, etc.

I have never done this, but I think theoretically you could mobile order something for them (you don’t have to be in the park to mobile order) but they’d have to pick it up within a certain amount of time, and you’d probably wanna send them the screen shot of your mobile order number/screen once it said it was ready for pickup. But if you knew they were near (example) the Candy Palace, you could mobile order them a candy apple or something. Again though a few factors would have to come together in order for you to do this, including having the app, ordering, saying you’re there, sending them a screenshot of the mobile order, making sure they pick it up within a certain amount of time, etc. Also if they’re unfamiliar with the mobile ordering process in Disneyland or where certain shops are, it could be stressful lol.

"e39","t5_2rmbq","528i is definitely doable. People put the 2.8L M52's in E30's and turbo the hell out of them in Europe. The issue is if you aren't going to replace the rods they'll bend in a few months at 450hp ish. Pistons could likely handle more but if you're replacing the rods just get new pistons as well and you'll be good for any amount of power you want on the stock crank (just don't go above 7500RPM). I've even seen a guy cram a turbo setup in the 540i for a drift car. 

The issue is packaging. If you don't know a competent fabricator/engineer or aren't one yourself then I wouldn't attempt it. Even though it's done a lot in Europe, it is always done with custom fab parts. 

You can always remap the stock Siemens ECU as well if you know how to do it. You can also get access to the knock sensor data and other things if you have the ECU serial number written down. If you don't have an interior OBD2 port already, you can wire one in fairly easily and use that to log the ECU data live as well. Combine that with reground M54 cams, an M50 intake, and equal length headers you'll make >250hp N/A for really not that much money.",1709251339.0
"actualgyaru","t5_4t2858","You are right. A lot of the gaijin community is stuck in the past and dead set on not allowing any change. Most don't even consider reiwa gals as actually gyaru and constantly slander them. But then again, there are small groups of gals that do want some change and progression and want to follow the Japanese gyaru trends. It's just older gen gals clashing with new gen, a common issue in every subculture. 

As for why the community as a whole seems disconnected, I've noticed a bit of a problem. This is just my experience and what I've seen, but there is A LOT of gatekeeping coming from vets and old school gals. Not just in regards to the clothes or makeup, but online spaces. There are active spaces out there, but they are private, invite only, and not for baby gals. I don't know how much of it is intentional, but that's why a lot of us feel like there's a divide. Because there is. Again, that's just what I've personally witnessed. Some may have different experiences and opinions.",1709251339.0

"DragonsDogma","t5_2smmb","Oh, they're definitively trying to talk to new players. It doesn't mean they're great at it, but they're trying. They're definitively doing a better job than for DD, since at least this time you heard about it, but as you point out, maybe it's still not the right approach.

I read your other post, and what you complain about, only showing a few spells and looking like a generic fantasy game, is exactly what makes me think it's targeted toward new players. They don't want to show you all the late-game weirdness that we know was in DD, and hope will be in DD2, because they don't want to spoil it too much for new players. They're not trying to one-up Dark Arisen, they're showing you instead normal daytime adventuring.

I think they *want* you to think it's a generic fantasy game. In a sense, they're doing the opposite of movie trailers showing too much, but maybe they went way too far in the opposite direction.",1709251339.0

But what does his daughter's marriage have to do with his relationship(s) prior to his marriage to her mother? He clearly put himself in John's shoes, rather than the reality that he is merely the F-I-L. 

In my view, all he has done is cause avoidable heartache for John and further destroyed his own family, all to finally lay to rest his resentment about being cheated on. I hope his nobility keeps him warm at night.. Smh",1709251340.0

He allied with the Soviet Union and allowed it to control the economy because Xinjiang had constant rebellions and civil unrest from the native Uyghurs, and the Soviets helped crush those rebellions.

The FMC describes everything in painful detail such as…

**what she sees**

>!There was hair stuff, jewelry and makeup, bath soap, scented powders, perfume and lotions. This entire small (ish) trunk I also carted into the bathroom-type place. There was another trunk filled with leather-bound books, some printed, some blank (journals?), elegant ice-blue writing paper and envelopes, a wax candle and an elaborate, silver seal to use to close the wax on the envelopes (awesome!), a slim, silver quill pen and a couple bottles of ink. I stocked the desk with these.!<

**what she’s wearing**

>!An ice-blue velvet gown that had this kick-freaking-ass sheen at the tip of the pile that looked iridescent white, like the shimmer on top of new snow.!<

**her thoughts**

>!The whole room was freaking *amazing*. Way cool. Unbelievably cool. I’d seen a lot in my life, and I had the money to go for the gusto, but I’d never seen anything *this* amazing.!<

**And then there’s the riveting dialogue!**

>!What?” I breathed this time, knowing my eyes had grown wide. He jerked his chin. “You were drunk and may not remember our discussion, but I bloody well do.” Oh God. Oh shit. Oh God.!<

>!Oh shit! Oh God! Oh shit! “Uh—” I started, not having that first clue what to say.!<

>!OhshitohGodohshit. “Uh—” I mumbled.!<

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","This is such a tricky problem.

On one hand, free speech should be protected.

On the other hand, the internet has given opportunities for the most vile parts of humanity to fester and proliferate.  

I have two close friends, both excellent parents who I look up to and seek for advice.  Each has had a kid accidentally exposed to porn.  One kid found an old iPhone and charged it without the parents knowing for months.  He was seven years old.  The other had a friend show her during a sleepover.  She was 9 at the time.  Both kids were traumatized and needed a lot of emotional support to overcome the violence they witnessed.  

What happens to kids when parents aren’t actively involved? Who turn a blind eye or are just too overwhelmed to worry about one more problem.  

I don’t know what needs to be done.  But we have to start having these conversations.  Change has got to start somewhere, even if we don’t get it perfect the first try.  ",1709251340.0

"oneohtrixpointnever","t5_33zua","I see on Daniel’s instagram stories he’ll share pictures of Ableton grids with MIDI data and automation. I assume that people are referencing using several hardware synths, FX units, etc. etc. but they are all being controlled by the computer vs. playing individual instruments and recording them that way. Who knows, I may be way off. I remember watching some interview from like 10 yrs ago where he explains everything is connected together then reaches the computer (see also pictures from Ford and Lopatin and Games). I know in this interview he specifically talks about eccojams, his early life, and the Juno he uses (if you need reference points to find the interview). I think OPN’s music is very dynamic, “wavy” or “swooping” and almost natural sounding, something that can be hard to achieve using MIDI grids (in my limited experience but YMMV). I think another part of it is, especially younger people, MIDI is kind of your first foray into home production so there is an element of closeness to it, that these wide, verbose, natural sounding tracks come from controlled computers.

"entjwoman","t5_3hvltb","I mean, I was one of the ones *born into religion!* 😅 My dad was an INFJ, a city employee, an aspiring pastor, and an alcoholic (who is very dead.) I was even a JBQ kid, for a couple of years. 

So yeah, my personal experiences with religion have been pretty damned traumatic! I see religion as one of the main things that *stole* my father away from me (in the interest of making things sound more exciting and melodramatic,) because he relied on religion, rather than confronting his trauma and his problems, directly, and getting a real psychiatrist! He was smart AF, too! I am actually an ENTP, btw. (I like talking to other T-Type women, and we are kinda like “cousins,) So you know my dad and I were actually pretty close! 

His family enabled his religious delusions and pretended like his alcoholism “wasn’t even that bad.” Then one night, “we got the call.” 

So yeah, *I really hate religion!* (I am cool with healthier, more open-ended and informal forms of spirituality, though.) Thusly, it was not a good fit for me, personally, *because* I did see *way too much of the “judging,”* “being prudish,” and etc……… 

Hell, my own mother is still a Christian, through it all, and we actually have *zero conflict,* cuz she’s an ESFP and she has become a much healthier person, over the years. She kinda sucked and we were a bad fit, when I was younger. But now that I am older, and so is she, we get along much better. 

Nice!!! (On the Milky Donations!) 😁 

While I have never been a stripper (I do pole fitness for fun, sometimes though, and *I suck!* I am better at Aerial Lyra and Aerial sling / hammock,) I was a breastraunt girl, for a bit, when that was still a *bigger thing!* Easiest money I’ve ever made! 

But idk if “banning it” is the answer. The more you tell people “you can’t do this” the more they are going to want to. So I really think better, more comprehensive Sex Education and improved communication is the way to go! 

When our bodies are “criminalized” it becomes *very easy to become “a product.”* 

I have more interesting thoughts, but Lyra Class Time! 😁 

In a nutshell, I think moderate / center right or center left is the most reasonable way to go. My INTJ husband is a left-leaning moderate, while I am more “left libertarian,” rather than true “Marxist.”",1709251342.0

Essentially once something becomes proved and disproved for the most part the study of that phenomenon stops aside from perhaps a handful of people who study that particular phenomenon 

When someone is making a claim that's outlandish it doesn't necessarily need to be disproven because if we can't observe the claim by any means (including mathematically) then whatever claim said isn't something impending that needs to even be focused on by people trying to solve problems 

In short basically having the oneness of ""things seem to be this way, but they could also be this way instead"" allows for a wider range of data to be taken in mentally and then analyzed after",1709251343.0

Also, another trick, is to clean your windows with a little glycerin mixed in water.  The other poster is right that clean windows fog less.  The small amount of glycerin raises the surface energy (chemistry term), making it harder for water to condense on it.

He may have been a crooked DEA agent and had some back deals.

I think most cartels are usually hands off policies with American federal agents now I could be wrong.

"nightingale","t5_2rncy","I get the direction you're going, but this also requires a lot of other things in the game to be fixed first. Right now it's very trivial (just takes a bit of time) to 1- or 2-hit the bosses. So first person to the boss gets damage dealt reward and then everyone else is SoL. And this isn't just the boss - shockwave and such can insta a whole wave of mobs. Even if you write this off as a balance issue and the devs patch weapon dmg to normalize, people can still start the boss immediately before everyone is there. If you lock the boss until everyone is present, then what if someone actually is AFK? Noone can complete the vault. So now you have to have voting mechanisms, or allow some majority to trigger the boss, or other systems. As you said, difficult to implement because you quickly go down a rabbit hole of new systems to build or patch.  


Then factor in the different event types - if I don't interact with something (the rune or music puzzles), it doesn't mean I'm not actively participating. It just means someone found the rune before I did. There are often less runes in the rune rooms than there are players in the party.  


I like competition, but I don't think this is the place for it. I think maybe something like global leaderboards with daily/weekly rewards (which maybe require you to go to the watch to receive the rewards, which helps keep people logging into the multiplayer area) might be more appropriate, and maybe more straightforward to implement. The leaderboard focus could vary week to week (damage this week, healing next), even.",1709251344.0

Just doing that gets me 9000 steps.  Some days I’ll do home gym exercise for 45 minutes either before work or after kids go to sleep and that pushes me up to 11,000.

There are also a variety of great 3rd party options for headstraps. It is important to note that there are two main types of headstraps for the quests. Elite strap style (the one that Meta makes) and Halo style. Both have pros and cons and preference is usually down to the individuals use case for VR. The 3rd party straps are often better value than what Meta provides. If you want to look into some options, I’d recommend the likes of BoBo, Kiwi, and Anker.

If you have children you are obligated to support them, but beyond that you don't need to have any contact. If you are married, while you can ignore a divorce process initiated by your spouse, it might cause the court to order something you don't like and you will have to comply with any support or division of assets judgement.

We are officers first; before we are ship drivers or pilots or information professionals.

"ClinicalPsychology","t5_2sl1j","I felt like that when I was applying for an internship. And I got into the field without even wanting to be a therapist. I wanted to do research. I felt like the match system was a scam (expensive to apply for, one-year training that might have been necessary in the 80s and 90s when they weren't getting as much grad therapy training, have to relocate for a year with no moving expense provided, and internship paid so little compared to the cost of living increase everywhere). I got paid less on internship than during grad school in a more expensive area with no social support (did a long distance relationship). Due to the financial difficulty and reality of internship, I was completely depressed the whole year in internship. 

I'm graduated, still in academia, and happy currently. I am also seeing a lot of folks go into private practice and make a lot of money with work-life balance if thats what they want. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. I now appreciate my degree in that I see a lot of career options in the future. If I want, I can always pivot to a lot of different roles in industry or to private practice. I get your frustrations though. We really should be telling those who get rec letters from us to go to grad school about the reality. And as we move forward, I hope people in our field work to make this a more equitable field without all these expensive gatekeeping cus we really need to.",1709251345.0

I I also suggest that you check the humidity and dew point levels where you live.

And I agree with all your points. New tools have always created new demand, artists who adopt technology work faster than those who don't, the talent pool will favor quality.

But something that deserves more focus in all these AI discussions is the final end game. I.e, the current concepts of money and capitalism.

People get giddy or upset that AI is automating away ""creative jobs"" and nothing else. But, if we have technology that can already simulate the human brain and all its intricacies, what is stopping me from having my own AI CEO? Why wouldn't Bob Iger, Sam Altman, Joe Biden all face the same threat of replacement when robotics will  one day surpass the smartest man on Earth?

To me, that's why all these AI doom and gloom feel like distractions. We're dealing with technology that rivals God and can change entire market forces overnight. And that effects everyone.",1709251346.0

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","> but calories out takes time. 

How many calories do you burn running for an hour? You'd think we'd have a decent idea of this, based on some general factors, right? 

I have NEVER found an actual scientific source on it that really measures it based on certain criteria. We have a decent guess that it's between 500 and 1500 calories or so, probably. 

There's also a bunch of other complicating factors. Hydration, and carb consumption, for one. If you eat more carbs, your body needs water to bind these. So when someone first gets rid of carbs from their diet, they lose 5 lbs in a few days. THIS IS AMAZING!!!! ...except it's completely meaningless, and they'll gain those 5lbs back in a few days if they start eating carbs again. 

In the summer, I'll sometimes weigh myself to check water intake. I work outdoors, so I try to drink 6-8l of water per day. If I weigh myself and I'm 2lbs down, I chug a liter of water. 

In other words, weighing yourself to figure out fat gain is kinda useless.",1709251346.0

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","Meta will always always always exist. For every ""problem"" there will be a single, (or set of a few) most optimal solutions. Pretending like meta doesn't exist is just burying your head in the sand. 


Build crafting and choice is fun, but the choices you make are to achieve some sort of (more) optimal solution(outside of self imposed challenge modes), or else you might as well just hit a randomizer and call it a day. 


As far as contention between the player and the environment, it's regularly so easy that you don't need to be ""meta"", but again because it's so so easy, the game is optimization, not doing the activity itself.


For PvP, a well balanced game will have different options that are more suitable in certain environments, or in the hands of certain players, so there is some flexibility in the meta. (This can be seen as not every top level FG player plays the same character), but again if you aren't trying to find what's optimal (for you), you aren't even trying to win or engage with it, so why are you even partaking in it, short of seeing shiny pixels.

"privacy","t5_2qhlc","Now, HP has been a terrible company for a while and that is not a secret to anyone here, but this is almost comically evil: 

> Prices range from $6.99 per month for a plan that includes an HP Envy printer (the current model is the 6020e) and 20 printed pages. The priciest plan includes an HP OfficeJet Pro rental and 700 printed pages for $35.99 per month.


Not only are the prices outrageous, but they will spy on your network and sell the data: 

> HP says it enforces a constant connection so that the company can monitor things that make sense for the subscription, like ink cartridge statuses, page count, and ""to prevent unauthorized use of Your account."" However, HP will also remotely monitor the type of documents (for example, a PDF or JPEG) printed, the devices and software used to initiate the print job, ""peripheral devices,"" and any other ""metrics"" that HP thinks are related to the subscription and decides to add to its remote monitoring.

>The All-In-Plan privacy policy also says that HP may “transfer information about you to advertising partners” so that they can ""recognize your devices,"" perform targeted advertising, and, potentially, ""combine information about you with information from other companies in data sharing cooperatives"" that HP participates in. The policy says that users can opt out of sharing personal data.

But that's not all, if you want to cancel their ""service"", you must pay:

> Last month, HP CEO Enrique Lores declared that HP's ""long-term objective is to make printing a subscription."" The All-In-Plan is HP's latest attempt at that goal, hoping people believe that the subscription service will simplify things for themselves. And by including high cancellation fees, HP is looking to lock subscribers in for two years.

>HP will charge subscribers who cancel their subscription before its end date up to $270 plus taxes (the amount decreases to as little as $60, depending on the printer rented and the length of the subscription). 

I cannot stress enough how much that experiment needs to fail, badly. Great conclusion of the article by Scharon:
> HP is hoping to convince people that the answer to torturous printer experiences is to ""never own a printer again."" But considering the above frustrations, some might just never own an HP printer again.",1709251346.0

I'm not much of a chart wizard myself but there have historically been some pretty 'not chill' March and April times (and one particularly Wild Wednesday). I guess what I'm saying here is, let the man have his PTSD. Any single month can and has turned a bull run like this into big red dildos and caught many a bull with their pants down. kdD might be a broken shell of a man but he's ours and I love him.

Socialism is institutionalized aggression towards private property rights. 

Communism is complete abolishment of private property rights.   


You can't blame Capitalism on the corruption of an institution that we've given the right to a monopoly on violence. It's doing all the things you'd ever predict it could do if you allow a central authority the right to steal money and print money without recourse.

I don't want this to feel like an ultimatum, but I'm not interested in a relationship where the only intimacy I get is snuggling.

"twentyonepilots","t5_2u0fp","I was slightly disappointed on first listen - i was hoping for a super serious track like Jumpsuit - but instead it’s a confident, fun and energetic inferno of a tune.

It’s grown on me a lot in the last few hours, i think the lyrics are great, and certainly better than most of the lyrics on the last album. I think the intro with Welcome to Trench and the Bandito interpolation is fantastic and a truly epic way to start the album. Tyler’s rapping is phenomenal and he doesn’t fall into the trap of being to corny like he has done before.

Personally while it doesn’t hit as hard as a first single as Jumpsuit, this single is absolutely a banger and is on the same tier as Shy Away was for me when that came out. In time i will probably end up preferring this song i think.

The Paul meany production is obvious and as tasty as ever. It has been missed.

Easy 8/10 tøp song. I’m most excited by the fact that this feels like a brief intro to the album. I hope the rest of the album keeps this quality and style, while also getting more into the meat and bones of the story.

Conclusion:

Good song and great album intro that stands on its own but definitely needs development and support from the rest of the album to truly shine. Hopefully the album gives that.",1709251348.0

My concern for you is- even if he's getting better, he needs to let you in on his healing, or this isn't going to be fixed. He is effecting you IMMENSELY, you are supposed to be his life partner. But he won't let you come to a session with him, because you're 'too controlling?'.

I would add a stipulation that if he doesn't start to understand that he's being selfish in not making you a part of this conversation, you should get out of there. The fact that he sees you as controlling when he's acting like that is bad, bad news. And scary news.

A couple of days later, I realized that a woman that I sold something to left and tried to get a refund. She tried to get her money back. So basically she tried to steal from me.

 I blocked her on the app and also on Facebook. Of course her refund was declined because there was no reason for it which I'm happy about. It just tells me that she tried to take my item and get her money back. I'm not falling for that again. That was really one of the only times that I ever accepted payment through one of the apps. 

I usually insist on cash and I've started doing that again. That way I get my money and the person gets what they want and everybody is happy. There are way too many dishonest people in this world for me to take a chance on getting burned again.",1709251350.0

THAT BEING SAID..
I just spent 4+ hours on this freaking quiz. Used the process of elimination to finally get correct answers written down bc I was so stressed I definitely wasn’t remembering any of that information. Why on EARTH wouldn’t they let us know AT LEAST which questions we got wrong and which ones we got right?? How is anybody supposed to learn like this?! It is scientifically proven that most people learn and actually retain the information they are tested on when given ways to help them understand what they don’t know and what they do know. I feel like I’ve been set up to fail. Our store doesn’t have the MDP guide (or at least the updated one) that has any of this information to go back to, which personally I think is one of the dumbest things ever bc what if I forget one day anyways??? Also both my evening manager and my gm said they always try to troubleshoot themselves and when they end up calling the help desk they’re like “why didn’t you just call us first? Here’s the answer” so WHY THE HECK DO WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE?!
Anyways I got up to 42 attempts and finally with the help of this thread and another one I finally was able to pass. Hopefully there aren’t many others like this bc I am definitely considering just going back to being a driver at this point honestly 🥴",1709251350.0

it seems to be more or less equivalent to the current system, just in a different format that lets you pick what you want a bit sooner. assuming you get 25 tickets per rank, you should be able to redeem every page fully as you go 1-100. 

new to this system is a full ""bonus"" page of cosmetics for ranks 100+ in addition to a page of consumables like we currently get. to earn the full page of cosmetics, you would need 50 ranks (to 150), and to also get the full page of consumables you'd need to get another 30 (to 180).

i don't think it's going to be much different in terms of pace and quantity of rewards, except now there are better bonus rewards for ranks 100+",1709251353.0

Which is actually a lot of information to disperse, considering their stated wishes for privacy.

* A lapdance
* Cowgirl
* Reverse cowgirl

**Standit is its own UNIQUE position:**  

* Girl is facing away from man
* Girl's feet are on floor
* Girl is shaking / twerking / bouncing her ass

[Allow /u/OliviaLights to demonstrate](https://www.reddit.com/r/standit/comments/pjas80/ill_be_this_subs_masscott/)

Additionally, if you post a video, include the timestamp where the standit occurs in the title. For example:

`Cuban whore claps thick ass on mega cock while standing it @ 2:30`

If it's a short clip, then the timestamp is not needed.

If your post does not qualify for /r/standit, kindly remove it and find something else to post! We'd love to see some standit content from you, but it has to adhere to our guidelines.

"sudoku","t5_2r2mp","i have a pretty extensive wiki on here if you ever want to dive into 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/sudoku/comments/191h5uw/we\_have\_a\_wiki\_that\_contains\_guides\_links\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sudoku/comments/191h5uw/we_have_a_wiki_that_contains_guides_links_and/)

on [http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/](http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/)the players forum  we created a rating program to Id what techniques are used for the average person to solve  in a program called Sudoku Explainer 

it has a  publicized solving hierarchy that's fixed,  has been the standard for 15+ years, the program also accounts for issomophology  ie ""identical"" puzzles all have the same rating.  

 this is based on the # of cells, length of chain and digit counts.  there more complex the move is in  these four aspects the difficulty scales. 

we categorized the moves  into a point based category. 

 the rating program solves a grid and   produces the rating of its most difficult move needed. 

  as a value from 1 -> 11.9 

the longer and harder a move is the higher the value can be .  

 most printed puzzles  or online puzzles fall into the S.E range of 4.2 

   which only has ->  Box line reduction, and Naked/Hidden subsets {basic entry level techniques} 

 whereby the 4.2 rating  capping out with hidden Quads  being the hardest move set needed. 



stuff in the  5-6 range is usually fish logic , and  6+ usually needs chains or Almost locked sets 

 once you break into the 8-9  dynamic forcing chains become needed more frequently, past 10 that's pretty much all get to work with. 

  

as for the Context  grid setup Sudoku is a  243 constraints solving problem.  27 sectors 9 digits per sector 

 RC its the cardinal system for  row x col  for each of the 81 cells of a grid, 

Rn: is the digit mapping for what is still on  per Row as  it stores Cols, for each specific digit 

Cn: is the digit mapping for what is still on  per col  as  it stores row , for each specific digit 

Bn: is the digit mapping for what is still on  per box as  it stores square, for each specific digit 

  
 these 4 spaces are populated by givens of a grid { weather we know it or not} 

when we write pencil-marks we are actually visually depicting 

  the intersection of {Rn,Cn,Bn}  & union of Digits 1-9  for each RC 

  
all solving logic developed utilizes these 4 spaces exclusively, {know or unknown to the user. }

 in which the logic applies reduction in those 4 spaces, until all 243 constraints have 1 solution each.

the point i was making is that with moves below 4.2  your solving sequences focus on placements which  are  visual reminders of the 4 space reduction. 

compared to harder techniques that  can only remove singular digits form specific cells.",1709251354.0

"Scams","t5_2qrt0","AutoModerator has been summoned to explain [recovery scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams). Also known as refund scams, these scams target people who have already fallen for a scam. The scammer may contact you, or may advertise their services online. They will usually either offer to help you recover your funds, or will tell you that your funds have already been recovered and they will help you access them. In cases where they say they will help you recover your funds, they usually call themselves either ""recovery agents"" or hackers. When they tell you that your funds have already been recovered, they may impersonate a law enforcement, a government official, a lawyer, or anyone else along those lines. Recovery scams are simply [advance-fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) scams that are specifically targeted at scam victims. When a victim pays a recovery scammer, the scammer will keep stringing them along while asking for increasingly absurd fees/expenses/deposits/insurance/whatever until the victim stops paying. If you have been scammed in the past, make sure you are aware of recovery scams so that you are not scammed a second time. If you are currently engaging with a recovery scammer, you should block them and be very wary of random contact for some time. It's normal for posters on this subreddit to be contacted by recovery scammers after posting, and they often ask you to delete your post so that you both cannot receive legitimate advice, and cannot be targeted by other recovery scammers.

"SWlegion","t5_3nqdi","Still fairly new so take my insights with a grain of salt, but:

1. Definitely still getting updates. As a former X-Wing player, it was refreshing to come in knowing there were like 6-7 planned releases we were getting active updates towards, across multiple stages of developments.

3. Way simpler than Warhammer. Fairly easy to pick up if you have tabletop experience, but with a few unique nuances. But had a lot of depth and room to play and improve and innovate. And game balance is fairly wide with lots of options within each faction.

4. I’ve liked Yavin Base for streams of competitive content. Fifth Trooper isn’t bad because they have three podcasts that run weekly, but I’m not a fan of all three.

5. It’s not too good to be true. This game ACTUALLY IS 1/4 the cost of Warhammer. Each box had a full army inside, with some room to swap around upgrades, but you’ll mostly be playing the same units within the starter boxes every game until you pick up some more variety.

6. Droids play completely different from everything else. The other three factions seem to play semi-similar, woth most of the differences coming down to subtle things with how their lists are built. Rebels are like HeroHammer, Empire has mercenaries and gunlines, Republic likes to stay closely clumped and runs less models.",1709251356.0

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","I totally understand you feel responsible and it feels heartless to not do anything, but you really can't. You cannot force help on her if she doesn't want it. 

Self harm is her way of coping with her situation, she recognises it's an unhealthy mechanism but she currently doesn't see herself in a situation to change that. You either have to accept that she sets the pace with this and if you don't want that (which is 100% fine, please only do what you feel capable of) you need to walk away from her. Pressuring her into anything won't work. 

What you can do is make her feel seen and understood and maybe someday she'll be ready to accept professional help. You can throw it in from time to time or offer to go see a professional with her if she would find that helpful, but acceptance is the key. If she says no, it's a no. You don't owe her saving or fixing. And she doesn't owe you getting better.

As frustrating as losing is, take it an an experience and try to grow in it. Try to identify patterns that emerge when you begin losing. Is it another lane that uses their pressure to dominate another lane? Is it counterjunglers? Is it splitpushers? Is it grouping for objectives? Where do you gain gold an experience? See what's the most difficult to deal with, and identify *why* it's so tricky to deal with.

When there are two smart political candidates, things get more complicated. For any issue with wide support, both candidates take the same position. For things that are widely hated, they both also take the same position.  
So they do differentiate themselves, but ONLY through things that have relatively close appeal to voters.  
If a candidate loses by a wide margin, their party goes back to the drawing board. What exactly was it that made them unappealing? This might result in them fielding a different candidate. It may result in a change of priorities by the candidate. So they either double down on their differences with their opponent, or they get closer to their opponents stance. Or find a new issue to champion.   
In any case, if what they do doesn't work they try something else. Eventually they will find something that works. And then their opponent is in the same position.",1709251357.0

She can't even answer questions about her kids--they are little and busy being little, etc. Where do the kids live and who lives with them? There is something going on. Just like when Megs was supposedly pregnant. You know she would have been posing like Demi Moore for a magazine cover, baring her pregnant belly. You know she would have been talking nonstop to this day about her pregnancy cravings, exhausting, etc and every detail of her labor and delivery.

"Accounting","t5_2qw2b",">I've been ignored, disagreed with, told that I don't understand, told that a tax is ""un-Constitutional.""  All after having read the relevant rules and then explain in plain English those rules step by step.

I'm on government side: individual income tax audit, in the appellate bureau now, of a State agency.

I had a trial on Monday.  The petitioner (taxpayer in disagreement with our adjustment) got to cross examine me.

First he asked what the difference was between a refund of his withholding and a refundable credit.  That's the kind of thing I prefer to work out over the phone instead of going the whole nine yards for a trial; but: Okay - I got this.

Then he asked me what happened to his federal income tax refund (from the IRS).  This gentleman has already had it explained to him by: our auditor, the auditor's supervisor, myself, my supervisor, our attorney, and then two of the three judges on the panel during phone conferences that our State agency is not the IRS.

I had a ""Sir, this is a Wendy's moment.""

The chair judge then explained at great length that he could not question me about what the IRS did.

Again, this is the sort of thing that 99% of the time gets worked out by the auditor.  The 1% of the time it doesn't, I get it worked out.  Monday, I went to trial for that.

After that - ""no further questions.""

Just a few reminders...

* Please take a moment to **review the sub rules**. Ignorance is not an excuse for rule breaking.
* All posts require a timestamp with the knife. This is a picture of the knife with your handwritten username and the date to prove you possess the item in question. At least one photo must include the knife open as well.
* Your prices should also be in the form of Paypal Goods and Services if you are under 25 flair, with any fees included in the price.  If you have over 25 flair, all methods of payment are allowed.
* All your prices should include the shipping costs, unless international shipping is requested by the buyer. 
* Please **DO NOT** remove prices after an item is sold. Prices MUST stay on the post. Please wrap the item in `~~` characters to ~~strike through~~ the text instead.
* Any ""Want to Buy"" threads should use the weekly stickied ""WTB"" thread.  
* If you're looking for a Price Check, please use the stickied ""Still Available / Price Check"" thread.  
* If you're looking to sell EDC gear, that's fine to do here as long as there are more knives in your post than gear in both value and number. Please consider using r/edcexchange as well.

I put just the tip in and I finally fucking get it lol. Why people risk that 1% chance to feel this feeling lol. I let myself savor it for like a few seconds but I pulled it out cause I was worried it would make me wanna like hook up or something lol but the fullness felt so fucking amazing in comparison to my vibe that I usually use as like a makeshift dildo lmao seriously I get it. It’s that fullness and like the feeling of the ridges on the head and omg like everything about it god fucking damn I can’t wait to have sex i seriously can’t wait lol omg",1709251360.0

"AskStatistics","t5_2sioa","""fairly shuffled"" is not a property of an individual deck order (every possible deck order is equally likely under a fair shuffle), but of the process -- it will skew the probabilities away from equally likely, but in the most general case you have no obvious way to order the possible outcomes (there's an infinite number of ways to be ""unfair"").

Consequently, I don't see how you could do it from a single shuffle in general (though if you suspect a particular kind of unfairness - without examining the deck - then sure, you can do it, because that would let you get to some kind of ordering of consistency with the alternative hypothesis of the specific kind of unfairness).

In particular, presumably if you think it's stacked (*a priori*, NOT *post hoc*), you suspect some particular form of non-randomness. If you can specify how that will affect likely deck order, you can certainly do something, but exactly how many cards you might need to see will depend on the details of the suspected form of nonrandomness, and (if any randomness remains among the stacking) on what chance you want to have to pick up that form of stacking if it's occurring, and on your degree of willingness to unjustly accuse an innocent of cheating.",1709251361.0

I do want to be clear that I would NEVER call my wife crazy, nor do I think it. I do feel her reactions can be out of proportion with what initiates them. But that’s not the same. 

Likewise, I fully believe she has a right to be stressed. But I’d like to help her keep things in perspective rather than have her spiral - which can lead to the aforementioned screaming, throwing things, etc. My therapist has suggested when she gets that way I need to step back and just don’t be involved.

I keep trying to tell myself that she did care for me at one point. That she wasn't treating this whole thing like a science experiment, that she didn't ask me to be her girlfriend to see if she could grow to like me. But I don't know, and I don't think I ever will at this point. It's going to be a long time before I can let myself be vulnerable like this again.",1709251363.0

Second, it's normal to be clueless at times. if you want 0% damage rates, it's impossible when you're trying to find love. But a girl that liked you will often enough make an effort in order to stay with you as much as possible. Does she ask to hangout? Does she talk to you a lot? Does she give you gifts? Does she do slight physical contact? Those are more obvious cues that she might be interested, but the best is to wait and see, especially see. Observe and it'll maybe come obvious to you. If embarassing stuff happens, welp it happens. I've for tons of cringe memories! But you'll live with it. You're still young. The most important thing is to have fun!  
You'll probably make mistakes if you date young, or in your first dating experiences really doesn't really matter what age you are.  
From your taste in people from your way of approach and passing by understanding of people and communication. Omg help I could go on and on.  


Ok I'll just make do's and don't's.  
DO:  
\-Have patience, these things takes time.  
\-Have respect, usually it goes back to you  
\-Have prudence, Love is like a rose, it has it's thorns.   
\-Have confidence, It's the key for attraction.  
\-Have hygene, girls like boys that smells good! And it's good for you! (No judging, I've been a teen too.)  
\-Your research on relationships. It helped me on some stuff. If you wanna know about women, take advice from women, not just men. (ESPECIALLY DON'T LISTEN TO ANDREW TATE and any other alpha male podcasts)  
DON'T:  
\-Expect love in exchange of your courtesy. It's not a transaction.  
\-Let yourself be abused / be abusive./\*\*\*STAY IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP\*\*\* (Even if you're a boy, your feelings matter, and her feelingns matters too. but I say you first because boy's feelings are often overlooked.)  
\-Neglect your relationship. Bonds can be strong but if not rekindled it can break. (been here)  
\-Be paranoid. If you're controling, it means you don't trust them. And trust is something important.  
\-Stay with people who's values don't align with yours. Stay true to yourself.  
\-SPEND A SINGLE PENNY IN THE FIRST 6 MONTHS. You'll regret it. Trust me. At first give crafted and heartfelt gift. It's more valuable than anything out there.  
\-leave your friendships. On the contrary, make time for both your friends and your girlfriend. Friendship is very important.

It is like stepping back in time a bit, they have a high school homecoming parade that shuts down the town.  The social scene is pretty bad as you have to travel to Junction or to Telluride to find any people under 30 who are not very blue-collar country folk. Also, everyone knows everyone so it can be hard to make friends, I am super extroverted and even I struggled. Dating sucks, everyone single is like a parking spot at a busy grocery store.

"2007scape","t5_2wbww","So what you do is you take ensouled heads, runes to cast whatever reanimation spell the head in question needs (for example master for dragons, expert for bloodvelds) and head over to the Dark Altar, located in Arceuus, Kourend (it's the purple section southeast of wintertodt and northwest of piscarilius). There you can speak (or right click) to an NPC called Tyss who will change your spellbook to Arceuus spellbook. IIRC you'll need to complete Ascent of Arceuus quest for this, it's fairly short and simple.

Then you just click the reanimation spell and the ensouled head, much like if you were alching or enchanting on standard spellbook, kill the reanimated monster for prayer xp, rinse and repeat.

My inventory consists of rune pouch with the reanimation runes, varrock teleport tablets for banking close to a fairy ring and dramen staff for fairy rings (there's a fairy ring close to the dark altar). The rest are ensouled heads.",1709251365.0

As for performance it’s not the most performant way to build an API, however it does support reactivity very well because it forces you to have unique types and IDs for all entities allowing for anything to be cached client and/or server side. If you need performance for s2s use gRPC.",1709251365.0

"LiverpoolFC","t5_2qn0o","> Imagine defending someone who is excited about Jurgen Klopp leaving.

Imagine being a grown man with such feeble emotional intelligence. 

Who the hell knows who is next in line to manage this team and how they'll fare? 

The excitement is in the unknown and the novelty of what life after Klopp will bring. When the positives of the club's current situation outweigh the negatives and the mood around the team is at a high, why would choose to take the pessimistic road. What good could that possibly bring about? 

>A positive outlook is not a better outlook. Especially not when it's a delusional fucking outlook like this one.

All things come to an end. Have you ever thought about how silly it is to sit and cry about the departure of a man who is too mentally exhausted to see his contract out? It's a situation that's wholly out of your control. In the absence of that control, tell me what's the point of filling that void with negative thoughts and energy?",1709251365.0

"AskWomenOver30","t5_2ya5k","I have been going on dates, but not as you very narrowly describe an ""actual"" date.  The only things I think we agree on per your description is they have to be planned at least a couple days in advance.  I'm not a booty call or just filling in for an evening some guy thought he already had plans for.  I've had guys try that bs but they very quickly lose access to talking to me at all.

I prefer a coffee or walking date as a first date.  It takes the pressure off both of us.  I usually like to pick a small diner if we do coffee so if they want to get food they can.  I generally don't. If we go for a walk, I usually choose a park I'm familiar with during the day.  I want a public place where we can just chat and see if we vibe at all.  Get some of the important stuff out of the way and see if a second, more substantial date can be planned.

Then I try to let them make plans.  If they can't choose, then I know they're likely not willing to put in any kind of effort and I lose interest.",1709251365.0
