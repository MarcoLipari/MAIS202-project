"insanepeoplefacebook","t5_3acf2","Alrighty, I'll talk ""qualifications"" Teddy Roosevelt was a war hero with very minimal in the way of education. George Washington had even less education and while he was a war hero he was far from the greatest tactician and often called on others for planning and strategy. George W. Bush was a businessman. Ronald Reagan was just an actor who won office purely through popularity. Trump is a failing entrepreneur who sought the presidency for financial gain. Bit of a pattern here as most of the presidents whom didn't have ""qualifications"" would have fallen under the modern definition of republican. If you'd like some proof. Abe Lincoln was a democrat and studied law. Barak Obama was a lawyer who studied at Harvard Law. And Joe Biden studied law at Syracuse University. As far as Kamala Harris, She studied at the UC Hastings College of Law in 1989 meaning that not only is her education exceeding Donald Trump's and many other candidates, it's also more recent and up-to-date as far as newer laws and ways we deal with legal issues.",1622505600

"jawsurgery","t5_2yfo0","Given your severe symptoms despite being so young (21 M) I would really recommend aggressive treatment, it's better to do this kind of stuff while you're young than procrastinate and let it get progressively worse.

I agree the sleep study is a great idea, I would also try and make sure the sleep lab uses the AASM 1A criteria (3% desaturation) for hypopneas (as opposed to 4%) to try and avoid the possibility of a false negative, it can be an issue in especially young and thin OSA cases.

CPAP could also help improve your symptoms if you do test positive, though there are arguments for jaw surgery as well, such as the fact you may not need a CPAP after jaw surgery, the cosmetic side, and even some people find CPAP doesn't work for them at all (either ineffective or can't sleep with it). Some people call it a last resort but for a 21 year old personally I don't think it's a big deal, sure the recovery sucks but afterwards you'll have a new jaw for your entire life.

If you want to see an ortho who specializes in the jaw I would see an MSE provider from this list: [https://www.moonmse.com/distributors-1](https://www.moonmse.com/distributors-1)",1622505600

You can absolutely renovate a yard.

It requires minimal plumbing if the layout stays the same. A home owner could do it.

&gt;You cannot resize a window frame without a permit

Okay? At no point have I mentioned resizing. I talked about upgrading from one pane ton two, not enlarging the size.

&gt;High voltage electrical work more than 48V requires an electrician

I very clearly stated homeowners are allowed to do MINOR electrical work. 

&gt;I don't care about your area.

I'm sorry, are you failing to comprehend where you live could have different rules and regulations than where i do?

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Here's my point in a nutshell: I claim that it is perfectly fine to agree that 'is actual' is indexical while insisting on actualism. This was Stalnaker's point in his paper from the '60s I mentioned above. 'World w is actual' is false when evaluated at this world and true when evaluated at world w. At the same time, only this world is actual. 

The analogy is the following: the presentist is perfectly happy to agree that (as is really obvious) 'now' is indexical (in normal conditions it refers to the time of utterance). 'It is now noon' is true at noon and false at 3PM. However, the presentist can still insist that only the present exists. The two positions are completely independent of each other. 

Both my points about 'is actual' and about 'now' are pretty uncontroversial points in contemporary semantics so I'm not going to try and argue for them here (that would get pretty complicated and I'm not sure how to go about it; I guess Kaplan's classic paper 'Demonstratives' would be relevant?). 

Maybe your problem is the idea that I can evaluate a sentence at a context even when I don't believe an element of that context has *real, genuine* existence. But evaluating a sentence at a context is a rather formal, logical technique without obvious metaphysical implications. I can be a nominalist or whatever about other times while still agreeing that 'now' when I use it refers to the time I use it and hence 'now' when I used it ten minutes ago referred to ten minutes ago. The presentist *has* to tell a story about what 'It was raining ten minutes ago' means, after all (e.g. I'm referring to something that technically no longer exists). Whatever story they end up telling will allow them to give the standard semantics for 'now'. 

To be fair, I haven't read a ton about presentism because I think it's straightforwardly incompatible with Relativity Theory and runs into quite few other issues too.",1622505601
"photographs","t5_2qkod","I took this photo because I have been playing around with and loving vertical framing recently and when I saw this as I was walking down hill I just had to capture it, with the positioning of the trees and the munroe I saw the photo op straight away and had this vision. 
I was stood on the very edge of a rocky hill on the descent down from The Cobbler with my dslr to capture this at the right angle I wanted and to make sure I got that rule of thirds framing. It’s a handheld shot - hiking up a mountain with a tripod ain’t where it’s at!

I'd like to hit a few of your counter points where I think I was perhaps a little unclear and so you may have misunderstood what I meant.  


Firstly, I do fully recognize that my experience with players is completely personal but I would like to give myself some credit in that it is nearly 4000 hours of personal experience in ranked alone, and these sentiments are held by many of my friends who also play the game. So yes it is not representative of every person's experience but I do think it is certainly a large enough sample pool across enough ranks to make it decently relatable.  


Secondly, my use of the term trolling here isn't relating to just bad players or people who would often be labeled as trolls when they actually just kinda suck. I am using that as general shorthand for the players who steal roles out of anger, sell their build mid game for full MS etc etc. The people are very clearly doing shitty things and making sly remarks about it in chat and all that shit.  


Thirdly, and this is where I think you misunderstand me the most. I do not think anyone in the ranked scene is comparable to an SPL player rn (excluding ex spl players ofc) but I DO think there are many people in the SCC who are. High end SCC players, with time to practice and compete in the same league could 100% compete in the SPL, while extremely the highest tier ranked players who compete in the amateur league could totally fill the spots of low end SCC teams, which would then open up spots for more ranked players to join the amateur league and practice playing as a team. So it's of course just a cycle of good players moving up and making a larger, more interesting League.   


Finally while I agree that it would be foolish to assume Smite/TitanForge/Hirez did no market research but it's also a bit foolish to ignore the very much less than stellar history for the business side of the company. They are not exactly marketing geniuses so criticism is very much needed to keep them lined up I think.",1622505602

&gt; The Armenian people are amongst the native ethnic groups of northwestern Iran (known as Iranian Azerbaijan), having millennia-long recorded history there while the region (or parts of it) have had made up part of historical Armenia numerous times in history. These historical Armenian regions that nowadays include Iranian Azerbaijan are Nor Shirakan, Vaspurakan, and Paytakaran. Many of the oldest Armenian chapels, monasteries and churches in the world are located within this region of Iran.

It's goofy and very selfish. It adds nothing to the game, it makes it extremely difficult for the other plays to play around and it makes it almost impossible for the DM to write and make things that are ""fair"".

I make sure to state that sort of thing is unacceptable in any session 0.


A lot of players (especially ones that aren't very experienced) come out of the game with these wild ideas of these crazy characters they want to play. I've done it before. 

But they are difficult to plan around, some of their made up character rules don't make much sense or are difficult to balance or they want some rick and morty bullshit.

I'm against that sort of thing. I generally find it best if your character starts out bland. A youngling, a nobody, some bland dude. Their character story is in the game, at the table, not before.",1622505602

In the East, there's Akavir, and what little we do know of it is blatantly self-contradictory due to the future being neither knowable nor set in stone.

You’ll have hiking options in the blue ridge and Appalachia but it won’t compare to hiking in the mountain west. It’s very green which is something I miss. You never adjust to humidity ever.

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","This is less like storebought stuff, but possibly a good start: equal parts mayo and sour cream, a clove of garlic (grated or minced) and a scallion/green onion for every 75 ml of mayo-sour cream blend, salt and pepper to taste, lemon juice, and some minced (or freeze-dried) parsley (volume depends on taste and whether fresh or dried). The lemon juice makes it tangy and cuts the fattiness of the mayo.  I usually make 250-300 ml at a time and use a half a lemon (more if the lemon is small or dry).  The storebought stuff is a little sweeter, though, so you may want to either cut back on the lemon or add a touch of sugar.  (Full disclosure: I also make this with cilantro/fresh coriander instead of parsley, and sometimes I cheat by throwing everything into a cup and blending it until it's basically pale green.)

They can tank most battles if managed properly and get a serious kill count. And eltharion is just such a fun lord to play, especially with stormwing. I LOVE the color scheme of yvresse, WAY more high elfy than others. Also they are the only H.e faction I feel can justify their superiority to others because of how powerful they are and all the threats they've faced successfully. Also starting in the old world as H.e is super refreshing. Plus the athel Tamara mechanic,in terms of how it feels and looks really adds more in depth feeling to the aesthetic of yvresse.

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

Except he isn't killing one to kill four. He is killing seven to save no one. This is like the trolley problem except you are already on a track that won't kill anyone and you would have to switch tracks to kill seven people. It isn't a difficult ethical conundrum.

&gt;Then how about the opposite? Does committing good make you good? Has there ever been a person that hasn't done a mix of both?

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","I had one player who didn't seem that into his character, wasn't roleplaying heavily, was sort of doing the exact same things every battle.  Tried to gear a few more encounters his way but it just didn't seem to gel. Mind you there were some definitely very strong RPers in the group so maybe he was just letting them do all the talking or possibly felt a bit left behind.

He was playing a cleric, so I gave him a bit of a crisis of faith. At first I started fudging some rolls behind the screen (nothing obnoxious I don't think). He seemed cursed.  Sure enough, I wrote up a whole quest line aimed at him. Basically revolved around questioning, testing and then renewing his faith in his chosen deity. Basically the group ended up performing some tasks for another group of clerics/druids, and his curse grew. After an encounter with a sort of demonic creature he started developing fatigue that wouldn't go away with rest. His spells all were cast at disadvantage. Every night he'd have feverish dreams and visions of an empty field, devoid of life. Eventually in a bit of wild self doubt and surrender, demanded forgiveness from his god- only to reveal in a vision that   his deity  appreciated his devotion to *any* power as long as his intentions and actions were appropriate- one race's god of life and health was not all that different from another.

So he had a bit of an awakening and I give him some extra abilities. He automatically gained the knowledge of how to speak Elvish (was a halfling) and another trait or feat I can't recall right now.

After that he was much more conscious about ""serving"" his deity and their intentions, rather than simple checking boxes in an attempt at piety.",1622505611

"RedditReads","t5_33xfn","The Curies' newly discovered element of radium makes gleaming headlines across the nation as the fresh face of beauty, and wonder drug of the medical community. From body lotion to tonic water, the popular new element shines bright in the otherwise dark years of the First World War.Meanwhile, hundreds of girls toil amidst the glowing dust of the radium-dial factories. The glittering chemical covers their bodies from head to toe; they light up the night like industrious fireflies. With such a coveted job, these ""shining girls"" are the luckiest alive — until they begin to fall mysteriously ill.But the factories that once offered golden opportunities are now ignoring all claims of the gruesome side effects, and the women's cries of corruption. And as the fatal poison of the radium takes hold, the brave shining girls find themselves embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of America's early 20th century, and in a groundbreaking battle for workers' rights that will echo for centuries to come. Written with a sparkling voice and breakneck pace, The Radium Girls fully illuminates the inspiring young women exposed to the ""wonder"" substance of radium, and their awe-inspiring strength in the face of almost impossible circumstances. Their courage and tenacity led to life-changing regulations, research into nuclear bombing, and ultimately saved hundreds of thousands of lives...",1622505611

I prefer people to speak their minds and like the conversation at least being on the table. Again, I could be wrong about this because I was an atheist for many years before I became a Christian and developed my own understanding about some of the doctrine.

Eventually, I believe that jesus will come back to earth visibly and at this point, everybody has the opportunity to be saved. Of course, some people will reject the messiah after he has definitely proven himself and these people will align against god. However, I believe everyone that accepts christ as the messiah when he is revealed will be saved. I think that the believers before he appears will have some kind of nobility and be blessed. This belief has nothing to do with actually being saved. The prerequisite to obtain this nobility is near infinitely low, if someone at some reach of their mind thinks it is at all possible that jesus is even maybe the savior or could be, even if he highly doubts it, christ will still break bread and consider this person a true Christian .

I think the popular interpretation of the doctrine is wrong and god ends up saving nearly all. Well anyway, I want to wish you well, on your pursuit on the knowledge of god. I hope it leads to a satisfying and rewarding life and answers your questions in a way that benefits your over all well being.",1622505612

"trippinthroughtime","t5_2y3e1","A far less punishment than eternal hell for not believing and worshipping him. We are the clay, he is the potter, and he has all the justified right to do with his creation as he pleases (Romans 9:21-23). He alone is worthy of all worship, and he demands that worship, not because he’s a megalomaniac, but because he is perfect and worthy. And he is all-knowing, so his assessment of his own value and thus his demanding that he alone be worshipped is RIGHT. So if he so chooses to kill whomever he chooses to kill for whatever reason he chooses, that is a justified cause because his will is perfect and his judgments are just and his standard is perfection. The town he destroyed that you mentioned (Sodom) refused to repent and their evil was rampant. They were murderers and rapists. God could not even find ONE good person in that town. His judgment was just. Imagine an American town filled with 100% murders and rapists and many other kinds of evil. Wouldn’t we call for justice? God delivered justice and now you call for grace? Fine, have your grace…it’s yours in Jesus. You can’t have it both ways. Your tottering on logical inconsistency here.

The real issue here is that you are equating God to a superhuman and evaluating him according to human morality. As if he must work according to our human standards of morality. When in actuality, God’s standard is the measure of morality, of which we all fall short. He determine right from wrong, we have to follow his morality. And his actions are not bound to our standards because he is sovereign over every single molecule in existence. So death in this life (even terrible deaths at the hand of God) are far easier to swallow than eternal damnation for rejecting his gracious gift of eternal life in Jesus. So your argument that God seems crazy for his behavior comes from viewing God from human standards. He creates the standard, we don’t follow it, then we face judgment, and it’s justified. BUT…God knows it’s impossible for us obey all his rules and thus be perfect. That is why in his love and grace he provided us with a Savior in whom we need only to believe, and thus escape his judgment and instead receive his eternal joy and reward of his presence (seem too easy? That’s the point). That is a good God. We deserve nothing because of our sinful nature. But he gives grace and provides a way to salvation. 

Believe it or not, that’s up to you (I assume you won’t based on your last comment), but know that every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord…either in this life, or at his feet in judgment (Philippians 2:10-11). You’re clearly angry at this concept of God (I call him a concept because you say you don’t believe in him, but he is real). Have you ever considered that maybe your anger at God is actually the product of Christians who don’t do the things or say the things they claim? That they are terrible people but claim God? I could see how that could push you away. But keep in mind that just because God’s people are not perfect doesn’t make God imperfect or not real. That’s simply illogical. The fact that we are imperfect is the reason we need Jesus. That’s logical. We aren’t better, we’re just as sinful as everyone else, but we believe in Christ for salvation. Because we’re smarter? No! Because God was gracious to us and his patience that he is showing you today is meant to show you his kindness…to give you time to believe in Jesus for your salvation (Romans 2:4). Also, have you considered that maybe you’re angry at God because it helps you justify not being held accountable to him for your sin? If that is the case, ignoring his existence (claiming ignorance) is not a justifiable excuse to escape his judgment or to escape hell.

I hate when Christians tell non-Christians, “I’ll pray for you.” It sounds so pretentious and arrogant, as if to say, “Since I’m godly and you’re not, I’ll pray for you…you wicked evil person.” So, despite my hesitancy to say it…I WILL pray for you. Even if you don’t want me to and even if you think it’s arrogant. It is not arrogant, it’s the opposite…it’s dependence. It is me trusting that God can break through any barrier. Whether he does or not is up to him. My role is to be faithful to him, proclaim the truth, and pray for you. You can be angry at me, but I’m not the one you’ll have to face. He offers you his eternal joy. Take it.",1622505612

I was speculating with a friend that the reason they kept reference to Reia even though he left was because he may join the line-up of the BHJ group, I could definitely see that happening. What year did they hold the previous BHJ auditions? I wasn't aware they had any until recently...curious that they wouldn't have any trainees from those on iland if they were held  before the show aired.

I guess we'll see if plans for this group shift now that Kyungmin left. It just all appears rather more unplanned and willy-nilly than BigHit/Hybe's usual M.O. which is everything planned to the last detail lol. Another reason I'm speculative about this, is the audition show that's supposes to be coming based off this group. Obviously the confirmed members won't participate but it seems like they're going to air the &amp;Audition process for promo?

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

These people have lives and career that they need to keep up with, as long as they keep putting on a funny show and aren’t dicks in real life, I don’t care.

"polymerclay","t5_2s48h","First, some brands/lines of polymer clay will just be brittle after baking in any *thin* and/or thinly-projecting areas if those areas get much later stress (e.g., Sculpey III, Bake Shop, regular Craftsmart, no-name brands like some kits from amazon, Super Sculpey Original, and especially Original Sculpey).   
So just avoiding those brands/lines if you want to make anything with thin parts (i.e., not thick-and-rounded) will automatically result in stronger clay pieces. 

And thoroughly polymerizing while baking is required to get the best strength from any brand/line of polymer clay.

And/or use a permanent armature inside the clay next time. You might be able to cut the clay open and add a permanent armature but can be difficult especially with certain shapes.

If you're trying to fix a brittle piece though, you could try any of these things that make sense for that piece or that part (would have been helpful to see a pic or get more explanation of exactly what your piece is like though, in shape especially, to know which might be more appropriate):

--- rebake the item to fully polymerize even the thickest areas of it, if you hadn't fully-cured before

--- back or surround, etc, the piece or brittle parts of it with more clay or with another strong material to reinforce any brittle areas (or just to make any flexible areas stiffer)

--- coat with a liquid polymer clay (some will be shinier than others when cured)  

--- coat with a high-quality clear liquid finish (e.g., something like Varathane polyurethane--which can be applied in multiple layers if you want or even used for dipping) or with epoxy or UV-curing resin

There are tons of resources online where you can find 20-30 minute workouts that don't require tons of equipment, so you can do them while the kids nap or watch TV. Or you could go for a 30 minute run or bike ride (maybe bring the kids with you, they love shit like that), you could do some yoga or dance type stuff after your kids go to bed!

Staying fit after becoming a parent isn't easy, and I definitely don't judge anyone for prioritizing other aspects of their life! Parenting is exhausting. Most parents deserve all the slack in the world but with JE's track record...not so much",1622505617

She’s the one in the wrong here and ironically it has absolutely nothing to do with her. She is just starting gossip and drama. 

You addressed your drunken actions with the girl involved and that is all you can do. I mean the girl involved has no problem with you and seems like she accepted your apology. She is the one who mattered in this situation. You don’t need to apologise to every female you know bc you got drunk and asked for a kiss. That is an idiotic unrealistic standard and it’s sounds like girl B is just bullying you. 

Also a lot of lasting relationships start out as friends and evolve into romantic sexual relationships. You can be friends and still be aware of someone else’s physical attractiveness without sexualising them or finding them a potential sex partner. 

Women do it all the time. I have plenty of good looking male friends and female friends. I am married and pregnant and completely uninterested in anyone but my husband however I have the ability to recognise if our friends are considered attractive or not.",1622505617

***

**Rule 6:** Titles should describe, or strongly and easily allude to, what the subject of the thumbnail appears to be. You are free to resubmit with a different title provided that the post does not violate any other rules besides rule 2.

* **Common Mistakes:**
  * Titles should not describe what the full-size image *actually is*.
  * Titles should not describe what the full-size image *looks like*.
  * Titles should not describe *events that happen later in a video or gif* that are not visible in the freeze-frame used as the thumbnail.
  * Titles should not describe something that is *too small to see* in the thumbnail, or *cropped out* of the thumbnail.
  * Titles should never simply be *a joke* about the full-size image.
  * Titles should not be treated like /r/MisleadingCaptions where you *make up a story about the full-size image*, but the thumbnail-sized image doesn't look any different.

* [More detail about Rule 6 can be found in the wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/misleadingthumbnails/wiki/index#wiki_6._titles_should_describe.2C_or_strongly_and_easily_allude_to.2C_what_the_subject_of_the_thumbnail_appears_to_be.)

 Once we did, it was like people (news) felt like there was no warning.    


 I was more pissed about it, because in the beginning (Feb 2020) those projections didn't seem that far fetched to me at the time.  And Trump was trying to sell us that by May, those 15 cases would ""disappear"", as if the virus didn't exist.

"Boruto","t5_34e1h","yh but then mitsuki is quite proficient with the sword already as seen in ep 39 or whenever that one shot chapter about mitsuki and oro was 

and so is boruto in the future and since mitsuki is really fast in sage mode and karma makes boruto much faster i feel like sarada's the only one left out and since she sees the hokages as her role models maybe she learns a jutsu from each and i think flying raijin would suit her

 but she puts her own twist to it so maybe her sword has the marking so she throws it at her opponent then she suddently appears before them with the sword in the hand or she uses a shuriken with markings so maybe if she throws multiple and she learns shuriken clone jutsu thing she can teleport with so many shurikens i think that would be cool but tobirama would be turning in his grave lmao an uchiha learning one of his signature jutsus",1622505620

"castlevania","t5_2ss33","Exactly, Dracula in the games is driven by eternal hate and he's so driven and motivated that he's gonna keep coming back to life until the job is done, quite the opposite of the depressed and just kinda done with everything Netflix Dracula in season 2. Dracula in the games is the literal antichrist, but everything he does is out of love for Elisabetha and Lisa and since humankind's evil is what brings him back, he questions whether or not he actually *is* evil or in the wrong since his very existence proves his point about humans. There's a philosophical side to Dracula everyone conveniently ignores and that's been around since 1994 with Rondo of Blood.

Yeah, game Isaac does exactly what he has to and fulfils his purpose and as a character, he works well in the game's narrative themes and also deals with the dangers of single-minded obsession, something Hector flat out rejects.",1622505620

It’s been a wonderful smoker, the 22 though... it has room for more corn and side items.

I think he's giving retail investors far too much credit here, since I doubt the majority of people pumping these coins have any clue about inflation rates or even the most basic understanding of market caps, and they certainly don't understand the technology (or lack thereof) of these blockchains. This is probably why Tezos isn't doing as great as we would all have expected - the incredible fundamentals and technology are just lost on the average investor at the moment.

"DAE","t5_2r6cf","I do it with social situations. For some reason people get super aggravated if you point things out. People take everything as complaining or griping. Not a lot of people can just make an observation just to make an observation. They assume if you make an observation that you must have some emotional stake in it.

I tend to think everything is funny or that parameters around things can't be taken seriously. So I laugh at everything.

Used to I'd say it out loud. Like when I.worked this job, this woman would stand by the door everyday they were handing out assignments and slip out before she got one.

I'd laugh because no one would say anything about it, but they'd get mad when Tony didn't want to do the most physically grueling task every single day. That was funny to me because these people saw Tiny.not wanting to do the hardest job every day all day as wrong. But this woman doing nothing wasn't wrong. 

I'd say, I bet she slips out today with laugh, and people would get so mad. They'd say, Why do your care or why does it matter or even Bullshit she wouldn't do that. Then I'd say I bet she does and she would and I'd laugh and say See!! And people would just roll their eyes.

So I make bets to myself the time.about gromey things people are gonna try to pull. Like, I bet that car in the right lane tries to races around the car in the left when the light turns green. Then they do and I laugh and laugh as the barely squeeze in as the right lane closes.",1622505622

The problem though is that people who call others 'bigot' and say phrases such as 'shut the entire fuck up' are not thinking of that brand of thin. They consider 'thin' anyone in the fat category. 

Remember that 'normal' to many of these people is obesity. 

There was a nice facebook ad that showcased a bigger guy getting some clothes. He looked really good honestly. I wasn't really thinking about it much because It was obvious his shirt was too tight and the ad showed a better fitting shirt for him. I figured it was just about getting a good fit.

But what I noticed was the comments being full of ""Finally an actual guy!"" or ""Not someone too thin!"" and ""A regular guy!"". To me it was very telling that to so many people 'normal' is someone who was at best on the border of obese and overweight.",1622505623

"PS5","t5_2s887","&gt; we should attempt to hold them to a certain standard when giving that amount of money.

Except this post was originally about people expecting a *free* 60fps update to HZD. There's no one giving any money here.

&gt;Nope, not comparing a medium where you don't control the movement and camera to one where you do.

You're misinterpreting the intent. The point is that 30fps and 60fps were standards that resulted from older standards for the electrical grid. While the cinema industry created their own standards with the only goal being cinematography, and they had much more freedom of choice regarding framerate. 60fps was never invented with the thought of manually controlling a camera.

The point is that even in an industry where they basically had free reign, framerate ended up being just another arbitrary compromise.

&gt;Explain to me the drawbacks of 60FPS vs 30FPS if we simply placed a cap on a game. (So, if we were to play God of War at 30 vs 60 with no visual quality change). I'm interested to hear this take.

This is an idiotic hypothetical, the main advantage of 30fps is that it allows for twice the amount of computing work per frame, hence drastically better visual quality. Regardless, there is still an advantage to 30fps, for SOME people, even at the same level of graphical detail. And that is related to the history of framerates.

As explained in the above comment, 24fps became the industry standard for movies, while television was 60Hz. Which means content produced for cinematic immersion has always been 24fps, while content produced for with television equipment has mostly been 60fps. That means sports, talk shows, soap operas, etc. Over time some higher quality productions became available for television and started using film, at a TV-friendly framerate of 30fps. They could have filmed those at 60fps, but they didn't, because film is fucking expensive.

This means that for as long as cinematic entertainment has existed, almost every production targeting cinematic immersion has been either 24 or 30fps, while every cheap TV program has been 60fps. This has a massive effect on some people's willing suspension of disbelief. For those people, looking at any content over ~40fps breaks their suspension of disbelief and therefore the cinematic immersion. it's not something that can be controlled, it's not something that can be mitigated by just watching more high framerate content. For the people affected, myself included, high framerate content *looks bad*. There's nothing that can be done about it. This has been dubbed the Soap Opera Effect.

So for the people affected by this, in games where cinematic immersion plays a significant role in their enjoyment of the game, 30fps looks better than 60fps.

What you need to understand is that there is more than one way to enjoy a video game. It's perfectly okay if your enjoyment of the game comes from the satisfaction of a responsive system that reacts immediately and smoothly to your inputs. I like this too, in some games.

But it is also perfectly okay for people to feel more enjoyment from the sheer satisfaction of looking at amazing graphics. And for some people, that feeling is severely impaired at 60fps due to the soap opera effect.

And on a more realistic level, games will NOT have the exact same graphical fidelity at 30 and 60fps. For those who prefer being wowed by graphics over being wowed by responsiveness, 30fps modes are better than 60fps modes because they look better, because the hardware can do twice as much work per frame.",1622505623

With Griffith the repression was self-imposed and gradually intensified over time as a copying mechanism. He’s “baring his soul” in this instance, which is visualised via his physicality. The fact Guts treated him as a regular human being drew Griffith to him. You’re right, Griff was perfectly fine with Guts getting the better of him, joking around. It’s one of the only instances where we see him laugh openly and genuinely. He often seems unreachable to others as an idealised figure, but scenes like this show his human side, that he too can be reached. 

It’s a bonding experience neither of them was able to have up until that point. The combination of this light-hearted, cheerful interaction and the ominous sense of dread we’re filled with when the behelit is shown is brilliant.

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

Brokerages will decide if they want to recall shares after GameStop reports there are too many out there. GameStop cannot even force brokerages to do that, they have to choose to.

Don’t expect anything til they announce how much of the float is owned. And even then, don’t freak out if brokers do not recall shares, because GameStop can do crypto dividend (my guess for what will happen), etc. in order to cause the squeeze.

"TwoBestFriendsPlay","t5_2uzei","The vanilla versions of Persona 4 and Kingdom Hearts 2.

For Persona 4 I hate how shuffle time is a random 50/50 chance of getting what you want because you'll end up it situations where you're struggling with grinding and try to encounter the one shuffle time card you need to heal or restore SP but you end up with the opposite effect, die, and going back to your last save.

The fox helps but it's also expensive which sucks when I'm trying to grind for money for new equipment.

Compared to Persona 3 where you have checkpoints and shuffle time is purely skill based or Persona 5 which has a huge list of quality of life features that make grinding faster and way more efficient.

KH2 is different because after I found the levels super empty and dull (still do honestly it's the only thing I still don't care for) as well as the lack of challenging endgame content always bummed me out compared to KH1 changing the enemy layouts in multiple levels and Introducing multi superbosses.

Both problems did get fixed in future versions however so that's good.",1622505625

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

I guess I am a 43 year old dweeby try hard and you all wouldn't like me either. There's a point in life where you just don't care what people think anymore though. I am pretty sure Beau is at that point. I appreciate that he is comfortable being himself. Just because other people don't think like him or me doesn't mean we think the way you do. I've always been shy and quiet, but when you find people that like and appreciate you get comfortable being your dorky self.

"AskOccult","t5_3jila","In my journey I sort of moved past the idea that “the devil ultimately works God’s will.” It’s kind of a weak excuse drummed up by Christians trying to defend God when he doesn’t need defending.

The truth I have found is that free will is the most important aspect of our natures. Angels also have free will. Still.

A much more rational argument is that God will be victorious even though... So, while Satan is an arch angel who comes and goes in heaven (per Job) his will is free and he can do as he pleases within certain boundaries.",1622505626

I was offered a job to be the shadow of a special needs kid, but unfortunately could not accept as I did not know if I could commit for two years minumum at the time. I regret not accepting, because it would have been a dream job. I am very good at relating to special needs people. I can do well at independent living and for the most part, my autism is not that visible to the casual observer. Your job sounds like a dream job.

"RedditReads","t5_33xfn","A startling and eye-opening look into America’s First Family, Never Caught is the powerful narrative of Ona Judge, George and Martha Washington’s runaway slave who risked it all to escape the nation’s capital and reach freedom.When George Washington was elected president, he reluctantly left behind his beloved Mount Vernon to serve in Philadelphia, the temporary seat of the nation’s capital, after a brief stay in New York. In setting up his household he took Tobias Lear, his celebrated secretary, and nine slaves, including Ona Judge, about which little has been written. As he grew accustomed to Northern ways, there was one change he couldn’t get his arms around: Pennsylvania law required enslaved people be set free after six months of residency in the state. Rather than comply, Washington decided to circumvent the law. Every six months he sent the slaves back down south just as the clock was about to expire.Though Ona Judge lived a life of relative comfort, the few pleasantries she was afforded were nothing compared to freedom, a glimpse of which she encountered first-hand in Philadelphia. So, when the opportunity presented itself one clear and pleasant spring day in Philadelphia, Judge left everything she knew to escape to New England. Yet freedom would not come without its costs.At just twenty-two-years-old, Ona became the subject of an intense manhunt led by George Washington, who used his political and personal contacts to recapture his property.Impeccably researched, historian Erica Armstrong Dunbar weaves a powerful tale and offers fascinating new scholarship on how one young woman risked it all to gain freedom from the famous founding father.",1622505628

It was no big deal and both of our fiances did not care if the other overshadowed one another- it's the engagement, not the wedding. Our weddings are going to be two and a half months apart which is also fine by all 4 of us. Honestly, I believe it just comes down to what type of people they are and what type of person your soon to be fiance is- are they more high maintenance type and likely to be upset/jealous/spiteful or low key go with the flow type of people? I honestly mean nothing bad by high maintenance- my fiance is like that with some things, but I knew she would not care when it came down to just asking the question.

For entry to neutralize the shooter.

2. California, San Jose.  May 2031, Valley transportation authority.  8 dead, Cops took 11 minutes to respond.
Oh, and a reminder this State is the strictest states to get a CCW let alone purchase a firearm with out it being in a illegal way.

[Nota Original](https://www.milenio.com/politica/avion-presidencial-regresa-a-california-para-mantenimiento) | Reducido en un 43.82% | 31.05.2021 14:27:35

*****

&gt; El avión presidencial partió esta mañana hacia el aeropuerto de Victorville, California, Estados Unidos, desde la Ciudad de México para recibir el mantenimiento que necesita periódicamente, confirmó el Secretario de Hacienda y Crédito Público (SHCP), Arturo Herrera.   

&gt; De acuerdo con el funcionario, el servicio de mantenimiento de la aeronave se adelantó con la finalidad de que sea utilizado en julio para trasladar a los atletas mexicanos a los Juegos Olímpicos que se llevarán a cabo en Japón.   

&gt; ""Eso estaba en el costo inicial y fue para mantenimiento y la idea de que entrara en el proceso de mantenimiento ahora es para que pueda regresar a finales de mes y en el se tiene hasta ahora programado trasladar a los atletas olímpicos a los juegos olímpicos de Tokyo, el tiempo estaba pensado para ello"", dijo.   

&gt; Según datos del sitio Flightradar 24, el TP-01 José María Morelos y Pavón realizó un vuelo de tres horas con 25 minutos a una altitud máxima de 38 mil pies de altura, partiendo desde la Ciudad de México hasta la terminal logística ubicada en el sur de California. 

&gt; Apenas el 19 de mayo, debido a que no se ha logrado vender la aeronave, el gobierno mexicano solicitó a la Oficina de las Naciones Unidas de Servicios para Proyectos ayuda para encontrarle comprador.

"libertarianmeme","t5_2te5l","Markets exist not only whether or not the state exists to extort wealth from them, but for concurrent purposes: Black markets, gray markets, controlled markets. The person taking tips and not reporting them as taxable income. The person who sells firearms or drugs in secret, in disregard of state laws. These market agents operate in the same universe which the 'law abiding taxpayer' lives in. They will continue to exist to serve a market demand even if the state loses influence, however their form will be conditioned by the lack of prohibition laws. They may shed stigma and gain reputation.

A transition to a stateless society is not the path towards a power vacuum, but a restoration of power to individuals previously held by authoritarians in a centralized model. 

No matter the situation, pursuing more liberty is the libertarian ethos here. You not liking pinkertons isn't an argument against libertarianism. Whatever hangups you have, whatever discomforts you're feeling, they're not going to be lessened through complacency to the state with any lasting assurances.

&gt;I’d rather get tread on by someone I can vote against than a warlord/corporation or rich person with pinkertons/church with an army.

What's kind of sad about this position is that it relies on a selfish assumption, because I can guarantee you that the deaths of innocent people through drone strikes and bombings are in fact materially consequential to the loved ones who survive them, and the people who order these actions are subservient to the politicians you have elected. We don't even need to talk about the politicians you haven't elected, but I see no reason to separate the two because voting endorses the result of the system, whether or not your candidate wins. You are supporting these actions via proxy.  When I trade liberty for security, or the perception that my interests are being looked after by politicians, I am neglecting my personal responsibility and giving up my ability to dissent or revoke the power. I lose the means to ethically deny my part in the atrocity.",1622505631

"EliteDangerous","t5_2vi60","&gt; Would you be content to see it crash and burn, get no more updates and eventually shut it's servers down in 2-3 years, or would you rather that the issues get fixed and development continues?

To be honest this comes off as a half-assed attempt to guilt-trip people voicing valid criticism. If Frontier's blatant mismanagement and incompetence culminate in the game slowly fading out into irrelevance until the servers shut down, it's *on them*. This company isn't a charity, they aren't your friends. They're selling an overpriced, deeply flawed product, which sales were boosted by very dishonest marketing. Not only that, most of these issues have been a consistent pattern for them since 2014, to varying degrees.

Of course a vast majority of people voicing criticism wish for this game to eventually improve and deliver something great. They're vocal *because* they care. But failing any sort of improvement on Frontier's part, and worse, actual **regression** in the quality of their product... There has to be significant pushback in response. 

&gt; Instead of doom-posting we should be productive

And that's the part where this post devolves into classic white knight rhetoric, with the usual sweeping statements about ""hyperbole"" or ""doom-saying"". Of course failing to include any conclusive examples of non-constructive behavior getting any actual traction on the sub, or any definition of where OP draws the line in that regard. All of it written in a patronizing tone. I've seen this countless times in gaming subs. 

Please understand this : a vast majority of critics have been constructive since Elite came out. That's over 6 years ago. Not only did Frontier's process not improve, it clearly got worse over time. They are out of touch. They are mismanaged. And now they can't even deliver on the technical aspects (visuals, optimization), which used to be their one saving grace. For all this to improve there needs to be  significant change. And for significant change to happen, there needs to be significant blowback from the playerbase.",1622505631

When you don’t know what to do, look the « Scenario » tab under the « requests » in the menu, there is indications about the main story and on going sub event.

**Seed Circle** is the ZL button:
- push: stop the enemy’s movement for a few seconds.
- hold button: charge the Seed Circle and you will connect with a monster, he will be your ally for 24 hrs (that doesn’t mean he is your friend).

**Orange Juice**: you should have received tons of orange juice in the three chests just outside the Seed Station (these « Newcomers gifts » were added in the day one patch). 

**To start cooking/crafting**, you need a license: talk to Eliza, select the license, and there will be a short test. After you pass it, you will be able to buy a forge, a crafting table, etc at Palmo workshop.

**Upgrading the clinic** will allow you to receive vaccinations that will give you special effects for 24 hrs. (Just like the medicinal bath at the inn). The 状態異常ワクチン vaccin will prevent poison, seal, paralysis and sleep for example.",1622505632

"RedditReads","t5_33xfn","In December 1972, Jean McConville, a thirty-eight-year-old mother of ten, was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders, her children clinging to her legs. They never saw her again. Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles. Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it. In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. McConville's children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress--with so many kids, she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes.Patrick Radden Keefe's mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war, a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with. The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children, but also I.R.A. members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland, and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war, but simple murders.Patrick Radden Keefe writes an intricate narrative about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussions.",1622505634

After the first few weeks I canceled everything. 

I don't like the subscription model. Buy a game to pay to play it? I get why that might make financial sense, but for me I couldn't get past it. Like, I already paid for the game. Why would I know pay per month indefinitely?

I don't like not being able to pause the game and come back to it. 

The new controls take some getting used to. 

FO76 is a fine game. I think you can now host a private sever to get rid of the hassle of randos killing / harassing you.

For example, there are the songs about a white womans Instagram and Calling your mom. These basically just play off all the same points everyone’s already heard of. “Oh my mom is bad with technology haha”. “Oh white women post this - good one”. It felt bland.

In comparison, previous songs like “break up” had a twist on our expectations. Or kill yourself, which was able to make some good points and do it in a very creative way.

"Mexico_News","t5_3afkf","### CJNG Cartel is hunting down police at their homes thanks to AMLO failed policies - Mexico Daily Post

[Nota Original](https://mexicodailypost.com/2021/05/31/cjng-cartel-is-hunting-down-police-at-their-homes-thanks-to-amlo-failed-policies/) | Reducido en un 62.27%

*****

&gt; The notoriously violent Jalisco cartel has responded to AMLO “hugs, not bullets” policy with a policy of its own: The cartel kidnapped several members of an elite police force in the state of Guanajuato, tortured them to obtain names and addresses of fellow officers and is now hunting down and killing police at their homes, on their days off, in front of their families.   

&gt; It is a type of direct attack on officers seldom seen outside of the most gang-plagued nations of Central America and poses the most direct challenge yet to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s policy of avoiding violence and rejecting any war on the cartels.   

&gt; We are coming for all of you,” reads a professionally printed banner signed by the cartel and hung on a building in Guanajuato in May   “For each member of our firm (CJNG) that you arrest, we are going to kill two of your Tacticals, wherever they are, at their homes, in their patrol vehicles,” the banner read, referring to the cartel by its Spanish initials.   

&gt; Officials in Guanajuato — Mexico’s most violent state, where Jalisco is fighting local gangs backed by the rival Sinaloa cartel — refused to comment on how many members of the elite group have been murdered so far.   

&gt; Between 2018 and May 12, a total of 262 police have been killed, or an average of about 75 officers each year — more than are killed by gunfire or other assaults on average each year in the entire United States, which has 50 times Guanajuato’s population.

The annual percentage rate (APR) of a loan is the total amount of interest you pay each year as a percentage of the loan balance.

For example, if the car loan has an APR of 10%, you might pay roughly $1000 annually per $10,000 borrowed, or if it's 2% you would pay roughly $200 per $10,000 borrowed. All other things being equal, the loan or credit product with the lowest APR is typically the least expensive.",1622505637

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Anesthetizing patients during a colonoscopy is less about it being uncomfortable (it is, and that's certainly a reason), and more about not having the patient moving around and squirming about during the examination. Both because it makes it really difficult to perform a good examination, and because of safety reasons- it's reasonably easy to damage the large intestine with the endoscope if you're not careful; and having a patient rolling around makes that a lot more likely. 

Another important reason is that you want to be able to take biopsies of polyps or other suspected lesions if they're observed. You don't want to do that with your patient being awake and aware.

EDIT: So, after doing a little more reading, this seems to be more of a 'contentious' topic than I initially thought. Looks like it's pretty common in the U.S., and less common elsewhere. There likely is a strong financial and/or litigious component to the increased use in the U.S.. And to head off anyone that sees that as a controversial statement; it really isn't; it's a pretty well understood and recognized issue. A huge number of differences in procedures or order of operations in management of patients (e.g. very early use of MRI for lower back pain in the U.S.) is not well supported by research, and is driven primarily by financial pressures, and the incredibly overbearing influence of the legal system on healthcare in the U.S.; basically that you can be sued for anything, at any time, and you have to spend far more time covering your arse, solely for the purpose of ensuring that you don't get sued, than your collogues in other countries would. 

[There's actually evidence] (https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085%2815%2901813-2/fulltext) that anesthesia can lead to increased risk with colonoscopies  (largely because anesthesia brings it's own list of potential complications).",1622505637

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I worked in a grocery store in HS and one night tidying shelves before closing, an older (40 or 50ish) man walked up and started talking to me. He was nice enough at first but quickly started asking if I lived close by, what time I'm off work, etc. I lied with every answer. Then I told him I'm only 16 (another lie, I was almost 18 but he was creeping me out), he smiled and said Oh that's okay. My daughter's about that age.

I made some excuse to leave the aisle, ran to my manager's office and watched him on the cameras, stalking other rows. Apparently he asked three other employees about where I might be.

My manager kicked him out at closing time and made two of the stock boys walk me to my car that night. I've never been so scared to leave work.",1622505637

"MensLib","t5_38jid","So my base art is a form of Japanese Jiu Jitsu but it's hit or miss with the quality of any school. Personally I'm a big fan of Judo and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, grappling comes more naturally to me and my refrigerator body type is suited for it. But really any of the mma arts like bjj, kickboxing, wrestling, etc will be safe for effectiveness but have a tendency to lack of the philosophical side (although mma turned Jiri Prochazka from a Czech street thug to a humble, respectful, and thoughtful athlete so I guess it defends), while the traditional styles like karate (but there's even more and less legit styles of karate itself) or taekwondo can lack effectiveness in training but promote the philosophical aspect much more. 

Really it depends on what's available in your area and what your son is interested in doing but generally I'd say a good place to start could be Brazilian Jiu Jitsu as it's very safe to practice, extremely effective for self defense against a single attacker, and there's very very few, if any, bullshit schools out there. But what's most important to look for is that the school is full of humble respectful instructors and that they do sparring and actually train the techniques with an actual resisting person. The hallmark of a McDojo (a fake school) is that they don't do sparring or live training and the instructor's are always on an ego trip about their art.

That's kind of my basic general advice for it. I can give you better advice with some more specifics about what he wants to get out of martial arts and what kind of martial artist he wants to be. 

Also feel free to message me in the future if you find a place but are wondering if it's a good place to learn, it can be hard to spot some of the mcdojos out there if you're not really knowledgeable on martial arts",1622505639

"moderatepolitics","t5_2s6h3","Every once in a while there is such a massive upheaval that one party loses its dominance in the two party system and is replaced. Most recently the Whigs got split over slavery and were replaced by the anti-slavery Republican party.  Though of course that was over 150 years ago.

Political realignments in the two-party system happen more these days when some faction within a party becomes dominant and essentially redefines the party's core values. It's quite fascinating to see when these realignments happen, and what issues drive them to happen. I'm guessing history is going to see the current realignment starting with the tea party movement and culminating in Trump's election victory.

If rappers can put out diss tracks in hours then yes, a Disney star can get into the studio and release a poorly written song and make a shitty directed video in two weeks. Olivia’s album came out so fast because Drivers’ License was such a huge hit and they wanted to capitalize on it. Olivia isn’t the only well marketed singer, Interscope took a lot out of Taylor and the kpop playbook when marketing her release, especially to maximize appeal to her target audience.

It hurts a lot of people on here to admit that they’ve aged out of gossip about certain things so it’s easier to write it off as PR or industry plants. (You can’t even be a mainstream pop star and an industry plant because labels are inherently going to invest a ton of money into making a pop act happen.

Although to be fair is was mixed up with quite a lot of other crackpot conspiracy theories at the time. You know, there's been quite a lot of it. Everything from birtherism right through to Q and Jewish moon lasers. It does get easy to just dismiss it all. 

If I stare into a pot and it's full of fingers and toes, in going to assume that every bit of that stew is human flesh and refuse to partake. It's a bit churlish to then say 'haha! This bit was actually pork!.'

But yeah, partisan thinking blinds people. Subjects become part of political identity. For instance, there's no reason that denying climate change should be right wing other than the PR companies that represented the oil industry in the 80's saw that republican leaning non-college educated men were suggestible in that area. Now it's become so much part of that identity, it's unshakeable. Same with the left and Palestine. It's political identity. It's difficult to think outside of narrow path we create for ourselves.

"audiophile","t5_2qmiy","Apologies for the formatting (mobile user).

This is my first deep dive into getting a pair of towers as a gift to myself for graduating college. I had visited the local hi-fi store looking for some floor standings several months ago, initially looking at the Klipsch RP-8000’s. The gentleman helping me, curse him, showed me these absolutely stunning Lumina IIIs and I had dreams about them for weeks after. 

The clarity and musicality is unmatched in this class of speaker. I had already had a Klipsch 5.1 satellite speaker set, but I wanted something a bit beefier for when I move out on my own. After finding some graduation money burning a hole in my pocket, I pulled the trigger and the rest is history. 

Some listening impressions: first off, I am by no means an expert audiophile with highly sensitive ears, but I could immediately tell the caliper of these beautiful machines upon first listen. The treble is crystal clear with the apex-dome damped tweeters, and midrange is musically dynamic. The soundstage is not huge in my current space, but they certainly get the job done. The only complaint is that the bass is a little lean, albeit very controlled. 

I also had the pleasure of listening to the Aidas and Olympica Nova Vs, both of which blow anything else out of the water. These speakers still maintain the same characteristics of those behemoths however, which in my mind makes me feel as though it was money well-spent. What these speakers do, they do incredibly well.

p.s. if anyone has any suggestions on a nice AVR stand for room to grow I am all ears! Cheers.",1622505640

"Sober","t5_2s8rw","I never thought I'd be someone who voluntarily gave up drinking. I'm not an alcoholic and don't have any horror stories, but I have little self-control. I have less after a few beers, so a few beers often turns into 'too many beers'. I'd been trying to cut back in my 30s because hangovers were getting worse, and drinking was less fun. 

Then last year I ended up in hospital. Not alcohol related. I was put on medication. It was safe to drink in small doses, but I was advised not to drink at all as any amount would affect the medication. I thought it'd be easier to stop completely, so I did.

And over time I found I looked better. I felt better mentally. I like who I am sober. I'm an embarrassing drunk. I had more creative energy too. And obviously I never woke up with a hangover. Four months in I was seriously considering never drinking again.

But once I was allowed to drink again, I did have a beer. I'd really been looking forward to it. I got my favourite beer in. And it was... just fine. Neither good nor bad. And then I felt sleepy and a little sick. It's just not enjoyable now, or at least not as enjoyable to be worth the consequences. Life is genuinely better without it.

I'm considering having the occasional glass of good scotch for special occasions, but I'm not sure what the point would be now. I've started getting into alcohol free beers --- and I love the feeling of cracking open a beer and taking a long cold sip. I can still have that, without the downsides.

I feel like a better person. Not in a smug, moral way. I just feel better about myself. More relaxed and comfortable with who I am. Proud of having the maturity and will-power to stop. I also like feeling in control of myself.

The big thing for me was Christmas. In the UK Christmas revolves around alcohol. Drinking champagne in the morning is normal. Beer and wine with lunch. It goes on from there. I'm a sleepy drunk, so I spent every Christmas sleepy and feeling a little sick. Getting through the day was a bit of a chore. I resented having to help with the food or do anything.
This as Christmas I couldn't drink. It's the first one I've properly enjoyed for years and years. That was when I first started thinking about becoming a non-drinker.",1622505641

It will have the original seven as its team. With the debut of Hal Jordan becoming Green Lantern as a subplot. Setting up his film in phase 2.

"Christian","t5_2qjy5","My ex emotionally and verbally abused me. He was in total control and I couldn't even see it at first (although my family did and they did not like him). He was never wrong about anything. He DID NOT love me as a husband is commanded to, but he was always quick to remind me I had to submit. Early in our marriage I asked him to go to counseling with me and he refused. Eight years later he became an alcoholic and wouldn't get help for it. He of course didn't see what had become. He usually kept his drinking to when the kids and I weren't around (he worked nights) so at first it wasn't an issue of safety for the kids and me. Then he got drunk one day and put a hole in a door. I was done. I had 2 young children to think of. Then, suddenly he wants to go to counseling. At first my plan was just to remain separated and if he changed his job and moved, I would move too so my boys could be near their dad. But then he disappeared and for 6 months we didn't even know where he was. Then I filed for divorce. He continued to have a tendency for violence when drunk. 20 years later he is finally sober, but who he is hasn't changed. Most of his family has basically disowned him, his sister had to call the cops on him when my boys and I were visiting her, and my younger son had to kick him out of his house for disrespecting his wife! He was a Christian when we got married and still professes to be, but he doesn't see any fault in himself so that God can help him change.

On the other hand, I had a boyfriend who slapped me once, but he was in counseling for severe depression, and he apologized after and never did it again (we were together 2 1/2 years). It just want in his nature to be like that--even when we argued he didn't yell.

Lastly, God can change people. I am proof. I used to have a very bad temper and I yelled a lot when angry. (I can remember a few instances where I really embarrassed myself.) I thought, well it's just the way I was born cause my mom and her younger sister were the same. But that didn't make it okay, and God eventually showed me that (or I guess it would be better to say I finally started listening) and I am totally different now.

I respect your desire to just separate and never remarry.

If you don't want counseling, then it sounds like your heart is completely hardened toward him. I was the same way. My ex had killed every last shred of caring and respect I had ever felt for him. I would encourage you to keep your heart open in case God does change him.

The key to the process is continuity. 

Now consider the possibility you extend your brain by connecting it to another brain. You learn to use both, eventually “you” is spread across two brains. Now turn the original off. 

Now consider that the connection between the brains doesn’t even need to be a physical one — it just needs to transfer information. It could be via a wireless connection.

I don’t see any problem transferring to a new body/vessel of some sort in this way. 

I would however never sign up to something that “transfers” consciousness without some serious continuity; I would consider that likely to be the death of “me”.",1622505642

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","I understand where you're coming from. Mutual and comparable effort in a relationship IS really important. However, posit this:

Women typically have longer hair than men. It takes a lot more time and effort to wash and keep healthy, moisturized, undamaged, etc. What if your girl expected you to grow out your hair because that was Her preference and what She found to be significantly more attractive and because she wanted you to put just as much effort into your appearance and she does. Do you see the issue here?

And you might say that women's body hair to men's head hair are not analagous, but really they are. If you find yourself unable to find someone as attractive / arousing / sexy because of something about their appearance, that's valid. But it's virtuous to try to reduce those preferences as much as possible. She's not asking you to have sex with her when she's two weeks unshowered. How we feel about women's body hair is almost entirely manufactured (by the media, etc.) and most people are fully capable of shifting how they feel about it. 

And trying to achieve ""equal effort"" in this situation is a foolish endeavor, as demonstrated by that analogy--yes, partners should put effort into pleasing each other, and that means trying to meet your partner's preferences, but what someone is comfortable with / feels best about doing with their body supercedes anyone else's preferences, whether that be head hair or body hair. No one's saying she shouldn't prefer long hair, but everyone gets that it would be ridiculous to expect it.

Edit: Same when it comes to makeup. It would be ridiculous to expect a girl to wear makeup, just as it would be ridiculous for her to expect a boy to wear makeup, right? Even if it was a significant preference. You can talk about your preferences and ask for them or suggest them but to not accept No, to expect it, is a very much flawed perspective.",1622505643

I also would point out that as a medical student, we now are required to have intense training around nutrition as relates to both pathologic states as well as obesity and diabetes! 

I would say for the future - display more restraint before putting these opinions out there without the foundational knowledge requried to understand context of these complex biochemical/nutriotional problems.

For your reference, starvation mode is more mainstream/colqiual understand of simply fasting hypoglycemia. In overwieght patients, it is simply an issue that these patients need to increase fiber intake. Bringing blood sugar levels in greater control will improve weight loss goals. The logic being that the hormonal response to hypoglycemia (mainly increased glucagon with a small balance from GH) superimposed by a postprandial spike in glucose can lead to greater lipogenesis than would have occured otherwise. Thus, obese patients (especially diabetics - but this has been proven to helpthe larger population though issues around the confounding effects of ghrelin/leptin are still debateble) have been found that it is helpful to avoid ""starvation mode"" aka severe fasting hypoglycemia followed by dense caloric meals.

Minimal work required to raise them back in the day when they were chained up inside for 15 weeks then slaughtered. The milking business requires that the cows are constantly giving birth to keep milk production. Recently there are other ""synthetic"" ways to keep dairy cows producing without needing to give birth.

The industry has become much more kind and humane, but (no more steroids since mid 2000s, that shit was crazy... I poked myself many times with steroid injection needles as a teenager trying to administer the shot to a rambunctious calf) as all animal husbandry goes, there are bad people making it worse. That said, veal is a declining industry. My farm and about a dozen others in the area have gone out of business, including the big supplier we all contracted for.

Source: was a veal farmer as a kid.


Edit: I had maybe a dozen or more of the number 7s come through my farm over the years. We named them all number seven.

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

We're really excited that you posted, but it had to be removed because it violated Rule 2 - our rules are what keep LBGW one of the top-visited NSFW sites on Reddit, so we need to ensure that our hot post providers always follow them.

Here is a good way to make sure you are following the rules:

Rule 2 means that all posts must contain at least half your face. We must clearly be able to see some of your features! 
I.e. (eyes and nose)/(nose and mouth)/(eyes and mouth). 

This means that we DO NOT allow text-only posts. All posts must contain at least one image which fulfills rule two.

If you read [https://lagen.nu/2012:978](https://lagen.nu/2012:978)

&gt;Denna lag gäller hyresavtal som avses i 12 kap. 1 § jordabalken, genom vilket någon utanför näringsverksamhet upplåter en bostadslägenhet för annat än fritidsändamål. Lagen gäller dock inte upplåtelse av en hyresrätt i andra hand. Om fler än en lägenhet upplåts, gäller lagen endast den första upplåtelsen.

That google translate turn into

&gt;This Act applies to rental agreements referred to in Chapter 12. § 1 of the Land Code, by which someone outside a business leases a residential apartment for other than leisure purposes. However, the law does not apply to the subletting of a tenancy. If more than one apartment is leased, the law only applies to the first lease. 

The relevant part is ""outside a business"" and ""if more than one apartment is leased, the law only applies to the first lease. ""

So if your landlord runs it as a company it does not apply. Even if it is not a company it only applies to hist the first lease.
So if he is the landlord to the one that lives above you to the 1 monthly limit does not apply to you if they lived there before you.

I might read the law incorrectly but when I read the article linked below it says the same thing.

I never really saw it as a modern perspective being inserted into the story as the essay suggests; it’s really more of a smallfolk perspective, and the parallel here isn’t “modern vs medieval” but “lord/king vs peasant”.

The game was actively detecting that the only ""pointing device"" was a touchpad, and refusing to let the player go ingame unless they plugged in a real mouse.

Virtualization is the most common method, if the executables and resources can't be ran directly. Since the new consoles are basically bog standard x86_64 PC's, they can run executables made for the last generation, just make sure the API is fully implemented. Original Xbox emulation works because the Xbox One is so much more powerful than the original.

Considering that Nintendo likes to use... Unique, hardware choices, I wouldn't bet too hard on backwards compatibility. The only reason the Wii had it was entirely due to the fact that it literally had the original gamecube hardware in it. The Wii U was just barely powerful enough to run Wii games iirc, and struggles to play Gamecube games.

This is why emulation is important, and why we should continue to support the development of projects like Yuzu. If Nintendo can't preserve their games for the next generation, **we** need to.",1622505649

"LSD","t5_2qhvj","It's not likely to get any more legal outside of a therapy context any time soon (and not holding my breath on that one either, though it / similar efforts are in the works / have passed in some states) that I'm aware of, though I always seem to get surprised hearing about pot or mushroom decrim / legalization legislation passing.

I will certainly tell you that if you end up enjoying it, and only find that out after waiting years to try it for the first time after it's legal (if that ever happens), you will want those years back, I turned down pot for years around personal issues and the legality of it (anti-social / emotional issues / wasn't sure how I'd react on it around other people / didn't want any legal attention), and after some found it's way to me to try in private, I loved it / was fine on it. Similar with LSD, I didn't seek it out thinking I didn't need the social or legal hassle enough to try it, then a hookup found it's way into my life, and I took to it enough / it helped me with my personal issues enough that I wish I'd sought it out back in high school a couple of decades ago.

As long as you can drop your anxiety around doing an illegal drug, I'd say go for it.

"dontstarve","t5_2v1jr","I feel like the ability to give your minions to someone a little less fragile could be really interesting as far as gathering goes. I don’t know if calling him the second best gatherer is really fair, since both him and Woodie are situationally better for different circumstances (I generally prefer Woodie, but he’s one of my mains so I really can’t place him first in an unbiased fashion). But the ability to give someone like Wendy or Walter the minions sounds absolutely amazing. Wendy could easily and automatically protect the workers as they chop/mine while she picks up the resources, and Walter can quickly get to distant areas to clear out biomes without having to worry as much about travel time and the like. 

The idea of a shadow clone likewise sounds super intriguing. One could almost treat their normal body like the merm king, giving them access to food and fuel for fire/lantern every so often, and then Maxwell can just sit amidst some statues indefinitely. It saves you from the cost of dying and the ability to easily heal with nightmare fuel (which is trivially easy to obtain stacks of), in exchange for decreased inventory space. Not horribly imbalanced, and still quite useful. Plus you have possibilities for interesting basing/exploration balance; you can be with your team out and about fighting a boss or something with your clone, and the real Maxwell can be at base doing chores. I’d definitely be interested in this kind of addition in the rework.",1622505650

There are two major players in the VCM deactivation game from what I’ve seen. What I bought is an [S-VCM controller](https://www.svcmcontroller.com/) from Canada. From what I’ve read, the guy who ships them is very helpful with returning questions and the device comes with a warranty.

The other major option is [VCMTuner](https://www.vcmtuner.com), the latest version of which is VCMTuner II. Users of both have spoken highly of their effectiveness.

As you may know, both operate by overriding the car’s engine temperature readout relayed through the computer. They “tell” the computer that the engine is below the minimum operating temperature for VCM activation, preventing the system from coming on. S-VCM has a failsafe on board which allows the computer to notify the driver if the engine in fact begins to overheat, and will stop overriding the temperature readout, thus allowing the engine to return to fully normal operation. I don’t know much about VCMTuner, mainly because S-VCM seemed to be the easier install and VCMTuner does not currently ship to California, where I live. Their website says the Tuner II also features the temperature failsafe.

I have to take my ‘17 in to a dealership tomorrow to get a headlight assembly replacement, so I’ve held off on installing the device. My car still has a little bit of time left on the power train warranty, and I don’t want to do anything to upset Honda. Once it’s in and I’ve compared driving with it to how my car operates now, I’ll update. Other users here have said that it does make a huge difference in responsiveness overall, I guess I’ll just see if it’s enough to my liking. Otherwise a throttle body spacer is next.",1622505651

It is impossible for them to known our list of preferences and provide us with the marginal product of the next unsatisfied need.

This is not correct. There are all sorts of cases in market institutions where goods and services won't meet standard conditions of allocative and / or productive efficiency. It's true that one cannot immediately infer that states *will in fact* better approximate those efficiency conditions, but it's plainly false that they *cannot in principle* better approximate them. It's ultimately an empirical question whether some good or service will be more efficiently provided by public or market institutions in any particular case, though there is of course a strong *presumption* that markets will generally be more efficient.",1622505651

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

"headphones","t5_2rcyx","To go over the gain vs amp issue I will refer to [this](https://www.musicianonamission.com/gain-vs-volume/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20Gain%20Vs%20Volume,-So%20remember%3A%20gain&amp;text=Volume%20is%20how%20loud%20the,the%20channel%20or%20amp%20is.) article about this difference between gain and volume. Gain happens in the pre amp before the amp does it's thing, amps add volume after it's done it's thing. This can mean gain has a real effect on the sound of your system. So at the end the 5 watts will be made differently depending on how and when voltage was added. 

So in this case the amp matters as it changes what gain stage I'm using, therefore changing the sound.

Gain before the amp changes how the voltage interacts with the amp. This is also why tubes can still work with planars like these as tubes in the gain stage like stated above add voltage before the amp changing the sound and how it plays with it. As the preamp does not send power to the drive but the amp does tubing a pre amp will have no downsides to the driver as all it does is change what the amp gets.
*I say no downsides as I like tube sound. If you don't like tube sound it just adds distortion and other bad things. But I am a subjective listener rather than an objective listener so it works for me.",1622505653

"Mexico_News","t5_3afkf","### CJNG Cartel is hunting down police at their homes thanks to AMLO failed policies - Mexico Daily Post

[Original Source](https://mexicodailypost.com/2021/05/31/cjng-cartel-is-hunting-down-police-at-their-homes-thanks-to-amlo-failed-policies/)

*****

 &gt; The notoriously violent Jalisco cartel has responded to AMLO “hugs, not bullets” policy with a policy of its own: The cartel kidnapped several members of an elite police force in the state of Guanajuato, tortured them to obtain names and addresses of fellow officers and is now hunting down and killing police at their homes, on their days off, in front of their families.

&gt; It is a type of direct attack on officers seldom seen outside of the most gang-plagued nations of Central America and poses the most direct challenge yet to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s policy of avoiding violence and rejecting any war on the cartels.

&gt; We are coming for all of you, ”reads a professionally printed banner signed by the cartel and hung on a building in Guanajuato in May“ For each member of our firm (CJNG) that you arrest, we are going to kill two of your Tacticals, wherever they are, at their homes, in their patrol vehicles, ”the banner read, referring to the poster by its Spanish initials.

&gt; Officials in Guanajuato - Mexico’s most violent state, where Jalisco is fighting local gangs backed by the rival Sinaloa cartel - refused to comment on how many members of the elite group have been murdered so far.

&gt; Between 2018 and May 12, a total of 262 police have been killed, or an average of about 75 officers each year - more than are killed by gunfire or other assaults on average each year in the entire United States, which has 50 times Guanajuato's population.

I was also watching Suspiria (Argento's version) which honestly may or may not be relevant insofar as triggering events go. After that, they came on extra suddenly and without any sort of obvious trigger. Sometimes while at work or even just driving.

For what its worth, I found getting into flow states help considerably at avoiding the issue of focusing in on the DP. So like doing things that require active participation like work, video games, or excercise with some chill music to avoid wandering thoughts.",1622505654

"saintcloud","t5_2slv3","Depends on what you are looking for but I just don't agree with the comparisons many are making. If st cloud were all alone it would lose out to most other towns. I'm from the Fargo area and it is a little bigger and gets lots of bigger name events, culture, nice downtown etc. However st cloud still wins out for me because of it's central location in the state on i94 and highway 10 an hour from Minneapolis with very low cost of living. I can get my fill of all the stuff missing in st cloud and much more by travelling a little bit. I love Duluth and usually go there about twice a year. I see Duluth more as a great place to visit not to live. It's funny because if I lived in Duluth I probably wouldn't go to st cloud but I still think st cloud is a better place to live because it's more complicated than 1 town vs another.

Also they really crammed the retail in west st cloud there is just restaurants and stores everywhere it's very convenient but it can cause some traffic like others mentioned.",1622505654

The only other issue you might have as the tomatoes get large is less light will get through but with good soil the lettuce should find its way up to correct that....I don’t listen to many gardening rules, 
I just experiment and so far it’s been a good method for me. I’ve got a cherry tomato plant growing with 2 broccoli and 2 cauliflower packed in a 2 foot by 3 foot bin. Tomato is supposed to be a bad idea to plant with both of those and none of mine are having any issues, everything is MASSIVE lol and starting to flower and produce.

Up for sale is my Mondaine Stop2go Swiss Railway Watch.    
Unique features: The Stop to go movement mimics that of the railway clocks used throughout Switzerland where the second hand takes one trip around dial in 58 seconds and stops for two seconds before the minute hand advances at exactly the start of the next minute.  It also has a pretty cool backlight lume which works well with the bright white. See the [album](https://imgur.com/a/hi2k4YG) for illustration of both of these features.

I've enjoyed this watch, but not really found the opportunity to wear it much, so it is pretty close to new condition.  Purchased in 2019 from Mondaine, and crown pulled to stop the movement when not worn (to save some battery).

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;First, we’re not Canada. We’re in no way obliged to follow their model, so I’m not certain why they were brought into the conversation.

Who said we're ""obliged""? I raised Canada's ID requirements because the Texas requirements are a whole lot more stringent.

&gt;The process for obtaining government documents such as birth certificates, social security cards, etc is well documented.

Being well-documented isn't the issue. Getting a copy of one's birth certificate and getting a new social security card are bloody pains in the ass, often times taking months, especially the birth certificate if one was born in the early-'80s or prior since those aren't stored digitally but are on microfiche.

&gt;That’s why most (if not all) states requiring ID provide for a free ID to those without the means to pay.

Did you read the article that I posted? It states that:

&gt;It is true that many states with these voter ID stipulations do, in fact, help the ID-less out by providing specially made photo identification cards free of charge. A huge problem with that, however, is that they are actually not free. To get most state-issued voter ID cards, people are still required to produce documents including birth certificates or social security cards, which can cost quite a bit to obtain if you don’t have these documents. Many elderly African Americans who were born in the Jim Crow South, when hospitals often refused black patients, don’t have these otherwise common forms. Add in the costs of traveling to a DMV office (if your community even has one) to get an ID card, and you suddenly might be paying more to vote than black people were charged under the Jim Crow-era poll tax system. That’s no good for people living on low income or fixed wages.

....

&gt;I have a right to a firearm, I do not ask that the state provide one for me (thought do have to provide ID to obtain one, as well as fill out a rather intrusive form).

Really? You're comparing the right to vote to  the right to own a firearm? Really? The last time I checked, exercising one's right to vote didn't kill anyone. In regard to being able exercise one's right to vote and participate in our democracy, the government, at all levels, should be bending over backwards in order to ensure that eligible voters are able to vote with as few barriers as possible. They should be aggressive in making sure that every eligible voter has everything they need to vote and should also be aggressive in encouraging eligible voters to vote. It should almost be more difficult for eligible voters not to vote than to exercise that right.",1622505655

"HilariaBaldwin","t5_3hq52e","As a teacher, I'm especially concerned about the oldest/eldest child (pick your grammar rule).  That poor child is absorbing more and bearing more than any child should have to absorb and bear.  Believe me, she already knows ""my family is weird.""  And if she doesn't, it will be pointed out to her in no time by other kids.  She sees that her Dad is really old and other dads aren't.  She sees that her mom is not like other moms--and not in a good way.

The twins things is bizarre, but par for the course considering this bizarre, funhouse family.  ""Twins"" is harmless; it deflects from ""I'm so mentally ill I was pregnant with 1 child and had a surrogate implanted with another a few months later.  The babies' needs mean nothing to me.""

The pajamas in the firehouse pic are failed parenting, period.  Adults in our society wear clothes.  If he does not learn to accept clothing, he will have NO adult life.  Long after Alec is gone, this child will suffer as an adult.  Society will shame and reject him.  The oldest daughter will bear the brunt of caring for him.  Great job, Alec.  

I see so much abuse and neglect in these pictures.  I don't care how rich you are; to objectify your children has horrific, long-term consequences.  Teachers see the results all day, every day.  Give us a child with stable, married parents who are roughly of the same age, who seek nothing but good manners and a good education for their children, and we can teach that child anything.  Children of egocentric or narcissistic parents (most of Hollywood)?  They're doomed and history proves me right.",1622505655

The thing i enjoy the most is that instead of changing characters, your character changes disguises (abilities).   Every other lego game the extra characters in your party are controlled by AI and sometimes the AI is not the best. You'll come to a door that requires an ability, go to change characters, and end up across the map because the AI chose not to follow you. In Lego Cities you always play the same guy and switch abilities. Its a small variant but made a huge difference for me.

"ChoosingBeggars","t5_35fmc","I think this conversation has run its course. I entuned with what is going on in the babysitting world since I use them regularly, and have for years. You're going off what others have told you or what you're reading from random folks on the internet. You saw on sittercity that there were countless people offering their services for $10/hour. That is the market rate. Again, you can post something worthless on ebay for $10,000. It does not make the market value of that worthless thing $10,000. People can post their hourly rates at obscene values, but that does not make that the going rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

The original post was not really showing a beggar because they were willing to pay the market rate, or perhaps more than the market rate. Even the OP said she would negotiate. So maybe the $30 would become $20. And that is realistic. $30 is not. I'm sure there are small pockets where that figure would be possible, but it's not the norm. And what's funny is now the OP has lost out on making money from that job. And she even said she didn't want to work three days in a row (LOL) so I don't know how serious she is about this babysitting gig. Yeah, lots of assumptions, but I just had to laugh when I first saw the post because it's not indicative of the real world. 

If I really had that much time to waste I would go on sittercity, message a dozen people with the same scenario as in the OP and offer $15 and see how many would bite. I would bet the vast majority. When the federal minimum wage is $7.50 an hour and people in the business of taking care of kids (teachers, daycares, babysitters, etc.) get paid crap there aren't going to be many holdouts for $30/hr. Trust me, I'm an expert.",1622505658

"LabiaplastySurgery","t5_3lurmd","From my experience, this situation would be really impossible. My surgery was under local anesthesia so I was home within a few hours, but I wasn't walking normally until 2-3 weeks afterwards and it was VERY noticeable. I'm almost 10 years older than you and live alone, but I wanted to avoid telling my mom too: I had a medical issue and non-elective surgery earlier this year which she had to help me through, so I didn't want to stress her out over me having elective surgery. I ended up having to see her about a week after surgery and I had to lie and said I hurt my ankle since my weird walk was so noticeable. If I was living with her or anyone, I definitely would have had to tell her/them. Can you share why you don't want to tell your mom? It worries me that you're not allowed out for long periods of time. Like another poster said, you should consider what would happen if she found out.

You really can't get out of bed or move much the first week (and it's not a ""recommended"" thing—you really, physically can't). In addition to walking, I couldn't sit normally either for 2-3 weeks. (I had to do a video interview for work at one point during the healing process and simply perching on a chair was super tough.) You're going to feel really awful and there's no hiding it. I had to ice myself CONSTANTLY literally up until week 5 to bring down the swelling, so you'll be pulling ice packs out of the freezer basically every 30 minutes, too, as well as having to stash a peri bottle (basically a spray bottle you use to rinse yourself each time you use the bathroom). Also, I definitely didn't have the financial means to do this surgery at 19 (but congrats to you if you do!).

I really want to encourage you to take just a little more time to think about this. Read through some of the experiences here and don't be shy about DM'ing people—everyone here is really friendly and kind! Maybe if you haven't already, start doing some research on the surgeons in your area and perhaps make an appointment for a consultation. You can ask them directly about aftercare instructions and healing time, and get pricing info. Please be honest with them about your situation. If you're not at that point yet, maybe bring up the fact that you're considering this surgery with your gynecologist at your next appointment. They may be able to share some insights or advice as well. Good luck!",1622505659

Then if you are under 40, get out now if you are in any type of field that is not specific to the military.

Most of the time contractors are the ones working when federal employees are told not to work, since the money for them get allocated in other sources.  Yes there are possibilities of a contract not being renewed or lost and that the government decided to do away with your position or contract.  The solution to that is to plan for it and have an emergency fund.  

If you are a good worker and know your field it is generally not hard to get on a new contract.  If you are not and just skate along then stay a federal employee.

$17K is low unless you are getting near the same benefits as afederal employees.

I spent around 1/2 my carrear as federal employee and 45% as defense contractor with the rest working in non-government related jobs.    Came back to federal employee because of the stupid in-source garbage and for family reasons wanted to stay at the location.  I would switch back to defense contractor now but I am near retirement and as a federal employee  it is acceptable to slip into a semi-retired status compared to being a contractor.",1622505660

As a highish A2 so much of it is constantly feeling like an idiot child (for me anyway) so that extra little bit of personal comfort matters. Which is not to say the other teachers made me feel bad or anything, on the contrary they’ve all been completely supportive and encouraging – but for whatever reason having that extra bit of interpersonal connection has an effect for me.

We're really excited that you posted, but it had to be removed because it violated Rule 2 - our rules are what keep LBGW one of the top-visited NSFW sites on Reddit, so we need to ensure that our hot post providers always follow them.

Here is a good way to make sure you are following the rules:

Rule 2 means that all posts must contain at least half your face. We must clearly be able to see some of your features! 
I.e. (eyes and nose)/(nose and mouth)/(eyes and mouth). 

This means that we DO NOT allow text-only posts. All posts must contain at least one image which fulfills rule two.

1. Delete this current thread.
2. Copy the URL of the Reddit thread you are trying to crosspost.
3. [Go to the submission page](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/submit) and paste the URL of the thread.
4. You are now done. Sit back and reap the karma.

Note that this subreddit does not currently have crossposting enabled.

##If you are trying to submit a Wikipedia link:

Try submitting the *Wikipedia* or *Wikimedia commons* link instead of the raw file. A quick look at the URL should confirm this. Compare the following links:

* **Link A:** https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Minard%27s_Map_%28vectorized%29.svg
* **Link B:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization#/media/File:Minard%27s_Map_(vectorized).svg
* **Link C:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Minard%27s_Map_(vectorized).svg

Take a look at Link A. That is just the image, and is the same issue with hotlinking an article image from a website; there is no context. Now look at Link B. There is a lot of enriching information, e.g. copyright license, author, source, and even a link to the revision history. The same is the case with Link C. In the ideal case, **the B or C examples are the acceptable links.**

---

##If you made the image yourself:

...then you probably just forgot to add `[OC]` to the title. Simply follow the steps below:

1. Delete this current thread.
2. [Resubmit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/submit?sidebar&amp;title=Title%20your%20visualization%20but%20keep%20the%20closing%20tag%20%5BOC%5D#btn) your thread with the phrase `[OC]` somewhere in the title.
3. AutoModerator will send you a private message instructing you how to cite your post. **Follow instructions carefully.**
4. If you have done everything correctly, /u/OC-Bot will be along shortly to reward you with [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/flair#wiki_oc_flair), and sticky your citations.

Please note that you may **only tag a post as OC if and only if you made it yourself.** We are very strict about [plagiarism](/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/rules/rule3) in this subreddit. **No, screenshots of someone else's apps do not count.**

"realestateinvesting","t5_2qnt1","I did some research on the topic but I’m not an expert. One thing to keep in mind are zoning regulations and permits. Most jurisdictions require a permit to operate a short term rental. Also in most cities you can’t operate one in residentially zoned areas (you will not be issued a permit for the property). You will be subject to hotel taxes as well in addition to VRBO or AirBnB’s cut.

You may have to hire a property manager too because you will not be in the area yourself. Someone will need to clean the place, change the linens, address issues etc. Also, the place will need to be fully furnished and have good amenities, which can cost a pretty penny. In any decent area, there is a lot of competition with other short term rentals and hotels.

After considering all of the above, I decided against the idea of doing short term rentals. Certainly buying a property solely to do short term rentals seems like a bad idea for me personally. It does make sense if you happen to already own a home that is in an attractive location.

The people I know who run AirBnBs already owned their homes and moved out to a different location and kept their homes to be used as AirBnBs.

Another thing to keep in mind is that there is an increasing backlash against short term rentals in many areas. Residents are not happy that they are decreasing the supply of local housing and driving up rents etc. They don’t like tourists coming to their quiet neighborhoods and having loud parties, which they often will because they are on vacation.",1622505662

My wording could have definitely been better and avoiding 'colourful' language would have been the way to go.

**What I forgot to include and should have is that it's a vicious cycle that feeds itself and yes fans and idols are part of it. The idols, the fans... who's pressuring who?** (I wanted to use another metaphor with animals-- But it can be avoided.)

I'm still in shock tbh. The 'Don't compare them to animals' seriously shocked me. 'Who did I compare to an animal?!!' was my immediate thought. What I meant, however incomplete and flawed, was completely tainted by the metaphor alone.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","I think the point is that the federal government actively suppressed the ability for doctors to treat early (like forcing pharmacies to not fill scripts for drugs on a protocol) which forced people to get sick enough to go to the hospital. A lot of deaths could have been prevented if the federal health organizations didn't suppress the ability for doctors to treat early with drugs that have been around a long time and drugs they're knowledgeable on when it comes to risks and doses. After suppressing early treatment , they come out and push the vaccine for literally every person, most of which weren't in their initial 2 month trial. It's abnormal to push a vaccine or drug or a populous indiscriminately without proven safety data. His only assumption is that there must be a nefarious plot by the federal and global health organizations because there's no logical reason why they're doing what they're doing and it's unprecedented and dangerous to people. You may not die, but that's not the point. There is no way to know if you will have adverse reactions or severe enough reactions to cause permanent harm or death. We know these side effects can happen, but there is no data or proper screening to truly know who is at risk and who isnt and why. You're forcing people to choose to gamble their life with no one being responsible for what happens or go to college, school, or have a job (in some cases). All this for a disease he has first hand knowledge is treatable and doesn't have to be a death sentence for those who are most vulnerable.

They have enough gerrymandered districts in swing states that they control the state houses that make the state election rules.  And the Supreme Court that is supposed to fix those unconstitutional gerrymandered districts... well Republican Mitch McConnell refused to allow Barack Obama to fill two empty seats.  He obstructed and delayed until Trump was elected, so Republicans could fill the court with their guys.

So the party that represents less Americans has been really good at rigging the system in their favor.

We're actually in complete agreement about the toxicity and danger of those communities.

The targeting thing is a personal interpretation. Latitude's banned words inhibit and exclude descriptions of women's bodies (small breasts, petite figures), breastfeeding, and they portray non-con as an aggressive male fantasy when it actually is most common in women (as well as rape survivors). Turning the topic of rape into ""respect"" was humiliating and insulted the dignity and gravity of the topic. It's as if Latitude has tried to deal with sexism, racism, pedophilia, etc by simply erasing the people. And a lot of the kink erasing they're doing has a similar effect on certain parts of the lgbtq community.",1622505666

"3d6","t5_2wkux","Identify, Tenser's Floating Disk, Alarm, Sanctuary, and Unseen Servant all seem like the closest thing for ""honest merchant"" 1st level spells. Out of these, I think Tenser's Disk, Sanctuary, and Unseen servant are probably the best options as they're less situational/can be reliably used most of the time.

If you don't mind going up to 2nd level spells (and don't mind dunamancy, which I'm assuming you're fine with based on GoA), Wristpocket seems like a fun one. It basically lets you hide an object you're holding for up to an hour in an extradimensional space. Maybe toeing the line a bit in terms of honest merchant, but I think any merchant could find use in this particularly when it comes to the valuables (hiding a much bigger coinpurse while having a dummy, or hiding one super valuable item, in case of being robbed or inspected).

Other 2nd level spells might include Animal Messenger and Arcane Lock, as well as Nystul's Magic Aura and Fortune's Favor, although the last two are a little more hazy on the ""honest"" part (although either definitely has use). 2nd level spells tend to be stronger, but most of these are either situational, relatively weaker, or have a costly material component in the case of Fortune's Favor, and when combined with the fact that detect magic is one of the most used spells in the game I could see an entity such as this Merchant of Magic evaluating the deal as fair.",1622505667

That scene where chainsaw guy monologs about the dead bodies with the same clothing/jewelry in the vault being them stuck in some time loop is 100% going to be how Snyder brings them back.

I just finished this monstrosity and had to go look at just what the hell was going on. Snyder is gleefully asking reporters if they saw the robot zombie (yeah Zak it wasn’t exactly subtle) his producer/wife is saying things like “maybe it is aliens”. Zak also recounted how he riffed on the sequel and his co-writer(?) just replied with “OK’. I think this whole exercise is Zak saying “and then …” and throwing in whatever genre tickles his fancy.",1622505667

"preppers","t5_2riow","Very good idea.

I have very limited construction experience and maybe some advice is way overkill, so do your own research.

If you can, hire an structural engineer and be very very wary of whatever the contractors may say. Don't trust them to do it right. Verify the strength of the mix used and be extra insane with the vibration process. Check the rebar fastenings too.

There are companies that rent modular metallic forms.

Use hydraulic cement, is resistant to water and lasts a lot longer because slows rust forming in the rebars.

Don't skimp on rebar nor the size of the columns and walls.

Go for a full cage rebar reinforcement. Because of flying debris.

At least 2 exits, is better but expensive.

Build a full bathroom.

Build a water resevoir below.

2 or 3 separate dormitories.

2 or 3 separate and independent ventilation systems.

Build it in steps along the years.

Foundations must be calculated according to the local soil characteristics.

Better to have thick walls and shitty decor.

If you can avoid the trap of having any pipes, tubing, conduit etc running inside your walls, or God forbid inside the columns.

Monolithic domes are the best shape to resist winds and impacts. Buy a bit pricey and not really bunker minded.

And above all don't let looks get in the way of function.

Don't let them pour the slab upon the bare dirt and rebar big nono. Don't let them skimp on the separation between the outer sides  of the concrete and the rebar reinforcement inside, don't go for the minimum separation go for the maximum. There are special tiny bricks  that attach to the rebar and guarantee proper separatiob  This helps to seal the concrete away from the water and greatly extends the life cycle of the building. If they fail to do this water will reach the iron and you'll get corrosion and spalling wich can go hidden for a long time.

Remember the roman roads, proper foundations make for almost indestructible structures, but if you mess the foundation you can lose a lot of money.

Contractors like to water the concrete because it's easier to work and they will try to convince you that it doesn't matter. It does. Don't pay for some heavy duty concrete only for somebody to water it down. With enough added water you can turn bunker grade concrete into plaster.

Gotta go, best of lucks and extra kudos if you do it yourself. Feel free to ask anything else I love concrete and the prepping mindset.",1622505668

Not saying the PSU was bad quality, but a surge or power sent to ground can cause components to explode in spectacular fashion, and won't always show any obvious signs on the PSU. 

My main point was to make sure to test the PSU with a PSU tester, or using an old board that you don't care about, before you try it with a replacement board, just in case it was the PSU. Seasonic is definitely quality, but individual QC failures can occur, and bad components happen, so I just want to make sure you don't torch another board if it happens to be the PSU.",1622505668

She’s a self righteous, un-selfaware and deeply selfish person and the way she is portrayed in the show makes the fact that Jamie is so in love with her unbelievable half the time.  From my standpoint, she’s not at all even likable. MAJOR peeve with what otherwise is a fantastic show, ruined by Claire Fraser and later the almost equally frustrating character of her daughter Bree. Smfh.",1622505669

There are bad actors everywhere. And call me paranoid, but it just seems like the perfect opportunity to set some new investors up for a rug pull. I have been DCAing ERGO since the 5 dollar region, but I'm just feeling super cautious about a coin getting *this much* attention from our sub. 

The fact that ERGO has a post in the top three on our subreddit is worrisome and new investors should take caution and buy in increments. We have so so many new people here. It's insane how big this group has gotten. And it has a good rep for giving advice that some people may want to take advantage of. 

Don't get me wrong please. For a long time I have defended ADA and supported the project and Alex and ERGO were on my radar as soon as CH mentioned them. But just because the founder of Cardano says he likes a project, does not mean he is protecting it from any would-be bad actors.

Just don't throw all your money in at once. It's tempting to want to make the most money by getting in early. Well, it's still early. Take your time and DCA.

I'd also love to hear counter arguments. This space has ruined me when it comes to trust. It took a long time to even trust Cardano. I guess I just don't appreciate the active campaign to ride our coat tails. Cus that's what it is. Even though the project is great.",1622505670

The pot lights have a circular spread, you can have the spacing between the lights be larger and closer to the walls as the centre of the room will fill with light due to the overlapping spreads. Your corners (like where the 1.2M and 1.6M arrows meet) will receive the least amount of light.

Typically in this sense your outermost columns are 1/2x where x= equal spacing between the lights. In this case you should be doing something like 1m, 2m, 2m, 2m, 2m, 1m
And for your width, assuming that the spacing you have between the two lights is also 1.7m (you don’t have it listed) you should have 1.025m, 2.05m, 1.025m.

Of course all this assumes that your trusses or ceiling joists would allow for that kind of spacing.",1622505670

*****
&gt; Belarus&amp;#039; border security agency on Monday announced a severe tightening of already strict rules limiting citizens&amp;#039; ability to exit the country - even if they have long-term residency permits abroad. The changes, which the agency said were temporary and designed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, essentially block all land border crossings.

&gt; Faced with the prospect of a mass exodus of medical and IT experts, the government in Minsk began making it more difficult for citizens to leave the country last December, by limiting departures to those Belarus citizens who could present long-term residency permits from abroad. The new rules now forbid the holders of such documents from leaving as well.

&gt; State carrier Belavia, in return, cancelled all flights to the EU - leaving those who wish to leave Belarus increasingly worried and running out of options.

Knowing your sister does not like having HER things touched and moved, you deliberately put the curling iron down in a different place.

"math","t5_2qh0n","Honestly I've never seen anyone talk about a ""subbasis"" outside of munkres, so I don't think it's particularly important. Bases are important though, because it's often easier to work on a base of a topology rather than arbitrary open sets. For example, in R with the standard topology, it's really easy to work with open intervals, but arbitrary open sets can be weird and hard to describe.

A basis is sort of the minimal amount of information you need to get a topology; In particular, the topology generated by the base is the smallest topology containing the base elements (so all the base elements must be open); you can get this by taking the intersection of all topologies containing the base. 

&gt;And finally, he says ""If X is any set, the collection of all subsets of X is a topology on X, it is called the discrete topology"" when he says ""all subsets,""

he means all subsets. ""open"" and ""closed"" have no meaning before a topology is placed. ""Open"" is just another word for ""an element of the topology"". The topology given by all subsets (the powerset) is called the discrete topology, and under *this* topology, every set is open and closed. Under the metric topology, that's not true of course.",1622505673

"CovidVaccine","t5_2ls1x1","It HAS had FDA testing. It is FDA approved. It just went through EUA, which is the exact same testing as a regular FDA approval, just streamlined to do several tests at the same time instead of sequentially.

And you're completely ignoring the fact that you may be avoiding the 1 in a million or billion chance of something happening to you with the vaccine. But you are then taking the chance that you contract covid and have that effect you. And the odds of covid giving you a serious complication or killing you is extremely higher than the vaccine. If you're playing an odds game, vaccine is a thousand times safer than not taking the vaccine. Unless you want to live on an island and never see another person again to avoid contracting it. 

I am glad that you did decide to get it. And some people do have horrible short term side effects, but I believe it's absolutely worth it, to avoid getting and spreading covid. I got off pretty lucky. I just had a moderate headache for a day and that's it. But I know some other people who felt worse, but they're fine now. Getting an MRI sounds kind of nuts to me, but whatever, you do you.

Also there are coincidences in the world. You can't just ignore that, specially when millions of people are doing something, it's statistically bound to happen. And they don't hide the evidence of their investigations, you can look into it and see exactly why those people died and that it wasn't vaccine related.",1622505673

I mean, the DMV shouldn't be the only place you can get an ID. You should be able to get them at most government buildings. Police stations, courthouses, town halls, etc. Hell, even jails. 

When I say ID I mean a very basic ID that is valid. I understand that you pay for drivers licenses as a tax that is used to maintain the infrastructure that you're utilizing. I don't think these IDs should cost money, because voting should remain 100% free.",1622505674

"opiates","t5_2r0y3","Holy Jesus, what's medically wrong with you that your doctor's are willing to prescribe *that much* medication?

&gt;do u know how much fentanyls are in a pressed 30?

There's no way for anyone to know that because they're made illegally. Not only can the fent content vary per batch, each pill in a batch might have a different amount in it - which is a big part of why they're so damn dangerous. **Plus** there are a ton (hundreds?) of different fentanyl analogues, so you might get one batch that's got fentanyl and another that's got carfent.

&gt;i heard buprenorphine is like fent, u cant swallow it, it has to absorb thru the mouth. so does it taste like candy like the fent lollies, or does it have a strong bitter yucko mediciney taste like the sublingual morphine pills or the dilaudid liquids?

There are a few different ways you can get buprenorphine. Suboxone and Subutex (the sublingual strip and tablet) both taste like shit. 

Belbuca is a buccal (inside your cheek) film I've never tried before, but it's supposed to be used for pain rather than the sublingual variations. That probably tastes like ass, too.

There's *also* a transdermal patch (Butrans) that's used for pain. Unless you're using it wrong, I doubt you'll taste that one (lol)

The thing is, with bupe, **low** doses work well for *pain* and **high** doses are for *opioid use disorder*. So while the majority of people I've known who take Suboxone are on 8-16mg, Belbuca is meant to be prescribed in doses that range from 75-1800**mcg** (1 mcg = .001mg) - that way you can use rescue medications like Percocet if they're needed.

Unfortunately with the absolutely **insane** amount of opioids it sounds like you're currently prescribed, you'd need to go on Suboxone and wean down *very* slowly to get on a good dose for pain. 

**Fortunately**, while it'll suck to have to go into withdrawal at all, you only have to deal with it for a short time. You have to go into severe withdrawals before you induce with any kind of bupe because if you don't, you go into precipitated withdrawals (and you basically can't get out of those until they're over on their own timeline).

I'm prescribed an unhelpful amount of morphine (45mg/day), so I buy that and oxy from friends during the month. I probably average 90-120mme per day. I bought a single 8mg Suboxone strip, cut it into 16 pieces (so .5mg/500mcg), and use one of those pieces when I start feeling withdrawals coming on once I run out of my regular meds. Honestly, I'd say bupe at that dose is pretty comparable to the amount of pain relief I get from 100mg morphine (I do boof it though, so I'm getting significantly more in my system than if I were talking it sublingually [50% vs 13%])

With the amount of shit you're taking now, it's gonna be a rough switch, but it might be worth it if your pain still isn't under control. If you talk to your doctors about it, **make sure** they are willing to switch you back to full agonist opioids in case it doesn't work for you.",1622505674

Funnily enough though, an old crew I was in the last time I played (I take breaks for a few months at a time here and there) had the PC as a requirement even though their requirement was only 900k RP. It didn’t matter if you pulled 2 mil RP a season without the PC, every crew member had to SCREENSHOT the big 180,000 RP pop up after the last race, and if you didn’t, you’d get bitched at HARDCORE. Even if you accidentally clicked pay it because you forgot and then sent a screenshot of it saying PC complete in the crew chat, it wasn’t good enough and you’d be yelled at. It had to be the 180,000 pop up after the race. And if you failed to do complete the PC at all, then you’d basically just be kicked at the end of the season and replaced, even like I said above if you did 2 mil RP that season. And all of that for a 900k min RP acre that usually ended up around 35-40mil per season. 😂😅🤦‍♂️

Some here wont see it that way and effort and external aspects (fashion, more expense &amp; time) are relevant factors (and should be more critical to the less attractive sex). 

Thigh gap and higher hip to waist ratio are big turn on factors for me and are a factor in me finding a women more attractive of not, but really that should not be a factor for women when it comes to beauty. I'm biased thanks to testosterone/DHT in finding women more attractive and its over whelming men who say that, because that what nature hardwired us with that desire.

"PoliticalCompassMemes","t5_3ipa1","There entire argument is to have equal opportunity you must do these steps. This is what I mean by logical conclusion, they accept your goal of equal opportunity but in order to get there they have to implement these changes. What the hell do you expect to happen when you fram equality as this supreme moral good. Your never going to beat CRT through liberalism because you actually agree it's entire purpose which is to allow equality of opportunity. Also it's not anti free market as it is literally being pushed by the buisnesses. Woke capital is responsible for this crap and it needs to acknowledge this instead of constantly saying it's ""muh communism"". I can't think of any communists country that has implemented CRT or an Ideaology similar to that infact communists countries seem to enact pretty social conservative laws and actually manage to create a far more wholesome society to raise your family in. The only places thess batshit Ideaologies thrive in are liberal countries.

Also I would argue the consequences of liberalism has allowed all these Ideaologies to thrive from communism to CRT. I am at the point now where I view liberalism as more corrosive to the human spirit then anything else. You managed to take humans that were quite stable with there morals, values, and priorities for something like 3000 years to the state we are in now in what like 200ish years? Our society is at the point where it can't even reproduce itself and the type of people that rise up in these society are some of the most pathetic/unimpressive people to have ever existed.",1622505676

I told him he should HARD pass and go onto the next guy and he was like, ""ooooOooOooh, we have a tough guy here!""

It was pretty funny when he said that and I told him if I was up there then the club wouldn't have to charge a 2 drink minimum and entry price.

We had a few funny comments back and forth after that for 15 minutes and the guy was a 100% fucking stand up guy.  He told the manager he was paying my tab and to refuse to let my friend and I leave for the night.

He actually took us to another bar as a regular person and it wasn't just him and I chatting but my friend as well.  

He told me it he found it hilarious that I would just straight embarrass myself to take a cheap shot at him.  He said while I the crowd wouldn't give a fuck about me but they would remember that for his future events made him back off a tad from harassing me.

I just told him that I honestly give no fucks about what other people I won't ever meet again or don't care about think of me so if tell these people that I might have a 1 inch penis, your wife still calls me while you're here at the club most nights embarrasses you more than me.",1622505676

I think you've done your homework and have narrowed it down to a list where people are just gonna throw what they use at you.

There also might be some lag, but its not that bad.

Also Pikmin 3 deluxe co-op is a GEM. You can do the entire game as co-op. The hard mode is easy and its very very cute. Bingo battle is super fun and has a ton of cool stages; I hope I can do co-op for all of Pikmin 4!

Shoes off asap (be prepared with clean socks/feet or slippers or whatever you need to be a nice neighbour)

Seat near the back of the plane if possible works for me and increases chances of no neighbours for more space. Also the back of the plane usually has some space for walking / stretching / hanging out by the rearmost emergency exit for a chance to stand and a change of position.

Have your own water and snack, and drink plenty. Be light on the alcohol.

Cente section seats on widebodies seem to have been quieter, have less clutter cutting into leg space and easier to sleep in for some reason.

No team that plans to win can pay him more. And he’s just not worth it in addition to a pick. His main gripe is surely guarantees, because his ‘22 and ‘23 salary isn’t guaranteed. And the way to get reworked guarantees is to succeed this year. 

Atl doesn’t want him. His contract on the books, 100% puts you in a 2 year rebuild. He likely helps you win an extra game or two this year, which could mean several draft positions worse.

"ontario","t5_2qsf3","well hopefully they keep two options for each jurisdiction because as it stands you don't actually have a choice of which school to go to - it's just a psuedo choice via catholic or non-catholic. My assumption is with one school board, you'd go to the nearest school even if the one that was an extra 3 minutes of walking/driving is substantially better. Like I said, in this case there'd be no incentive for schools to improve what they offer to attract more students.    


I will say, my time in catholic elementary school I was a standout student - labelled gifted from the schoolboard. When I switched to public for high school all of my Individual Education Plan seemingly went out the window. I wasn't given advanced work anymore, and performance-wise my marks only really shined in the classes that I enjoyed.

"druggardening","t5_2uggx","We may be talking past a each other a little, but there are some things I think we can figure out together.

Most Apple trees are not self-fertile. Triploid trees are not special in that sense. Triploid trees just lack the ability to fertilize other trees. They are also not self-fertile, so they require the pollen of another tree to produce its fruit.

When a triploid tree, let's say the Arkansas black, is pollinated by other trees, it will always produce Arkansas Black apples. The fruit of this tree will be the same regardless of where the pollen came from. It could be pollinated by fuji trees or crabapple trees - the Arkansas Black apples will taste and look the same. The ONLY change that comes from differing pollen is that the seeds in the Arkansas Black apple will grow hybrid trees - hybrids between the Arkansas Black tree and whatever tree the pollen came from.

Most apples you buy in the store are not self-fertile. Because of this, farmers will graft branches from crabapple trees into their primary trees so the flowers will have fresh genetics to mix with - resulting in fruit production. This is why planting the seeds from a store-bought apple will NEVER give you a tree that is true to the fruit you ate.

Does this make sense? Do you have any questions? Or do you have any sources that contradict what I'm saying?

I'm not trying to be mean. Just trying to spread accurate information. Much love!",1622505679

When i play bird i go for Hail of Bullets with a shotgun (pref Wild Hunt, but Hell will do)  I also prioritize Victory Rush, Within Range and Fully Equipped as damage ascensions, but Hail of Bullets is a must if you go the shotgun-build.

As for defence i go Regen Hit and Steel Armor, and go for a build that'll burst down anything if i get close enough. If i dont hit any of thoose ascensions i get something that lowers cooldown for leap, and im usually cruising through Elite, and I am by no stretch of the imagination a decent fps-player.

The playstyle is just leap on top of them and burst them down with a click or two, and you're golden. 

The 600% leap damage and 60% CDR is also awesome if you can get it tho, instant leaps all the way to the bank.",1622505682

&gt; Peru on Monday more than doubled its official coronavirus death toll, becoming the country with the highest Covid-19 mortality per capita anywhere in the world.

&gt; With the adjustment, Peru now has the highest coronavirus mortality per capita of any country, with 5,484 deaths per million inhabitants, according to an AFP count.

&gt; The adjustment of the death toll came six days before Sunday&amp;#039;s presidential runoff race between right-wing candidate Keiko Fujimori and leftist Pedro Castillo, both of whom have promised to speed up Peru&amp;#039;s immunization campaign.

2. Oh I definitely agree that you want your holy land to be yours. 100% agree you should have it too. What I do not agree with is hiding behind religion and considering others as below you. I, as a religious person, would believe that mine is true but I certainly not harm others based on the notion that what I believe is the truth. (I don't know if this coming across right, can you tell me what you think I'm saying?)  I cannot speak on a federation. I don't even know what it is. I'm soo sorry I don't know crap about governments and their structures. I would encourage someone who does know what that is to talk with you.
3. I can't read Hebrew, even though I am slowly learning the language. I also feel that way from Jews and Israelis especially this subreddit. I've mentioned several times here, I didn't want to comment or post bc I felt that I would be attacked and blocked and hated from what I saw, but the result is great.
4. I also mentioned somewhere one someone asked which one I would want to live under and the answer is none bc they all are corrupt.

In my mind, I had no concrete proof I was not straight, so I must be straight. I still laid awake a lot of nights, thinking about girls I liked and what was pretty about them, making up scenarios where I dated or married them, etc. then trying to convince myself that it was normal straight person behavior.

For some background I’ve been dating my girlfriend who I’ll be referring to as gf since late December/ early January and I recently had no contact with her for personal reasons that I won’t be giving a description on, anyway fast foreword to the 31st of may and I surprise her by coming back and all was well until around 2 hours ago when me and hear got into a heat argument, which subsequently led to her giving me the cold shoulder, fast foreword to now and she wants to have a break because apparently I stressed her out and caused her to have an anxiety attack.

For some background to the argument it was because someone said something that upset her and I tried to calm her down and told her to try to be the better person and to try and lessen the attitude, and unfortunately I did say it in a way that might have upset her more, so now she refuses to hear me out about me being just as upset as her, so fellow Redditors AITA?

I would have walked, if it weren't for the two of them. They were always with me. They always made sure I was ok. It wasn't just me in the house, it was them too. I would have gone to my room, but the door was locked from the outside, and my bedroom was the only other one in the house. I had to face my biggest fear. I'm alone, and I have to face my biggest fear alone.

That night I sat at my window. I stared at the moon and the stars, and I kept my gaze on them. That's when I noticed the sun, its warm light shining in through the window. I sighed at the thought of being on my bed all alone again, the thought of being in my bed all alone, my head back on my pillow, the thought of the bed all alone, and then I saw the sun. The sun was shining so brightly in through my window, I could almost see myself when I looked at myself. 

I had just stared at the sun for a while, when I noticed one of the things in my closet. I picked it up and put it on the table, where it was supposed to be. The stars were so bright in my bedroom, and the stars had a habit of putting things on the shelf. That's when I knew for sure. I took a deep breath, and I took the scissors from my closet, and I went to the mirror. I saw the sun on my face. I smiled, and I looked at myself in the mirror, and I laughed a little bit. The sun was shining on me, and the sun was shining on me, and the sun was shining on me, and the sun was shining on me, and the sun was shining on me, and the sun was shining on me, and the sun was shining on me, and the sun was shining on me, and the sun was shining on me.",1622505684

&gt;The initial spill resulted in no injuries or deaths, but several of the employees of an engineering firm hired by TVA to clean up the spill developed illnesses, including brain cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia, as a result of exposure to the toxic coal ash, and by the ten year anniversary of the spill, more than 30 had died.",1622505685

As for DLSS2, I have praised it in the past because I was informed by tech reviewers who compared stills. It was not until I used it for myself that I quickly discovered it's flaw: motion.

ps. It is this same reason that I think AMD's VRS feature is garbage, major quality loss in motion is not something I enjoy when I game on a good monitor precisely for the visuals.

Edit: Before you randomly accuse me of being an AMD fanboy, [I suggest you visit this recent one where another user called me out for such regarding Intel/AMD share buy backs and was proven wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/ngbfgj/amd_announces_4_billion_share_repurchase_program/gysyenh/?context=3).

There was really only one type of man featured, no variety, and it was all that big square jawed muscle man type. A lot of women don't like that, especially not younger women who would be the biggest audience for something like that. The ""pretty boy"" type is much more popular among women. Like if you look at the celebrities women were going crazy over at the time, it was like young Leonardo DiCaprio and guys in boy bands and stuff. PlayGirl had no guys like that.

Also for some reason they had a rule against showing erections so it was all limp dicks.

I bought a few issues back then, before the internet existed. But then I quit because yeah I wasn't really interested in seeing unattractive guys with limp dicks.

I think it might have done better with women if they'd put more thought into what women actually wanted to see.

"swedishproblems","t5_2vyct","Jag fick en asperger-diagnos från BUP när jag var 15-16, nästan 10 år sedan nu. Fick dock en diagnos för egentlig depression med självskadebeteende  när jag var 13. I mitt fall är jag ganska säker på att  asperger-diagnosen är rätt, med tanke på allt jag upplever, hur jag beter mig och whatnot. Men det tog fanimig 8 år innan jag blev av med depressionen och mådde bättre, och mycket av den tiden gick åt till att vänta på att BUP skulle ""följa upp"".

Minns en av samtalen jag hade med tanten jag träffade en gång per vecka på BUP; jag berättade om att jag hörde röster som inte fanns och att jag inte kunde sova pga dem, och att rösterna uppmanar mig till självmord. Tanten nickade, antecknade och frågade hur rösterna låter. Jag förklarade och sen hörde jag aldrig mer om det. Fortsatte med audiella hallucinationer till ganska nyligen. Vart fri från dem i ca 2 år nu, känns skönt.

BUP är fruktansvärda. Man kom aldrig någonvart trots att man hade tydliga problem, I mitt fall svårigheter att somna, depression och självmordstankar med borderline planer till dessa.

Vuxenpsykiatrin är bättre och det känns som att de faktiskt lyssnar och tar en på allvar i jämförelse. Väntetid kan uppstå men det händer *nånting* I alla fall.",1622505689

"SubSimulatorGPT2","t5_121sso","It was a pleasant evening. A crisp summer breeze tickled my bare feet, as I wandered through the quiet streets of the village I had settled into. A small crowd of young people had gathered around an old man who sat at a makeshift table that was set in the middle of the street. I didn't know many people in the village, but I knew this man. He was the only one who could afford the cheap fare that the rest of the townfolk were forced to partake of. He had a long beard that almost reached the ground. His eyes were a bit distant, but his expression was so warm and welcoming that I couldn't help but smile.

The man stood and looked down at his wooden legs and the sand that lay beneath them. ""They're just a little tired of you. You know that, right?"" He laughed softly to himself as a dozen of the town's inhabitants shuffled away from the table. The man's smile faded slightly as if he didn't quite understand. I watched him closely as he slowly picked up his pace. The crowd around him grew ever so small.

""What is it you want?"" The man turned to face me, his eyes focused on mine. I smiled. ""I've always wanted to leave. You know that?"" My smile became a little wider. ""I always did. In fact, I thought you'd be my first. Maybe because I knew that you were a good person. Maybe because I was afraid of what you might do."" He looked around the street, noting the eyes of the other townspeople. ""But you never did."" 

""What do you mean?"" I took a step forward, my feet clicking together as I approached him.

""That's the thing. I never did. I don't know. But you're my first. This is the first time you've ever done something like this. You've never even spoken."" I glanced at him, his eyes still fixed on mine. He smiled, but his expression was a little strained.

""Maybe not,"" he said softly. ""But I had a good life. I always did have a good life.""

""You really have? How long have you been here?"" I nodded towards the man.

""Two days. I can't even remember. I used to be a soldier but I went crazy and took my own life."" He smiled as he shook his head. ""I don't even know how to begin to describe it any better. I just remember. I remember everything.""

""I don't know how to describe it any better either,"" I said softly, ""but I did leave. So I have. Good for you.""

""You're such a good person."" He smiled and leaned back onto his wooden leg. He glanced up at me as if to say thank you, but he could not stop looking at me. He looked so small and so warm.

""You're such a good person. I'm such a good person, too."" He smiled at me.

""I'm such a good person too. You're such a good person."" I leaned in to him, my finger grazing his cheek as we spoke. ""I'm good.""",1622505690

We want to pay for a good educated population, the question should be how do we pay for it. Taxes are better than young people in debts. The university of Ottawa is always cutting in services that affect the quality of the education itself despite the raises. There’s a huge part of the administration that is not involved in the academic activities of the universities.

imo, no fucking way lmao. Unless you are someone like OP who absolutely cant stand C;H or at least is aware that some stuff will fly over your head. Personally Id say C;C is just straight up bad without C;H knowledge cause it doesnt give you enough information and examples.

While C;H isnt a game for everyone, its actually good at least and literrally the most important sciADV game, so reading it has its benefits compared to just skipping it or reading a summary.

Its different from something like Never7 from Infinity series, which is an actual bad game and its not uncommon to see people skipping it (or reading a summary) to read Ever17 and Remember11",1622505691

So, I posted this the other day, but here it is again.  I had a better glamour shot photo that I took with my regular camera to try to show off the new leather strap a bit.  This is the Tudor Heritage Ranger that I’ve had for about three years, which apparently Tudor discontinued last summer. Was this not as popular a watch as I thought?  I know the Black Bay series started around the same time, and it seems that Tudor has leaned into that series of watches pretty heavily.  

The watch itself is a joy to wear. Mine is extremely accurate at an average of +0.9 seconds per day, and it’s been worn a lot, to do just about everything. The painted dial works well for me, and the lume is excellent. 

Mine came on the bracelet, which I like pretty well, but I prefer it on leather. This strap is one I made for myself, using some fancy Italian leather in Olive green Camouflage.  I used some red stitching to keep it a little spicy.",1622505691

*****
&gt; The UN nuclear watchdog Monday voiced concern that Iran had not clarified queries over possible undeclared nuclear activity, adding that its enriched uranium stockpile was 16 times over the limit.

&gt; The report said IAEA director general Rafael Grossi was &amp;quot;Concerned that the technical discussions between the agency and Iran have not yielded the expected results,&amp;quot; referring to exchanges on the sites where undeclared nuclear activity may have occurred.

&gt; The IAEA says that the results of its inspection work have established &amp;quot;a clear indication that nuclear material and/or equipment contaminated by nuclear material has been present&amp;quot; at three undeclared locations, with most of the activity in question dating back to the early 2000s.

I merely expressed a view regarding policy specifics, which should not contradict the original point, but I do think the comparison is unfortunate, especially because I come from a place who provides both and more, to teachers and to officers. I cannot fail but see it as if someone complained about people with pensions because they don't have public healthcare.

I don't know if I would be more inclined to strip them harder if the american police were my police as I have a moderate amount of respect for mine, but I definitely cannot imagine another  system without the police in place besides complete anarchy.

Mg L-Threonate freed that blockage. However, I do have perforations of the corpus callosum so perhaps that is factored in. Likely suffered from brain damage at some point in life and didn't heal properly due to vitamin deficiency.

Based on my understanding, just getting more magnesium is crucial beyond the RDI because it is absolutely needed for energy metabolism and a whole host of other metabolic processes.

I first supplemented Mg Glycinate-Lysinate from Doctor's Best and I had a state of euphoria for a solid 2 weeks. Received Mg L-Threonate from Nootropics Depot and that doubled.

Make sure you supplement with high dose thiamine as well, thiamine and magnesium are synergistic in energy metabolism. I began to get irritable and very tired after supplementing with high dose Mg, so now I started to take benfotiamine and I no longer get irritable from high dose Mg.

I take 1000mg of benfotiamine a day however I am looking at TTFD now.

It isn't really a nootropic but it does help for general well-being.

It is possible to have a sub-clinical deficit of these micro-nutrients, so be cognizant. I know I did because I have much more energy now than before. 

The worst issue I had was that I wouldn't be able to retain a single spoken word during conversation, none of it would stick until I started to supplement these 2 nutrients. It would be transient and intermittent in severity.

Look up EONutrition on YouTube for more information about thiamine.",1622505694

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

Try something for me. Go up to one of your friends who doesn't watch the Steelers and mention the Ben Roethlisberger Pass, and see if they know what you're talking about.

I also make some vegetable soups, cabbage soups, and bean soups. My favorite bean is chick peas, potatoes, and celery in beef broth. You can also add an onion if you like. Spice them up, but peppers (any kind), are good. I get the low or no salt broths. It was my pandemic go-to, but I think it is going to stay in my life for ever now (the soup, not the pandemic).

"Odsp","t5_2ytpb","Social Housing Apartment Retrofit Program. I am guess, that ""SHARP"" gives money to potential landlords (like someone who owns a house, and wants to make a basement into a 1 bedroom unit) with the agreement that it'll be low-cost housing. I believe it is more designed for families with a disabled child that wants their own unit. Government would rather not take care of the disabled, so make it easier for the 'rents to take care of their disabled children by giving them some money.",1622505695
"relationships","t5_2qjvn","My boyfriend did this a little bit in the beginning of our relationship. He just never told people we were dating, partially because he was my coach at the gym we went to and his boss told him he can’t date clients, so we had to be quiet, but it started to irk me when I’d see girl friends of his trying to shmooze their way in. And so I finally expressed that it really upset me that he wasn’t telling people about us, especially when girls were flirting. It was super awkward of course, but he was incredibly receptive and now he is EXTREMELY clear and open with people about us and is always introducing me to his friends. I would say let him know how it’s making you feel and see what he does to adjust. Some people aren’t very open about their personal life, so he could be that way. It really sounds to me like he’s trying not to let people know he’s dating, for whatever reason, but I could 100% be wrong. I don’t want to make assumptions. Just let him know how it makes you feel and hopefully he’ll come to a compromise with you. 

Best of luck!",1622505695

"SubSimulatorGPT2","t5_121sso","I walked the streets that were once my home, the same streets I was born on. My family didn't have much, but I never minded. They always had enough to eat, and we always lived in houses. I grew up in a family that always put food on the table for my family, and gave us what we needed to live. I took pride in that.

I always carried a small bag with me that consisted only of water and small amounts of food, but I never cared for the things in this bag. I never cared for anything except my family.

As I walked down these streets, looking at the scenery, thinking of my family, I saw a figure standing in the dark. He was a man and he was wearing a tattered white suit. He had a very long black coat that wrapped his body and a very large black cane. He looked at me with a dark, sad, and tired expression. I was surprised because I saw him standing not only in the dark, but also in the middle of two street lights, that illuminated the whole street.

I walked into the light, holding my hand out to the man. I wanted to shake his hand, but I couldn't move. I was on the ground now, and everything was dark. We were still standing in the dark, but the man didn't speak. He just stared at me with his eyes. Without saying a word, he slowly walked towards me, and I saw tears in his eyes. I looked at him with a worried face in the dark, and he looked at me with a sad face in the light. We were both staring at each other.

""What do you want to do? Will you stay, or will you go?"" I asked.

""I... I'm... I'm going. Goodbye."" He said.

I wanted to hug him, but I couldn't move. I looked at my hand. It was cold. I wanted to cry, but I couldn't. I looked at the man with a sad face in the light, and I looked at him with a sad face in the dark.

""I'm going. Goodbye."" He said.

I wanted to hug him for the first time. I wanted to hold him, but I couldn't. I looked at the man with a sad face in the light, and I looked at him with a sad face in the dark.

""I'm going. Goodbye."" He said.",1622505695

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; It's the ""with intent"" bit. Traditionally it's shockingly hard to prove Republicans weren't just pretending to be calling for treason.

There was a lot of reporting that Flynn was also calling for a coup back in december.  Like this:

https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a34846863/michael-flynn-trump-military-coup-suspend-constitution/

Then some people went and actually tried to do a coup.   And now he's doing it again. That ought to count for something.

I'm no military lawyer, but even if that doesn't technically qualify as treason, seems like it ought to be reason enough to disqualify his pension and other benefits.  IIRC there are some rules about upholding your oath of service even after retirement.",1622505696

A lot of white guys (that I’m friend with now bc I have a bf) thought that I wanted to hookup with them or date them bc I talked to them.... once I got a bf they started wanting to be my friend bc they realized I didn’t want them lol. 

I thought that guys wanted to date me but they wanted the “experience” with a black girl. I never got past the talking stage with a lot of boys. 


A lot of girls made rumors that I was sleeping around when I was in a white sorority. I was a virgin at the time....The boys wanted to hang out with me more and not them so they thought that just bc their whiteness didn’t get them anywhere, my cooch had to get me attn... not my personality. 

One white guy I talked to asked me if I ate vegetables??? I’m vegan??? 


Pussy boy called me aggressive but in reality I’m a pre med student and black at that so it’s very hard bc ppl don’t take me seriously in school. When I am “assertive” I’m “aggressive”

One of the things that nobody seems able to clearly explain to me is who is willing to _pay_ these kinds of interest rates. The very best explanation I've heard is ""we're lending to speculators, who are confident on their ability to pay back!"" and... well, I lived through the S&amp;L crisis, the DotCom bubble, and the 2008 GFC. ""It always goes up"" is true right up until the Very Bad Day that it's not. And that's the best case! 

Other things I hear sound like pure voodoo. ""It's a teaser rate to attract more investors"" sets off my Ponzi/Pyramid warning bells. ""It's a Custodial Coin, so you get the interest without the other person ever controlling it"" likewise sounds like hogwash... are they borrowing it, or aren't they? If they can't control it, how are they getting their returns and why do they need me to set my money aside?

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","To argue effectively you're going to need to know a thing or two. For example, Hinduism is not monolithic and never has been, it is paganism which is fundamentally individualistic. So for example, just like in Ancient Greece and Rome, different parts of the Indian subcontinent worshipped different idols. Over time, these idols came to be identified as the same figures. So Jagannath is Vishnu is Krishna is Rama is etc. A good deal of these figures like Krishna or Rama may have actually been historical persons who over time developed a cult around them--and this is what many Hindus believe and to them this is actually proof of these individuals' divinity, because only a divine person could develop a cult over time. For this same reason though they tend to fall for the Guru of the Month and there are probably more divine gurus in India than are deities at this point. They all claim occult knowledge and have some special gimmick or technique to show people how to attain enlightenment--which is fundamentally an imitation of Buddhist principles in my opinion.

And that is another thing: Buddhism is, in my opinion, the authentic transmission of the original Vedic teachings which Hindu claims to be based upon. Buddhism can be either considered a reform of Hinduism or it can be considered a kind of vetting of dead practices, which is what the Buddha himself claimed to be doing with his teaching. The Buddha, in that sense, is a prefiguration of Christ and the spiritually dead Vedic religion which would go on to inspire the diversity of later Hindu practices was symbolic of the Jewish religion. And, well, I'm pretty sure there are some connections between Hinduism and Judaism--this is a whole other story that I could go on with, but I won't delve into that. Interestingly, the word in Sanskrit to describe barbarians is m'lecchas--what I find interesting about that is the word in Hebrew for salting meat is mlech or something like that. I ascribe to the belief that we are all physically descended from the three sons of Noah though, so to me these little things add up and make sense.

Back to Hinduism, it isn't a real thing, it is really more like a national concept. The technical term for the religion of the Indian subcontinent is the Aryan religion, which is based on the Vedic texts which are probably authentically very old. One thing about that religion is it all revolved around sacrifice--in Sanskrit yagya (sounds like jug-ya). So we see here intimations of the necessity of sacrifice--this is a universal thing in all religions, so it is silly that protestants should try to argue that our priests and sacrifice are anathema. The Catholic Church is the fulfillment of this universal desire to make sacrifices for God. This desire was fulfilled in Christ upon Golgotha and given to us as a Sacrament at the Last Supper.

There are two types of sacrifices: they are either bloody or unbloody. Just as well they can be offered for Adoration, Thanksgiving, Propitiation, or to attain God's help. The Sacrifice Christ offered was a bloody sacrifice, but we offer that same Sacrifice in an unbloody manner upon our altars. The Sacrifice we offer with bread, wine, and water is the same Sacrifice that Christ offered with His Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity.

In Hinduism, the priesthood is largely pharasaical. Like most ancient societies it is passed on through family lines, father to son and so on. They are obsessed with cleanliness, refusing to associate with others outside their caste and can be highly critical and prejudiced. They're not all bad, but the term 'brahman' hasn't entered into our vernacular for no reason. Their duties are more like a Tradional Latin Rite priest than our Ordinary Form priests. They don't associate or preach or really try to deal with those who come to them at all. They basically just stand there and get paid by people to perform little pujas (devotions) like waving incense or a ghee lamp in front of the idol. The people take their hands and touch the flame or take the apple home and eat it, believing it has been now imbued with power from the deity.

That is a prefiguration right there too. The Hindus believe that when they offer something to an idol, it *becomes the idol* in a sense. This is called prasad/prasadam. So a sweetmeat offered to Krishna by a Hindu priest is essentially now Krishna, so when a devotee eats it, he imbibes the nature of Krishna. Sound familiar? I don't doubt that it is possible that these views towards prasadam aren't somewhat influenced by Christianity, because Christianity has had a long life in India that isn't talked about by Hindus. Did Hindu priests borrow concepts from Catholic priests? Possibly, but even in the Bible we see that offering food to idols and eating it (""honoring it"") was done by kings like Nebuchadnezzar and some idolatrous kings of Israel. Even in the Temple of Israel these kinds of rituals were commonplace.

I see in it a prefiguration of the Holy Eucharist. The Blessed Sacrament is a fulfillment of man's desire for Sacrifice. Again, part of the ritual of sacrifice has always been *sharing* with God. This is called *communion* and at times that takes the form of a meal shared with God. Other times it is a Holocaust, or a whole offering--in this case the devotee shares nothing in the sacrifice it is wholly given to God. The Levites as you may know shared the meat offerings given to God, in fact they somewhat relied on the tithes if I am correct.

Now, this might seem like a lot, and I could go on, but I won't. You might just want to know a few other things. For example, Hinduism is largely based upon the philosophical works of Adi Shankar, who may or may not have been a real person. He is basically like the Indian Socrates, except more theological than anything. He is responsible for giving us the concept of Advaita, I believe. That is somewhat similar to Eastern Christianity's practice of negation. It is figuring out what God *isn't* so that you can understand what He *is.*

Another figure is Ramanuja I think, he is like Thomas Acquinas of Hinduism. I'm not sure what he did, but he is more of a historical figure than Shankaracarya. All these people are called ""acarya"" meaning ""world teacher"" or something like that. Ramanuja was mostly philosophical.

Then into the 15th centuries you get the big Vaishnava movements which are probably the biggest sect in Hinduism. They were a kind of unification of Vishnu worshippers coming from the philosophy of a grammar teacher called Nimai Pandit (Caitanya). Their big thing is Jagannath Puri, they do these big parades with chariots and it is where we get the term Juggernaut because they put their deities on these giant chariots pulled by men and devotees get crushed under the wheels every year and it is something like a big deal ""they've gone to Vaikuntha-loka"" but anyhow. Caintanya inspired a lot of 18th century reformers like Gadadhar (Ramakrishna), Swaminaryan, Arya Samaj, Brahmo Samaj, Bhaktivedanta, etc. These guys all emphasized a personal God, who although One appears in varied forms for the sake of humankind. Arguably these ""Hindu"" ideas were taken up by the Theosophists like Annie Besant to devise their Luciferian New Age religion.

Then, finally, there is the South Indian contingent (Tamil) which is much more philosophical and less ""Vishnu-centered"" and more dualistic, Shiva-Parvati oriented (Tantric). They emphasize a lot of mysticism and renunciation and it gets to be a lot less personalistic in the way of the theology and more impersonalistic. They ascribe to a universal Brahman which pervades all things and less to a Creator God who incarnates in a kind of divine play (maya-lila).  Arguably the guru tradition stems from this contingent. They believe in Siddhars (Rishis) who are like Enoch or Elijah and who live immeasurably long times hidden in the Himilayas such as Shiva and who have magic powers, can fly through the air, travel through time, etc.

"spacequestions","t5_2ysdy","Sorry I've made a mistake in the previous comment. The limit on exhaust velocity is not controlled by the thermal considerations but the specific impulse (Isp) of the rocket propellant. Specific impulse is decided by the chemistry of propellants. The maximum for chemical rockets we've yet reached is for hydrogen oxygen combination at around 4500 m/s. But due to combustion inefficiencies and other forces such as aerodynamic drag, you'll get smaller value than this.


Now I've got that out of the way, to answer your question, if the mass ratio is less than e then we are limited by the exhaust velocity. However there's a catch. When you mean efficiency there are two possibilities:

1) Engine efficiency: When you say engine is efficient it means combustion efficiency is high. That means you can extract as much energy from the fuel as possible. consequently your exhaust velocity will reach as close to its theoretical limit as possible dictated by specific impulse.

2) Propellant efficiency: Alternatively, you could have a more efficient energetic propellant. This effectively means that is specific impulse is high and you can get higher exhaust velocities. 

So when you said efficiency I think you meant the latter.

 When you say m0/mf is 2 and you are at maximum velocity it means that you have essentially exhausted all the fuel because that's when you'll have maximum velocity. And so yes you'll be limited by exhaust velocity but as your fuel is significantly more energetic that limit will also be higher.

But this also means the final mass mf of the rocket is 50% of its initial mass. This would be really incredible right that you can get larger amount of mass into space as compared to only 4% in current rockets.

Hope I'm able to clear it up.",1622505699

"WhereAreAllTheGoodMen","t5_3jsx9","You are wrong here and I will school you on this.   I know a USDA Grade A 100% certified solid 10 Chad, not a 9.5 or a 9.7 but a solid 10 chad.   He has never been married nor has any children.   He attends single events to meet women.   He is not looking for a GF, or LTR or a possible wife, but women to fuck and add to his harem.  The best any girl will be at a single event is an 8, so he comes in as a solid 10 and these women are easy prey for him.   How do I know, I was his wing man several times.   Below are true stories.   He had no need to marry when he can get any woman he wants, when he wants.   Why settle for one when he can have many?

Chad is a lawyer and was working on USA/Russia oil business contracts in NYC.  Every 2 weeks, he would fly up to NYC for a week and work with his Russian counterpart.  He was doing this for 4-6 months, always the same flights.  A stewardess on American Airlines asks him if he would like to spend the week with her in Hawaii.   He could fly on her companion fare $100 and split the one bedroom hotel cost.  He would pay $62 a night.  He is telling me about this.   Sarcastically I say,”And the problem is”.   He says he knows he could get better looking women in Hawaii and bring them up to the room for sex.   He didn’t want to bring them to the room while the stewardess was there.   He had no doubt he could find women to have sex with, the issue was the stewardess.

  
Chad is out with a friend of mine.   He is in his late 40’s but looks early 30’s.   Two women, ages 22 and 26 have the hots for Chad.   They are asking my friends about Chad to get the inside track on him.  These women are topless dancers.   How do we know?  They said so.   The end of the night, Chad get both of their numbers.

  
Chad and I are at a singles event.   I am waiting to get inside.  We see each other through the doorway.   There is a woman 30-32, 5’7”, wearing a woman’s business suit.   She is very attractive and by herself in a corner.   She starts walking, so I keep an eye on her.  She walks up to Chad.  She gives him her name and phone number.

  
I set Chad up with a woman I know in my home owners association.   Chad picks her up.   She is so memorized by his looks, they don’t go out.   They go to his place for sex.   How do I know?  Chad tells me.

  
Chad and I are at a C&amp;W bar.   Chad says,”Oh this is going to be painful.  I didn’t want to run into her.”  I look up to see the backside of a woman pass behind a wooden column.   A second later the first thing I see emerging on the other side of the column are huge breasts.   She then turns and is walking towards us.  She is 42, 5’8”  34FF, 28, 38, blond hair piled 2-3 inches on her head flowing around to her elbows.   She is former Miss Sweden and has been in TV, Radio and movies.   She has her own advertising company and has her own money.   She is beautiful and in shape.   She wants to marry Chad.   Chad wants no part of it.",1622505700

He was honored by the U.N., used proceeds from the sale of his book ONE STRAW REVOLUTION to fund scholarships, and traveled to consult on several continents. When I see raised beds in neat rows I am reminded of troops in formation, a sense of order. So many Western gardens are compounds designed to keep nature out, an impossible task. Seeds are carried in the wind. How many start gardens and are defeated by the work? I look at new gardens and think of the work and expense in order to do more work.

"FruitsBasket","t5_2zift","I’m super curious because I’ve been seeing comments like that a lot so I want to know, really.
Besides Kyoko and Katsuya when else is power over others romanticized? (Also since we don’t know his age, if he’s actually 18 and she’s 15 just how wrong is it?) - don’t get me wrong, I still don’t like that age gap

Machi and Yuki - clear wooing going on

Tohru and Kyo - emotions forming over the course of 2 years

Kagura and Kyo - obviously she is abusing him but it isn’t romanticized

Rin and Haru - pure consent in regards to him asking her if she wants to kiss and be his gf

Hatori and Kana and Mayu - both relationships blossomed... gradually?

Momiji - never gets the girl and tries to bathe nakie with her but she’d at least have a towel on I guess so idk what category you want to fit him into 

Kisa and Hiro - childhood friends and crushes

Kureno and Arisa - she overthinks her feelings and he’s in love with the idea of freedom. Maybe romanticized but the girl is almost 18 and &gt;!they don’t even hook up until after graduation!&lt; I see this less as romanticized and more as realistic 

Kazuma and Hana - she has a crush and most don’t take that seriously anyways &gt;!and from Another we know nothing pans out; also he even seems to just laugh it off and use it to tease kyo!&lt;

Shigure and Akito - I’ve never viewed any of their scenes as “romantic from the audiences perspective” and that’s a 2 way toxic road that I don’t want to prod lol",1622505700

When you compare my parents compensation to mine, it's laughable how many more benefits teachers get. I won't compare the jobs as they are vastly different, but I would argue that working in a maximum security prison is likely as stressful as being a teacher, yet they receive better benefits, pay, time off and more sick/ personable days.

"history","t5_2qh53","Your submission has been automatically removed because it only has a title and little to none self text.   
When submitting a self post you should expand on the title in order to get the discussion started. Questions can't just be questions, we require that you have put in some effort yourself towards finding an answer. Your post should include what you have found so far, where you have looked so far, the context that made you ask the question and possibly a start towards what you think might be the answer. Basically we ask from you to provide the things needed to start a good discussion. 

Before you attempt to expand your post you should make sure it follows [the /r/history rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_rules_.26amp.3B_guidelines). These things are particually important to keep in mind:

- Requests for sources should still be capable of generating a discussion  You can request help with finding sources (Books/Podcasts/Documentaries/etc.) but your post must conform to [Rule 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_9._text_posts_require_a_descriptive_body_text.), the same as any other self-post.
- If your question is homework related your post most likely belongs in /r/homeworkhelp. 
- Titles of posts should accurately describe the content. Rule of thumb: see the title as a short summary of your post which will draw people in. 
- /r/history is not a place to crowdsource your research efforts. We apply our ""no homework"" rule to not only students, but to authors, journalists, and anyone else seeking to use the subreddit as their research team. The goal here is to generate discussions about history, and the original post should be geared in that effort.
- If your post includes a link to content you made, check out the [/r/history Self Promotion &amp; Spam guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/selfpromotion)
- All of the above too much effort but still want to ask your question? check out our weekly [Silly Questions Saturday](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/search/?q=Silly+Questions+Saturday&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all) topic where we are less strict in what we require for questions (self promotion rules still apply though).

**Please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/history&amp;subject=I%20expanded%20my%20post&amp;message=I%20expanded%20my%20submission%20for%20your%20review%3A%20https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/npgvii/identifying_sherman_tank_tracks/) once you have expanded your post so we can approve it for you.**

Say we do reach 100% photorealism. What happens then? Obviously not all companies are going to be able to afford it, and a lot of companies are going to prefer to use stylized looks anyways. So once that threshold is passed, most games still aren't going to use them.

"SubSimulatorGPT2","t5_121sso","""Thank you for coming, it's so nice to see you."" The man said, waving at me from the bus window. I walked up to him and sat down. He was a tall man, but not by much. He dressed nicely, well tailored, and spoke with confidence. He was talking about a job for me.

""Where do you want to work?"" I asked. He was kind of a jerk, I didn't really like him.

""Wherever will fit in and won't take up too much of my day."" He said. He looked at the bus for a few more seconds, then turned to me. ""Here. You're an assistant in the office, and I'm your supervisor."" He smiled at me, and I smiled back at him.

""Well I would like to go home, and I'll see you tomorrow at lunch, I'll see you then."" I said, waving at him.

""Thanks."" He said, looking at me. ""I hope you have a good day tomorrow!""

""I will."" I said, waving at him. I walked away from him, and he waved to me. I didn't really like him, but I was in a good position for a higher paying job. I would see him in the office tomorrow, and I would tell him I'm staying that day, I don't really mind having another employee.

​

And then I was home. I'm sitting on my couch, cleaning up my apartment. I was going to have a long day, I really needed to relax. I got up, closed the door to my apartment, and went to my bedroom. I walked in and closed the door, locking it. I got to my bed, and put on my headphones. I listened to some music, and drifted off to sleep.

​

I had to work early the next day, I had to go to the office. I had to get up at 5:30, I had to work until 7:30, and my day was supposed to start at 8:30. I didn't want to work that early, I never did. I walked to the bus stop, and walked across the street, and got on the bus. I looked over at the sign, and checked the time. It was 5:30, it shouldn't be long. I got on the bus, and I looked over at the window again, and it was 9:00. I stood up, and walked to my office. I put the headphones in, and closed the door behind me. I walked into my office, and I saw the new assistant. He was a tall man, I liked him, I looked up and down, and I walked up to him.

""I'll be right with you."" I said, then I walked out the door. I thought about what I was going to do that day, and about my job. I walked to my car, and I got in. I was going to work the next day at 7:30, and I was going to be there at 8:30. I got on the bus, and I looked at the sign. It was 9:30, and I got to my car. I looked at the sign, and it was 10:00. I got in and drove to work.

​

That day, I got off the bus at 9:30, I got on the elevator, it was 9:45. I got inside my office, and I closed the door. I started the printer, and I checked the time, it was 9:00. I walked over to the table, and I looked at the clock, it was 9:15. I walked back to my desk, and I started the printer, and I checked the time, it was 9:15. I walked out the door. I got on the elevator, it went up to 9, and I got to work. I saw the man with me, he was standing in the hall, staring at me, and he looked pissed. ""Fuck you."" He screamed. ""Just do your job."" I yelled, ""I'll keep you from doing your job, and you'll do me a favor."" I walked to the door, and I walked out the door.

​

I walked out of my building, and I started walking to the office, when I heard the man screaming. ""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO THAT FOR?"" I yelled. ""No one cares!"" He screamed, and I walked back to my office. I got out of the elevator, and I stared at the man. I stared at the man. I stared at the man.

​

I stared at the man.

Smoke inhalation can be dealt with using a half-face respirator and sufficient filters. 

Nuclear/fallout- most p100 filters can deal with that, but I'd want the heavy-duty stuff for anything life threatening.

As with most preparations, there are layers. I have lower-level filters, but also have higher-level ones (40mm with a full-face mask.) All depends on your immediate concern.",1622505702

Can Jamie risk Roger going off on his own, knowing Bree has already almost lost him once, when he went off on his own? Jamie must notice the similarity between sending Roger on his mission here and before Alamance, though there’s a big difference in the gravity of the situation and the enemies present; yet, there is a possibility that Roger may not come back. However, the thought that Roger doesn’t yet realize that his being so withdrawn hurts not only himself but his entire family too, as well as pushes Jamie to step up for them, is also definitely at the back of Jamie’s mind.

Result of genetics+habits, it is more like a reflection of your choices and some predisposition.
That said, you can set whatever dealbreaker you want in dating, as long as you aren't disrespectfull to anyone. You can set to yourself "" I will only date blonde guys, specifically named Todd 2 years older than me, exactly 1.88m. Oh, and they must have nice feet"". Its your party.

Does this include ""common areas"" that are locked, and only accessible to residents?  For instance, the apartment complex I am at has a common walkway area, but access is restricted on both ends:  at the front there is a gate, which requires a key to open, in the back parking area, there is also a lock.  Apart from residents, postal carriers, and first responders, no-one can simply access the common area.  This is a pain in the ass for Amazon and other deliveries, I either have packages delivered to a Amazon locker, or if not fragile, put a note in the front requesting they throw it over a wall onto my patio.  

Practically, this is a moot-point, as I have a ccw, my SO has one, and so do several of my neighbors.  However, during the riots last year, there were definitely several neighbors sitting on their stoops open-carrying just watching all of the shit go down.

The last SARS case was in 2004, so that would no longer be a pandemic. You are right that MERS is still circulating (rarely) and most likely it is only jumping from zoonotic reservoirs to humans as very little human to human transmission was observed.

Collaboration is what kept humanity alive long enough to make it to the people that took advantage of others. People forcing others to do their work doesn’t change that the work was collaborative, just that there’s no passion on the part of the workers. That’s why, yes, big/great things can be done through force, but also why it will never yield the best results.

"Lyme","t5_2rzlq","I’ve spent years with issues. Have taken an alphabet worth of antibiotics as well as herbs and supplements and they all worked to some degree. 

Unfortunately, many of my remaining symptoms were neuro and brain related. It wasn’t until a doctor prescribed Ceftin that I began to clear up these remaining symptoms. Ceftin itself will create headaches for the first few days but then I began to have more energy, my endocrine system began to get better, tremors, fatigue, head pressure, back of neck pains subsided, ear pain diminished, anger faded and I began to feel normal again.

I do take breaks in between Ceftin periods to allow my digestive system to recover and to give my body a break. Lyme and company replicates slowly, I think every 28 days (?) so taking a break will not create problems. Taking breaks also helps me stay the course without it feeling too much like a burden.

And you know one of the reasons that I knew I was getting better? I began to worry about the yellowing of my teeth, that I needed a haircut and my general looks. LOL! When I was very ill, I could care less about dumb things like this as I felt that I was fighting for my life. Who cares about yellowing teeth when you can barely walk and you feel like your whole body is falling apart. 

I hope that whatever path you take gives you your health back so you feel like your old self again. That’s all we wish for, right?",1622505705

Honestly, the under quilt was a life changer for me.  Also, a tarp big enough to get almost to the ground on the windward side is nice to have. As long as I have enough room to keep my kit dry, I’ll take the hammock every time. Tents kill my back unless I have one big enough to stand up in. So, that definitely plays into my decisions, particularly if I’m hiking in. I’ve also learned to boil some water to go in a nalgene and put that in the hammock with me.

I can’t say I’ve ever noticed them (sad virgins) but I believe you. I avoid them pretty well by mostly existing on plant and cat Reddit 😅 

But honestly I expect the vast majority of people don’t have sex before age 16. That is the earliest that it’s not “too young”, imo. I imagine you were some combo of very attractive and/or popular, (by which I just mean “had plenty of friends,) and preoccupied with the opposite (or same 🤷🏻‍♀️ idk) sex. 

I imagine they complain about sex stuff bc they’re not having any, and/or it makes them uncomfortable which is part of why they haven’t had sex. I imagine it’s also complicated and I’m honestly not so interested in the psychology of sad boys who complain on the internet haha

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I like the game, its fun, but its not nearly the absolute GEM it could have been, especially after such a long production time.  The game lacked depth, meaningful choice, and a ""living"" world.  It was absolutely plagued with performance issues and bugs to the point of it being near unplayable and having players try desperately to find small fixes here and there just to finish the game out.  It was a huge disappointment, I wanted the game to be amazing and it just wasnt anywhere near what it could have been.  Last I played the game I was sitting on an absolute PILE of money because nothing was worth purchasing, the game gave me good vehicles from quests, good guns from drops, and I never found a ripper doc with any augments worth investing in and even if I had the augments system feels incredibly lacking.  I am fine driving around to find upgrades from certain shops but when there's a store in a building I cant access it kind of kills it for me and I just go back to doing quests.",1622505708

I find it hard to imagine that in the next 110 years Isildur and Anárion just failed to notice that their archenemy was ruling the neighbouring country.

"community","t5_2qu49","Sure, the entire season is basically setting up the dark path Jeff had been on since season 5. Turning 40 and then being left alone at greendale when he was supposed to be the first person out. 

Also, the theme of change continues as we see new people added to the group which changes the dynamic of the group. But thats the main point, that even greendale is changing. Its not the toilet it used to be. This is the main point in the final paintball. The janitors are trying to hold on to the last bit of the old greendale but change is inevitable. 

Episodes like the email leaks and garrets wedding show how the study group has kind of changed to become just a normal group of people that hang out. The synergy/codependancy bit is meta but these episodes make the group feel like actual friends. Moreso even than earlier seasons imo. Its unrealistic of us to expect annie or Abed to waste their life at greendale so its kind of a relief when they both get to leave at the end. 

This is all off the top of my head, and i havent re-watched the series in like a year",1622505709

You don’t hold the moral high ground and that wouldn’t excuse you even if you did. You result to childish insults against those on the other side of your ideological position because you cannot think beyond your assumption that you are morally correct.

"Smite","t5_2stl8","&gt; It barely does any of that. Warriors don't need any power or prots to clear or deal damage. That's how Warriors are naturally built. And most people who aren't clueless won't build first item Benevolence and just rush boots and play safe to ensure the fastest route to level 17. Not an issue.

Actually, you're still supposed to go Benevolence first. The GP5 it gives is beneficial enough to warrant going it, and the minor HP5 and MP5 are better to have than not. Again, this is anecdotal but it's worked in really high level duels for me. I think going no Benevolence is even worse bar a few Gods like Vamana who can just brainlessly proxy and can use that extra gold to go items to help proxy. But power and prots help anyone clear or deal damage -- Warrior base damage is high but in a world where Hunter's best starting item literally comes with physical prot, you're definitely going to feel the difference. And Warriors haven't ever ever cleared faster than Hunters on Duel anyways. No warrior is rivaling Anhur, Hou Yi, or AMC's buff or objective clear.

&gt; It allows ALL the damage needed without any need for actual offense items, even more so than if they went Bluestone + hybrid tank items. Warriors also have so many routes to build both defense, health, and attack speed (Void Shield, Shogun's, Talisman of Energy). To even PRETEND that this is at all comparable to how Warriors played before is absurd quite frankly. I don't agree with that at all.

I just faced a Set at 2800 MMR who went Animosity, Ichaival, then Reinforced Greaves into 3 physical defense items (Midguard, Mystical, Void Shield). He lost. You know why? Spamming tank sucks in a game state where penetration is everywhere. The best physical defense item in Duel currently (Void Shield) has penetration. Exe is good penetration. Any of the mace items are fine. Toxic Blade is amazing as every single stat it gives is good in Duel, and it eliminates any healing trouble. Triple defense was an issue previous season when penetration was a lot more rare. That insane build that hunters run in Conquest that shreds even through Spectral is so good because like 70% of the items they buy have penetration on them. Penetration is not rare in S8.

&gt; The rest of your post references backdooring, ending the game before 17 (lol), stating Hunters have been the meta which are all understandable because at the end of the day we're all just trying to win with what's been given to us, but like you said: it's just not healthy for this strange little mode. I don't think it's valid to talk about how Hunters/Mages being the meta since the dawn of time changing is refreshing or good because, again, 3k health max defense Warriors doing the same DPS as Hunters and Mages (they are) is on a whole other plane of existence.

Ending the game before 17 can be literally or metaphorically. You can 'end the game' by amassing a big enough lead on a God to where coming back isn't possible. This is done through smart farming and objective clear. If you have a Warrior backed up to their titan at level 17 (this is totally possible if you go anyone with any objective push at all. If you can't consistently do this then you're either losing or playing wrong) then they'll most likely lose because Warrior wave clear is absurdly bad with Joust's buffed minions, and the Animosity builds lackluster power.

Let me walk you through the metas this game has been through when it comes to Duel.

In the original Joust map, turtling was omnipresent. Going Gods with really good waveclear, really good lategame, and buying items like Midguardian, Fatalis, and sitting under phoenix full clearing because it was impossible to push was the norm. If you ever got phoenix down, you could kill the Titan without the Titan ever aggroing due to the wall exploit. Poseidon was notorious for this, and this was where the max MS poseidon build came into popularity.

In the S3 Chinese themed Joust map, turtling was still common because titans were ridiculously tanky. Lots of backdoor strats saw rise in this map and the previous because turtling was such an issue -- Loki, Bastet, Bakasura became really popular. HiRez eventually nerfed titans and incentivized using BDK to clear objectives (which wasn't always useful because, again, turtling at titan was viable -- BDK only impacts up to Phoenix). This resulted in the latter part of this map being decided in the first few levels, because whoever got BDK and pushed objectives fast enough would probably win; the titan was too squishy after the changes. 

In both of these maps, and all the aforementioned seasons, the same gods were meta. Ullr, Skadi, He Bo, Chronos, Kali, Anhur, Ah Muzen Cab (ESPECIALLY this character. If you've played Duel for any amount of time before this map iteration, you'd know how frustrating a high MS high Defense AMC is to fight. Certainly more than warriors) Freya, Bakasura and Poseidon have been worthwhile bans since the gamemode came out. This gamemode had literally been stale for 5 years.

This new map allowed for more gods to shine. It struck a nice farm to size where you didn't jeopardize the game because you lost one red buff, but also didn't bore yourself with 8 buffs across map. Backdooring was nearly impossible because you're close enough to your phoenix from base, but turtling wasn't an issue because BDK is far enough away from objectives that you couldn't just go a high mobility God and contest every BDK, resulting in a 50/50 (like on the Chinese joust). Kali and He Bo aren't nearly the powerhouses they used to be. The viable God pool is bigger than it's ever been in Duel, and I see people banning and playing any and everything at a high level. I've had Susanos and Raijin's tear me a hole AMC nor Hou Yi ever could. 

The 'meta' in Duel has never been good. SMITE is a team focused game, and Duel is a 1v1 focused gamemode - it is a perfect breeding ground for horrible, annoying playstyles like backdooring, attack speed slow stacking (beginning of this season with Manikins, Ichaival, Midguardian, Witchblade...) and turtling. Like it or hate it, Animosity has single handedly allowed for an entire group of Gods to be usable if not competitive with the top tier meta, and it FORCES fighting to happen because it finally gave warriors and Guardians the one thing they've been lacking all this time: objective pressure. 

Again, I remind you that those bans I mentioned earlier still shit all over Animosity warriors as long as they're played well and counterbuilding specific to the God is used. It just isn't the same steamroll brainless play that Duel has been before, and there's actually stakes and possibilities for both sides, not just the person who picked the more meta character.

I've been Diamond or Masters in Duel for multiple seasons, all the way back to S2. I can't tell you how new and exciting it is to be able to shitstomp Skadis, AMCs and Poseidons who don't respect Warriors. We are going to regress heavily when we return to the initial Joust map because turtling hasn't been fixed there w/ a lack of BDK.",1622505710

However in practice it doesn't actually matter; any version of the Mach-E gets worse charging speed than that from 10%-80% (and MUCH worse above 80% but that's par for the course, albeit perhaps not as drastically so as in the Mach-E's situation)",1622505712

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","[The Rumsfeld Doctrine](https://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0921/p09s02-coop.html) was stupid beyond belief and prevented Iraq from being anything other than a clusterfuck. Rumsfeld's incompetence [was called out by former generals](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/04/donald-rumsfeld-iraq-war).

&gt;""He has shown himself incompetent strategically, operationally and tactically, and is far more than anyone else responsible for what has happened to our important mission in Iraq.""

\-- Major General Paul D. Eaton, the man responsible for training the Iraqi military from 2003 to 2004.

One of the most consistent criticisms of Rumsfeld going back to the 1970s was his complete lack of humility and his inability to believe that he was anything less than 100% correct all the time. It didn't take a genius to see Rumsfeld would have been a terrible President, but Milton seemed to miss it. 

And Freidman called Reagan's choice of Bush over the arrogant, incompetent Rumsfeld [""the worst decision of his Presidency"".](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_rY3wdaDZ5UC&amp;pg=PA391&amp;lpg=PA391&amp;dq=%22Had+he+been+chosen,+I+believe+he+would+have+succeeded+Reagan+as+president+and+the+sorry+Bush-Clinton+period+would+never+have+occurred.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=03i64bFYwH&amp;sig=AWLLYrVNe-13KnWOEdRNT5zz-Zw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Had%20he%20been%20chosen%2C%20I%20believe%20he%20would%20have%20succeeded%20Reagan%20as%20president%20and%20the%20sorry%20Bush-Clinton%20period%20would%20never%20have%20occurred.%22&amp;f=false)",1622505712

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","CNN is no beacon of integrity but comparing them to the right-wing media lunacy is an immediate and obvious indicator that you’re drunk on kool-aid. 

The greatest trick Murdoch ever pulled was making people believe anything to the left of Fox is just as biased and ridiculous so that they seem more reasonable by comparison. 

Fox is to right-wing media as MSNBC is to left-wing. 

CNN falls in-between, albeit closer to MSNBC. The genius of what Fox did is make their brain dead viewers believe that CNN is the left-wing equivalent of them, therefore creating the illusion that they are more center and reasonable when in fact they’re laughably biased and dangerously accepting of authoritarianism. 

And that doesn’t even bring the real lunatics like OANN and Newsmax into the fold. And that’s just TV. 

There’s no denying that the vast majority of news media in America leans left - but not so egregiously far that it’s legitimately threatening democracy. Those that lean right (with the exception of like three outlets) go so fucking far overboard in some attempt to “level the playing field” that they table all sanity and foment the kind of hysteria that it actually becomes dangerous. 

CNN catches sooo much shit because of their popularity, but in the grand scheme of things - they’re damn near as good as it gets when it comes to MSM

Now that says more about how shitty the rest are than how good CNN is, but using them as an example of a “parallel universe” is preposterous. 

Yes, I just “defended” CNN on the Libertarian sub. I guess. They’re shameless sensationalists that are more worried about views/clicks than anything else - but when it comes to advocating for one side or another - they don’t come anywhere near those on the right who pretend they’re the other side of the same coin. They’re not. They suck, but for other reasons. Not because they’re activists LARPing as journalists.",1622505713

“The architecture is similar though not quite as grand. The feeling I get when looking at these fine walls is like staring back at home.”

That part was true. It did remind him of home, of the state it was in. It was decrepit in comparison devoid of any trappings of what was once a glorious house. 
He had spent no time repairing the walls and cleaning the many cobwebs. His work had been focused on his people. Though he could’ve let his cousins work on it he was ever the micro-manager. He resolved himself to correct it before he had to entertain any other colleagues, lords or otherwise. 
“They’re both places where nobility congregate, though I admit it’s place within the forests do lend it to be slightly more austere in its decorations than a place such as this. Would that my humble abode match such a place.”

He raised a hand to gesture to the hall around them. Certainly it was a much more grand place than the slightly more menacing halls of his own place. He had scarcely investigated the darker corners where his grandfather’s will still exerted itself, even if he has passed. 
“You are welcome to visit at any time, my Princess. The gates will always open to royalty such as yourself.”

Barbecue Sauce  
Servings: Makes about 2 Quarts

Ingredients  
28 ounces tomato sauce  
1 large garlic clove, minced or 1 ½  to 2 teaspoons garlic paste, or 2 teaspoons garlic juice  
½ cup minced onion, (1 teaspoon) onion juice or 3 tablespoons or 1/8 cup onion paste (equal to 1 medium onion)  
¼ cup firmly packed brown sugar  
2 tablespoons molasses  
¼ cup bourbon or whiskey  
½ cup ketchup  
¼ cup apple cider vinegar  
1/8 cup red wine vinegar  
¼ cup Worcestershire sauce  
2 tablespoons Sister Mary’s BBQ Rub \[AKA Pork Butt Rub\]  
(Pork Butt Rub and Rib Rub (AKA Sister Mary's Barbecue Rub))  
1 teaspoon adobo sauce (in place of the chopotle and adobo, I used ½ teaspoon chipotle sauce)  


  Steps  
1. In large saucepan over medium heat, add tomato sauce, and all other ingredients 1 at a time stirring after each addition.  
2. Simmer until flavors have blended and the sauce has thickened somewhat.   (if not using chipotle, onion and garlic pastes, then  puree in blender after cooling).  


  Notes  
I puree the chipotles in adobo sauce, in the food processor and add 1 teaspoon 1 tablespoon of that mixture to the sauce.  I also puree the onion and garlic in as much olive oil as it takes to make a slightly runny paste. The paste goes in the pan first and is warmed a bit before everything else is added.",1622505714

"kpophelp","t5_2vyk1","Yup, back in 2017 when BTS was starting to blow up here in Brazil I ended up getting interested in this whole world of Kpop and Kdramas and in less than a month of watching Korean stuff I decided to start learning Korean. It’s been almost 4 years and I’m pretty proud of how far I’ve come, I can hold conversations by phone, send audio messages, write letters, chat about various subjects and I’m writing a blog in Korean as well. Kpop really helped keep me motivated and, ironically, even helped me get better at English, since my native language is Portuguese but most of kpop contents have English subs. 
 Also, these days I finally finished reading a book fully in Korean (나는 예쁘지 않습니다 지은이 배리나), of course I didn’t know all of the vocabulary but I managed to understand almost everything by myself, it feels great!
I’m also learning Japanese, even though I’m still only conversational, but Kpop also played a huge influence in that. 
I’m glad to see everyone making of use of music as a meaning to start learning new languages, that’s a amazing thing to do.",1622505714

So if we say everyone is telling the truth about everything, then Witness A saw Cecil in SUV 001 at 7:35 or so, and Cecil forgot to call in his arrival on scene that night like a rookie. In that timeline, Maura had at least 25 minutes to get 5 miles, and probably more time depending on exactly when she bolted and how good RF's estimated time of sighting was when he recalled it months later. Doable? Eh, definitely not by me, but I suppose it's conceivable that a college track runner could conceivably keep up a 6 minute pace for 5 miles while intoxicated, after a car wreck, running blindly away from the scene of an accident down a dark road at night in the winter, while trying to avoid being spotted by passing cars.

"SubSimulatorGPT2","t5_121sso","I walked through the door. The lights from the hall were still on, but I felt the room go dark. It was as if I had stepped into a black void. As soon as the words ""you're leaving"" left my lips, I was outside. 

I looked around and saw nothing but the street in front of the house. There was nothing for me to do but stare. The house was right on the edge of the town, but the house was so big, I could see no way up. There was no possible way for me to get inside the house. 

The only thing I could do was turn around and face the street. I looked up and saw that the street had collapsed into a straight line. A single light was still lit up by the front of the house. It was as though the house was watching me. 

My stomach started to rumble as I felt my fingers start to curl into fists. My eyes started to hurt, and I felt my mind go blank. I looked down at my feet and saw a hole in the ground. As I stepped into the hole, my knees were crushed and I felt my feet lift off my feet. I fell into the hole with a thud. 

I heard a screech as I hit the ground and my head hit the ground with a crunch. The house started to crumble and the ground rose up with it. 

I looked up and saw that it was still on my street. The street was still on my street. When did I step on that street? 

I saw the house, still on the street, crumble and disappear from my street. I looked at the front of the house and saw a black hole with a single light on. The light was on, but there was no visible way for me to get in. 

I looked around and saw that all of the houses had started to crumble. Then I saw my own house. It was on the street, and it was on a street. When did all of us start to crumble? 

I looked down at the ground and saw that I was wearing a shirt, shorts, and sandals. I looked at the ground and saw that it was all still under the street. There was no way for me to get out of the street. 

There was nothing but a black void to my right. I looked up at the sky and saw a single light on. The light was on, but there was no way for me to get out of the light. 

I looked down at the ground and saw that there was a black hole to my left. I looked down at the ground and saw that if the hole was on my left, then the hole would be on the right, right? 

I looked down at my feet and saw that there was a hole to my right. I looked down and saw that there was a hole to my right. I looked down and saw that there was a hole to my right. 

I looked down and saw that there was no place to go. I looked down and saw that there was a hole to my right. I looked down and saw that there was a hole to my right. 

And as I looked, I saw all of those things disappear.",1622505715

To top it off, while Fantasy was very much entrenched in 'Magic Germany Vs Magic Vikings,' AoS launched with NOT-SPACE-MARINES FOR THE GOD-GOD EMPRAH

Over time though GW realised people did want a serious, competitive ruleset, and the lore evolved to have arcs, novels etc. And most dramatically, Stormcast remain the poster boys but they had Comparably very few releases after the intro waves against the 'every release has Space Marines' approach, so much so we're in the middle of an Elf Flood.
It gives the feeling that GW listened and are actually making models and lore people want.

But the broad consensus appears to be 2.5-3 for the original strain (with some debate over whether D614G represented a step-change in the very early days), 4-5.5 for B.1.1.7, and then take your pick for how much more transmissible B.1.617.2 is. 

I deliberately picked a number that was a bit higher than B.1.1.7, but not much higher since we know there's some vaccine escape which explains part of the observed increased transmissibility. But a reasonable worst-case scenario could easily substitute R0 = 7 or at a stretch even R0 = 8 if transmissibility is at the 60-70% range.",1622505716

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Just about the entirety of the Sourthern states. Most of the poorest states. Usually higher tax rates than  the national average. The culture is so judgmental  to anyone who isn't a cookie cutter conservative. And the culture is also hypocritical since it commands respect as one of it's most important values. Than the racism, i mean there will always be racist people but in the south the kkk still exists and theres tons of white supremacy movements. And the people are  one of the most homophobic and transphobic groups of people. There will always be people who think differently than the majority but my god can people stop living in the past. Come on and move on. Were still in the dawn of a whole fucking millennium. Times change, life in 10, 20, 30, 40 years isn't going to be how you grow up.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I’m female, that’s probably important for context.

When I was sixteen, I went in an Uber alone and the driver offered me a bottle of water. I took the bottle and almost started drinking it before realizing that was the only water bottle in the front of the car. If he was giving out water to all his passengers, he’d have a case or something, at least more than one bottle. I guess it *could* have been in the trunk but that would mean the guy was getting out of the car, walking around back, grabbing one bottle of water, and bringing it back to the front, between every ride he gave, and that didn’t make sense. The seal on the cap wasn’t broken, so I flipped it upside down and squeezed it a bit. I figured I was being paranoid and that nothing would happen, but instead, water dripped out of a tiny hole in the area where the neck and body of the bottle connected (probably from a needle or something). I “changed my mind” and he didn’t make a fuss over that, just took it back and kept driving me to the place I was going. I got there safe and reported him, but I don’t know if anything came of that. I just hope whoever else he drove that night didn’t accept the offer.",1622505717
"r4r","t5_2rn0e","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/r4r because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

It’s a shame because the mind-body connection is important but it gets overshadowed by (as you say) introducing it in such a ridiculous and overly-simplistic way.

And he doesnt do well on bosses. So I would say yes but not really since he can still be used, but he isn't optimal. Since you are just starting out, he is one of the best shikis you can invest in since early to mid game is all about clearing chapters and Souls 10 farming, where he is still very good in. Go ahead and invest in him, he will pay you back tons by the time you get to late game. I will say this though, he needs a lot of skill darumas (12) and a decent souls set to be really good, so you might want to consider a cheaper alternative first since you are new. Like Kuro Mujou or Ubume. 

Oh yeah, I guess clearing all Secret Zones are also late game, but he does well in the first few stages for some Zones.",1622505717

People hated the idea of Yondu not having his big fin, but once they saw the movie and the explanation, people accepted it and enjoyed it. I still really think it comes down to respecting the source material enough to make changes that are appropriate for the new story without making changes that completely take away what the character is or stands for.

"IsaacArthur","t5_3g7ux","Alright, let me rephrase my points: Isaac thinks that the lack of any detectable tech signatures at the moment, in a world where we’re pretty sure FTL is impossible, is a serious counter argument to alien civilizations. If we change nothing else but whether FTL is possible, then that makes the absence of any such indications even more compelling.

All the rest, such as how many lifetimes it would take for a colony to start sending out its own ships or how unified such a civilization would be, etc, are beside the point. We can see no evidence of any such signatures, that would not be dependent on having any of the parameters you specify.

Further, because we’re only looking at what, at most, is less than 100,000 years in any part of our galaxy’s past, the argument of being millions of years after any other civs is even more damning. If a civ started expanding 1 million years ago, they’d have 900,000 years before the oldest light in our galaxy could give them away.

If you don’t buy Isaac’s premise that a civ would almost certainly build dyson spheres around all their stars or engage in similarly obvious activities, that is fine. But if they would, then FTL makes their absence more glaring.",1622505718

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","I think traveling does lead to a more “enlightened” perspective.  Traveling allows us to interact with different cultures and more easily realize how limited the perspective we were raised with might be.  It doesn’t guarantee “enlightenment,” though, and it isn’t the only way we can broaden our perspective; it just makes doing so much easier.  I think college is similar.  College makes it easier to learn advanced content.  Students aren’t guaranteed to learn it just by going to college, and non-students aren’t incapable of teaching themselves that content to a certain extent, but having coursework and knowledgeable professors just makes it easier.  Similarly, traveling is not the only road to a global perspective, but it is one that is comparably wide and well-paved.",1622505718

"PersonalFinanceCanada","t5_2tasy","I look at the issue in this way. As a student I have spent 2 h in daily commute. When I got a job, I was deciding between buyjng a house vs renting. I cannot afford a home within at keast 1h driving distance from my kob place. If I spend 2+ h in daily driving/commuting, I would spend 10+ unproductive hours a week. This means I work one extra day a week for which I don't get paid. Plus I spend more money in gas, car insurance, have to deal with more car wear and tear. My probability of getting involved into accident (driver fatigue, traffic frustration etc) increases a lot. Most importantly, I add lot of stress to my life. Considering these factors, I ended up renting a place close to my job place. I spend more in rent, lose home ownership opportunity but that is the price I pay for the time and energy saved and having more time to spend with my family.",1622505718

Here's my issue, and this may be completely overblown; but at what point does it become a question of ""should these sorts of character traits be promoted to an audience of millions of children""?
There's a certain subliminal sequence of deception and lies that took place in the pursuit of clout and monetary gain. This guy cheated, denied, lied, and now there's millions of people who witnessed the events and bought into all of it. What sorts of conceptual disasters can that cause in the overall acceptance of rational information and evidence going forward into future years?

I really dislike people who cheat in competitive situations; this happened when he submitted the run to the site

I really dislike people who deny their actions when confronted with them; this happened when he completely trashed the moderators and had his fans mob everyone who presented math and evidence.

Finally, I really dislike people who lie as an end-state because they can't even bring themselves to present the full truth. Its completely unbelievable that this guy accidently enabled very specific modifications to game files. He can't even suck it up enough to say ""yeah I did all of it, I'm sorry"" 

Instead he says ""Oh man I did that? I'm sorry, there's just no way I would ever mean to do that""

I personally enjoy doing them out in nature while camping or by a lake, especially around sunset is awesome. If you can time it right when the sun is setting and the mushrooms start taking effect it is such a cool experience. 

I’ve found the people will either make or break your trip. Better to do them with less people than more. Too many people can be too stimulating. I’ve had the best mushroom trips with 1-3 friends that I know very well and can be myself around. Often times mushrooms won’t work if you can’t let your guard down and just let your mind wander.

Assuming you are from a western nation, its crazy how much our educational institutions and culture push everyone to believe that the west is so superior and acts like they always have been. Its only since the age of exploration that western nations have taken prominent positions on the world stage. Lets say we are looking at the last 8,000 years of human history, industrialized western civ accounts for only 5% of that time. 

Its not a stretch to say that the center of world power has existed in Asia for 70%+ recorded history. That might be low depending on who you talk to. I mean the Assyrian empire was MASSIVE and it existed in 600 B.C. I suggest you also investigate the Achaemenid Persian empire because that one was also truely impressive. Where as the romans dominated their neighbors and took millions as slaves the persians culturally assimilated hundreds of different peoples and united them often diplomatically under one banner.

They do not have 51 votes, the necessary votes to have a simple majority. Y'all keep misreading the rules and regurgitating false information. It doesn't matter if only 36 Democrats and 25 Republicans are present (which makes it a quorum), a repeal of the filibuster will still need 51 votes to pass because it is a simple majority of the Senators in the United State Senate, not who are present.

Do you honestly think if all it took was 51 Senators being present to pass things with a simple majority, the GOP would've only used the reconciliation process to pass legislation from 2017-2019?",1622505719

"GamePhysics","t5_2viau","A lot of time wasters to pad out game length (as if the game is short, lol). There's a lot of meaningless side-quests which are hard to discern at first. They're part of the MMO quests that were left in after they changed direction. There's other time wasters like the War Table mechanic. There's a massive delay on it for no reason and I'd always rather just mod it out.

Even the way the game's loot is given is in such a measly way so as to make you grind for good loot. Certain weapons have a needlessly rare drop rate. Many shops don't sell higher tier items seemingly just to make you go further away to get them. Even the Inquisition Levels felt slowly meted out.

I hated the game when playing vanilla for these very reasons. It was very clear that the devs/publisher felt that the game's offerings weren't good enough so they just added filler and made it very tedious. Honestly, the game is incredible and removing that crap proves it. It didn't need to be artifically lengthened. The main content is substantial. Just skip the collectathon nonsense like shards.

[Here are the mods I used](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/ikjsut/the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly_of_returning_to/g3ovkbz/). Most of them are just to kill the tedium that they put in but a couple are just for personal preference like removing class restrictions.

EDIT: There's also a mod for decreasing the interval at which party triggers when you're travelling around. The vanilla has it set at some ridiculous 15 or 20 minutes. There's a mod to drastically reduce that to a couple of minutes like in DAO and DA2. I can't recall its name but it's on Nexus iirc.",1622505720

"classicwow","t5_3eb8a","Alright so a few things:

I don't play retail. This is not a trip down memory lane for me, I skipped BC and MoP pretty much entirely (did play wrath and cata mostly). Ironically I'm sticking around for BC classic because it's almost all new content for me.

&gt;Now every new player or person leveling an alt has to sit with the nagging feeling of why not boost and save a ton of time while they level in a dead world because everyone else boosts.

*Every* person huh? Every? On just my server alone (Windseeker), do you have any idea how many regular dungeon groups I was part of and/or saw going this past holiday weekend? And it wasn't just this past weekend either or just because of the pre patch either - I just spent the months of April and May leveling a druid to 58 and did every dungeon leveling up normally (save for BFD, couldn't find a group). Hardly had any issues finding groups for quests and dungeons and the world wasn't nearly as populated as the first 6mo of classic but it was far from dead also. Every time I lost an herb to someone who got there first I was a sad boi in a good way. The economy on Windseeker is also in fine shape.

I agree with you that mtx are not healthy for the game overall however I will say that I think tokens do hurt the market of the gold sellers which I am fine with. Less bots farming shit is cool with me.

I guess my point is that yeah, it fucking sucks that mtx are here and here to stay but I (and the 100+ people I play with over 2 guilds) don't allow it to ruin our enjoyment of the game. There are hundreds of thousands if not millions playing this game and still enjoying themselves without boosting or buying gold. This could be you too!

Like why would I give a shit if someone wants to pay $15 a month to play a game to then just pay more money to get ""ahead"" and not...actually...play the game...? Why would that bother me? That's fucking stupid as shit, but if people wanna do that, more power to them. It literally does not effect my experience in any, way, shape or form. I honestly just don't understand how the vocal minority's experiences are effected *so much* by this stuff. Just play the game like you would normally and enjoy it?

I don’t like the restriction of any headphones (even wireless), and *really* don’t like the audio quality loss from wireless sets. 

I eventually spent about $8k (after a very big discount) on a set of Klipsch 7.1 speakers. I felt a bit dumb buying them, but speakers are one of those things you can “buy for life”. They don’t get obsoleted with new tech. Just update your receiver twice a decade or so, and you can enjoy most everything.

Like I said before, if they’re counting on the standard diagnostic tests for the Covid-19 cases, then that means there’s a high false positive rate. So their estimates are far too high to say the least. They do say right in the study: “It is unknown ifCOVID-19 increases the risk of CVT and PVT.”
Also from the study: “However, causation cannot be demonstrated with the current study and residual confounding (e.g. increased medical monitoring directly after COVID-19 vs. a few weeks later) might contribute to this observation”. The observation they’re talking about is decreasing rates of CVT/PVT weeks after the covid-19 diagnosis, which would make sense if it was indeed causing increased risk. But because of the close monitoring of covid-19 initially with decreased follow up, it’s likely that rates of CVT/PVT would be lower regardless",1622505724

&gt;    https://reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/wiki/format

This is what your title should look like:
&gt;    *AGE [R4R] - Description*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your title:

**1. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. Replace the first ""R"" with your gender and the second ""R"" with the gender you're looking for:** 
&gt;    Use only **M**, **F**, **T** or **A** for tagging gender. Use any combination for couples: **MF**, **FF**, etc.

**4. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject:**
&gt;    *[META] - Description*

How I took it they just wanted to spend some time with OP and instead of handling it like an adult they just got pissy. They should apologise but it's an understandable feeling.

One time he got all spun out and decided he was going to trade these miniature horses he had for some ostriches and start raising them.. The guy he was trading to had told him to be careful, these ostriches are assholes.. 

Tweaker dude says, ""It's just a bird?""

Anyways, he drops off the horses and goes to load up the birds. One of the males is being an asshole, and he cant get it on the trailer.. It ends up flogging him. And he leaves it there..

In his spun out mind, he decides he's gonna go back and fight this ostrich. So dude has his wife duck tape some rakes to his hands and he goes back. LOL, he got his ass kicked by this ostrich. He ended up telling the old man that he was trading to ""keep the fucking bird""

Anyways, there's more to that story, but the thought of this dude getting his ass beat by a bird with rakes taped to his arms kills me..

I need to get him to write a book, but he'd be in prison for the shit they used to do... I know it sounds like bullshit, but other people have verified the shit he's done, and he is insane as fuck..

aim for an agi set, those are the bests sets at low level. Try to buy the items with overmaged vita on them : extra hp is super important at low levels.

"osureport","t5_3buwn","I can back this up too. I've taken  it upon myself to practice EZ recently just to see if that is a big deal or not. It all started 4 months ago and I've been playing EZ and nothing else since. And I can speak from experience now: improving at it is **PAINFULLY** slow. It's just awful. Just to put things into perspective: after 4 months of it I still struggle to get a decent combo/accuracy on 5\* jump maps, which are probably the easiest to read. Yes, it's **this** grindy. And that's EZ only, we're not even talking about EZHD, which is probably the hardest mod combination there is (excluding EZHTHD, obv). There's no ""I've suddenly realised that I'm good at reading"". It just doesn't work this way. You have to go through literal hell to learn EZ, let alone EZHD, it takes ages to become even remotely decent at it. You have to fucking commit to it. You either nolife the shit out of it or you'll never improve, there are no in-betweens and there's definitely no cutting corners with this skill set, it's this strict and demanding. There are no EZ prodigies.

Both approaches have their value. If you’re looking for something that feels more like a fight in a shonen series… off the top of my head: COPRA by Michel Fiffe, anything by James Stokoe, some of Walt Simonson’s Thor, Frank Miller’s Ronin or Sin City, Prophet by Graham / Dalrymple / Milogiannis, Glory or TMNT by Sophie Campbell.

I originally had 2 Lucilles in the deck and changed to 3 after a suggestion.  I think dropping it back to 2 copies with a higher value would make sense.  I imagined Lucille having more “charges” on it, so having the base value being higher should make up for it. 

Increasing the movement on Distraction is also a good idea.  I’m afraid to bump it up to 3, but I’ll try it at 2 and see how it goes.  

Eeny Meeny Miny Moe:  I understand losing the winning condition would make it more useful. I don’t want to have it be a exact clone of Wily Fighting if I can avoid it.  I’m going to try to think of a good alternative.

I can eat a bunch of things that I don't usually eat and be fine if it isn't near my period, or then I can eat safety foods and have everything get all messed up because of my period. Since I've started the new BC, things have been super wonky in that regard. 

I have tried cutting out other foods (dairy, weirdly, is completely fine during my period but not always great at other times) and I keep a food diary. Other than gluten and fried food, nothing has come up that's obvious, though I will be meeting with a nutritionist soon to come up with an elimination diet. 

But there's no way that food is what's causing my really severe flare-ups, based on everything I've kept track of. I think food issues account for some of my gastro issues, but not all of it.

If the Necrons so desired they could wipe out the Tyranids before most Imperial citizens woke up for breakfast, they just can't be bothered.

That said there is something funky in the Silent King lore with regards to his supposed ""trip"" and then return to the galaxy in M41, and that is that no Necron, absolutely nobody, has any idea who he is, ever was, or that he even exists. All memories and thoughts pertaining to the Silent King have been totally wiped from the minds of every Necron and Necron computer, which is highly suspicious. Even Chronomancers don't know who he is, which is weird given that they could literally travel back in time and find out firsthand.

"TOR","t5_2r36m","Where do I start?

##The ""deep web""

What you call ""deepweb"" are simplfixed on services. They are a tool for secure, private communication and have some advantages:

When connecting to a clearnet site your computer first has to perform a DNS query to get the servers IP address. This allows individual DNS server operators or much worse the used registrar or the TLD operator (basically the company that manages the registered domains for a top level domain like .com or .net) to either spoof or censor DNS records for the domain thereby giving them the ability to block the site. Onion services are censorship resistant and do not rely on DNS.

To establish an encrypted connection your browser somehow has to verify the authenticity of the site to make sure no one intercepts the traffic and impersonates the site. For clear net sites certificates issued by certificate authorities verify this. However this requires to trust the certificate authority. Onion services use a fingerprint of their public encryption key as their URL. That means the URL itself contains all information necessary to verify the authenticity of the site and no trust in third parties is required.

Tor hidden services are among others used by criminals, but so are a lot of things, this does not mean they are inherently bad or made for this purpose. They have a lot of use cases. Regular news sites like the BBC or the NY Times, search engines like DuckDuckGo, social media sites like Facebook, email providers like ProtonMail and many more have onion versions of their site.

##Tor and VPNs

You do not need a VPN for Tor. Tor provides anonymity regardless of the usage of a VPN, so using a VPN for Tor is unnecessary.

#Malicious exit nodes

Make sure to use sites over https so your connections to them are encrypted. When using https, the sites URL will start with https:// opposed to http:// and at the beginning of the URL bar a green lock will be shown. That way no eavesdropper can read or tamper the content of your connections. Do not download files and do not enter anything sensitive on insecure sites without https. This is important regardless of the usage of Tor.  
This does not apply for onion sites that have end to end encryption integrated and therefore do not need https for encryption.

This is kind of beside the point here, but it's a major pet peeve of mine.

Victims universally *have absolutely no legal say* in whether to ""press"" or ""drop"" charges. It has nothing to do with timing or Georgia law.

Police collect evidence and make arrests. Prosecutors choose which cases to pursue for indictments and convictions. Victims provide testimony to both.

The most a victim can do is to stop cooperating with the state, which unfortunately does happen often. But that is not ""dropping charges."" The state is free to continue its case on other evidence and testimony.

And in this particular case it sounds like Ozuna is dead to rights on responding officer testimony alone.

---

edit: Oh, and the PDF Rosenthal linked actually spells this out despite his butchering.

A. The victim in a family violence case cannot ""drop"" charges or ""press"" charges once the 
case is submitted to the prosecutor from the law enforcement agency. The decision
whether or not to proceed with prosecution of the case is made solely by the prosecutor.

B. Charges will be prosecuted without victim cooperation if there is deemed to be sufficient
independent evidence to prove the elements of the crime(s) without the victim's full
involvement.

C. Once subpoenaed, if a victim fails to appear in court he/she will be treated as any other
witness who fails to submit to an authorized subpoena. The case will not be dismissed
solely due to the victim's failure to appear.

D. The prosecutor will not offer or agree to reduce a family violence charge to a lesser
offense unless after a thorough investigation and a discussion with the victim it is
determined that the ends of justice are served thereby. This policy recognizes the
seriousness of this type of crime, and communicates that to the extent violent behavior in
the home is deemed criminal, it will not be tolerated.

E. Once an indictment has been returned, or an accusation has been filed, the prosecutor
will not move to dismiss the charges merely because a victim is reluctant to cooperate.
The case will proceed until the defendant either enters a plea or is tried by a judge or
jury.",1622505726

There are, once again, more skillful uses of your time.  Becoming so stubborn and averse to masturbation that it causes unwholesome thoughts and feelings is also not right, for what it's worth.  This kind of thing is something you should abandon after having thoroughly examined the drawbacks.  You might try asubha meditation, for example.  Regardless, total abandonment of sensual desire is something only realized as an anagami, when one is basically ""next door"" to full enlightenment.  It is quite a high realization, and not necessarily something you should aim for straight away.  Take it one step at a time.  Investigate the gradual path approach to The Buddha's teachings\*

&gt;I should meditate if I ever feel tempted and look what’s making me do these actions

That is certainly one way to approach it, yes.

&gt;Does this sum it up or is there more or something I said wrong

You have more work to do but you are on the right track :)

#How to identify these bots? 

#\- Often times, all their usernames follow the same format of some first and last names with some numbers at the end (ex. RodgerFelix437, NameName345). 

#\- They will post a link to a Twitter account to bypass Automod and spam detectors. Sometimes use some unknown forum sites to host links that redirect you to a Gearlaunch owned site. Gearlaunch is commonly known to not remove any content that is stolen and is used a lot to sell stolen art by these bot owners.

#\- They have also used PM to send Twitter links to people as well. 

#\- They have also been taking posts from subreddits and reposting them to gain karma to post in more subreddits with karma limits. Most noticably with a white boarder around the image. Other instances include flipping the photo to avoid spam detection.

#\- Titles of the post are usually just short sentences like ""love it"" being the most common, ""you want it"",  or other phrases. All usually because of poor english. 

#Do not buy from them, as they don't own the art and is often stolen and put onto a site that won't take it down (ex. Gearlaunch). Downvote, report, and feel free to tear them a new one in the comments if you would like.

#Mods, implement a karma and account age restriction on the subreddit to help mitigate these bots with Automod. I don't know any instructions on how, but I believe it can be searched for on Reddit easily.

we had such a difficult semester where i felt obligated to do all their workload, and did 90%. i also visited them for a week during which they had a major surgery. i sat there the entire time in the hospital ward with their parents, nauseously doing coursework on my laptop. when they got out of surgery, i helped them pee in the bathroom, talked to their mom, sat through their dad giving me creepy compliments about how im ""womanly"" and never told them. for the next 2 days, i helped them pee, eat and shit at home and advised them through their crying

combined with the coursework, it was the most draining thing i ever did. now when they talk about the health issue i really can't keep up with anything, so i try to listen but feel blank. im pretty drained and admittedly will try to avoid it if i can 

i feel guilty over feeling this way... i know they're dealing with the actual problem which they dont deserve, but yea, i do feel tired",1622505731

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","From what I've seen, the US safety regs are all over the place. Strict as hell in some ways, missing the obvious in others. In this case, the barrier works the way it does. The numbers I quoted are from practical testing to the US standard - they are what happens when the test crash occurs and real world results will be better or worse depending on the speed, mass and angle of incidence in the crash. Note that the heaviest test vehicle was only 8 tons while we have 60 ton truck and trailer units on the road. We don't generally design for them because 1. none of our test hardware is tested for this so we don't have any data to work with and 2. heavy vehicles of all types only make up about 10% of the vehicles on most roads with heavy HPMVs only a small fraction of them (again, in most locations)

They may have chosen to ignore the risk or pretend that the probability it low enough that they don't care if it happens but that doesn't mean it wont happen if the crash occurs. We're not entirely in the clear here either - until fairly recently, the test performance of these products was not understood or applied (still isn't by many of the people using them but its improving). 

Of course, the picture doesn't tell much of a story. For example, what is the speed limit on the bridge? that makes a huge difference to the results - in our case, it's an 80 km/hr motorway with high volumes of heavy vehicles. If the picture was closer to 50 then the numbers get a lot smaller. 

Interestingly, there's an article on RNZ today with an interview with the head of NZTA and they are saying exactly what I said - you'll need to take 2 lanes to make it work safely",1622505731

In my experience (wrapping up dedicated, finished UWorld, amboss, NBMEs 18-30), whether or not a disease is commonly seen in clinical practice and whether or not it is high yield for Step 1 are nearly irrelevant to each other. The goal is to understand and be able to differentiate between diseases, especially in terms of pathophysiologic mechanisms, risk factors (especially demographics). For your example, the vignette will give you clues on whether you should be thinking bacterial causes of endocarditis (tricuspid involvement, IVDU, fever, dental procedure) or sterile/marantic endocarditis (history/clues pointing toward malignancy, young female with a rash and/or lesions on both sides of the mitral valve for SLE).

 &gt;The sinking of Rainbow Warrior, codenamed Opération Satanique, was a bombing operation by the ""action"" branch of the French foreign intelligence services, the Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure (DGSE), carried out on 10 July 1985. During the operation, two operatives sank the flagship of the Greenpeace fleet, Rainbow Warrior, at the Port of Auckland in New Zealand on her way to a protest against a planned French nuclear test in Moruroa. Fernando Pereira, a photographer, drowned on the sinking ship.

I don't know about y'all, but it sounded to me like Omega misses NJPW. If not for all this Covid stuff, I'd like to think he would've been back there by now wrestling a match or two. If only he stayed, we could've seen him against Ibushi again, taking on Shingo, a more improved Jay White, and a Heavyweight Will Ospreay.

It totally depends on you as to how you want to proceed. There are multiple options. One is to find a calm mature stable mediator who can sit her down and ask her whats bugging. 

I often find labels such as she is jealous unhelpful. Their is always something deeper underneath. 

Now here is where it gets tough. Sometimes the underlying reasons have to do with very deep seated problems. And in that case very kind, gentle empathic professionals (therapists, empathic friends) are needed.

In your case, you are the target of her aggressive/abusive behaviour. You can also take a break from this friendship and look for healthier ones, as gently as possible. 

I just want to point out that, situations like this present opportunities. Either you guys will talk about it, solve the issues and become better friends or you will drift apart.

Like five days had gone by, the cat has eaten nothing and I had no clue what to do and really didn't want to tell my friend ""hey so yeah your cat died of starvation under my watch sorry bro"". So I tried some varieties of wet food. Poor cat ate up like three wet food cans immediately. Apparently between the ride from my friend's house to my house his cat decided it had a fancier palette than before. After that, sometimes it refused to eat wet food, sometimes it refused to eat dry food. It was a random cycle. Buddy claimed it mostly ate dry food before.

"linguistics","t5_2qhos","In English, why are prefixed and suffixed words mostly of Latin origin, not Germanic?

&amp;#x200B;

(reposting in the correct spot here)

Correct me if I’m wrong but I’m finding most of the most common prefixes and suffixes in English are of Latin origin, and the roots they attach to also tend to be of Latin origin.

And it seems like the English words of Germanic origin are more often the “simpler” words.

I’m aware that the prefixes be-/by- and un- are of Germanic origin. But co, pre, per, re, ad, abs, im, sub, de, dis, ex, inter.... all Latin. What gives!

Is this something to do with how Latin works vs how Germanic languages work? I’m not familiar with German. Does it also have words formed by combining roots with prefixes and suffixes? (Does every language??)

I’m also aware that more specialized and technical English tends to be more Latin-derived, but it doesn’t seem like that would entirely explain this, since so many of these prefixed and suffixed words are very common, everyday words.

IN SUMMARY - Why doesn't English have more germanic-origin words that are combinations and recombinations, the way so many of our latin-origin words are?

Exs. - reject, subject, deject, interject, object...  propose, expose, depose, postal, position

Do we have word groups like this of germanic origin? Anyone have examples?",1622505735

B4) **Vet your lenders! Be careful who you send your personal information to** A) Moderators strongly suggest requiring that a lender comment on your REQ post before you send them any personal information. Banned or ineligible lenders cannot comment here. B) CHECK your lenders r/borrow history by clicking [here.](https://www.loanmanager.co/lender-check/) Do this for every loan request you recieve. C) Are they **BLACKLISTED** or asking for **PROHIBITED ITEMS/INFORMATION** (see [THIS LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lender_blacklist_prohibited_info))? Message moderators immediately D) Are they eligible (90+ day account, 1000+ karma, not banned) and active (any big account activity gaps?). Ultimately, you are free to accept loans from any user though you do so at your own risk. Loans made with ineligible/banned users will not be tracked by LoansBot and you will not get credit for loans fulfilled by ineligible lenders, so proceed at your own risk

Please adhere to this rule or you will be banned!** Additionally, it is suggested that lenders take into account a user’s **current open loans and repayment history when considering funding a loan**. This includes a) do they have any repayment history? Extra vetting may be required if not, b) are they asking for loans while still having some out (this is not against the rules)? **It is encouraged and courteous to contact current lenders to inquire about open loans**, c) How much has a borrower repaid historically (in total) vs. how much do they have out now in total? ""Piling"", or lenders **continuously providing loans to borrowers with many already open loans, is highly discouraged** unless the borrower has a very solid repayment history

Hello, I'm dealing with some financial difficulty and I'm in need of a loan for living expenses. I have enrolled in college for the summer semester and I'm waiting on student loan disbursement, which will arrive Jun 24, and I'll repay with interest on that day.

I can provide proof of my loan acceptance and disbursement dates. Thank you.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Matthew 7 among many other passages are definitely about hypocrisy not simply being judgmental but there are some fairly clear on the subject.

James 4:11-12 - 
Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?

John 8:7 - And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.”

Titus 3:2 To speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all people.

Although like a lot of things in the bible there are passages saying the opposite.

Proverbs 31:9 - Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy.

John 7:24 - Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.

"scribblenauts","t5_2r1fg","Punctuation Plaza in PC: punctuation plaza is  where you upload and download objects in the wii u  version, however you can still access it in the steam version by hacking the game.
Lily in DS: in the ds games you can find a female Maxwell sprite in the game file, probably an early female playable character idea.
Unusude stadium: in Unlimited there is an unfinished level that can be accessed by hacking that is stadium themed.
Beta sprites: in the ds games you can find early versions of many NPCs in the game files.
Sambo: watermelon had a synonym that was Sambo, however this word is also a racial slur in some countries.
Maxwell is missing: you can find a picture of Maxwell in the milk box, kinda like those missing child milk pictures from the 80s and 90s.
Lily dies: a joke entry, in reference to an old Unlimited creepypasta really badly written and somewhat funny.
Fighting Words: a cancelled scribblenauts game for ios, it was going to be a rpg. There is a lot of leaked stuff if you search it up.
Drawn to life: its another game developed by 5th cell and also is about creating stuff and uses the sea serpent sprite from scribblenauts.",1622505737

It will give the FO pause when deciding whether to max Randle, perhaps taking next season as another chance to evaluate him. It will also hopefully serve as a confirmation that we are not done rebuilding and are still missing some pieces. I'm not 100% sure who we should bring back and for how much, but I think long term this series will provide a solid reality check for the FO to reevaluate some things. As much as I love this squad and all they have accomplished this year, we are not a contender and I think accepting there is still work to be done is a good thing",1622505737

You can definitely leave Feros for a bit and explore some other worlds - side missions will be a bit easier and offer you lots of experience and gear.  Otherwise, you can definitely push forward on this mission and you’ll start earning rewards as you kill enemies.

As far as squadmates, it takes some practice, but managing their positions and abilities helps a lot.

2. Rhythm's Gelato #33 CBD cart - When I'm really hyper-aware of how I'm feeling this is my favorite, and the best I've found for ADHD. Not too much one way or the other to send me into overdrive, always able to help pull me from a panic attack without me having to work too hard at it in my brain. The body high is amazing and cloudy-floaty if you keep puffing on it. My usual all-day cart is either rhythm's Hell's Fire OG CBD or cresco's 1:1 Remedy. I really miss rhythm's CBD Blue Dream carts which aren't really available around me. 

3. Calypso's Axilla flower - This smells so fkn good that I made a friend bring over some coffee grounds like B&amp;Body Works so I could keep smelling it like new again. Is great for those days when depression, anxiety, and ADHD are totally festering off each other. You can sit down and have a moment to smell the flowers rather than bitch there's bugs.

"Warhammer40k","t5_2rr81","I think others have given you good advice, but I'll add my own piece.  I've largely pulled away from the local community and only really focus on playing with friends.  Mainly, this is because I no longer enjoy playing Matched Play at all (competitively or not) and have chosen to focus entirely on a more narrative, laid back experience with friends.

I have two friends that would fall under a very similar situation as you have.

One friend that only has an army because I gave him one.  I collected this army for a while when I had the urge, then stopped.  Since I couldn't sell it for a value I deemed acceptable, I donated it to him to help him be able to play.  He's otherwise far too busy to partake in the hobby and would not engage in it at all.  Even then, he doesn't really have much interest in the hobby as a whole and would only engage it in because the rest of us are, as well.  He'd prefer to socialize through D&amp;D or other role-playing games, or online games.  I don't pressure him.  I don't bug him.  I ask him, I include him, I am more than happy when he wants to socialize with us and watch and if he wants to have a game, super!  Definitely likes Kill Team's smaller size than 40k proper.

A second friend that really likes the game, enjoys playing and LOVES collecting his Sisters (been collecting them for years, lots of the older metal models he regularly picks up on ebay).  Hates painting.  Absolutely hates it.  Almost refuses to do it.  Has a bunch of the newer Sisters, pretty much all still on sprue partially because of the pandemic 'break' from the hobby, partially because he doesn't wanna paint them.

My answer to him is: I don't care if they're painted.  I really don't.  I'd MUCH rather have him having fun with his friends and playing with his models than to be excluded because I'm forcing him to do something he hates.  My SOLUTION to him was to offer to paint some of his models, myself.  I don't want to brag, but I am a fairly decent painter and I do enjoy that aspect, especially when I'm home, alone (which is a lot for a social shut-in like myself).  I'm currently painting a sisters unit for him and it's a nice change of pace from my own stuff, and to have a unit that won't just be added to my growing collection on my own shelf.

The tl;dr on my two friends is that I include them but do not pressure them.  I offer to help and, in turn, get to use my own skills to give something back to my friends, allowing them to engage in this hobby in more ways than they could have were they to only do so, themselves.

Of course, I won't tell anyone to paint up a whole Tau army and then just give it away.  That's just me.",1622505740

&amp;#x200B;

There are people who say ""Ricky and Nini have no story, they're boring"" i don't get it. What they are doing about how to manage a long distance relationship is an excellent plot that doesn't need a love triangle (that not only is cliche it is also boring, in my opinion).

Even if Ricky develops a crush on Gina while Nini is away, that will always be the key of their relationship... ""When Nini is not around, I notice ..."", i don't know why they want Gina to settle for Ricky to look at her when his girlfriend is not there or when he breaks up with his girlfriend.

Gina is cool, she is badass, she is insightful, don't make her keep Ricky's crumbs ... even if Rini breaks up, a part of Ricky will always want Nini and vice versa.

I know there's a part of Ricky that's like ""OMG I HATE CHANGE, I'LL HANG ON TO THE FAMILIAR THING"", but that's not the only thing that glues him with Nini, it's sad that people can't see how they manage to make each other happy. I hope it doesn't end up Ricky/Gina, mostly because the shippers are rude and i think Gina deserves better and also Rini.. Why building up Rini in s1 for nothing?",1622505740

#How to identify these bots? 

#\- Often times, all their usernames follow the same format of some first and last names with some numbers at the end (ex. RodgerFelix437, NameName345). 

#\- They will post a link to a Twitter account to bypass Automod and spam detectors. Sometimes use some unknown forum sites to host links that redirect you to a Gearlaunch owned site. Gearlaunch is commonly known to not remove any content that is stolen and is used a lot to sell stolen art by these bot owners.

#\- They have also used PM to send Twitter links to people as well. 

#\- They have also been taking posts from subreddits and reposting them to gain karma to post in more subreddits with karma limits. Most noticably with a white boarder around the image. Other instances include flipping the photo to avoid spam detection.

#\- Titles of the post are usually just short sentences like ""love it"" being the most common, ""you want it"",  or other phrases. All usually because of poor english. 

#Do not buy from them, as they don't own the art and is often stolen and put onto a site that won't take it down (ex. Gearlaunch). Downvote, report, and feel free to tear them a new one in the comments if you would like.

#Mods, implement a karma and account age restriction on the subreddit to help mitigate these bots with Automod. I don't know any instructions on how, but I believe it can be searched for on Reddit easily.

But beyond that, your logic isn't even completely sound. The reason the conference finals was technically the ""second round"" for the Lakers in 76-77 was because they clinched a first round bye due to being the 1 seed in the West. You've done all you can not to address that season because there's no way you can use it to knock Kareem.

Meanwhile, again, the year after Kareem retired when all the other key pieces of Showtime were intact and Magic was in his prime, he lost in the conference semis, a second round exit. How is that not extremely relevant to the debate over which player was more important to Showtime? And if you admit it is, then why do you keep refusing to address it?",1622505742

I was dating this chick like two weeks. She wanted to rape rp. We had a safe word. Ten seconds in she says stop. Why did she say it? Because that’s how the role play works. That’s why we created the safe word, to allow her to say stop.

"bloodbowl","t5_2r6pl","Street cred: My dark elves are 4 seasons old and are heading into the best of 32 round in the REBBL playoffs. Take the following with a grain of salt, it's all my personal experience.

I played three seasons with an assassin on the team. I went through 5 assassin's, including one with the dream skill Multi-Block.

Every team the assassin wants to base and threaten with stab is too agile and fast, or it's stabbing something well bellow the assassin's price tag. I can count on one hand the number of times I used stab across 4 seasons on turns other than my drive.

Every team the assassin wants to zone with Shadowing hits too hard. I caught loads of folks by surprise because they simply forgot about Shadowing, but then they'd roll the dice and walk away anyway, or make sure a Shadowing followup would be into a fist. Shadowing is a phenomenally good skill on a MA+ Blitzer or Witch (or Runner). Hell, it's even halfway good on an orc blitzer. It's awful on an Assassin.

The only role for an Assassin in my book is as a lightning rod (for wizards and blitzers) when you are going double Witch Elf.

Runners have a place on the team. Having a fast ball carrier that can focus on evasion rather than burning a Blitzer or Witch on ball duty is great. I'd probably skip any passing skills on him, but Sure Hands and Dodge would be solid enough. And Dump Off does force your more daring opponents to commit more players than normal. Wardancers have no idea what to do when diving the cage let's me move the ball. To a blodgestepping blitzer on the corner. The Runner is also a fine safety letting you take Wrestle on an MA7 player that isn't a Witch.

That said, the Runner is only as good as your Blitzers, so I'd hold off until it's your 13th (and last) player and your Blitzers are level 3+.

If you want to buck the norm, I've found taking Wrestle on both Witch's to be a lot of fun and pretty solid. Getting some leap on then also let's you pull off some really exciting sacks and chain pushes. I do like the Runner as the 12th or 13th man on a well developed team.",1622505742

In my experience reading peoples opinions online and from many friends, a lot of people play the early stuff which is slow and get bored and then come back later on and get further in and enjoy it. Everyone is different though.

I forget the name of the quest, I think it's called the grave hoard, but after you've done the main missions in the desert city you will have a main quest that will take you to a snow covered place with big story ramifications.

"SquaredCircle","t5_2sljg","The rules being made up really doesn't matter, it's just the basic premise of pro wrestling. Same with how tons of moves don't actually hurt as much as they're sold but we buy it because they look cool, or how people can last in submissions forever. It's a normal part of fiction, no different from just accepting the laws of physics are different so your sci-fi story can have people travelling unrealistic distances. That's where suspension of disbelief comes in on the part of the viewer. It comes in on the part of the writer when they stick to whatever rules they have established so the world they're presenting feels coherent.

It's not like the details of the rules have to be super logical from an outside perspective for it to make sense that they're taken seriously in the story. Lots of real sports have odd rules, but no one thinks it's strange for them to be enforced. The UFC doesn't allow people to grab the cage or the opponents shorts, even though intuitively it makes sense that you can use the cage to your advantage (you already can in some ways) or what the opponent is wearing. Offsides rules in soccer or hockey don't really make any sense beyond trying to enforce certain tactics and prevent others. And in football a catch counts as in bounds if both feet touch in bounds even if you fall out, which doesn't exactly feel like it's in bounds but we accept that it is for whatever reason (probably because it allows for great highlight reel catches). Hell, hockey has had goals called back because a coach challenged that the other teams player used a stick with an illegal curve and was right, which never gets challenged except when a goal is scored. The rules don't have to be above all possible question, they just need to be applied consistently. Because in the story, pro wrestling is as real as any of those other sports that (try to) consistently apply even their weirdest rules.",1622505743

"LabourUK","t5_30c1v","There are plenty of things which could affect my behaviour to harm other people. Prevent and punish people when they harm/attempt to harm other people. You don't punish people for doing things that *might* result in harm, that's not congruent with the goals of punishment. 

And what do ""special hospitals for drug addicts"" accomplish? You're still choosing to threaten the alienation of a section of the population who *require* acceptance in order to escape their current situation. If you are addicted to drugs, the absolute last thing you need is the threat that if you return to society, attempt to get help, you will have your autonomy removed.

Numerous studies have shown that reduced police funding in favour of social services do far more for reducing crime in comparison to increased police funding, and ""broken windows"" tactics. The latter tactics do nothing but promote cultures of conflict between communities and the police, while the former actually promote a culture of cooperation. The state should exist for the benefit of the people, not as a force which they should have to be wary of, which is what currently exists in many marginalised neighbourhoods (the neighbourhoods where improved cooperation between the community and the state is most necessary).",1622505745

Lowest I accept is a 6 dollar payout, if the mileage is higher than the payout then I decline it, if it's a shop order then I decline it.

Apparently a decent way to go about it is to divide the amount you plan to make for the day by the amount of hours you want to work for that day, then divide THAT by the amount of orders you average an hour. That final number should be the lowest payout you'll accept. Got all that from DoorDash Diaries on YouTube.

So for me, I divide 100 by 72, and divide that by 3, getting me 5 something which I round to 6.

EDIT: sorry for my stupidity, meant i divide 100(the amount i plan to make a day) by 6(the latest hours i want to ideally work that day), and the result of that by 3(the amount of orders i average an hour), which the result of gets rounded up to 6 dollars an order. I don't usually get to actually do 3 orders an hours with each paying out at least 6 dollars, either i get shitty orders that pay less than that all day, or i get fuck all. more often than not i work over 6 hours and barely make 72 even on 8 hours a day, its not often i get 100 a day, even if i stop being so picky. shit sucks.",1622505745

Original Post: 

&gt; My step-mother is not the legal guardian of my brother or I, is the legal guardian of my sister, and birth mother of my step sister.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We have two car loans, a mortgage, a home improvement loan for windows, and 5 credit cards in my stepmothers name. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; What will I be responsible for?

But the building owner and/or the renter who was using the building at the time have every right to remove that for any reason (well, owner/lessee relationships could complicate that statement, as well as if they had some kind of contract with the artist, but thats all speculation).

"NameThatSong","t5_2svj1","Your post was automatically removed because we require the **post titles to be more descriptive**, to make it easier for the helpers to figure out if they might be able to help or not, and to act as a TL;DR.

*Side note before resubmitting: if you have a recording of the actual song you can summon the bot* **RecognizeSong** *by adding u/ before its name and including the link in your comment (timestamped link if needed, no link needed for video posts)*

Please post with a title that fits one of these 3 options depending on your question:

**1. For identifying a song/artist/album** - please include at least one of these details in your title:

`Era | Genre/Style | Artist type or Artist name | Music video information | Source name | Language | Lyrics`

* Note that the safest way to make sure your post is accepted is to include at least one of the relevant keywords with a colon (Lyrics:, Source name:, Music video:, etc.)  
* If you know many of the details *don't overload the title* - only include the most important/unique details, and put the rest inside the post.

`Examples of titles that will get accepted:`

    - 90's song by an alternative rock band (male singer/s)
    - Ballad by a female singer, sounds like it's from the 80's
    - Music video where a guy is walking in the street towards the camera {=Bittersweet Symphony btw}
    - Upbeat Latin song
    - Meme video of a cat bobbing its head to a beat
    - Calm piano instrumental
    - Source name: [the name of a film/show/YouTuber/etc. Please don't put a url as the detail here]
    - Lyrics: [the lyrics you remember]

`Titles that aren't descriptive enough:`

    - What's the background music in this video?
    - I forgot the name of this popular song

**2. For identifying a genre** you should use a format like:

    - What's the genre of the song ""Title"" by Artist?
    - What's the sub-genre of this electronic background music?

**3. For locating an already identified song/album in a legal way** you should use a format like:

    - Help locate ""Song/Album Title"" by ""Artist"" [replace the quoted text with the actual details]
    - Where can I buy/stream ""Song/Album Title"" by ""Artist""?

##Make sure you've read the [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NameThatSong/comments/cu0x42) before posting, and good luck :)

So pretending week 12 and the Super Bowl would’ve been the same is ridiculous. Bucs had a completely different game plan in the super bowl. Their secondary treated Hill differently. Their offense ran differently. So pretending that all means nothing and the o-line would’ve shifted the game is delusional. 

As I said. Go watch the tape. The bucs secondary blanketed Hill. He was never open. The game plan was to deny him the ball completely. Whether Mahomes was able to sit in the pocket or be on the move was irrelevant to whether or not Hill was open at any point. Our corners pressed him. We had at least one safety spying him. And our linebackers fell back into coverage more often. We weren’t letting hill go off. It wasn’t happening. We determined to focus our entire scheme against hill and let Kelce go 1v1 with David most of the game and let him eat up 8-15 yard gains, rather than Hill get 200 yards again. Lol. So while the O-line problems made the game 31-9. A healthy o-line wouldn’t have shifted our game plan from Hill. He wasn’t getting the ball for big gains. And the chiefs had no answer for our offense. We ran all over them and Brady methodically dismantled them with our tight ends and running backs. Even if we gave up 20, we just would’ve got the ball and scored more.",1622505748

"mauramurray","t5_3a8p6","I \*think\* there is a small possibility there was a tandem driver.  I have no evidence just knowing most college kids don't have money or time to take a solo trip during the school year.  When I think of college kids taking vacations I think of Spring Break. She had enough alcohol for two. Perhaps this was an older man a secret relationship they were hiding. Two cars so they were not seen together until the accident changed that plan.  The other driver doubled back when Maura wasn't following.  Maura turned down a ride from Butch so I am not sure she would jump in the next random passing car.  Although Butch has said (I heard he said) his appearance is not one that makes you want to jump in his vehicle.  There are not even that many cars on that road at that time of night.  To find the rare car with a killer would be extremely unlucky but also unlucky is two accidents in a few days.

There is no evidence of a tandem driver and there would probably be some type of electronic record, phone, or computer messages.  

So my main theory is the simplest one she saw the police lights coming and jumped into the woods.  She ran and walked until she was overcome by the elements.  It is strange there are no footprints and nothing has ever been found after all the searching that was done.",1622505750

"autism","t5_2qhs6","I can tell you what worked well for my son and our family.

We weren't concerned with things like stimming, that sort of behavior doesn't really have milestones and in my opinion can be left to a child to address or not, in their own good time (provided it's not self-harming).

In interviewing every therapist / clinic in the city it became apparent that they had some wildly different approaches and ideas about ABA. At some point during this process and doing a lot of reading, it occurred to us that at a basic level, every discussion about how to parent is a discussion about ABA.  The same for teaching. With that in mind, it gets baffling how some therapists think punishment is a good way to 'modify' behavior. 

Eventually we found a therapist who explained their approach like this (paraphrasing),

""If you burn your hand in a fire, you won't stick your hand in again, so you'll find therapists who think this is great because it sounds fool-proof. They'll take this observation and tell you to punish your child if they take a toy from a playmate. What they failed to consider is that things that elicit feelings also build associations beyond that immediate interaction. ""

""Punish a kid for taking a toy and they will not only build an unfavorable association with taking the toy, but also with playing with other children or playing in general. On the other hand, if you reward them when they share, or even for having self control, you build favorable associations with playing, sharing and socializing, all of which are hugely beneficial to a child's ability to interact later in life.""

At a glance, therapy for our son looked like one-on-one school. 'Lessons' were speech, math, reading and writing - bearing in mind he started at two and a half - so math started as counting, reading started as learning letters etc, and since he was non-verbal at the start that was all very slow. The point wasn't so much the lessons as it was having fun while doing them - that was EVERYTHING. His therapist made it fun for him, and that was the ABA - the building of joy into social interaction and into those types of activities which often become a frustration when a kid on the spectrum starts school.

He learned the value of language because it became the most expedient way to get the things that made him happy. He learned the value in social interaction in a way that I still struggle with. I think if you approach therapy with that mindset it will be great for you and your clients. Best of luck!",1622505750

"ISRO","t5_2u3ww","Arguably India would be one of the most space capable countries to join so far. Ukraine has some awesome history and JAXA is reasonably capable. NZ is emerging with Rocket Lab. 

But many of the other partners have very limited capabilities. Australia signed and has some small commercial space companies but no launch capability and basically no government space program. South Korea is at least developing a launch vehicle and despite having a very sophisticated electronics and industrial base still has a long way to go.

Some of the ISRO launch vehicles might be a bit dated and uncompetitive with the latest commercial vehicles but there would be lots of expertise for building experiments and equipment. The USA and China may have dominated the news with their Mars rovers but Mangalyaan was still a very impressive achievement and would be well beyond the capabilities of most of the other signatories.

India will have to decide if it is in their interests or not. I think Artemis is a bit of a mess, the gateway is a distraction and Orion and SLS need to cancelled but it is all limping forward. Without Russia or China any agreement risks being dominated by the US and potentially divisive. It may also be an opportunity.",1622505752

My first IEM was a Fiio and was nearly my last. The ear tips have a big effect on the sound, tips with a wide hole tend to enhance the treble so it will be bass light.

I spent my life as a serial job hopper and was even doing multiple jobs at a time because simply didn’t know what I wanted to do. I managed to get a degree in Human Development (after 3 Major switches) because I like people. I even started a business but it only lasted a few years. 

The funny thing was that this entire time I had been involved in a teaching, training, coaching, or other type of mentoring field as a volunteer or worker for over 13 years. I only realized this after my business failed. I refuse to be a K-12 a teacher in the US because I watched my mom suffer through that, so my journey took me to Asia, where my lifelong variety of experiences has proven to be extremely useful. Unfortunately I am still loaded with debt because of previous life choices and indecision.

First off, congrats on the completed story.

**Overall:**

I think I read part 2 or 3, then 4 and 5. I'll briefly echo what others have said, this was fun. 

I'll also echo that over all it feels very brief. I think some of DA's strength was drawing out an absurd scene that I would have made a one off joke about to the length of one of these segments. I'm again thinking of the whale, or Trillian floating, or the flying stuff, or the part where ford survives the thing meant to show the true scale of the universe. 

**Titanic jokes:**

Of the sections I read, the titanic jokes, were I think the best of all the comedy, that of course being subjective. I felt like it was just such an absurd premise, and the way they met up with the sci-fi theme worked well. 

**Character humor:**

I think the character jokes were mostly on appearance, but I am not sure they landed with me as well. This is a note entirely in retrospect and mostly about part 4, so don't worry too much. If you do a revision, just think about it and see if you agree, and if not, let it go. I'm probably wrong.

**Characters:**

The parts I read had relatively little characterization outside of the dialogue, and that's probably fine in a comedy piece of this length. I would not worry too much about it.

**Plot**:

I'll also agree with others that the action comedy balance seems a bit off but I think in any story the plot demands so many words, like to have a plot happen, much less one with different parts as you have done, eats up a bunch of the word count. I would probably pad this out with some extra comedy but not much extra plot. First time in my mind I have ever suggested padding.

**Scenes/settings:**

This feels pretty rapid fire. I think we probably visit a few too many places, and the amount of atmosphere that can be built is very little given the length and number of places. Not sure it matters too much again.

**In conclusion:**

Look, for real, it was fun in a harmless and thanks for all the fish sort of way. I still think to get to Adam's in a closer way its a dial the absurd to like over 9000. 

If there is anything else you would like me to comment on please let me know, I'm happy to help, even if its laaaaaaate.",1622505754

"newfoundland","t5_2qzqt","Oh God, there are so many that can be recommended based upon your budget and what you are looking for. 

If it is an AWD SUV that you are considering then you can't go wrong with a Honda CRV or Toyota RAV4. 

If FWD is what you decide on then there are many options. Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla probably being two of the more popular. 

And just to throw it out there... if you want a true 4WD that is good in the winter and offers fun in the sun during the summer, go with a Jeep Wrangler. It's not my recommendation as the perfect vehicle, but you can't argue with the appeal; classic good looks, go anywhere attitude, and removable roof / doors adds a touch of chic.",1622505755
"uberdrivers","t5_2yzxz","Those are the quick trips that only net you a $3 per ride for that ride and like $2 minimum if it's really quick. You still have to factor in wait time, traffic and minimum 5 min drive pickup time. So if you did 4 rides it still like 20 mins spent trying to pick someone up and that's if nobody made you wait and you were able to min max time spent on trip. Allotting 5 mins waiting pickup time for each trip that's upto 40 mins not on trip. I've never been able to do more than 4 rides an hour. It's not often that stars align and you get efficient drives. Also Uber pool fucks those numbers up and only gives you like 0.80 cents per pickup but you put extra weight in your car and have to drive out of the way to pick them up too and wait if they are not there. Uber charges those pool riders a little discount taking the lion's share but all you get for working extra is $0.80 I'm not sure what the math is anymore. Still gotta factor in gas and often the short trips have you running back and forth with more miles. If you see the math Uber often charges rider like 30 bucks or more for all 4 rides but you only get milage rate $0.65 and you get something like 12-14 bucks and Uber takes the rest. Hopefully there is tips and surge but that's not always the case +90% don't tip and how much of a tip do you expect for a $3 trip but uber charges $10 and most riders thinks your are getting way more than you are. Uber drivers hate quick trips for a reason, not as profitable in the long run.",1622505755

The real question is what happens when Sarah steady sells just before each crash and repurchases when the crash ends. Sarah also got an 8 year headstart before the others even put a penny in the market. 

In conclusion, it was a fabulous read. However, it's not really a fair fight and a 4th person should be introduced just for fun to beat Sarah. Sarah is nice and all, but her friends are stupid.",1622505755

Rather, you need to speak with charge nurse that witness the interaction or the head nurse for that floor directly and how you came across this nickname and how it make you feel.

Rather then working against them, work with them to resolve this conflict and tell them how it makes you feel. Make sure to document afterwards of the interaction such as follow up email thanking for their time and how it was important to discuss about the so called nickname etc.

Not an expert on weathering myself, but if you got the time and paint a Juggernaut again, here's a few ideas of mine you could consider ;)

* If you are going for the effect of it being used for a long time, try painting some panels in a slightly brighter color to make it look like they have been replaced. 
* The lower a part is, the more dirt it gets. Especially the legs and underside. 
   * Once done with that, you could try and make it look like something blew up near it and sprayed a bunch of mud onto the Juggernaut. 
* Try making a scratch across the side of the cockpit (careful not to penetrate the plastic) to make it look like it took a grazing hit from an Ameise. 
* ""Armor"" is made of aluminium, so you could try making it look like the paint chipped off in places
* You could try making the legs look like they've been used a lot. Put a bunch of scratches onto them, especially their underside, to indicate wear and tear. 
* Next to moving parts, try to emulate oil stains. You know, some oil leaking from the joints and such. 

(all this is of course purely optional, just some random suggestions on my part)",1622505756

Here's where we get to that part where I said that in general, we get less concerned with other folks' opinions about the parts of ourselves that don't harm anybody else. I know that doesn't give you an easy solution that will solve everything in the next few days or weeks. Unfortunately, there just isn't any such a solution, really.

But this is what I mean about critiquing your own thoughts, pretty carefully.

Here's the shitty, unfortunate truth:

You probably will disappoint some of the people in your life, if it turns out you're gay, or bi, or otherwise not straight. You probably will. That's just a fact of life that *most* of us have had to deal with at one point or another.

I will always be a disappointment to my mom. That was incredibly hard, and incredibly painful to think about when I was your age.

As I've gotten older, it's gotten a lot easier for me to recognize that her problems with my queerness are her problems. There's a saying I like: ""Other people's opinions about me are none of my business.""

It's true, in its own way: whatever other folks think about us, really, it doesn't often have much or anything to do with us, and even if it *does,* it's not our responsibility to deal with their issues, whatever they may be.

That's not to say that where you're at isn't hard, or that you can just easily deal with any of this. None of this is easy. I know that, as deep down to my bones as you probably do. I've been there.

So, try to unpack that thought in your head: say you disappoint someone in your life, because you're gay (or bisexual, or whatever identity ends up being the right fit). Say you *do* disappoint someone.

What happens then? Just you being gay, all by itself, who have you hurt? Have you stolen from somebody, cheated them out of their savings, or beaten somebody with a pipe and taken their shoes? I know you said you're not worried about harming somebody, but you still feel like you're doing something *wrong*. Well. Okay. What does that *mean,* really? What's wrong with you being gay? Because it's lying, cheating, stealing, or harming anyone? What *makes* it wrong? 

Because you'll disappoint your parents, or others? 

Okay. Your mom, or your dad, or somebody in your life that's important: say they *do* come to you in a few weeks or a few months, after you tell them, and they say they're disappointed. What happens then? Will you stop being same-sex attracted? (I can tell you from experience, probably not.) What if their disappointment is *their* thing, that they have to work through, and not your responsibility?",1622505758

"wildrift","t5_24knsa","Unless you're really fed, you don't really want to roam to a 0-4 lane. Their opponent will likely be fed and hard to kill. You're more likely to give a double kill than successfully gank that lane. You're better off helping snowball the other lanes.

Generally, you roam when two things are met: 

1. Your lane opponent can't capitalize on your absence.
2. Your lane opponent can't follow you easily.
3. There's a gankable lane.

As such, most roams are done after quickly clearing the wave against someone with poor wave clear. That way, if they follow you they're giving up a large amount of minion kills. It creates an opportunity and you also gain vision on them since the lane is pushed. They also can't quickly push to your tower and damage it.

It's not worth roaming most of the time if the side lanes are pushed heavily. You want either the enemy in the ganked lane to be overextended or low enough on health to kill them before they can retreat underneath their turret. Conversely, you don't generally want to gank if your ally is low on health. They're likely to die and nullify the benefits of the roam.",1622505758

As I and I'm sure others have mentioned, they're not finished all of the mechanics yet and this is only temporary. But as such there are still measures right now that you can take to counter and avoid it. But what you're not considering is without it, there are no mechanics to help track your targets right now so without this temporary mechanic how would bounty hunting work?

&gt; It is hate, because the response to genuine griefing is responded to resoundingly with hostility and ridicule.

No, it's just people who disagree with your opinion on this. for instance, IMO if you had a bounty and a bounty hunter came after you to claim it that is in no way griefing. If that happens, shoot back.

In the case of my comment above about doing the crime and doing the time it was clearly done in jest. And I sure hope you didn't think I was calling you an asshole when I posted a clip from Liar Liar starting Jim Carrey.

AU033ED is the display I'm using, which may not be the same as what you're using. In terms of ""detecting"" the display, it is already done via that command in the script....go back and read my explanations in my previous post. If the display is turned on, it is considered as ""active"" and will return a value of ""true"".

`(((Get-CimInstance -Namespace root\wmi -ClassName wmiMonitorID) | where {$_.InstanceName -like ""*AUO33ED*""}).Active) -eq ""true""`

&amp;#x200B;

You don't need to put an if statement under the else. You can just do something like this:

  
  
`if ((((Get-CimInstance -Namespace root\wmi -ClassName wmiMonitorID) | where {$_.InstanceName -like ""*AUO33ED*""}).Active) -eq ""true""){`  
  
`start """" "".\Launch Display Config for TV Hidden.vbs""`  
  
`}`  
  
`if ((((Get-CimInstance -Namespace root\wmi -ClassName wmiMonitorID) | where {$_.InstanceName -like ""*AU022DF*""}).Active) -eq ""true""){`  
  
`start """" "".\Launch Display Config for Desk Display Hidden.vbs""`  
  
`}`

&amp;#x200B;

Also, you're mixing Powershell and VBS. I don't know how you're running this, but make sure you understand that you cannot run VBS command in a Powershell console and you cannot run Powershell commands in VBS or .BAT. Technically, you can, but not if you run the commands raw. The script above **might** work if you save and run it as a .PS1 (powershell script). I said might because I don't know what your .vbs script looks like or what it does. I can only  say 100% certain that the commands I provided for Powershell work fine within Powershell.

Eventually at night we would take her to poop right before bed and would stay until she pooped (we have a yard so this was easier for us not sure about your outside area) that means up to 30 minutes outside no joke. Eventually it worked, and now she can roam the house at night no problem. You might also have to crate your dog at night to solve this issue.",1622505760

"PrincessesOfPower","t5_mv490","I am glad that (unlike many others in this subreddit) you aren't piling everything on Catra.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**it is undeniable she knew it would cause a lot of harm (in the form of more horde soldiers to fight the war), and did it with the intention of destroying the Princess Alliance/Adora/Shadow Weaver.**

As you point out, Catra explicitly and repeatedly said that she wanted to destroy Shadow Weaver and the princesses.  Catra never mentioned that she intended to cause harm to other people.  SW and the princesses are practically the entire fighting force of the rebellion, so without them, would there even be a war?

It is also important to take into account that Catra did not know about Horde Prime or that the galactic Horde was a mindless cult of clones, very different from the Etherian Horde.  I suspect that she would have been less enthusiastic about opening the portal if she did know.

&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**I think there are other three people responsible: Entrapta, Hordak and Shadow Weaver.**

Another responsible person is Adora:  Adora was the one who told Catra that opening the portal will ""bring the rest of the Horde army through to Etheria"", but never warned Catra that the previous She-Ra destroyed the planet's portal capabilities. Adora warned Entrapta about the true dangers of the portal (""The last She-Ra made it so we could never open another portal. Trying could destroy everything.""), but somehow neglected to tell Catra.  Ironically, despite trying to beat Adora by opening the portal, Catra was acting on incomplete information given to her by Adora.",1622505760

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","So I agree with the idea but putting one of the best exotics behind an activity only 10% { I believe that's the number} of the community will do is not how bungie wants to operate. That said most raid/endgame exotics are fairly lackluster with the only exceptions being Xeno, Anarchy, Divinity, and Eyes of tomorrow {but only in gambit}. 

I think alot of these Exotics could get the push they need from a good Catalyst like you were saying but you have to shift your expectations slightly.

Tarrabah's would probably just be charging the perk faster, which might actually make it useable.

Mythoclast already has one, but they have recently shown a willingness to change catalysts with the Mida catalyst being changed from outlaw to no distractions so there is hope.

Ace won't be changed because that was how the perk functioned originally and was nerfed for the crucible.

I have a lot of thoughts about your 1k Voices Catalyst idea. It sounds awesome and completely broken, like crash other players computers broken and out DPS every other weapon in the game. I would advocate for just firing continuously until the magazine empties then you have to reload, pulling ammo from reserves is too strong.

Anarchy just needs any catalyst so I can track my kills and make orbs. Even just a mag increase or field prep would be welcome.

Acrius just needs a bit of a damage buff, its basically just a sword with less ammo and no blocking

Whisper of the Worm can never have its original perk back because it ruins the Heavy ammo economy and bungie would never do that. but a precision damage buff would get the job done nicely.

Divinity's catalyst just has to be 4th times the charm and it becomes way better to hold the trigger than to tap fire.

Eyes of Tomorrow I think did have its boss damage reduction removed but does need a slight damage buff. It already 1 shots 4 guardians in a single burst, no more harm can be done.",1622505761
"movies","t5_2qh3s","&gt; All this being said, it may sound strange, but I actually still like the books. They don't really have a legitimate place in the modern world, and should probably be quietly left to gather dust on the shelf. But I'm conflicted about it, because they are also great adventure stories of a type that isn't really written any more. I can understand the motivations of the people who tried to produce Bowdlerized editions that removed the racism, but you just can't: it's too essential to the characters and story.

Alan Moore's work in comics has done the best job handling this I've yet encountered. He simultaneously pays homage to the wonderful naive adventuresness of the genre, while lampooning its over-the-top colonialist zeal.

His handlng of Lovecraft's foibles is much the same.",1622505761

This is especially necessary if it’s a very old coating of paint, because the paint will have faded, dulled, etc. 2) match the exact product, color, and sheen through the information you have. Perhaps through homeowner records, or the paint can in the basement. If you happen to have an account at Sherwin Williams it tracks your purchases for (I believe) 7 years. They can go into your account and exactly copy what can of paint you got from previous purchases. If you get a custom match at SW they can also save it in your account so you have the color/product info for future reference.",1622505762

Some people are friends of convenience, and it sucks realizing that when you thought you were real friends.

The roads we've built result in a lot of deer deaths. Sometimes it's because we hit them with our vehicles. Sometimes they seem confused by roads, so they are left standing there with no cover and no traction. Should we just let them figure it out, let their ""new nature"" determine their fate? Or should we save a deer when we get a chance, given that we've killed so many of them? Hard to say.

I understand that in any given natural situation, usually the best thing we can do is stay out of it.

"Pets","t5_2qh6o","There's a chance someone came across the  injured cat and brought it to a local vet, you should call all vets in the area.  But if the cat was badly injured, it's likely he needed immediate care and could have went somewhere and passed away.    You should look everywhere, calling his name, and listening for a faint meow.  He probably hasnt' eaten, and is in pain so it could be a very whispery meow.  Clang on a can of cat food, be loud.  Let the neighbor know what happened, so they can keep an eye out in case he is still in their yard just hid away from sight, if they hear something they could let you know, or if you do hear something at night, they will know why you're poking around.   If your neighbor hears a faint meow right now he may not think much of it, might assume it's a stray, but if he knows you are looking for a cat that would change things.I don't think you're a shitty owner, I had a similar situation, and I hesitated but went into the backyard of my neighbor and looked for my cat.  My neighbor has a gun he shoots often at things that are on his property so I was so nervous I was shaking and looking up at the house.  I was able to get my cat though, and we ran out of there. The neighbor didn't know I did it, but I told him what I did the next day, and said was sorry but I had to go into his yard, he understood.  If things had gone badly though, the neighbor could have thought I was a burglar and shot me, so I still don't know if what I did was the right thing, either, it's just hard to know what's appropriate when looking for your pet",1622505766

"ProgrammerHumor","t5_2tex6","&gt; I said that Unix way contradict with the requirements from desktop system would have from non-tech user

Care to elaborate? I know OG unix wasn't a desktop operating system, it was created before the concept of a ""desktop"" was a thing - but so was DOS and windows, and in fact, the FIRST desktop that ever existed, was unix-based. windows just adopted it afterwards, Apple invented the concept of a GUI. You seem to be saying that the unix design is inherently worse for desktop, yet provided no backing that concerned Unix in and of itself. 


I agree Mac is overpriced, I said that initially. It is expensive, but it is also a better system by almost every metric. You gave the example of docker on m1, but your entire argument is for the non-tech user - who wouldn't be using docker. Not to mention, the m1 architecture has nothing to do with Unix itself. M1 is a brand new architecture; I'd be shocked if things didn't break. 


&gt;Also mind that gaming in mac compared to the gaming in windows like having sex with rubber doll instead of real one.

You gave zero examples, and instead opted for a crude analogy that provides no helpful information. Please elaborate. 

&gt;maintenance effort: windows &lt; Apple &lt;&lt;&lt; linux distro

From the average users perspective, this is not true. You complained about the ""average user"", so let's look at a use case: The first thing that 99% of people do as soon as they get a new computer, and download Google chrome. 

- On windows, this requires finding and disabling the S mode setting through the Microsoft store to allow you to download third party software, then searching for chrome in edge, and downloading it, and running the installer. 

- On Mac, you search for chrome in safari, download it, and run the installer.

Which one of those was easier, from a non-savvy user perspective? And just for shits and giggles, doing the same on Ubuntu is just opening a terminal and running ""sudo apt install google-chrome"" and you're done. It's very clear to me which one of the three is actually the easiest. 

&gt;I don't want your garbage linux-native games because they are just too much boring

I'm not talking about tiny indie games, there are plenty of large games that are natively supported on Linux, e.g. Dota 2, CS:GO, Rocket League etc. Plus, your opinion on the game itself is irrelevant to the quality of the OS, I said natively supported games run better on Linux, and you just came back with ""yeah well I didn't want those games anyway"".


You have yet to address anything that supports your claim that Unix is not good for desktop environments. I have provided clear logic and examples backing my claims, none of which you have even tried to refute. I'm not trying to be mean but you don't sound like a person who has much experience in this area, it seems more like you are just mindlessly defending a bias towards the platform you've used more, as you've given almost no technical reasoning whatsoever",1622505768

https://sunnah.com/nawawi40:34

*On the authority of Abu Sa`eed al-Khudree (may Allah be pleased with him) who said:*

*I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say, “Whosoever of you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand; and if he is not able to do so, then [let him change it] with his tongue; and if he is not able to do so, then with his heart — and that is the weakest of faith.”*

So men are responsible to ensure their family members, including their wives and daughters, perform religious duties and obligations to protect them from hellfire.

Observing hijab is included in religious obligations for women.

If they see something unislamic, they were first told to change it using their hand if they're capable.

Which means, if they see their wives and daughters not wearing hijab, they were told to change that situation using their hand if they're capable.

So so vile and unfair because there are indeed islamic justification for these men to act the way they did.",1622505769

"TheHandmaidsTale","t5_3fhbh","My favorite villain is certainly Aunt Lydia because of how amazing the actress is. 

Concerning Nick, I think Nick, for the most part of his involvement with the rise of Gilead, is like the role of young German military officers during Nazi Germany. Nick probably is not a religious fanatic like the leaders of Gilead. He comes from a background of poor, unemployed and socially isolated segment of society in America prior to the rise of Gilead. Being involved in Gilead and being an Eye are his ways of achieving social mobility that is otherwise shut out to him. 

As you can see from Nick's hesitance at the council when the leading commanders announced that he would be in charge of the bombing of Chicago, he is no fanatic. He certainly is an effective and efficient commander in executing the orders from his bosses. Maybe Nick, like General Rommel, would come around to seek to topple Gilead by assassinating the remaining commanders.                                      

Above all these, I think there needs to be a solution or a set of solutions that can solve the global fertility crisis before Gilead's legitimacy will be fully called into question among its 'citizens'. If the free world has a better solution to the fertility crisis than Gilead's ""clean and green economy', then Gilead will fall.",1622505769

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","New people in a society are a positive public externality.  It benefits society in diffuse ways, across thousands of people. Before widespread birth control, it was also kind of a byproduct of people getting together.  So as long as you got people together.... babies will just happen. That positive externality will just pop out. Parents will have kids whether or not they really want to or if they can even afford it. They just had to internalize those costs and live with it. Now, in a very good thing for wider human freedom and bodily autonomy, most people can control whether or not they have kids.    


Unfortunately, the costs of providing that positive externality are still falling on individual families. Individual families have to bear all of these costs, using only their own resources. 

If societies want more families to make the choice to have kids, to provide this positive externality, they need to decrease the costs associated with having kids. There are lots of ways to do this... straight cash grants, free daycare, housing, free schooling, etc. etc. The birth rates across most of the rich world have cratered because the costs of having kids are still way too high for families.  Sweden and the Nordic countries have kind of gotten the closest with pro natal policies but even they can't stay at 2.1.   

What the Soviets did was the reverse, making people pay a cost for not providing the externality, which kind of seems on brand.",1622505770

Here’s a comment from @newspaperwater in the thread. Proving my point that it wasn’t about people “caring” where I’ve skated, but that there is in fact a very big differences as to where you skate. Do you skate? Are you saying there is no difference from skating say in NYC to my hometown in the suburbs/country of Ohio where there is stretches of roads for miles with very few cars or people or anything around for that matter. If you believe there is no difference to any of these places, then you clearly don’t know what you’re talking about. Think about it like a Tesla on auto pilot in a place like NYC or a back roads farm in Nebraska with paves 2 lane roads with no one around for miles. The cars algorithm and the lasers that’s scanning for everything around it when it puts those color boxes around everything it needs to observed in real time and quickly making speed adjustments off of that. It’s the same concept. Your brain has to be really observant of EVERYTHING when your skating in certain city. Also definitely have to understand your speed and the speed of other things around you. Which was really this guys biggest mistake as someone in the thread said earlier. He’s going to fast for that stretch and he paid the price.",1622505770

E.g. From https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/victorian-kids-mental-health-hit-hardest-during-2020: 

Our key findings about child wellbeing were:

Children who experienced the second lockdown in Victoria were two-to-five times more likely to show emotional and behavioural difficulties than children in the other states.

Emotional and behavioural difficulties in children who experienced a second lockdown significantly increased during the three months between both surveys. Up to 13 per cent of these children experienced very high levels of emotional and behavioural difficulties. 

Anxiety was most common and there was a marked increase of 21 per cent in high-to-very high depression symptoms. Parents reported that 28 per cent of children were clingier and 36 per cent demanded more attention and support.

 Between 27-to-44 per cent of parents who experienced the second lockdown in Victoria reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress with symptoms significantly increasing over time. 

Between 27-to-44 per cent of parents who experienced the second lockdown in Victoria reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress with symptoms significantly increasing over time. 

Parents and carers were also affected. Between 27-to-44 per cent of parents who experienced the second lockdown in Victoria reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress with symptoms significantly increasing over time. This was an increase of 7-to-14 per cent.

In comparison, there was no significant change in scores for parents in the other states.",1622505771

The system is not China's making.  They bought into it when they joined the WTO and other legal frameworks. But to put them on a different standard than what is commonplace in corporate America? 

Wait until they start a patent troll outfit like VSLI or the Rock Star group.  That'll get your blood boiling.  (Rock star group is what became of the RIM portfolio) and speaking of RIM...
&gt;[Consider what happened to Research in Motion (RIM), which builds the best-selling BlackBerry and runs the mobile e-mail service of the same name. NTP, a pure patent-holding company, first filed suit against RIM in 2000 for violation of five of its patents and petitioned the court for an injunction on the sale and support of BlackBerry devices. The case dragged on for years, and RIM felt relatively secure that no injunction would be issued. On February 24, 2006, however, statements by U.S. District Court judge James Spencer indicated that he was inclined to grant the injunction and that his ruling was imminent. Faced with the acute risk of an unfavorable decision, RIM settled only one week later for $612.5 million—paying a fortune for rights that were dubious at best, given that all five NTP patents had already been preliminarily invalidated by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and that two of them had then received a final rejection. The suit all but put an end to RIM’s fabulous success story, and it shows that weak patents can be just as dangerous as strong ones when injunctions put a shark’s target under time pressure. With several competing mobile e-mail services ready to take RIM’s place, even a limited disruption of operations might have ruined the company. In fact, the uncertainty over its future alone during the legal battle may have cost RIM many potential new customers and tens of millions of dollars in revenues.](https://hbr.org/2008/06/patent-sharks)

people don’t understand passing really.  it’s not like you take hormones and suddenly you pass one day.  if you have no facial hair, a female voice, a female name, dress like a typical adult cis woman would, and confidently go about your day as a woman, people see what they expect to see.

passing does not mean having absolutely no traces of masculine features in your face or body structure.  tall women and women with long faces aren’t like constantly being misgendered.

You want to just help injured troops - next thing you’re know you’re in Iraq in a war that some question why you’re there. It’s not your fault. Or imagine those troops who signed on to join months leading up 9/11 and what they went through. I think we can be proud of them.

There's a reason why doctors do everything so much later than their peers: buy homes, have families, etc. So couple this shitty real estate bubble (that makes entering the market unattainable for even well-off people) with an already delayed ""start"" on adult life and you'll see how it's frustrating.

I dont really care what you buy, though I think Ryzen has fantastic performance right now. Had an i5 before and an intel laptop now though. 

Benchmarks like these are really shitty at best though, as they are basically fake comparisons with whatever intel can get away with. See different memory speed and power limit.",1622505774

**Important:** As always, when copying and pasting, remember to replace the prompts with their relevant information and content.

Format:

    *Video Transcription:*

    ---

    (mm:ss)  
    [*Description of scene, kind of music playing, actions happening, etc.*]

Your final transcription will look like this:

*Video Transcription:*

---

(mm:ss)  
[*Description of scene, kind of music playing, actions happening, etc.*]
[*Tone of dialogue]* Dialogue.

**Useful Notes:**

* For videos shorter than one hour  
 Time: mm:ss --&gt; (00:00)
* For videos longer than one hour:  
 Time: hh:mm:ss --&gt; (00:00:00)
* Make a new timestamp anytime something happens to break the flow of audio, like a presenter finishing a paragraph, a large cut in the video, or something similar. You don't have to do it for every single line of dialogue. 
* There are **two enters/returns** after the timestamp to make it look:
 
like  
this

(Note: Double spaces also works but it only renders properly on PC. In order to make it look correct on mobile devices, you need to use two enter/returns)

* We **highly recommend** using [oTranscribe](http://otranscribe.com/) to help you with transcribing videos. Just give it the file or YouTube link to the video you are transcribing and copy / paste your finished work to the comment fields.

"Dogtraining","t5_2r067","Background: Instinct vs. Training - A hilarious example of where they meet.

Odin is my nearly 3 year old service dog and so, one of the first things I taught him was to not eat anything that I didn’t specifically tell him is okay to eat. Odin is also extremely spoiled and extremely picky when it comes to his food, so, sometimes he will choose not to eat his kibble from his snuffle mat or his wet food mix from his Kong or licki-mat immediately. He will wait until he’s hungry enough as he realizes he doesn’t get anything “better” if he doesn’t eat his meals. 

Today, was one of the days he didn’t want his breakfast, so I left it out, made myself a small bowl of loaded tater tots (just air fried tater tots with melted cheese and sour cream), at 90% of it, placed the bowl next to my bed, and took a short nap.  

We all know now that counter surfing is a self-satisfying action and that the best way to stop it is maintenance. I am usually pretty good about putting left overs away, but I’m a person with flaws and sometimes, this doesn’t happen. 

So..

Here’s where his mischievousness met his training and the hilarious result.

I woke up to my bowl of left over loaded tater tots on his bed, completely untouched. 

Attached are photos of the “crime” and the culprit.

"socialskills","t5_2r275","It’s great you’re acknowledging the anxiousness that arises when trying to make plans. Understanding that not everyone is the same, not everyone is great at making plans and being organized. For many, having time alone is energizing. 

You’re also thinking on a short term horizon, two weeks without plans is fine with how much you have going on. Throughout the rest of your life you will realize in these moments you will need to put aside certain priorities to focus on others, and that is totally fine. You can’t always do allllll of the things. 

Perhaps starting a group text to make plans when you’ll be settled in your new home and when things will be more calm. That way you have something to look forward to when you’re busy being productive and moving. 

Building habits that are healthy for YOU is a great thing to work towards at your age. Overtime as you get older, you’ll have built a way of living and connecting with others that is easy on your anxiety, and overtime should help you overcome a lot of it. So don’t feel pressured to be like others on social media, do what feels good in your heart. Ask yourself “what does *sideofqueso* need now?”.

Your stance is just as equally based on opinions and biases, only you don't see it that way because it's ideas you agree with.

At the end of the day, the argument is that a billion is so much money that it's inherently immortal, because you've got so much personal wealth while others suffer, especially because most people people don't become billionaires on their own, but due to owning a company, and that instead they should be spreading that profit out amongst their employees more, so that you don't have one CEO making billions while you have employees struggling to pay rent.",1622505776

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","&gt;Most places in the city charge the servers between 5 - 9% of their total sales which then gets distributed between all those other people you’re referring to who don’t face the guests like food runners, cooks and more and are equally entitled to a share of the tips paid to servers.

Like I said I know people who actually work those jobs and Anecdotal evidence suggest that is not correct. Staff at the back gets ~1% of the sales distributed between them. All 20+ of them(excluding head chef). So at the end of the day all they getting is probably between $10-15 while servers take home $100+ tips on average work of 5 hours.

&gt;Most nights I work what I pay back to the restaurant to distribute to support staff is more than double what I make in wages, even if the min wage goes up. So if you think a server believes that you “owe them money”, it’s because the server already owes money to the restaurant just to serve you. 

That's the problem right. Why are we obliged to pay you what your employer should be paying to you? This is not customers vs servers. This should be Employees vs Employers. They're asking you to pay 5% of your sales because they know you will get tips and they know you are not probably paying taxes on all your tips so definitely you're not going to kill your golden goose. I'm all for higher minimum wage and tips for great work but it shouldn't be at expense of an average customer. 

&gt;Whether it be polishing the cutlery, plates and glassware you use, washing and carrying racks of glassware, sanitizing tables, restocking the bathroom, clearing dirty plates/glassware, table maintenance…

Food runners and Hostesses help with that yet they don't get even 1/4th of what a server makes. 

&gt;when you tip you’re saying “I appreciate all the hard work you and your colleagues have put in over the past two hours to ensure we have been cared for”.

It should be fair distribution between all the colleagues then. If I'm tipping 20%. 5% goes to Employer. 15% goes to server. Then from the overall sales Employer pays ~1-2% to all the staff that works behind the curtain i.e. food runners, hostesses,  dishwashers, food prep helpers etc. Doesn't seem fair to me buddy. To each their own. I for one will definitely change my ways.",1622505776

The U.S. has identified the Guard as a terrorist organization since the administration of former President Donald Trump.  
&gt;  
&gt;Prosecutors say shippers tried to disguise the shipment by labeling it as “Basra light crude” from neighboring Iraq.

&gt;The U.S. government brought the Achilleas to Houston, Texas, where it sold the just over 2 million barrels of crude oil within it for $110 million, or at around $55 a barrel, court documents show. The money will be held in escrow amid a court case over it.",1622505778

The last pandemic at the end of the 1800s spread across Asia and at last gave scientific medicine the opportunity to identify the cause of the disease and its means of transmission.""

How could you reach herd immunity by slowing the spread? I know the argument of the hospital capacity and stuff, but there are countries like Sweden where they never had any lockdowns and they never got overwhelmed.

At the club level, I'd imagine there's deals worked out for things like the champions league because of the money it brings in. As for international competitions like the world cup or the Euros, appearance fees are nothing compared to weekly wages. For example, the fee for the England national side is £2,000 per match, which is nothing compared to the weekly wages these guys get (highest paid player in the England team for this years Euros is Raheem Sterling who's on £300,000/week).

The mens side players always give their fees to charity, some women's players do too, but not all because the average salaries are so much lower (the top earners make in a year what Sterling makes in a week).",1622505779

I think live rock is silly and overpriced. 
Personally what i do is not typical at all and a lot of people will say this is horrible advice.

I put all my sand and dry rock in the tank and arrange it how I want it to look, then I pour in ro fresh water and dechlorinator (salt is expensive).
I’ll pour in a few drops of fish ammonia and some bacteria in a bottle or a rock from another tank and just let it sit for 2 weeks.
Once that’s done I check ammonia and nitrate, and if it’s near undetectable, then I empty the tank and replace it with saltwater (you only lose somewhere around 30% of your bacteria when switching for fresh to salt.)

I’ll give the tank another two weeks with the saltwater, I’ll add in a damselfish, give it 2 weeks, then I’ll feel confident that my tank is ready.

Cycling is not as complicated as many suggest and there is no reason to break the bank making sure your tank is cycled.",1622505779

"psychologystudents","t5_2vizn","**[Academic] The role of diversity in the perception of online advertising imagery (Females aged 18+ only!)**

Hi everyone!

I'm a masters student at the University of the Arts London, studying MSc Applied Psychology in Fashion. This study forms a part of my report, but it is also a part of a wider supervised project that will be published in an academic research paper.

The study is focused on diversity (body and cultural) and how it affects advertising effectiveness in fashion - only female participants aged 18 and above are recruited, and due to its nature as a psychology study, it requires full ethical clearance from my university's ethics review panel (which it has received). The study is considered to be low-risk, as well as fairly light hearted - most of the items in the survey are image-based questions that one will likely breeze through quite quickly.

If you do decide to participate, you will be shown an information sheet so you can understand the general gist of the study (full debriefing sheet is at the end of the survey), before signing a quick consent form. Once you've signed that, it will then move on to the survey. I will definitely post the results if there is interest for me to do so!

Here is the link to the survey: https://arts.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2fVSjElvmrmaOPQ

All data is anonymised, and if you do decide to participate, I'd just like to say thank you - you've really made a struggling student's day a little bit better. ♥️",1622505779

"diabetes_t1","t5_2vzrv","type 1 is great for me.. 

after i found bernstein , i went all keto (30 g carbs a day), and levelled out at 5.0 ish a1c for years. it was great to learn how to be able to do that.. to get to the point where i can go for a walk, without having to worry about my blood sugar (keep glucose tabs in pocket is easiest for me). now i lean back a bit, felt safe to experiment with bolusing for carbier stuff, even tried going vegan (meat makes me sad), and feel like i could 'eat pizza' or other things- but only with hyper management. so in general i try to stay very low carb, but eat other stuff when i dont have very low carb prepared

anyway, literally a journal with each meal you try to eat.. each one has its own page. write down the date, how you bolused for it, how it went. youll have excellent notes on what foods worked and didnt for your blood sugar. you 10 times try to bolus for something and it has a bad outcome, donnnnt do that. 

each meal, you need to practice for, separately. if youre going to do oatmeal, or eggs with bacon, whatever your breakfast is. might take 5 times to try it. only when you get it good, should you shift to something else

skipping food between meals (eating enough calories to do this), so you can master your 3 meals, i would suggest

whatever thats my advice for smart people who want to solve it so t1d isnt causing problems so you never have to worry again. there are other ways with different learning styles. but yes, master each meal",1622505781

&gt; The Jewish doctrine of Marxism rejects the aristocratic principle of Nature and replaces the eternal privilege of power and strength by the mass of numbers and their dead weight. Thus it denies the value of personality in man, contests the significance of nationality and race, and thereby withdraws from humanity the premise of its existence and its culture. As a foundation of the universe, this doctrine would bring about the end of any order intellectually conceivable to man. And as, in this greatest of all recognizable organisms, the result of an application of such a law could only be chaos, on earth it could only be destruction for the inhabitants of this planet.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","Again, I agree with most of what you said. However you're focusing on the politicians while my focus is more on their constituents or just...citizens in general. 

I voted when I was 18, not ever having had much interest in politics, only to feel embarrassment and shame afterwards. The party for which I voted won and I quickly became aware of the state of politics in the US and soon after, the state of world politics. It's ***all*** the same bullshit. I've not voted since.

So I fully agree with your sentiment that politicians are bought &amp; paid for. Money should be taken out of politics, but we both know that will never happen barring a drastic series of events.

So here's where we differ. Like I said, I believe the politicians are bought &amp; paid for, *but only to a degree*. I believe they're puppets, but not just for corporations. They are beholden to The Powers That Be. I mean, imagine the power wielded by those who had Epstein killed. Politicians pander to corporations for a pay day. But they also vote and push for legislation that has nothing to do with corporations and has everything to do with society/culture. This is for TPTB who aim to deconstruct the pillars of our once great nation.

And many of those societal issues are ""wedge"" issues that they themselves don't even follow or believe in. But one side is trying to tear up the foundations in which our forefathers laid while the other side pays them little more than lip service. They push this upside-down, inversed worldview lathered with virtue-**signaling**, much to the pleasure of Satanists. Hell, both sides are chock *full* of Satanist politicians. But there has to be some feeble attempt to make it appear they care about what their constituents think. Enter Republicans. 

But then you have the citizens. Many are brainwashed by their political party's propaganda outlets with the talking heads. However, when you look at the ideologies of all of these citizens it's very dualistic in nature. Many value liberty while many others value security. Many value freedom of speech while others value restriction. Many value personal responsibility while others value welfare. Many value the right to defend one's self while others value reliance on government to protect you.

Individualism vs collectivism

Nationalism vs globalism

Equalitarianism vs elitism

This is what I was referring to. Much of the *citizenry* have been brainwashed into advocating for the stripping of our rights! Which is necessary for TPTB to install their one world government. While the rest are steadfast on keeping their rights. The former are most dangerous. Ignorant. Blind. Programmed. Etc.",1622505781

Discourse back like 15 years ago was... not... the same as it is now. Although you do still see the descendants of those sentiments today, tbh, in stuff like ""bisexual is transphobic because it excludes enbies"", so I guess it's not that different.

* No selfies or human family pics, youtube channels, discord links, personal blogs.

* No memes or infographics link posts unless it's Friday

* No ""why did my bipolar SO/coworker/ex/parent/staff/boss do this?"" type posts. Short 
answer: No idea. Ask them or talk to a therapist about it. 

* Be kind to fellow users. No harassment or abusive language will be tolerated. Report 
and move on. Engaging just brings everyone down. 

* We are not Drs so please don't post asking us if you have BP. You wouldn't ask a 
cancer support group if you have cancer, so please don't ask us. 

* Please report self-harm and suicide threats. Users aren't equipped to intervene. 

Most of all be kind to yourself. We have a really great piece of the internet due to 
users like all of you sharing your struggles and offering support. We're here for each 
other in ways most people probably wont understand so use it often.

There are a lot of brands that fly under the radar that are worth sampling and sharing while you wait on better prices from more elusive brands.  Now if you've had Elmer, or have a particular reason you'd pay almost any price for it, that's your business.

- showing up in Wrexentrum at the exact right time to catch Oban and co's ritual/elf invasion
- the whole traveller con ceremony with throwing the dicks and the moonweaver
- Zorth the goblin
- Beau figures out how to kill the laughing hand
- Lucien kills Ves 
- every message spell but especially the one where they announced to Oban that they'd arrived at the sketchy rendesvous

I also really liked the dream sequence Yasha had where she had to make the decision to let her wife go, shit was powerful, also the scene where Jester asked the traveller if he sent her to rumblecusp so she'd forget him too along with all his others followers, that scene was super emotional for me, and obviously that define intervention in the last episode.

"Pickonepornstar","t5_3kfxz","It's funny that I don't really know any of these girls except for Karlee, I've seen scene or two of hers... So I'm gonna go only by the pics here.

I'll go with Marsha because I like the boobs, the tattoos, and she looks great glazed like that.

About the fave pornstar... I tend not to focus on one girl, I vary a lot between sluts, although I have a top list of favorites. But I'll choose one for the sake of the game.

Although I love to see my whores pushed to the limit and have a big fetish for bukkakes, I'll choose Rachel Starr as my fave. I don't know that she did more than three guys at once, so very vanilla for my standards, but...  
That woman is, for me, the gold standard of pornstars. She is a machine, she's amazingly fit to this day with a statuesque body, and she gives me the impression that she really cares about the craft of fucking on camera.

It's maybe weird to think about this in the context of porn because it's just stuff we masturbate to, but... I think she's a great professional that just happens to make her money having sex on camera, and I will never ever judge the work of someone who makes me have an orgasm. It's a job, she seems like she loves doing it, and is very dedicated to it, and I have the utmost respect for that.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, I didn't think I'd choose a favorite, but then I just wrote a love letter to her, haha.",1622505783

Whether a premise is true or not isnt an obvious matter, as suggested by your answer. 

&gt;No matter how we cash out that proposition, it looks false.

The premise ""All unicorns  are purple"" is logically true. Formally, the premise is understood as: For any x, if x is a unicorn, then x is purple. Now, a conditional is only false if the antecedent is true and the consequent false. There are no unicorns (so there is no x that is a unicorn), so the antecedent is false; thus the conditional is true",1622505784

The adrenaline rush and endorphine realease of finally slaying Midir after 50 million attempts is something nothing else in video games can compare to. 
Defeating the Nameless King was the first time I loudly swore at my monitor out of elation rather than frustration.

Armour spider is difficult but he's an early game Boss and meant to be beatable, I know you're past him now but there's always NG+ 

I know the struggle isn't for everyone and 'git gud' is kinda frowned upon these days but for me and a lot of others that's what makes the whole series, overcoming the heartbreak of getting Sister Friede down to 1% health only to get frost bitten was awesome.",1622505784

Very few people get a job in geology based on a random resume. It's far more common to get jobs from people you know.

If you're out of school then memberships and activity in geology related organizations is incredibly important. 

I realize not everyone has the same networking skills, or the opportunities required to make those connections, and that's not right. I don't think it's good that it's like this, but it *is* like this.

sejujurnya gk ada yg namanya asuransi pendidikan. asuransi pendidikan yah intinya asuransi jiwa dengan jangka waktu tertentu yg cover orang tua + reksadana, udah itu aja. saranku sih jgn pernah mau beli asuransi pendidikan, soalnya biaya akuisisi(anggap aja biaya admin) buat si perusahaan asuransi beliin reksadana itu tinggi banget. biasanya 75% di tahun pertama, 50% tahun kedua dst. biaya akuisisi ini hilang gitu aja, gk jadi apa2.

&amp;#x200B;

anak umur setahun, masuk SD umur enam tahun kan yah biasanya 🤔 berarti investment horizon 5 tahun dan karena ini buat kebutuhan primer, berarti hampir gk ada drawdown toleration.

kalau mau super aman, 100% di surat utang negara yg tenornya sisa 4-5 tahun.

reksadana pendapatan tetap negara harusnya juga cukup OK.

kalau mau lebih risky, campurin sama emas online juga.

lebih risky lagi, campurin sama high yield P2P online, tapi ambil yg bulanan aja, untuk memperkecil gagal bayar.

&amp;#x200B;

hindarin saham dan crypto, soalnya untuk kebutuhan primer, gk mungkin kan kalau saham lagi turun, ntar anaknya tunda sekolah dulu :(

semoga membantu.

"tennis","t5_2qiq1","&gt; and venus williams signed a contract about her pay. yet she still was able to push, and successfully get, equal pay for both men and women.

I don't think that anybody is arguing against Naomi's right to push for a change in the sport. At the end of the day, press conferences being tough on the mental health of players with a myriad of issues is an issue that's worthy of discussion. The problem is that she's not actually tried to push for a change - she's just tried to extract herself from a situation she doesn't like, because she thinks she has the money and the power to get away with it.

Venus didn't go to the slams and demand that they pay her more, she pushed for them to pay every woman more. Nothing she did was unilateral, and nothing she did was selfish or abusive of her position in the sport. Naomi's action was unilateral, wholly self-serving (you can only argue in the most indirect way that she has ""started a conversation"", but for now, only she is benefiting), and abusive of her position (""Fine me, I can afford them"" - a lot of players can't).

Your own comparison makes it obvious why Naomi's actions are so controversial. They're not constructive, they're selfish, and they're privileged. Totally unlike anything Venus has ever done for the sport.",1622505785

I think it’s worth noting that there’s a lot of racism and sexism in tennis and that, while it is important to take the time to step away and work on developing methods to handle valid criticism, like struggling on clay, I think that there needs to be clearer messaging that a lot of the criticism she gets is not okay and she should not have to take time to learn to deal with it. That in some instances we really need to be supporting her and other athletes choosing not to face that and that they’re right to not give into it. And that bad criticism does ultimately affect how the more valid criticism is processed. 

Very true except the few pressers I watched with Naomi after US open and Australian Open I noticed she gets treated well by journalists. They seem to love her. I think she's too hard on herself.

The doctor in many ways is just like a newborn child (though born with the body and logical reasoning as an adult). He has no life experience.  He has intelligence but not wisdom.

"UnresolvedMysteries","t5_2wvvc","&gt; why in the world would make someone want to hang onto it? It certainly makes this look much more likely that he befell foul play rather than wandered off and died on his own. I’d be very suspicious of anyone giving a skull to someone and also someone taking receipt of it. What involvement did they have?

i thought the part about giving it to someone and taking receipt of it was about the son getting it from the father, not the father taking it from the guy running the camp. my bad on that part, but part of what im trying to say is people are jumping to the conclusion that what the father said to the son was creepy or ominous or implied foul play but the son could have been under the impression that the boy died while lost at camp from nature not foul play and was recovered(vs the boy was missing from camp and murdered) and the father kept the skull illegally to study or it was donated to study which is way different from suspecting the father was claiming he had received it being knowing the killer of a boy who is still missing. we have the advantage of knowing more than he claims to have known at the time and that seems to be effecting peoples opinion about what he remembers about something said to him 40 years ago.  


the father apparently getting it from the guy running the camp is definitely a red flag though and implies that he had some involvement even if it was after the fact.",1622505786

"aznidentity","t5_3amv4","&gt;On July 4 last year, another American holiday, U.S. soldiers on leave also converged at the beach and lit fireworks, some even aiming them at local residents. But police said no incidents of violence were reported this time.

Protesting to the Korean government won't do anything. But, South Koreans can protest against South Korean businesses investing in the US such as the new Samsung semiconductor factor in NY. While I'm for South Koreans supporting their national brands, but when those national brands are not serving the people who support them, why should the people support them back?

The last thing Biden wants is foreign investments leaving the US because of the behavior of a few replaceable servicemen who will never serve combat. Lets be honest. I think even the US military personnel in SK knows they will never see actual combat. Yet, they will still get the same pension and benefits as my German American friend who needed spinal surgery serving as a gunmen on top of a Humvee in Iraq being one of the first ones there.

"AbandonedPorn","t5_2sh6t","There are all kinds of crash scenarios, and indeed modern cars are reported to do better in many of them.  1972 era 5mph bumpers would laugh at a 6mph impact and send you on your way with something that would buff out, where any post 1999 mini-van that takes a rear end impact at even 4mph is handing you a multiple thousand dollar repair bill ""for your safety.""

My 1977 ""big steel"" pickup truck took a nice solid 30mph hit from the rear from a 1999 SUV - the diamond plate bumper basically got scuffed while the SUV and its crumple zone was totaled, due to my lack of crumple zone I got a small bump on the back of my head.  Same truck took a hit in the left rear side from another SUV, also totalled, and the ""big steel"" was a little wrinkled, needed some spray paint to cover a couple of spots where bare metal got exposed - zero injuries to me or my passenger.  I suppose if you took that truck head-to-head with a 2021 multiple airbag equipped crumple-mobile, at 60mph the occupants of the crumple-mobile would probably fare better in the post crash injury analysis, that's what the published reports all say.  What I know is the people I personally know who have actually experienced such crashes are still pretty messed up even when their airbags all deploy properly: multiple fractures, months in rehab, etc.  Returning to a 1978 Cadillac Seville, t-boned by a van doing 40+mph, the occupants of the Seville were slightly bruised - car totalled, but the simple leather-cushioned interior was enough to save the Cadillac passengers from any serious injury.

Yes, 1960s cars with no headrests, no seat belts, and 1950s cars without collapsing steering columns, and any car without disc brakes, those were serious safety issues - all addressed by 1972.  Advances since then?  Not as dramatic as the sales brochures tout them to be... in my experience.  I suppose ABS and traction control do prevent a number of accidents every day around the world, but only when the drivers are unable to accomplish the same things on their own.  ABS can be tough to reproduce with a single channel brake input - but keeping a safe following distance is an even more effective safety measure than ABS, judging by what I see on the highway very few people take advantage of this freely available automotive safety measure, even though it has been available since the first cars were made.  Traction control?  Yeah, it helps, but if it's helping you avoid accidents - you really need to re-evaluate your attitudes towards your own safety and the safety of others on public highways.",1622505787

"lexapro","t5_31mz6","I’ve stuck with it longer than anything else I’ve tried! I like how you can eat whatever you want, but with a focus on vegetables, fruits, whole grains and lean proteins, BUT you can and should have less healthy things in moderation. IMO this is the best and most sustainable diet. I used to think that the only way to lose weight was a low carb, high protein diet, but I’ve never really cared for high protein foods all that much. Noom’s approach takes away the stress/guilt id feel for not forcing myself to eat stuff I don’t like.

On top of that, you can do 5-10 mins per day of “lessons” or slides that use psychology to encourage successful behaviors. I already know a lot of it from being mentally ill (lol) but it’s super helpful to have a reminder. For instance, one day was a CBT exercise about recognizing thought distortions &amp; replacing them with more realistic, positive ones - ie, realizing that “I ate too much chocolate today, so today is ruined,” is black and white thinking, and instead saying to yourself “I ate too much chocolate today, but now I know that X is a trigger for that, so I’ll be more prepared next time. I can also still make healthy choices moving forward.” There’s also lessons about meditation &amp; mindfulness, healthier swaps for cravings, identifying different triggers and ways to cope, etc. 

Downside is the cost, but it’s about the same price as a monthly gym membership. I see it as an investment in my health (and by having a healthy weight, I’ll avoid medical costs down the road). I’d like to get back to my original weight, but 10 pounds would put me back in the “healthy” range (I’m considered “overweight” now - I’m just above 5 feet tall), so that’s my first goal. Once I’m there, I’ll decide if I want to keep going. 

Lastly, I appreciate how “kind” it is. Other apps, like MyFitnessPal for instance, will turn your calorie count bright red if you go over by even 1 calorie. Noom gives you a “good” range to be in, and if you go over, it’s subtly noted in light gray. This works really well for me because I get discouraged and want to give up easily. Noom’s, places more of an emphasis on awareness, consistency and gradual/sustainable change, rather than punishment for not being perfect. 

Overall I recommend giving the free trial a shot to see if it’s a good fit for you!",1622505787

Then of course he got some rare rare bladder cancer. And MRSA while they were treating the cancer. 

His heart just gave up.

But the heart failure as a cause of death provided one silver lining to mom. Survivor's benefits from the VA.

After 40+ years crawling in/on/under/around airplanes, the amount of pain my dad had was unfathomable. But he never got to benefit from medical MJ. We passed that in Florida about 6 months after he passed. But the last 2 years of his life, he had converted over to ""if your doctor thinks it's good, go for it."" ... I have a feeling some of the veteran boards he was on, some of the guys in previously legal states were probably talking about its benefits.

"nasikatok","t5_2m5vfl","# Viral claims of vaccine fee not true: MoH

^(June 1, 2021)





James Kon




The Ministry of Health (MoH) has denied viral claims that foreigners with green identity cards will be required to pay a BND50 fee per vaccine.




“As previously stated in press conferences and press releases, the COVID-19 vaccine injection is free for all citizens and residents residing in Brunei Darussalam,” said MoH on its social media platforms.




In addition, the MoH assured that the vaccination progamme will be administered in phases, as outlined in the Brunei Darussalam National Vaccination Strategy for COVID-19.




The public is reminded that circulating false information is an offence under Section 34, Chapter 148 of the Public Order Act, which states that anyone who spreads false reports or makes false statements, whether orally or in writing or by other means, that are likely to cause public alarm or result in public disorder, is guilty of an offence punishable by a prison term of three years or a fine of up to BND3,000.

There's also the dynastic issue with Marcus Aurelius on the reverse.

There's a Liberalitas reverse that has the goddess tossing coins, which makes it a coin with coins on it.

He reigned so long there are coins commemorating the first, second, and *third* decades of his reign. However, because the empire was mostly at peace during that time, and the emperor never even actually left Italy, there are no CAPTA issues.

I'm sure there are more, I just can't think of any.  He has a ton of reverses, just because he was emperor for so long.  I think you should try to collect them all, myself, but I'm biased. ;)",1622505788

Are you having healthy bowel movements? 

I spent years kegeling during masturbation for whatever reasons my younger self started. I have these same pains. Pain with and after ejaculation. Those pumping motions may be what some people call auto kegeling. It would happen with me in times for example when I was cuddling with a girlfriend mainly. It did happen other times but less frequently.

In your first point, what I am trying to highlight is the derogatory nature of the word. I am not arguing about the semantics but you and the previous individual have an derogatory semantic connotation associated with that adjective. Unfortunately, that’s not my doing it’s society as a whole. If you do find it offensive then your direction of offense towards me is somewhat misguided.

Secondly, your quotation of my comment seems to suggest a slight aversion to the point I raised. Again I shall pose the same question to you. Which I have highlighted previously but here we go;

If I use the word woke; who is to say it’s derogatory? I may be using it as a positive social constructive adjective. You are the person who have taken it to be a negative. Why? Should you not ask yourself why you find it a detriment?",1622505789

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","Hi :) I live in Germany too.. my psychiatrist recommended me to eat right before taking the meds, he explained it will help to dose the meds in my organism. 

I'm also taking medikinet 10mg I'm on my first month. First week once at day and after twice. 

I feel exhausted at the end of the day. I feel a bit more energetic during the day like I don't have the need to come back to bed at least because I'm not sleepy anymore after taking my dose. I feel incredibly thirsty during the day and I can tell the meds wear off just because I start starving so bad! 

I would avoid caffeine at all cost. It was a bad combo for me. My psychiatrist forgot to warn me and as I didn't know anything about adhs before getting diagnose I didn't know I shouldn't. It made me so anxious and got fast heartbeat. I quit tea too because same feeling.",1622505789

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Urgent care here would mean multiple full sets of vital signs, and a 1-12 hour wait for an STD panel (it would be the Lowest triage priority).
Not to mention, at UC, you're still going to see a doctor.
And (not that the average person thinks about this, but) a visit to urgent care, costs taxpayers over $1000. A walk in or family doctor appointment is about $50 to taxpayers. So definitely not the reasonable option for an STD panel. UC is for urgent issues. Which an STD test is not.

Also, in this case, I confronted him, immediately upon realizing he had lied, and he admitted it. (He definitely could have explained that he had it done at a clinic with a nurse practitioner, and therefore technically hadn't seen a doctor, but he wasn't smart enough to come up with that).",1622505789

I’ve never jived at all with “fat positive” culture.  I’m not out to judge others but I judge myself to hell.  Basic example: I have had plenty of time and opportunity in the past 3-4 years to hop on a dating app and hook up with as many men as I want, but it’s like- no, I don’t like my body, and I don’t want to go imposing my body on other men. 

Part of it too is my stomach is not shaped like a lot of fat girls. I don’t have one round belly, I have like, triple belly. Three separate bulges. So I really don’t look great in most clothes unless I’m under 200 lbs. Currently I really only wear plus size blazers for work (with a button to cover the triple bulge) and lazy-at-home/pajama clothes.  Man, I don’t wanna live like this anymore and no amount of “fat positivity” has ever made me budge on how I feel, even when I *really really really* try.",1622505789

But now that I do have what we have, it's like dang...  gotta get the second volumes of Batman and Books of Magic and Lucifer whenever those are available.  Have to get 2 and 3 of Grant Morrison's Batman run.  Then something else will be out I'm sure.  

Maybe it would have been best to never get our first one.  They are massive.  Uncomfortable to read unless I'm in the exact right position with like a pillow on my lap and blankets used to raise one side of the book more than the other.  Hahaha.  But dang I do like just looking at them on my shelf!  It is also super convenient to read and in most cases cheaper than buying individual volumes.

The question of animal intelligence is notoriously difficult to quantify, so I personally think that defaulting to caution is a reasonable position. So many errors have been made in this specific field of research that to think that you completely understand it, in a way, shows how poorly you actually do. People used to think elephants and crows were dumb. Our hubris as the ""smartest"" species on the planet too often blinds us to other perspectives.

There have been [studies](https://www.wales247.co.uk/new-research-reveals-that-snails-have-feelings-too) whose findings support the idea that some snails can feel loneliness, and that isolation has a direct impact on their behavior.

 &gt;These results show that social context can alter our conclusions about how ‘smart’ an animal is. Snails that form stronger memories in groups form the weakest memories in isolation and vice versa. It also shows that the relationship between exploration behaviour and memory changes when the social context is altered.

If a snail can feel lonely, then is it unreasonable to assume that putting one by itself in a cage for three times its natural life span might be torturous to them? How would we even know?

"Schmoedown","t5_3k7la","I’ll throw mine here as well:
1. Harper beats Cabrera. I mean, come on.
2. Parker beats Chance. Parker is a new kind of hungry this year and I can’t see Chance’s magic working again, as big of a Korruption fan as I am.
3. JTE beats Preston. JTE seems to have rekindled his old fire this year, and I think it’ll defeat Paul.
4. Oyama beats Erwin. Much as I’d love to see Ethan win, Paul’s going crazy this year.
5. Hot take, but Rocha beats Bateman. It’ll be close, but The Outlaw is cleaning house this year, and I think The Boss will provide extra motivation for him. 
6. Gold Leader beats Burkett, as much as I’d love otherwise. Bushkar is just too good atm.
7. Ramirez beats Wiggins. I think Sabrina will have a fire lit under her this year.
8. Considering what I’ve heard about Doug Benson, he’d better be good. I'm putting him to beat Van Vliet.
9. Harper beats Gold Leader. He’s Harper.
10. Parker beats Chandru to get ready for another Korruption vs. Dungeon matchup in IG.
11. Saul beats Alba based on that win against his Reel Reject buddy.
12. Newman beats Bancroft. Griffy Newms seems to be where it’s at for Singles rookies this year.
13. Chance beats Lon. Based on their last matches in both Singles and Teams, it seems pretty clear that Chance will win.
14. Schloth beats Alvarez. Frankie’s performance was way shakier than Schloth’s IIRC.
15. As much as I’d prefer otherwise, Haas beats Moses.
16. Oyama beats Rocha. Paul’s on a tear.
17. SHAZAM! beats Korruption. 100% PPE in Teams in a CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH? That’s still ridiculous to me.",1622505792
"MiddleClassFinance","t5_26nzo2","Couple things: 

1. They have better heat distribution, making it easier to cook.
2. You can scrub the shit out of them with barkeeper's friend (oxalic acid) and they still look / work great.  That wonderful chemical is off-limits for most cheap nonstick cookware and all non-enameled cast iron. The lack of non-stick lining means you can go to town when cleaning with the big guns. 
3. Most pieces let you start on a cooktop and finish in the oven, allowing for cooking very thick cuts of meat like 2"" pork chops properly, so that they have flavor, or searing long zucchini in a bed of oil, flipping and finishing in the oven.   This technique is how a lot of food goes from bland gray crap to delicious. 

Entry level would be like a $60 porcelain enameled cast iron dutch oven from lodge.  They are good enough for most needs but only last 3-4 years.

Entry level god tier is any of the made in cannonsburg, pa all-clad stainless stuff.  Most pieces are $200-250, and they are really worth it.",1622505792

"Abortiondebate","t5_2trti","&gt;Which is not an excuse to override someone’s right to their own body.

It can be argued that being born is a direct violation of one's rights. It's often said that all reproductive decisions are strictly personal, but I strongly disagree. Procreation involves the creation of another being that has no say in the matter. Conversely, it can also be said that abortion would be a violation of a fetus's autonomy since it can't consent, but since no being is harmed during abortion, this argument holds no water for me. Ultimately, the most moral action would be the prevention of pregnancy all together.

&gt;Nor is the pregnant person forcing someone to stay alive afterwards. I’m all in favour of assisted suicide.

There is nothing wrong with assisted suicide, but your argument makes little sense here. Are you saying its ok for birth to occur since they can simply kill themselves later? Why would you even allow children to be born into a world where they may be driven to suicide? Euthanasia only ends the pain, the concern presented here is avoiding it all together. 

&gt;Also, if it’s just a moral argument then sure... fine I suppose. You’re allowed to believe so. But if you want to make something illegal you’ll have to have better arguments for essentially ending the human species.

I can't think of any reason more sufficient than the ones I've already provided. So much suffering can be prevented but we refuse to do so under the notion of people simply wanting to procreate and the world governments allowing it. 

&gt;And are you saying every parent is a murderer cause their child eventually dies? Because if so.... that’s not how it works??

If we are to define it under a strictly causal relationship, then yes. The only reason a person suffers is because of their parents. I don't think this will ever become a socially acceptable view, but that's no reason not to stand your ground. It's been difficult for me to accept these conclusions and I struggle with a lot of cognitive dissonance and social backlash in my life in regards to how I apply it.

Ah, you must mean this one: 

*""We honor those members of our military who sacrificed their lives in order to defend our freedoms. We owe these heroes—and their loved ones—everything. Not just on Memorial Day. Every day.""*

Oh wow, what a lovely empty statement. More of the same, ""thank you for your service"", ""thank you for fighting for our freedoms (which is **not** what they are fighting for""). No substantive talk on how the government might try to right their wrongs (not that they could wholly do that anyways, but at least something would be nice). No mention of how these ""freedoms"" that they are fighting for are actually the freedom for CEOs to reap larger profits at the cost of innocent human lives. Of course, I don't really expect her to say this, seeing as she is a lib politician and all. 

&gt; I'm happy we have a day to support veterans and military, but what the hell do you want? Them to post something every hour from Friday to Monday?

What I want is an end to meaningless platitudes, and a beginning of policies that will help veterans. This could namely be accomplished by stopping sending them into unjust wars in the first place, but also by providing adequate care and services for the ones who unfortunately already got fucked up by being used as human cannon fodder.

- avoid 8:30 classes if you can. It doesn’t matter how early your high school started, you’ll almost certainly have to drag yourself out of bed unless you’re a SUPER early riser.
- you probably won’t the same grades you had in high school in your first semester. It’s fine, it’s an adjustment.
- try to avoid huge gaps between classes, they’re such a pain, and it gets really exhausting.
- join clubs, they’re a great way to get to know people! 
- four month dry erase wall calendars are a game changer. Stick them up and write EVERYTHING on them.
- as op mentioned, condensing classes into a few days is a huge help. Having a day to either work or take a break is AMAZING.
- if you can avoid it, don’t take a 7-10 class with an 8:30 the next morning. Hell, don’t take an 8:30 and a 7-10 in the same day
- start your assignments early. It’s easier said than done, but do it.

"IsraelPalestine","t5_2sgz7","&gt;Gaza cares about what goes on in the West Bank, they are all Palestinians, so of course they are going to build tunnels to fight Israel,

I am sure Mexico cares about Mexicans in the US, but would they start shooting over the border because of some perceived mistreatment of a Mexican in America? I don't think so, and if they would be stupid enough to try, you know what would follow, right?

But you are correct, many Israelis are disappointed in any ""peace process"" and want none of it, just like many Palestinians. You know the difference, though? In Israel there are plenty of politicians and political movements which are entirely ready and willing to start negotiations tomorrow. They don't have enough popular support to form a Government, but they are not marginal, they have support of millions. If Palestinians send a unequivocal signal that they are ready on their end, perhaps it would be enough to shift a balance of power in Israel. Contrary to that, there is no one in Gaza who can openly suggest to stop fighting  and star building peace together, be it because of the fear of repercussions, indoctrination, deep disappointment in the whole world or all of the above. And that's a big difference right here. So even if ultra-left Meretz forms a Government tomorrow, it would change nothing, they would still have no partner to talk to.",1622505798

I cannot be sure about this, but I think Disney walked back the idea of using them in/near the parks because it very quickly becomes ""if Disney can do it, why can't other professionals do it."" Disney only owns the ground, it does not own the air above it. As such, if Disney can get an exemption to use them inside the park, others could do the same.

"prey","t5_2vg16","Hey I just wanted to follow up with you because I felt the same way you did. No other games I’ve had these issues. What I did find out is:

1.	Xbox series X controllers aren’t the best at joystick quality. (Really annoying because I bought all new series x controllers for steam)
2.	As it turns out, and others mentioned this too: in the game settings dead zones are completely turned off or so small it picks up any imperfections. If you go to calibration you’ll see where your joystick inputs are in real time to see if you have a really large drift problem. 
3.	Steam typically implements a HUGE dead zone by default so if you had a significant drift, it might have been masked by that. 
4.	You can literally adjust your dead zone to compensate for your drift in big picture mode under controller options. Google it, “steam dead zone prey” probably will do it. 

I was able to adjust my joystick dead zones to fix the drift with little to no work and the game was playable again. Like you, I wanted to enjoy the game and was even going to buy another controller. I brought my steam controller down and it had no drift, but seeing as how they’re $100 these days I was just not going to invest that much in a new controller at this point. 

My controller has *minimal* drift, but with no dead zones the game picked it up. I wouldn’t believe anyone who says you’re controller is flawed or you should play keyboard/mouse etc. They have dead zones for a reason, if controllers were all perfect all the time we wouldn’t have them. 

Anyways, hope this helps a month later.",1622505799

"HomeImprovement","t5_2ql97","Im posting here because I dont want to violate the 'no inspiration' rule but I am trying to figure out what I can do with my current renovation project. 

My wife and I are renovating our sun room and have a wood beam that we dont know what to do with. We figure we have 2 options: 

1) encase the 2x10s with something more decorative (cedar, pine, etc) and drywall the ceiling around it

2) lower the ceiling by the windows and drywall everything to hide the beam (so it would look like the ceiling is lower for 2 feet by the windows).

She wants the beam 'exposed' to accent the room. I want a clean look that easy. Im wondering if it would be worth it to lower the ceiling by the windows to level with the beam to create space for recessed lighting and to hide that small side of the beam.

"agedlikemilk","t5_o7cng","Something I think that needs to be noted, is that consent IS important; but too many people think consent can only be in the form of ""I give you express permission to kiss me"" but it doesn't have to be.

What OC, and this advert was betting on is that if you know someone well enough, or can non-verbally communicate effectively, you can give consent without words, and the kisser can interpret they're open to it. And it's ONLY once you *know* they want to be kissed, that you as a kisser *responsibly* initiate a kiss without any verbal warning.

When done correctly, this style of kissing works better since its a welcome surprise. Of course though, it's risky, especially if your non-verbal communication skills need work, or you don't know who you're planning to kiss. Telling people ""how to kiss"" like that is also a much less foolproof method of teaching how to treat potential partners to a bunch of amateurs.

Arguably, it would be better (as it is safer) to go with verbal consent, until you and your partner gets bored of it, by which time non-verbal consent should be a viable option. But that's just my opinion, as someone with not much experience :P",1622505803

""It's all politics/political"" is the excuse of two kinds of people when it comes to Eurovision: 

A) Those who are not well informed about the nature of the contest (politics is not the main concern of televoters and home, and while some juries do engage in the political side of it, most simply vote for their music industry mates in different countries, e.g. Philip Kirkorov and his Eastern European links); 

B) And those whose countries have tended to send stuff that doesn't stand out or was crap.

There is often an overlap between these two types of people, and the UK has a very noticeable amount of people in it, who refuse to own up to their internal failings. Doesn't help that the tabloid media fan the cultural flames often.

(That being said, there have been more opinions coming out from British people that their country does need to kick it up a notch and send something that stands out more and is better than what was essentially H&amp;M store music)",1622505804

I think it’s folly to try and control things in the way they want. People will always have differing opinions and it’s something we ought to accept.

Reddit exists for people with similar ideas to come together and discuss. Also it is up to an individual to be critical of all information presented to them.

If they are upset about the post in this sub, I think a better solution would be to engage users in a civil manner. Brigading is not a solution to anything, nor is it effective or intelligent. In fact it will most likely embolden the opposition.

On that note, there are so many ongoing information wars happening on this site, it has become a constant blitzkrieg. Navigating the sea of bias, hate and propaganda has become a necessary skill for all of us. It is easier to enjoy the internet with that in mind. We can only control ourselves in this chaos. Otherwise we will only experience frustration and anger.

Although I am only a passive subscriber of this sub, I am commenting now because brigading and censorship are a threat to me and all redditors.

In the words of Voltaire:

“I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”

If people believe that censorship is the answer, they are not only damning us but themselves. Censorship is a common enemy and part of the reason I subscribe here is because I support the subs right to exist.",1622505805

"SexToys","t5_2qimy","I'd advise against buying a knockoff, because not all types of metal are safe to use internally. The original Njoy Pure Wand is made from 316 grade stainless steel, and its metal alloys are considered surgical grade.

With counterfeit metal toys (i.e. Njoy or Le Wand products,) there's a high risk of the materials not being body-safe. It's possible that knockoffs could be made from an unsafe metal, then spray painted or coated with a thin level of stainless steel.

Generally speaking, if a sex toy price seems to good to be true, it probably is. The best Njoy Pure Wand deals are on Black Friday, but if you don't want to wait, here's a couple of legitimate/authorized retailers that have it on sale right now. They both offer discreet shipping, and there won't be any indication of what's inside the box.

It's possible for your local USPS to hold packages at the post office, instead of delivering them directly to your address. But you have to sign up for their Informed Delivery program, and then wait for identity verification. I've tried to sign up for Informed Delivery with them before, and it took ~3 weeks for me to get verified. So I'd recommend planning ahead if that's something you want to do.

- [$90 at Liberator](https://www.liberator.com/njoy-pure-wand.html) with their current 25% off promo code SUMMERVIP. Includes [free standard US shipping](https://www.liberator.com/shipping-information.html) (3-5 days).

- [$92 at SutraVibes,](https://www.sutravibes.com/product/pure-wand/) but they have a 110% price match guarantee. If you find the Pure Wand at a lower price from a different retailer (i.e. Liberator,) their customer service will give you a discount to make it even cheaper than the competitor's lower price. Includes [free US express shipping](https://www.sutravibes.com/faq/) (2-3 days.)",1622505805

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","Classical music ended around 1820.  The romantic era followed, then 20th century music (1900's) and finally the music of today. I think impressionism was a little post-romantic era blip, but I don't really remember when.  There's a whole bunch of sub ideologies within each era with plenty of pockets of different kinds of music. 

This tradition is colloquially referred to as classical music but classical music is also a specific time period so it's more accurate to say Western Art Music.  I consider ""Modern Classical"" or ""Modern art music"" to be music written by and after Schoenberg, written in the 21st century, or written by composers still living (the cut and dry years and definitions will be written after the fact once music has gone a new direction and new historians study the past which is currently now).  Schoenberg, although a 20th century composer, was incredibly radical and changed the game forever.

If you want to know more about the timeline of music,  I recommend ""A history of Western music"" by Peter Burkholder et. al.

To answer your question directly, music has historically had norms associated with it.  Composers as they compose try and push the boundaries of those norms (why) and as they do they change the tastes of their listeners and move the tradition of art music in a new direction (how).  As for when, it can kind of be up to you what you consider modern.  If you want to be really safe, modern is music by composers who are still alive.",1622505805

Quoting from our [moderation guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies#wiki_moderation_guidelines_for_reviews):

&gt; Self-post reviews that do not address at least one of these questions and/or are less than 400 words long are subject to removal at the discretion of the moderation team.
&gt;
&gt; Additionally, self-post reviews should be for completed series only -- that is the series has finished airing all of its episodes and the reviewer has watched the entire drama. Reviews where the reviewer has not fully completed the drama will be removed.
&gt;
&gt; For those that just want to write a short blurb about a drama, feel free to share in any of our weekly discussion threads instead.

Reasons why your post fail to satisfy our requirements as a self-post:

#**Self-post reviews that do not address at least one of these questions and/or are less than 400 words long are subject to removal.**

Your post is less than 400 words long and is thus subject to removal.

#**Reviews where the reviewer has not fully completed the drama will be removed.**

You wrote that you have only watched eight episodes of *Vincenzo*, which has 20 episodes in total, which means you have not even completed half of the drama by your own admission.

As mentioned earlier, feel free to share your short rant about your experience of watching Vincenzo thus far in our FFA threads, latest one here: https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/now2vc/monday_madness_20210531/

I think on ME2 there's also 2 points that you can get unlimited paragon if you want to boost it a bit (but I heard it takes a looonnnngg time) which is also explained on the wiki.


I could be wrong but I remember reading that many of the options are based on paragon number you have percentage of the total possible at the time? Which means some options are easier if done early on such as the  [ME2 SPOILER](#s ""Miranda vs Jack loyalty argument"").


I'm kind of in a similar camp, I feel like you can be essentially the next Jesus and you still won't have enough paragon for some sections if you do it a certain way.

The terminal which will move attached to the stairs should then be partially underground but still interactable from above. When you interact with it (or symptomatic) they will force you into an animation at the same level allowing you to pass through the ground. Once through the ground you can then attach flooring to the bottom of the stairs and build out from there. Hope this helps, and good luck on the build!",1622505807

"ClashRoyale","t5_3bog8","So cheating for instance, cycling of cards and having less than 6 cards has been a proven theory even to a point where supercell had to weed it out of league play.  An easy example of elixir lag is the game will start off with the same elixir, you put say an electro giant right at the bridge, someone will then out down a big Pekka, an e-wiz and possible a tesla or inferno tower.  Ok so E giant is slow obviously, but then you go to use a counter card while he's put out all these cards and you find you have just gotten to 3.5 elixir in this same time period.  I don't believe elixir lag is a cheat or hack but if my connection on my phone is bad, then it will just play slower.  I've tested it on wifi and off and the results are pretty clear.  If I play on one bar or five the game runs smoother than others.  Also, (sorry for the long explanation) if you notice at times you'll place a card, the card will not deploy right away and then with that lag in deployment the game won't start generating your elixir until it has deployed giving it a slight half of a second lag which could accumulate throughout the game.",1622505808

"torontoraptors","t5_2s5sb","Yep, I got my fill of petty revenge during the bubble. Watching great players perform poorly just gets depressing after a while. I'd love to see battle of LA in the conference finals. Honestly, battle of the villains between Nets and Clippers would be cool too.

It's a stretch to call the Clippers an ""underdog"", but they've got a lot to prove this season, and I'd love to see them make a good run at it rather than flaking out again.",1622505808
"Superstonk","t5_43zwn1","Another post made the claim that because 1.5% of all shareholders are on eToro, and eToro had however many users, that the math added up to 89 million GME shareholders world wide.

That would mean that, as world population is 7.9 billion, that 1 in 89 people on this planet is a GME shareholder (7.900.000.000 / 89.000.000 = 88,76), and that's including women and children, which is rather absurd (women, because in several countries women are not allowed to even own property, so yeah...).

If we take out people under 15 (approx. 26%), then it means that 1/66 people on this dear rock own GME, which is even more absurd.

We could then assume that people living in extreme poverty, meaning they live on under 2 bucks per day, totals 690 million people. I doubt they're buying GME, so now it's 1/57 people. And we could do this all day.

Granted, there's some double dipping in the math as I assume underage people are counted in the poverty stat, but yeah, it's highly improbable that we have 89 million shareholders. But if we do, I'm not complaining. Just think that if we're setting people up with that kind of expectation, they're gonna be in for a rough day when it's announced to be something like 8 million.",1622505808

"AMC_meltdown","t5_43h1vo","Well, some of the price action we've seen has definitely looked like shorts desperate to pin the price. We've already seen spikes in AH that looked like a good sized retail short position getting blown up. This set up relies on the bulk of retail maintaining some sort of discipline and I'm not sure how that's going to play out. I'm sure some FOMO buyers have been shaken out. We'll see. I have a very small, fun money position in this as I'm not super confident this is going to run high enough to start triggering margin calls for institutional players, but we'll find out soon enough. Answering your original question, anything over 20% of a free float shorted is considered dangerous for short sellers.",1622505808

"datingoverthirty","t5_34cyw","Just went through this! Matched with a guy on bumble and we quickly moved to text. Convo was pretty good but it was mostly being led by me, and then him agreeing with what I said and just repeating it back to me. At the end he says the whole “you’re so easy to talk to!” Bit which of course...he didn’t ask me anything about myself! Day 2 of chatting was less “easy” because I had no mental energy to keep asking him things with no reciprocation. I’d ask him something, he would answer. Then I would stay quiet to see if he asks me anything in return. Nothing. So I would answer my OWN question “what did you major in college?” Answer. Then I would tell him my
Answer and he wouldn’t branch off of that at all . He quickly started in with  “ya idk if I’m interested since your vibe is different than last night” so I CALLED HIM OUT ON IT, told him he could ask me questions about myself and try to get to know me. His response “I don’t like the interview process of asking questions to get to know someone I’d rather have convo develop naturally”. Like bro, you have to show interest for there to be convo. He kept throwing out “you’re not interested in talking to me anymore” even after I kept initiating and asked him for coffee. Needless to say, he’s a narcissist who put in 0% effort and then blamed me the entire time. We never met thankfully but he kept trying to spin it on me. It felt really good to stand up and call him out on it. Eventually he apologized and wanted to “work things out” but i ghosted because we never met and he was crayyyyzyyy",1622505808

That is not say I suggest we not speak of their transgressions at all. I would encourage people to see that even their idols and leaders are flawed. However, to diminish their accomplishments due to them living within the confines of societal guidelines that were applicable at the time is pretty absurd.

You definitely should make an informed decision, but you should also make a concerted effort to become informed.

Tengo varios familiares uribistas que les parecio tan abusivo lo de las reformas que pensaban hasta salir a la calle. Aunque muchos no lo crean hasta los Uribistas estaban contra esa cosa pero las personas no salieron por el problema del **covid-19**. Tambien a varios les enojo que duque no hiciera nada con lo de los paros por tanto tiempo (osea militarizar-conmocion interior)  y ya no creen que los candidatos de Uribe sean aptos para el pais porque todos les salen Judas (Esto lo vi en twitter)  Su partido esta quemandose.  


El otro dia discutia con mis familiares sobre eso. Ok les acepte que Uribe ayudo a que el pais no fuera controlado por las FARC hace decadas pero hizo algo mas??????  


Su partido lleva 20 años dominando:  
La educacion malisima...salud-EPS malisima....la brecha entre ricos y pobres enorme......los falsos positivos......lo del agroingreso......campo abandonado.....Santos llego y robo mas (No entiendo como ese señor tiene un nobel) y ahora Duque con amigos como este [señor](https://www.elespectador.com/resizer/kJVYMOC1peNQllQFyYJrXXU7pI8=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-elespectador/public/GAVGEFFZDRG27GTEGTMEH3JEFI.jpg).   


Es muy claro que el Centro democratico ya no traera nada bueno a Colombia. Yo votare por alguien que no tenga que ver con Uribe-Duque-Santos en las siguientes elecciones. Eso si jamas petro. Ese señor no me gusta nada. Sigo su twitter y Las ideas con las que sale para Colombia son 0 viables economicamente y nos llevarian a la Ruina aun mas. Si por el fuera se pondria a imprimir dinero para mejorar la economia.

Endless weekend - why not pick up a couple extra This is a perfect end of summer fragrance. 

Flannel - I just burned this for the first time a couple months ago and I really liked it. 

Pumpkin cookie I couldn't remember if this one was good, I think people were complaining about it having no throw...... Does anyone remember this? 

There was a snowflakes and cashmere candle? Where was I? That's one of my favorite body care fragrances so I'm going to be picking up a basketball team's worth of this one.

I'm definitely going to need some Merry Mimosa in my life and I don't feel like waiting until November 

I wish I wish I wish they were bringing back the Merry Madeline cookie.... That one was so good.

I agree that whip cream on icecream is putting a hat on a hat, but I don’t see a difference between a ton of ingredients in icecream vs on them.

If you don’t like a particular topping, that’s cool. It doesn’t ruin it to add them though. If you mean you only like vanilla ice-cream and you’re considering that the base flavor, there is variability there as well. You can dump in milk, sweet and condensed milk, and a couple teaspoons of vanilla. You can also spend a long time and a lot of money on ingredients and make a custard.

"Stretched","t5_2tm3i","Ah, right, I should have probably explained before throwing the term “cat butt” out there haha. It’s basically caused by a buildup of scar tissue in the fistula / hole, creating a very wrinkly and shriveled up look. If they are irritated they can also look red, but in general “cat butt” refers to that wrinkled lobe look, as it can resemble the butthole of a cat lol. Some wrinkling is normal, but when it’s bad it can be pretty unsightly and the lobes are likely not healthy. Granted, you don’t really see it unless you don’t have jewelry in, so it’s not necessarily a huge deal. But for me, it’s just scar tissue that is getting in the way and making things harder.

As for acrylic, it’s generally not recommended to use as it is porous, harbors bacteria easily, cannot be sterilized or even really cleaned sufficiently, breaks down over time, and there have been claims that the material can leech chemicals into the skin at body temperature.

Basically, it’s not body-safe, and many people have adverse reactions. If you ever use acrylic, it should only be for short periods of time and only when your lobes are totally healed. It is possible to get away with it in certain circumstances, but there are no guarantees that you won’t have a reaction (even if you haven’t noticed any problems yet), that it won’t cause irritation or infection, and / or that you won’t do unnecessary damage to your body. 

I’ll always recommend glass jewelry first. It is body-safe and is easily cleaned / sterilized. It’s also very smooth and just feels good to wear, IMO. The weight of it in the larger sizes can help with natural stretching, too. 

If you don’t have metal sensitivities, you can go for surgical stainless steel (ideally from a reputable vendor). Titanium is a good option, as well. With metals and piercings, though, it’s best to look for implant-grade stuff. Glass will probably be the cheapest and easiest to find without sacrificing much quality. That’s what I’ve chosen for this second round and I love it. Acrylic had my lobes just…angry. They were never really properly healed while I was using acrylic. 

So, if you’re using acrylic now, just know it’s a risky situation and it can mess up your stretching journey. Arctic Buffalo has come to be a recommended source of single flare glass stretching plugs that are of decent quality without breaking the bank. Switching to a safer material is probably a good idea, even if it doesn’t seem to be doing any harm at the moment. Any positive change will bring better results.",1622505811

&gt;  Приказываю:    

&gt;  1. Леса, где прячутся бандиты, очистить ядовитыми газами, точно рассчитать, чтобы облако удушливых газов распространилось по всему лесу, уничтожая всё, что в нём пряталось.     

&gt;  2. Инспектору артиллерии немедленно подать на места потребное количество баллонов с ядовитыми газами и нужных специалистов.     

&gt;  3. Начальнику боевых участков настойчиво и энергично выполнить настоящий приказ.    

&gt;  4. О принятых мерах донести.     

&gt;  Командующий войсками Тухачевский,     
&gt;  Начальник штаба войск Генштаба Какурин.     

Приказ Полномочной комиссии ВЦИК № 116 от 23 июня 1921 года о порядке чистки в бандитски настроенных волостях и сёлах:     

&gt;  Опыт первого боевого участка показывает большую пригодность для быстрого очищения от бандитизма известных районов по следующему способу чистки.     

&gt;  Намечаются наиболее бандитски настроенные волости, и туда выезжают представители уполиткомиссии, особотделения, отделения РВТ и командования, вместе с частями, назначенными для проведения чистки. По прибытии на место волость оцепляется, берутся 60—100 наиболее видных заложников и вводится осадное положение. Выезд и въезд из волости должны быть на время операции запрещёны. После этого созывается полный волостной сход, на коем прочитываются приказы Полнком ВЦИК № 130 и 171 и написанный приговор для этой вол[ости]. Жителям даётся два часа срока на выдачу бандитов и оружия, а также бандитских семей, и население ставится в известность, что в случае отказа дать упомянутые сведения взятые заложники через два часа будут расстреляны. Если население не указало бандитов и не выдало оружие по истечении 2-часового срока, сход собирается вторично и взятые заложники на глазах у населения расстреливаются, после чего берутся новые заложники и собравшимся на сход вторично предлагается выдать бандитов и оружие. Желающие это исполнить становятся отдельно, разбиваются на сотни, и каждая сотня пропускается для опроса через опросную комиссию [из] представителей особотдела РВТ. Каждый должен дать показания, не отговариваясь незнанием. В случае упорства производятся новые расстрелы и т. д. По разработке материала, добытого из опросов, создаются экспедиционные отряды с обязательным участием в них лиц, давших сведения, и других местных жителей, [которые] направляются на ловлю бандитов. По окончании чистки осадное положение снимается, водворяется ревком и насаждается милиция.     
&gt;  Настоящее Полнком ВЦИК приказывает принять к неуклонному руководству и исполнению.     

&gt;  Председатель Полномочной комиссии ВЦИК Антонов-Овсеенко      
&gt;  Командующий войсками М.Тухачевский     
&gt;  Предгубисполкома Лавров     

Приказ Полномочной комиссии ВЦИК № 189 от 9 июля 1921 года о взятии и расстреле заложников в случае разрушения мостов:     

&gt;  Разгромленные банды прячутся в лесах и вымещают свою бессильную злобу на местном населении, сжигая мосты, портя плотины и прочее народное достояние. В целях охранения мостов Полнком ВЦИК приказывает:     

&gt;  1. Немедленно взять из населения деревень, вблизи которых расположены важные мосты, не менее пяти заложников, коих в случае порчи моста надлежит немедленно расстреливать.    

&gt;  2. Местным жителям организовывать под руководством ревкомов оборону мостов от бандитских налётов, а также вменить населению в обязанность исправление разрушенных мостов не позднее, чем в 24-часовой срок.     

&gt;  3. Настоящий приказ широко распространить по всем деревням и сёлам.

"ECEProfessionals","t5_2t05v","I think u/WeeklyPreparation832 has the right idea up above. That, unfortunately, for many working in the classroom setting, it's about a level of control, not necessarily who or what is best for the children. I had a terrible time entering the field and would go home at least on a weekly basis if not sometimes multiple times a week crying due to the 'mean girl alpha' bullshit I was being subjected to. This, as a white woman who - as another user said above - just doesn't quite 'fit the mold'. Now, 8 years later, the same girls who bullied me are complaining that I'm leaving to become director of another center instead of staying to lead theirs. 

The center I work(ed) at was admittedly toxic in so many ways, but taught me some serious life lessons. One that I think applies well here is: if you know why you've made the choices you have, and that you have not acted with any mal-intent, don't spend your time worrying or wondering why or how another person has taken it the way they do. All you can control is yourself, and if, at the end of the day, you can sleep well knowing you made your decisions for the right reasons with good intent, it is not up to you to help another sleep at night. If they are bothered by you, fine. Maybe it will help them to combat their own personal bias in attempt to sleep without being bothered. 

I have worked with many male teachers in this field, and I echo all of the women above who have said, thank you for what you do. We need more good men, especially men of color, to be role models to our kids and challenge their ideas of what role gender plays in our career choices. 

I've trained many teachers at my center and within my district, and something I focus heavily on is challenging our own implicit bias in the classroom, when it comes to the way we treat our students *and* our coworkers. People are so afraid to admit that they have any personal bias that they fail to challenge themselves to look at *why* they might treat certain people (children or adults) differently than others. In reality, we *all* hold personal biases, it's how we learned and were taught to view and interact with our world; from the impact of the media we see, to what our parents taught us, to the the generational stigmas from when we were growing up. The best of us will challenge and identify that bias to create an equal playing field for *everyone* in our classroom. Then there are those who refuse... This has nothing to do with *who* you are, and everything to do with *what* they have indoctrinated bias towards.

"MinecraftChampionship","t5_28ln0r","Yes, his leadership skills are amazing. Aside from understanding his team's strengths and approaching things strategically, what's very important is his positivity and effort to boost team morale. A good leader can bring up criticism about something, but knows not to drag it out too long so the team can focus on what they can do for the next game instead of dwelling on the past and stewing in negativity. I notice whenever chat or his teammates start complaining about something for too long, Pete finds a way to offer a different perspective or to help the team move on from it.

Also he doesn't look for external things to blame poor performance on. Whenever things aren't going well and Pete feels like he's getting emotional, he'll just mute and rant to his chat. But in his rant, he's not trashing anyone. He talks about what he himself did wrong and what he should've done and then goes back to his team.

Even though his team could've finished 2nd, Pete chose not to be mad about the Ace Race thing at all. And despite his team not being as PVP-oriented, he helped get them to 3rd place and he himself got #1 overall on the leaderboard. It's really incredible the positivity he has.",1622505811

"TwoBestFriendsPlay","t5_2uzei","I really like his speech, and then when he goes to visit the museum. Problem with it, IMO, is how abrupt it all is. It’s all kind of sanitized and almost unearned. Politicians who were ignoring the plight of refugees for years, and moments away from using military force to forcefully relocate them are suddenly reconsidering because Falcon, who has been kind of irrelevant to them until the last episode, saved their lives and gave a decent speech.

The speech is also kind of a real watered down kind of thing. It’s rough because it’s a very reductive kind of, mass appeal speech that also comes from a place of almost detachment and privilege. It’s still good though, but doesn’t fit as well with the themes and conflicts the series is tackling, let alone the tone of the show itself. 

The Flag Smashers just… end because their goal is achieved, and they are all dead now.

Then even Sam taking Isaiah Bradley to the museum and seeing that also just suddenly happens. Not too long ago we saw Bradley hopeless and broken down, then he warms up a little, and then the big rescue happens. Then suddenly he’s completely on board and Sam got a whole exhibit addition for him.

Walker goes through tragedy and internal struggle throughout the show just to have it be resolved for him by the time he needs to show up again.

So nothing wrong with any of these plot points, but the way it was handled really skips over the development and time we needed to have those conclusions have any strong impact or even justification, depending.",1622505812

I have an expensive system explicitly so I can get full dynamic range without needing to be very loud. I would like to hear things in detail now, but also still be able to hear when I’m 60. I pay to serve both those priorities. Any system can distinguish between very loud and very quiet. The question for me is can it replicate the difference between mezzo-forte and forte, at even reduced volume, or piano and pianissimo. Can I hear a pin drop without needing to turn the whispers above a whisper? That’s a good system. Of course if you pump the top up to 120 decibels, you can stratify the range enough hear the difference on any system. A good system can provide full nuance and clarity without needing to do that.",1622505812

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","** TW: Abuse (&amp; also just a really long vent)**

I grew up in a narcissistic abusive household, and I didn’t realize that what was happening to me was *that bad* until I was about 14. My mom forced me out of the closet (by screaming in my face over a gap in my text history- she went through my phone regularly, and the gap were texts from me turning down a boy in favor of a long distance girlfriend I had). She then confiscated 4+ years worth of journaling, drawing, lyricism- and deleted my Wattpad, which at the time had over 3k followers and was approaching a million reads. 

These were the only creative outlets I had, because I wasn’t allowed to go anywhere without their approval since she and my dad pulled me out of school at 12 to ‘unschool me’. (Pre-Qanon, but they of course ended up as Qanon supporters) 

After confiscating all my stuff, Mon attempted to ‘exorcise me of my demons’, after reading all my journals and then burning them. They also made me watch conversion therapy testimonies and videos, and made me read extensively about the effects of porn addiction. 

I was *14* - and not gay. I was Bi. And very much not addicted to porn, even if I did watch every now and again.

This all traumatized me so much that I entirely forgot about my LD girlfriend at the time, and when I emailed her years later she was devastated that I couldn’t even remember our relationship. I had only recovered my old email to try reconnecting with my online friends I’d lost thanks to having my wattpad deleted. 

To be fair we’d only been together for that summer, but still- it sucks I can only remember the occasional phone call. I don’t even remember her last name. 

Anyway- after all the *literal torture*, I kind of lost any respect I had for my parents that year. I was never able to respect either of them ever again- not that I had much respect in the first place- and in fact have gone no/low contact. My dad is in jail, (for the sexual abuse side of all this that I won’t get into), so he has no contact, and my mom SHOULD be in jail for identity theft and fraud (again, won’t get into that) but she has very low contact. I intend to cut her off entirely as soon as I’m financially able to do so.",1622505813

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","So sorry for your loss. Grief is hard to go through on your own much less guide a child through. 
Want to briefly state my point of view. I was taken from my mother at 3 years old and put with my Uncle and Aunt. Many are right in saying he will lash out, that is very true. Be as understanding as possible but be sure to set boundaries so he doesnt get lost on what is and isn't acceptable.  My Aunt had a baby within a year of taking me in. I'm sure it was very challenging.  I was an only child and had lost my mother and now was having to share attention as well. I did lash out, sometimes at the baby, and regressed. The thing is it all worked out and later in life that baby was my best friend but I'm sure for the first year or two it was a lot to handle. So if you have the baby or if you wait, I think ,has more to do with you and your partner and what you both feel like you can handle in this time of change and grief. I just had a baby and postpartum hits hard. Sleep deprivation is hard. A crying newborn is hard. Completely and utterly worth it but hard.  My heart is with you all in this tough time.",1622505814

"TalesFromDF","t5_21q0in","What, pray tell, is the difference between queuing for CT directly versus queueing for alliance roulette with an ilevel of 120? Literally the only difference is that I can knock out my daily roulette at the same time and/or maybe get a couple free materia crystals from the in-need bonus. Either way there's a CT group in the queue to ""drag you into"", even though there probably already was from a random sprout and I'm just taking a spot in that group.

I could understand if your argument was along the lines of ""cheating the devs' intentions for roulette"" or whatever; I wouldn't agree but I see dumber arguments along those ""purist"" lines all the time from single-pulling tanks and zero-dps healers. But your complaint is just that you get a lot of CT in roulette and that you're blaming ilevel cheesers for it. The reality is they have a near-zero effect on that and what you're actually seeing is the standard roulette MSQ bias. If you want to keep being mad at what is merely a symptom of a different, *actual* problem (the massive time/effort gap between first/second-tier and final-tier raids), by all means keep at it.

Besides, the kinds of people who think Orbonne is ""too hard"" and feel the need to cheese into only the easiest possible content are the kinds of people I'd rather keep quarantined in the kiddie pool, not force them into content that asks them to do more than ignore mechanics and sometimes step out of orange.

&gt; Maybe, just maybe the ilvl cheesers aren't doing it as much right now because there's actual benefits to letting the roulette do its thing?

This doesn't even make sense because nothing has changed with roulette at all recently; there are no new benefits to ""letting roulette do its thing"". And if there *were* such benefits good enough to convince people to stop ilevel cheesing, wouldn't that be mission accomplished???",1622505814

I trend towards libertarian municipalism in my thinking, so I don’t generally expect much from instruments of the state like a President or Senator. 

My ideological differences with Biden are vast, but I have been specifically disappointed in his abandonment of student loan forgiveness and police reform, his reluctance to embrace medicare for all, and his general lack of progressive policies. 

My biggest complaint would be his and the dem’s messaging, and disparagement of working class voters, particularly in rural and rust belt areas. We have abandoned those folks in this country and it led to Trump. We will likely disagree whether he gave a shit about any of them, but I think the failure of our politics and country to share the abundant wealth of this land has disenfranchised and left behind a lot of people.

Generally that leads to authoritarianism, be if left or fascist in nature.

Biden won’t fix that. Those problems will persist and I think they are the problems driving our country into the ground.",1622505814

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","A lofty oak cast his leafy crown |
Over a lake, blue and clear; |
His roots buried deep in the ground, |
He stood firm and never felt fear. ||

By his side, near the blue lake, |
A small, frail bush was lovingly planted; |
Her slender sticks coiled like snakes; |
She shook with each gust the wind granted. ||

The lofty Oak would laugh at the Bush: |
""Look at you and look at me: |
Your frail branches snap at the slightest push; |
I am sturdy, and mighty as the never-ending sea."" ||

And so life went on for the Bush and the Oak |
Until one day a raging storm came; |
Whipping the lake into foam and smoke |
Zephyr came too with the winds he would tame. ||

Zephyr let his winds loose to dance |
And the Oak struggled against them; |
The frail little Bush took a more welcoming stance |
And let the winds flow through her delicate stem. ||

After the storm went, the lofty Oak, |
His pride crushed, lay in the lake; |
And that is when the Bush spoke: |
""Sucks to be you. That's karma right there"". ||",1622505815

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","The Democrats want their power bases to play tug of war. The base of financial support for them fundamentally disagrees with the base of voter support on too many issues. So they try to keep politics about siloed political battles with ground rules everyone understands.

The way this breaks down on an individual level is twofold - Democrats in congress generally got there championing a few key issues that they push for, but go with the conventional party wisdom on the other issues. The other quality is that ever changing the rules or norms is a threat to everyone - when you have the filibuster in place I as a senator or rep don't have to figure out my position on every issue, because I get to adopt what my voters want and battle the other party knowing I'll either get nothing or a small piece of what I've been sent to negotiate. So removing a norm that prevented me from having to choose between my donors and voters forces me to now make someone unhappy, and even worse now I don't know what other norms I can rely on or if there will continue to be an erosion of norms.

The Republicans also have this problem, but to a much lesser extent, and it allows them to push boundaries that the Democrats don't even consider and it allows them to unify around some key policies. Now of course they fail at some of their agenda - especially repealing the ACA (part of the ""problem"" was that special interest groups became much more pro-ACA during the years the GOP was campaigning on it and there was a lot of support from groups like the AMA and AARP).",1622505816

"SubstituteTeachers","t5_2tf8l","TLDR I'm bad at keeping things short, no tldr, sorry

Little late, and I wrote a wall of text, sorry, but can I just say? Yeah. This shit sucks. (I'm not saying it's your fault, I'm saying the opposite.) Annoying and scary. In my neck of the woods thank the good lord I believe you can collect unemployment at this one particular place I sub  when school's out for the summer (that's what a friend who's actually done it a long time, unlike me, has said. )

I really hope things pick up for ya. 

Let me know how it goes! 

I feel like sometimes subbing can be a hella lonely thing! Reach out whenever.

 I'm dumb enough to expect this to be a long time job for me.

I did it full time for like two months so far haha, and have done it occassionally for a long while, and have worked general support jobs (like paraprofessional) in schools forever but yeah. (Relatively forever haha, I'm pretty young.) Mercifully I've only had like two or so helldays at impoverished middle schools with trouble makers, and occassionally a hellish day or two at an elementary, but nothing truly Earth shattering. I'm both sensitive and not. Subbing seems like the most and least sustainable job in the world haha.

I agree that the pay isn't dismal for the workload btw (think I saw you saying as much in another post or whatever?) And when I'm subbing as a teacher's assistant I usually do literally no work and get paid for it (lol I'm not saying out of choice, there's literally nothing to do) and when I sub middle and high school it's so easy it feels like I've found the most perfect job imaginable... maybe I shouldn't be admitting these traits of mine haha, but as for *why* the easiness I do live in a reasonably okay town, so maybe that's why the behavior isn't the worst......... I mean we absolutely *do* have some poverty that would breed some troublesome behavior but yeah. The only parts of the job I don't like are the lack of a single guaranteed hour, and I mostly want to work in my town alone (while I work for an agency that pretty much staffs like half the state) so I really do risk occassional pretty substantial underemployment but yeah. And the only slightly shameful thing is I've been disrespected and reacted in ways where it's like not terrible by any means but it's like I could've handled it a smidge better. That said I err on being a bit lax and am always aware that I'm not being hired to be a hyper efficient dictator, and even real teachers have a tough time. I mean like in my neck of the woods all you need is *some* college to sub, that's it, and I graduated, so I'm grateful for that.

If you live on the South Side, Perry Park is the rink to go. 

If you live on the north side, you have options like Carmel Ice Skadium, Fuel Tank in Fishers, and way north in Westfield. 

There is one you can go to at the Indiana State Fairgrounds, but it’s not the best in my opinion.

"Cringetopia","t5_ovfhp","Nah, anime is pretty fucking weak.

For starters shit is barely animated,I get economising when drawing,but half the time it looks like a slideshow or a character panning over a static background.

The dialogue is absolute trash,the characters constantly say what they're thinking and spend half the runtime narrating their thoughts. That's shit writing.

Character tropes - that's not a quirk of the medium, that's shit writing

Half the characters look the same,I swear on some shows the only thing that's different is their hair. 

The fanservice - it's obvious and feels out of place. I get some people watch this stuff with their dicks in their hand but you really shouldn't be catering to that, especially when it detracts from the plot(which it does 99% of the time)

The comedy: anime just isn't funny. I don't know who actually laughs at comedy anime, family guy somehow manages to be funnier than anime.

There are some good animes, in my experience they're usually movies, there's actual characters that develop and shit is actually animated.",1622505820

Look at his face. He's not enjoying it, its just probably the thing he hates the least when he has to do it 10+hrs/day.

I know the guys you mean though. Just because I'm not them doesn't mean they don't make up my friendship groups. I'm in tech and know a fair number of geeky guys who are shy and have a hard time talking to women. 

Trying to help them date has been like rolling my face into concrete at times. I get that it's a lot easier when you have good social skills but when reading things here like ""women only go for chads. Top 20%"" etc. etc. It can be frustrating.

I have absolutely no idea how far away they are because Zack does a horrible job showing how far they actually walk. But the coyote very specifically says they’re moving indoors because they’re only allowed outside at the perimeter. My thought is he doesn’t feel he can escape without the helicopter (or maybe they all understand it’s a trek without it since everything being evacuated- again, really not well explained) and wants to go get it. I don’t disagree the motivation is super strange, just trying to throw in my two cents because it did sort of make sense to me; I just think quite a bit of it was poorly explained- the best example being exactly how far they had walked.

We also cut a sheet of plexi glass to fit the top to keep in humidity. That was only for the first year though when our little one needed the extra humidity.

11 pellet shotguns (almost certain all but 3 are obtainable). Unless you mean primary pellets then you’re right it’s just 2.

12 scouts (needs to be more), but most of them feel crappy especially without explosive rounds. They’re the best example of why primaries need to be retuned.

There have always been less special weapons in the kinetic slot. And massive variety is not what we need when we’re getting good weapons. Most of these kinetic guns are solid.

Welcome to r/HomeworkHelp! It seems like you have not attempted to structure your post title to classify your question's level and discipline/topic enclosed with **square brackets** as a title prefix.

**e.g.** **[AS Level Physics: Light]** It's a grade 12 ques of probability, I am not getting the ans of ques of 4, I don't understand it please help

###Positive Examples

|Examples|**square brackets** is being used at prefix (must) + topic (optional) + clear question|
|:-|:-|
|includes syllabus|\**[GCE 'O' Level Calculus: Differentiation\]** How to differentiate e?|
||**\[AP English: Essay Writing\]** Should all adverts be factual?|
|includes grade|**\[Grade 8 Algebra: Complete the square\]** How to factorise ax^(2)\+bx+c?|
||**\[University Chemistry: Titration\]** What is my qs?|

###Bad Examples

|Examples|*It still works, but strongly discouraged*|
|:-|:-|
|Grade/level is not specific enough|**\[High School Math\]** What is my qs?|
|What is your question?|\[Grade 8 Algebra\] **Helpppp!**|
|Do not attempt to circumvent square brackets requirement. Classify your question with square brackets|**\[Q\]** What is my question?|

**There is no fixed list of standardised grades, disciplines or topics.** As long as you have tried your best to structure your post title to keep things organised in the following format: ***[&lt;Level/Syllabus&gt;: &lt;Discipline&gt;and/or&lt;Topic&gt;] Question?***, you are safe!

Nothing ""bad"" actually happens in those relationships, but by virtue of Katsuya and Kureno being much older than Kyoko and Uo (both of which are minors at that point in the story), they are taking advantage of them. And both of those stories are heavily romanticized.

You two aren’t friends, you just happen to chat on break sometimes and this seems to be what he talks about all the time. It’s unprofessional, it dampens your mood at work, could very well make you uncomfortable to be around him, and him whining about it nonstop to a random coworker is pathetic. I feel bad that he is dealing with this, and he could really use a therapist or a good supportive friend to help him see life in a better light. But so far, you haven’t signed up to be that friend or therapist. He sounds toxic and like I replied earlier, I have a friend who sounds very similar to him, and it is so exhausting to hear him talk the same negativity nonstop. It is draining and I feel as though my advice is forgotten within minutes after talking to him. There’s something more going on with your coworker and I think it is 100% ok that you had a moment of frustration and blurted that out.

"LSD","t5_2qhvj","In my experience, I think it's just a drug that makes your brain do weird shit but can be a lot of fun, and also in my opinion I don't think the fun is worth the risk, because bad trips can happen to anyone and ""bad"" can always be worse. As well, I don't think it can teach you things. The only thing I ever learned from taking acid is that I didn't learn anything at all.

This is a hot take, so don't take offense to this, but in my experience, I've come to believe that the only people who believe that acid teaches them things are stupid (or ignorant, either and/or both...). This may sound judgemental, maybe it is, but I'm sure you know some very very dumb and/or ignorant people, like people who still believe crystals have magical healing powers, some people are just kinda dumb and there's no debating perception on that one. Some of those people also take lsd, and then they wrongly believe that they learned something, and then they go and tell everyone, and then those people try it and believe so strongly in what they were told that they believe it too and then etc etc etc... It's hard to blame people who took it BEFORE anyone knew what it was, and yes I'm well aware that loads of smart people and even scientists have used lsd and thought it had lots of value, but I'm also aware that Ben Carson is a real doctor too, so...

Who am I to say the experiences are useless though, hell even I on mushrooms once had a life changing experience where I learned to be better, and I WAS better, how can I call that experience useless or misunderstood? Well, I slowly began to realize that all of the things I thought and noticed, albeit from a different perspective, I'd already thought of and believed in before! All of it came from ME, and all your trips come from YOU, and your subconscious is not smarter than you, nor is it any better or worse. There's no reason at all to trust what you learned from acid more than what you think while sober, and honestly plenty of reasons to believe it even less, and nor can you fairly say something like it taught you how to be a good person. No, YOU knew how to be a good person ACCORDING TO YOU, and now you're hopefully doing those things. I guess it doesn't really matter if it's all bologna though if they're still being a good person now, from that example, but well that's for another debate lol...

I saw a top comment on a very popular post recently that said ""lsd cured depression that I didn't even know I had."" Hopefully you know that that doesn't make any sense at all lol. I say, the power of belief is stronger than you think. There are people who literally faint in church because the ""holy spirit went through them"", and people who also believe that next to them who will just leave them there unconscious. It's very easy to believe things on or after using acid, but a person who is less ignorant of things might be able to see through the facade and realize that they didn't really learn anything, it was just the drugs. That's just how I see it, maybe I'm wrong, I'd sure like to be wrong honestly, but at the time it doesn't look like it to me.",1622505827
"SexToys","t5_2qimy","Oil based lubricants, like coconut oil or The Butters, will last longer. They don't feel the same as water-based lubes - they're greasy rather than wet - and can stain underwear, so just be mindful of that.

If you don't think you'll like the feel of oil and prefer something that feels wet, I'd suggest a thick hybrid lube. Hybrids are water-based lubes with a small percentage of silicone. They're safe with silicone toys and the silicone content makes them last longer.

"aspergers","t5_2rm6u","For a lot of us, interacting socially is something that we enjoy, but is draining. Like, hanging out for a few ours can be as exhausting mentally as running a marathon is physically.

Similarly, engaging in the usual small interactions that most people like to do can be like randomly having weights thrown at us while being told to start lifting them - the activity (weight lifting) itself isn't unpleasant, it even feels *good* \- it's just that without preparation and schedule it can be... disruptive to our function, and throw us off balance (much like having random weights thrown at one, even if one can easily catch them).

Some days, we just kind of don't feel the mental vigor to do social-things, (again parallel to the way some days, someone who enjoys regular physical activity might wake up tiredish and not feel up to doing a full workout, or anything at all).

At the same time, it can be really hard, or even embarrassing, to articulate the above, much less convey it succinctly, and since many of us have had bad experiences with people getting upset with regard to this matter (aside from standard imposter syndrome and anxiety stuff (e.g. feeling like one is worthless because of this)), it can be very difficult to even try to speak about it in the first place.",1622505828

"FanFiction","t5_2r5kb","Your mistake is in thinking people entrenched in a polarized belief system are going to be open to any rational argument whatsoever that contradicts their beliefs. You can't win an argument through logic if your opponent's argument is ""anyone who isn't 100% against fictional representations of minors (or legal teens or ""minor coded"" short people) having sex is a pedophile or a pedophile apologist.""  You might run into some people who are kind of bobbing uncertainly around the edges of things and are more open to reason, but the majority of antis who butt heads with proshippers are not.

You say the real argument is about whether fiction can affect reality. I'll point you in the direction of the anti wars in the Hannibal fandom. If fiction affecting reality was their primary concern, antis wouldn't be in the fandom at all. They shouldn't be willing to touch that fandom with a ten foot pole; they could easily argue that the show glorifies and romanticizes violence, cannibalism, profoundly unhealthy relationships, and all number of morally awful things. But they don't care about any of that. What they care about is shipping a 19 year old woman with an older man, because they claim it's ""pedophilia."" They then get all shocked and furious when the showrunner supports creative freedom and therefore proshippers and start calling him a pedophile/zoophile apologist too. I can't overemphasize how bizarre the whole situation is. Not a single fleck of logic to be found anywhere.

I recommend checking out [freedom-of-fanfic.tumblr.com](https://freedom-of-fanfic.tumblr.com) for some thoughtful analysis of anti culture and the arguments around it. It's important to acknowledge that at this point it is an ideological community, not just some random misguided people. Specifically, I've sometimes linked people to [this post](https://freedom-of-fanfic.tumblr.com/post/181813435249/do-you-have-any-posts-i-could-send-to-antis-to) when they are burning themselves out trying to argue with antis in the belief that they might be able to make them see reason.",1622505828

"AskLosAngeles","t5_2zay0","Holy shit - booked black car for 4:00am this morning - sucking up the $100 charge, for a 20 mins drive - thinking that would get a somewhat guaranteed driver. 

After 4 straight cancels within 7 - 8 mins distance (after driving towards me for 4 - 5 mins) I had to wake my wife up, bundle up the baby and have them take me to the airport, otherwise I was missing my plane. I was flipping between Uber and lift to see which app would follow through. 

It was awful getting any driver to commit to a ride out of LAX too, pre pandemic, constant calls to say (lie) “the app isn’t showing me where you are, what stand and where are you going?” Then promptly cancel for a trip to Santa Monica. Which was surge pricing at $50-60. Started telling them I was going to Beverly Hills and all of a sudden they wanted the fare. Lol jokes on you, oops I need to go to Santa Monica! No tip for you!!lol

Who turns down $60 for 20 mins?

"f150","t5_2t4ts","I agree with you on the appearance. I just don't follow the logic of jumping from 1/2 to 3/4. Maybe we are misunderstanding each other. 

I have F150 crew, 4x4 with 5.0 and 6.5ft bed. It is a little long for tight parking lots but you can manage with a keen eye and, IMHO, it looks better than the crew with a 5ft bed. I have the extreme tow package which is like the old school ""heavy half"" from back in the day. I can haul a full pallet of st augustine sod (~2200 pounds) while still having 2-3"" bumpstop gap or tow something crazy like 11k pounds. I dont buy sod but once a year and I'll never need to tow 5 tons but it's nice to have that capability while having a comfortable ride and  getting 18mpg daily commute. 

Bottom line, if you want a longer bed with a crew then you can do it with the 1/2 ton it just may be a little harder to find. If you realistically need more capability and can rationalize the higher ownership and operating costs then the super duty is a hella nice truck that will do the job.

Note: I think the base model has 17"" wheels with 32-32.8 inch tires. The the 18 and 20"" wheel packages can get a factory oversize tire that is 33.5 - 34 inches tall. I like the way the 34s look and there are so many 35"" tire options for about the same price as a smaller tire that, again IMHO, it would be silly not to go with a 35 whenever the need arises.",1622505829

I have an inkling that MANY new artists are scared to get axed so they generate these crazy battles and sequences to keep it thrilling and make sure to jump off one beat to the next with little to no downtime in between.

Even still, I REALLY love Undead Unluck. At first the art was a bit.. Odd for my liking, but it has this weird charm that makes me constantly go back to it.

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","The ACC doesn't have a Tier 2 bowl because they don't have a ""Best Team not in the NY6"" bowl designation against the best non-NY6 team from another conference, while the rest of the conferences do (P12 and B12 send their best non-NY6 team to the Alamo Bowl, and the B1G and SEC send their best non-NY6 team to the Citrus Bowl).

Outback Bowl is in Tier 3 and Liberty Bowl is in Tier 4 because the Big 12 sent their fourth best non-NY6 team to the Liberty Bowl while the Big Ten sent their #3-5 best non-NY6 team to the Outback Bowl. For comparison, the Big 12 sent their second best non-NY6 team to the Camping World Bowl (Tier 3 bowl) and their third best non-NY6 team to the Texas Bowl (Tier 4 bowl).

Take a side-by-side look at how the Outback Bowl and Liberty Bowl compare through the years and tell me that the Liberty Bowl is on the same tier:

Bowl Game | Winning Team | Losing Team | Combined Conf. W-L
---------|----------|----------|----------
2019 Outback Bowl | Minnesota (7-2) | Auburn (5-3) | 12-5 (70.6%)
2019 Liberty Bowl | Navy (G5) | Kansas State (5-4) | 5-4 (55.6%)
2018 Outback Bowl | Iowa (5-4) | Mississippi State (4-4) | 9-8 (52.9%)
2018 Liberty Bowl | Oklahoma State (3-6) | Missouri (4-4) | 7-10 (41.2%)
2017 Outback Bowl | South Carolina (5-3) | Michigan (5-4) | 10-7 (58.8%)
2017 Liberty Bowl | Iowa State (5-4) | Memphis (G5) | 5-4 (55.6%)
2016 Outback Bowl | Florida (6-2) | Iowa (6-3) | 12-5 (70.6%)
2016 Liberty Bowl | Georgia (4-4) | TCU (4-5) | 8-9 (47.1%)
2015 Outback Bowl | Tennessee (5-3) | Northwestern (6-2) | 11-5 (68.8%)
2015 Liberty Bowl | Arkansas (5-3) | Kansas State (3-6) | 8-9 (47.1%)
2014 Outback Bowl | Wisconsin (7-1) | Auburn (4-4) | 11-5 (68.8%)
2014 Liberty Bowl | Texas A&amp;M (3-5) | West Virginia (5-4) | 8-9 (47.1%)
2013 Outback Bowl | LSU (5-3) | Iowa (5-3) | 10-6 (62.5%)
2013 Liberty Bowl | Mississippi State (3-5) | Rice (G5) | 3-5 (37.5%)
2012 Outback Bowl | South Carolina (6-2) | Michigan (6-2) | 12-4 (75.0%)
2012 Liberty Bowl | Tulsa (G5) | Iowa State (3-6) | 3-6 (33.3%)

The SEC might include it on the same tier, but that doesn't mean it's the same caliber of game when the teams actually meet up. There have even been multiple games when G5 teams had to be substituted into the Liberty Bowl because there weren't enough SEC/B12 teams that qualified, but that never happened to the Outback Bowl.",1622505830

"Antipsychiatry","t5_2to28","“Antipsychotics” started out as chemicals used to kill insects. Psychiatrists noted when given to people they caused the people to become docile, asocial, easier to control, and sedated. They called this improving health. Later Psychiatry said the drugs equaled chemical lobotomies. Which since “antipsychotics” cause brain damage this is a rare instance when Psychatry was telling the truth.  9 months of use causes more than 4 times the brain decline that occurs over a lifetime. “Schizonrpeina“ does not cause brain damage, psych drugs do according to the research.

"WorldOfTanksBlitz","t5_31zi1","This Team Shame Tuesday is abit different, as I am only targeting 2 particular players, while the rest did ok. Battle was at Castilla, heavies and tds went windmill, lights and meds went clock tower. Within 30 seconds, Vickers typed out ‘World of nubs’ then proceeded to commit suicide by drowning himself in the river. At this point, we have just lost the strongest and only light in our game, but the m46 decided to brawl with the t92e1 nonetheless, while wt supports him. At the heavy side we are facing a group of tds at their spawn camping with 3 heavies on the other side of the hill. Is4 and I took on the Kran and the vk, while t30 and obj supported us. Obj happened to get his health depleted to 400+hp, then started to accuse the rest of being noob(don’t know what to do to help him when we got enemies to deal with). At the same time, the opposing fv has rushed the clock tower, killing both wt and m46, leaving the heavies and our 2 tds alone. Hori rushed with his other heavies, got shot by obj, but obj died. At this point in time I was a 1 shot, at 100+ hp and I would like to commend this is4, for trying his best to support me and blocking the kran from shooting me, but sadly I got killed by grille camping at the back. While we were fighting, obj seemed to have some disagreements, accusing us for being noob, and never seem to say anything but ‘your mother’ when confronted. 

Other than is4, I also have to commend on the m46 Patton, who continued fighting on the Med side despite being overwhelmed by tds and the t92e1",1622505832

A lot of people here probably think that ""real"" rich people live in a modest house with a base Corolla/Camry with the beige interior, super cheap budget and live like they have no money... And to me I don't want to be that guy but I feel like some people who vehemently say/comment this feels like just a confirmation bias to take up the moral high ground on other people who spend their money in more obvious ways.

I worked with CEO's of airline companies, hedge fund managers, CEO's of law firms and I can without a doubt  I'd can tell you MANY rich people don't live like broke college students and ""modesty"" is relative. 

For me the pretending to be rich folks are people who window shop with no real intention of buying items at luxury stores to basically take pictures of themselves with luxury items/goods. People don't like this but when you go to fancy stores like Louis Vuitton, a Mercedes dealership or Burberry the staff are VERY judgmental and I can tell you it's not really about what you're wearing that tips them off.

He always wears his Vietnam vet cap. He is basically a bum. His car is a green Saturn that is chock full of stuff. He sometimes reeks of urine. Sometimes the smell is so bad that we have to move our table far away from him. My parents told me that he has some mental issues due to being in the war and what not. When he sneezes, it is awful loud, and often frightens me and my mom. I think he is there everyday. Today, as we were driving back home from our bookstore hanging out place, my mom told me that she overheard him and an old veteran friend of his talking about how they think the democrat governor of our state should be out of office and that trump got screwed over in the presidency and should be president. I didn’t really care for this guy, TBH, but when my mom told me that he was basically a trumpster, I lost the last amount of respect for him, I don’t think I’ll ever seem him the same way again.",1622505833

&gt;When the appointed night arrived, another of the Kingsguard came for her, a man as different from Sandor Clegane as . . . well, as a flower from a dog.

""Ser Loras,"" she finally managed, ""you . . . **you look so lovely.""**  
&gt;  
&gt;""Oh,"" said Sansa. **I am talking to him, and he's touching me, he's holding my arm and touching me.** ""The Queen of Thorns, she's called. Isn't that right?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Your grandmother?"" **Sansa was finding it hard to walk and talk and think all at the same time, with Ser Loras touching her arm. She could feel the warmth of his hand through the silk.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Ser Balon Swann held the door of Maegor's for them to pass. He was all in white as well, **though he did not wear it half so well as Ser Loras.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Wed to Ser Loras, oh . . . **Sansa's breath caught in her throat. She remembered Ser Loras in his sparkling sapphire armor, tossing her a rose. Ser Loras in white silk, so pure, innocent, beautiful. The dimples at the corner of his mouth when he smiled. The sweetness of his laugh, the warmth of his hand. She could only imagine what it would be like to pull up his tunic and caress the smooth skin underneath, to stand on her toes and kiss him, to run her fingers through those thick brown curls and drown in his deep brown eyes.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","I think for some guys the word “date” feels like too much of a commitment, like it might set up some level of obligation or expectation. Kind of like going on a “date” almost implies you’re *dating.* Especially if they met you online, they might feel like they don’t really know you well enough to want to call it a formal “date.” I think calling it “hanging out” makes it feel more casual for them. That way, if they meet you and there’s no chemistry and they don’t want to see you again, it doesn’t feel like this big thing where they disappointed you and let you down because it wasn’t even a date, it was just hanging out. 

But also beware of the guys who just like to say “hanging out” as code for them using you for sex. They won’t ask you out on a date because they’re not even going to go through the pretense or expense of taking you to a restaurant or pretending to want to date you. They just want you to come over and “hang out” so they can get some, and then you leave. Their favorite activities are Netflix, pizza, and video games. If a guy who says he just wants to “hang out” is talking about at his house from the start, he’s *that* guy.",1622505833

"muacjdiscussion","t5_342em","I've never found a foundation that matches as well, unfortunately! I use a LOT of green concealer, the LA Girl Pro Conceal Green Corrector, as well as LA Girl white and blue mixers. Things I've tried that I thought might be close from the Internet include:

ELF Camo CC Cream in Light 240W is the correct level, but it oxidizes too ruddy/orange. I mix it with blue and green, but it accentuates texture then because it's soo thick with mixer added. If you like a thick CC cream, I would recommend this, though.

Surprisingly enough, Maybelline Instant Age Rewind concealer in Light is a bit light for my skintone in value, but the undertones are nice, not too red or orange. I took the sponge tip off of the one I use as actual concealer, but if you like to err on the side of a lighter foundation (i.e. you like to use lots of bronzer/blush) this stuff is beautiful as a glowy, skinlike allover base. It's very thin and lightweight in texture, which makes it super nice as a light-medium buildable foundation. 

Colourpop Pretty Fresh Tinted Moisturizer in 9W is way too orange, and the formula separates. I'd try 7W since I'm paler now and the undertones look less orange, but it separates in the tube and gets... somehow grainy. When I'm tan, it's a better match, though, so I'm keeping it around. Findation says 7W is close to Linen, though, and if you like a medium-coverage super dewy base, I'd give this one a shot. 

L'Oreal True Match in W3 is way too dark and orange.

[Findation.com](https://Findation.com) says that other matches for us would include Maybelline Fit Me 118, which looks like a pretty good bet.",1622505833

Bravo) is easier to give leeway to because it's Impact, it's basically a secondary indie company owned by a TV network and not supposed to be the tip-top of the business.

Also not for nothing, but I think they've handled Kenny Omega as a heel invader better than AEW has handled him as a heel roster member.
