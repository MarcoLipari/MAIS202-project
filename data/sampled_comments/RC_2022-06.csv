"adhdwomen","t5_31aao","Flexible hours would be so good. 

I kind of have that now but am expected to generally be 'on' 9-5. But whether it's ADHD or just having been in school for so long, my brain is like ""deep research/writing projects get done at HOME and at NIGHT"" and I so wish I could sometimes either sleep in and work like, 11-5 and then have a break and do another hour or two at night, OR do like, 9-2 for court/office stuff/client calls, and then 3 hours in the evening/night for research/writing/organizing. Then I could run errands and have appointments and clean during that 2-5 window when I have the like, motivation and wherewithal for that stuff. I have SUCH a hard time motivating myself to run errands or clean house after work--especially running errands. Once I get home I do not want to go out again, other than to walk my dog or maybe go for a run in the woods. I do NOT want to be where the people are-- I need at least a couple of hours of decompression between work and even hanging out with people I know and like at places I enjoy being, aka not the goddamn grocery store. 

I'd love to sometimes work an extra hour 4 days a week and then take a half day one day, or do one of the night splits I mentioned above, or just like...if work would accept that some days I will get a week's worth of work done in half a day and sometimes I will get half a day's work done in a week, and just like...let me vibe and decide when to do my work (other than court dates ofc) and when to run errands and when to chill, as long as the work is getting done...that'd be awesome.

I mean they kind of do, to an extent, but I know I'm not really SUPPOSED to, so I feel guilty even though my supervisor basically said it's fine to sometimes run errands/go to appointments during work hours because we all will end up working outside 9-5 at some points when prepping for hearings/trials so it's fine to just go to the store or the doctor during the day sometimes and not put in for it. but again...nervous and guilty!",1654041600

"ufc","t5_2qsev","HW - legit think Ngannou could if he stays in the UFC and continues to round out his skill set. Aspinall and Gane are threats I think, given time, but the biggest risk to Ngannou is ego / bad relationship with Dana. The wildcard here is Bones‚Ä¶.I don‚Äôt have faith that he will be as dangerous at HW, especially considering the lay-off

LHW - Bones will be the GOAT for some time. Can‚Äôt see anyone dethroning him in the next 5 years

MW - Silva hands down currently. Izzy has the potential, just a case of staying at the top. I‚Äôd like to see more activity from him too, needs 10 more title defences to equal silva‚Äôs record. Of course there is the PED debate but I‚Äôve left that aside for now.

WW - hard pressed not to say GSP. A few more title defences and usman may beat GSP‚Äôs record. The 2-belt champ has significance too, but maybe not in a weight-class based discussion 

LW - now this is probably the toughest one. really there are 2 contenders here. Khabib was SO dominant but his reign was short and his opponents prior to his last handful of fights were pretty meh. Oliviera holds records for most finishes and most submission wins in UFC history, finishing 30 of his 33 wins. That‚Äôs crazy! Depending on the outcome of the makochev fight, Charles may well be the GOAT. The best outcome, to know for sure, is a Charles victory and then a return from Khabib‚Ä¶.winner takes all!

FW - at this point I think we have to say Volk. It breaks my heart not to say my boy Max, but Volk has 2 victories over him (regardless of whether we think he really won the second) and is clearly head and shoulders above the rest of the pack. Prime Aldo is obviously a contender but got beat on his prime by Connor (who, to be fair, was using the mental weapon more effectively than we have ever seen), I don‚Äôt see this ever being the case with Volk, he is too mentally strong and his more well-rounded skill set gives him the edge (prime vs prime would be a great fight)

BW - Clearly Cruz. I know this will be controversial, but I was watching him from the start of his career and he has stayed at the top through the toughest injuries and bad luck imaginable, returning to take the belt from Pillashaw and still active (although clearly well past his prime). I believe he has only ever lost to champions 

FLW - DJ, nothing else to say here!",1654041601

To start with, what sort of conflict involves the US sending a massive amount of armor on an offensive operation that requires this sort of a river crossing? Massive tank rushes across the planes of Europe is really more of a Russian thing, while defending against the same is a pretty big element of everyone else around Russia.

In that respect I think the US would do better by simply not being in that sort of situation.

The author makes a point that the US is not very experienced in offensive combat, and that's entirely on point. The entire political and military organization of the NATO allies seems to be build around defensive combat. The only time I can reasonably see this sort of push is when chasing a retreating and broken opponent. Otherwise I would expect the US to use it's superior range and technology to make the enemy bleed over a longer range, and send in smaller teams to conduct ambushes. Basically exactly what Ukraine has been doing up to now at the unit leve. The biggest issue for Ukraine is that they don't have access to nearly the same degree of firepower that the US would have, so they are having to make do with only a small faction of the equipment and variety of systems that the US would be using in the same position.

This in turn raises another point. Offensive warfare on the modern battlefield is incredibly costly. Even with Russia's current slow push, if you believe the Ukrainians both sides are losing comparable numbers of troops, despite the fact that Ukraine is nowhere near as well equipped as a major western power would be. What would the casualty rate be if the Russians were facing a military that has already trained extensively using superior artillery, and has access to many thousands of suicide drones, backed by a bunch of flying, nearly invisible super-computers, all sharing data in real time. All the while individual special forces units would be getting behind enemy lines, and laying down accurate semi-automatic fire at night, at 800 meters.

In other words, I just don't see the US fighting a 20th century war given it's eagerness to adopt 21st century weapons and tactics.",1654041602

^(June 1, 2022)

COVID-19 Task Force Joint Operation members apprehended a 46-year-old local ferrying 300 cartons of cigarettes in his vehicle in Kampong Junjongan yesterday.




Upon noticing a suspicious vehicle travelling down an orchard road, the team stopped the driver for an inspection, resulting in the detection of two large packages concealed in the bonnet. In them were the cartons of contraband cigarettes. The patrolling personnel scoured the surrounding areas and found four boxes believed to contain more cigarettes.




The Limau Manis Police Station and the Royal Customs and Excise Department were contacted to assist with the investigation.




Personnel from the Company ‚ÄòC‚Äô Police Reserve Unit and Royal Brunei Armed Forces were involved in the joint operation, the Royal Brunei Police Force said.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

They could turn Monaco into an exhibition race, maybe the first in the calendar, to showcase all the new cars and drivers. Split the grid in 2, have two races with 10 cars, one from each team, top 5 move up to a final 10 car race.

Make it a show of how good and entertaining an F1 race can be

OR

Last race of that e season, more of a crowning ceremony of the new F1 champ than an actual race weekend. You can still invite all your superstar actors, musicians and athletes to come out and play with the drivers, have some more interactions between drivers of different teams during interviews.

You drop off supplies to the lookouts along the perimeter of your property during normal times? You lead a much different life than I do.  


But here's a scenario I mentioned - you get to your bugout location and find that the 1,000 gallon rainwater tank at your bugout location has a crack, and all of the water leaked out. You immediately repair it, but rainy season isn't for another 4 months. The nearest freshwater source is a freshwater lake 10 miles and 4,000 feet down the mountain.

No real recipe to reference; I kinda build it as I go, but this time around  I seasoned and browned some bone in, skin on chicken thighs in olive oil at the bottom of a large stock pot. Remove them.

Onion powder and garlic powder‚Ä¶cook it down a bit. Add some red wine and deglaze the bottom of the pot. Toss in some canned diced tomato, crushed tomato and whole san marzano canned tomato crushed with my hand before I toss them in . Chicken stock. Toss back in my browned thighs and pancetta. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Tossed in some old Parmesan rind, bay leaves and ground Parmesan. Black olives and a bit of brine. Simmered for a few hours on the stove. Removed the bones from the thighs and it very easily pulled apart. More Parmesan or salt to taste‚Ä¶.boiled pasta until it was just before al dente and threw some sauce in a pan with the pasta to finish. Splash of pasta water to thicken it up. 

Oh! Edit : And I forgot - chopped up some hot Italian sausage from the deli and tossed that in before it cooked down as well. Pinch of red pepper flakes too.

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","&gt;Don‚Äôt back out on that ‚ÄúONLY‚Äù bullshit.

I'm not backing out, I literally specifically worded ny original comment that way because my intent was not to state it as a blanket rule.

The rule exists but it is not absolute. The overall rule is that it still needs to have a link to fighting and combat. You can try and tell me what my own intention was but I can assure you that I know that better than you.

Zeraora has no reason to be fighting type. So it isn't. That's it. There is no reason for it to be fighting type... is that a difficult concept to grasp? As you say, there are exceptions to every rule. But Zeraora is evidence for the rule. Zeraora's origins, if you do any research on it, starts and ends with electricity. There is nothing that indicates fighting, but a lot to suggest electric. Galarian Zapdos apparently has links in its inspiration to an Irish god of War which, if true, would link it back to the fighting type as it is once again based on conflict and combat. Again, the point is you can't even make tenuous links with Zeraora.

The point is - Pokemon are deliberately designed. They don't just randomly assign types, and they don't just type them on a whim. The Pokemon are designed with specific types in mind based on standard set down by those types and what theming they set down. There is reason behind everything when it comes to Pokemon design. So the idea that they would just make it fighting type if they felt like it really undermines the effort that goes into designing it.

The bottom line is that if they wanted it to be fighting type, they would have given it qualities that actually relate to the fighting type. And as they didn't, they did not make ot fighting type. Fighting types have fighting type qualities. Zeraora does not. It isn't rocket science.",1654041607

Like okay, I'm not familiar with comic Marvel, so I can't comment on that, but your language gives me the impression that you're seriously underestimating him. MCU has nothing, Dormammu and Thanos included, that could even remotely scratch him. The six infinity stones combined, maybe. And even then, they wouldn't be able to actually kill him.

Jean Phoenix (movies, at least), is gonna be useless against him, because again, he's literally immortal. Only way to take him down is if he wants to lose. Even if she grabs the Hougyoku, it won't make a difference. It's bonded to Aizen. He still has it, even in EoS, because according to the databooks, it never rejected him. So, just taking it won't make a difference. See: Gin.

It's not wrong to respond to something that happens nearby if 

1) you are there well before the 911 response 

2) your help is called for given the severity of the situation and *explicitly wanted* by the patient(s) 

3) you stay in your scope of practice 

4) you hand off care to the 911 response as soon as it arrives and/or leave the patient alone when your help is no longer warranted or welcome.

It would've been perfectly acceptable (indeed, the right thing to do) to run over, make sure nobody's critical for some reason, call 911, and maybe do basic bleeding control + immobilization before handing the pt over to the actual ambulance. A compound humerus fracture is no joke! THAT SAID...

I have handled some situations out-and-about with my modest first aid kit that I usually keep in my backpack. 95% were like, someone's nicked their hand or skinned their knee but a few were more serious. And in those cases I *always* tell people that they should make their way to urgent care/ER or call 911. because at the end of the day when I'm off duty I'm just some guy with narcan and gauze in a pouch. I am *not* about to put my certification and the patient's health at risk by taking more responsibility than I should.

TOTALLY out of line to impose himself as the man-in-charge, rope *you* into it, and tell them *not to call 911*. Not only a recipe for a lawsuit (like others have said) but very poor form wrt patient autonomy and potentially harmful to patient outcome due to delaying their time to get definitive professional care.

"PokemonUnite","t5_2sks3d","To actually play the MOBA. Every Crustle I have ever seen afks top lane regardless if the team is winning or losing, regardless if Drednaw is spawning or Zapdos is fighting. And in the rare case that it ever joins a single fight, they are the first to die without even using its Unite move. But the game promotes that play because at the end of the game they get MVP because they scored a sneaky 100 points while the team lost a 4v5 at Zapdos. And this doesn't happen just on my team, if I see a Crustle on the enemy team, I'm assuming my team is going to win.

**EDIT: I WAS WRONG. They did ask for permission to post my clips plural, not just the one, and I gave them a all clear, so they weren‚Äôt in the wrong.

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

&gt;Ôº∏ What is the difference between „ÅÆ and „Åå ?

&gt;‚óØ I saw a book called Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÁü•„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑÊó•Êú¨Ë™û , why is „ÅÆ used there instead of „Åå ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

&gt;Ôº∏ What does this mean?

&gt;‚óØ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

&gt;Ôº∏ What's the difference between ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè?

&gt;‚óØ Jisho says ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does ÂÖ®„ÅèÂêåÊÑü„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between „ÅØ and „Åå ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

...except for state laws, which, like I said, are a terrible example to give because prior to the 14th states also had unconstitutional laws with respect to almost every other amendment. The fact is that until the 14th the constitution didn't apply to the states at all.

the first being there is no guranteed interest rate.  S&amp;P 500 going up 10% is the average growth over several decades of time.  It tends to increase in value by that much.  It's not guranteed to.  Some years it's up 20%, and some years it's -10% growth.

The ""compounding"" takes place as the stock increases in value over time and/or on the days in which the stock pays a dividend.  Some stocks and ETFs pay monthly (AGG comes to mind) and others pay quarterly, and others pay when they've hit some profit threshold known to them.",1654041614

[https://thefifthtrooper.com/getting-started-with-legion-may-2022-edition/](https://thefifthtrooper.com/getting-started-with-legion-may-2022-edition/)  
Their advice assumes you are building towards being able to run solid lists at 800 points, which requires more than 1 box per faction to pull off, so it's worth understanding but might not suit your immediate needs. 

If you're looking to maximize ""value"" (i.e. points worth of units put on the board vs. $ paid for models) there are a few special forces units that allow you to run 2 units from the box contents - Imperial Scouts and Imperial Special Forces and then Rebel Commandos and Clan Wren would each let you field two SF units from one box (in a sub-optimal way). Similarly, Imperial Shoretroopers and Rebel Veterans boxes both support 2 Corps units each from the models in the box and are solid units that are a good way to quickly fill up your force organization requirements.",1654041614

Accurate, and this is a big challenge for them moving forward if they want to develop any capable power projection capabilities.

&gt; The people are either broken or craving a fight.

That fight might be internal. China has had 13 Dynasties for a reason, it‚Äôs been basically impossible for Beijing to rule over the rest of the country for any long period of time. The people are going to be angry at the central government for these never ending lockdowns.

China also has a pretty massive [hidden debt problem](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3165411/chinas-hidden-debt-how-much-it-and-what-beijing-doing-curb) that‚Äôs a risk to economic and therefore military growth.

I‚Äôm ok with changing switches and keycaps and some light mods.

Would want south facing leds, but I‚Äôm okay with north as well, same with stabilizers, don‚Äôt necessarily have to be pcb mounted.

"DenverBroncos","t5_2s51j","I assume this is the logic is this:

- Browning came into the draft having played both ILB/OLB in college, that meant that he was a very developmental prospect at whichever position teams chose for him to specialize in.

- Browning actually played pretty average when he was forced into starting. He had a 54.9 PFF grade, allowed a 73% completion percentage and 95.6 passer rating when targeted and missed 8% of his tackles. So it‚Äôs not like he was an all-star run stopper or pass protector. 

- This year we‚Äôre probably transitioning to more aggressive 3-3-5/4-2-5 looks, which I think will mostly mean that we‚Äôll lean on a safety to play the nickel rather than a linebacker/CB if we want someone to cover a tight end. If that is the case then we probably want linebackers who are better at gap defense than Browning was, which Jewell/Griffith/Singleton are all very good run defenders. 

- I think they looked at the situation with the new scheme and his play and realized that if Browning was to stay at ILB he would mostly see snaps in lighter packages as a nickel linebacker, effectively making him ILB3/4 at most. 

- Then they looked at our OLB room and realized Reed and Chubb are both probably gone next year, while Gregory has had issues staying on the field. Bonitto helps but giving Browning time to develop now could allow him to be OLB3 that sees significant snaps next year. 

In the end I think they decided a OLB3 in 2023 with the ability to potentially trade Reed for picks and use this year for development was more valuable than a ILB3/4.",1654041616

"canada","t5_2qh68","The DTES began because of the BC Liberals (BC's conservative party) ended mental healthcare, closing asylums and mental health programs, and releasing thousands of mentally ill people in need of day-to-day care into the street to become homeless. Additionally, the asylums were also being used to get people off hard drugs. So the BC Libs both created the problem and destroyed the existing solution.

The DTES is just the best place to be homeless in Canada, so homeless people from across Canada migrate to the DTES. Temperate weather, shelter programs, soup kitchens, a methadone clinic, and Vancouver's care and support and opportunities. If you're going to be homeless in Canada, you want to do it in the DTES: that's why it's a thing.

DTES gets villified by people across Canada who have never been here (I live in Yaletown and walk through the DTES every day to work, FWIW). But in truth it was getting better - VPD, Onsite/Insite, BC Paramedics, NDP were all making progress to improve conditions there: along with dozens of charities active in the area.

What changed recently that made it worse, is two things out of Vancouverites control. Fentanyl is a fucking nightmare beyond imagining, it makes the days of 80's and 90's heroin addicts seem dreamy by comparison. Fentanyl amplified the problem.

COVID also amplified the problem - it created more addicts, more homeless, more mentally ill - and simultaneously it made it harder for anyone to provide help or services. A significant fraction of the people in the DTES are there because of COVID pushing them there. So the DTES isn't just a drug problem, or a homeless problem, it's a pandemic problem: again the DTES is where you go, when you have nowhere else to go.",1654041616

I had to buy my own reeds and honestly just learning to tighten that wire with a pair of pliers every once in a while probably saved me about 4 reeds a year. I don‚Äôt know if this is the best advice but it worked for me. Find a brand that works for you and keep in mind just because a reed is expensive does not mean it‚Äôs better quality.

It was here where her days were often spent nowadays - attempting to daydream her boredom away. Little by little, her thoughts found themselves thinking of home: of her father, of her mother, of Barrowton and The North she'd left behind. 

Gray cloths and tunics would drape her as she simply sat and stared. With her lonliness, thoughts would quickly begin to intrude her otherwise quiet mind. 

'*Has father already forgotten us so easily? Is he busy? Is it still dangerous? Why hasn't he sent for me?*' 

Often times, she'd been tempted to send a letter north on her own accord - but bitterness and pettiness kept her from giving in to her self created mind game. Instead she found herself sitting back and waiting aimlessly, praying to The Old Gods that one of these days, she'd find a letter calling her back home. 

As it was, only her brother seemed to be enjoying their time here - perhaps having been too young to grasp onto fleeting memories of their home and family.",1654041617

The World Government killed an an entire country on the off chance that a single one of them could read the Poneglyphs.  If there was an actual Gum Gum fruit out there, they would kill that person without hesitation.  They have never cared about ""if"" something that dangerous can turn into a threat, they cast a wide net and eliminate the chance.  Or at least try.

Regardless, complain is that factions should keep their identity, if not you make the game unlikable.",1654041618

Hi! Welcome to r/tumblertok - a subreddit dedicated to discussing the growing community of tumbler artists and creators on Tiktok! All opinions are welcome, as long as civil discussion is maintained. Please be sure you review the following rules and boundaries before you engage in discussion here.

Comments breaking the rules below will be deleted and result in a *one day, temporary ban.* If continuous rule-breaking is noted, it will result in a **permanent ban.**

**1. No hate speech**
&gt;No threatening speech or hate in regard to religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or race. Body shaming will also not be tolerated.


**2. No doxxing**
&gt;Do not post full names, address, phone numbers, emails, or any personal social media accounts of any creator or Redditor.


**3. No brigading**
&gt;This is your open place to talk about tumblertok creators and their content. Let's keep that conversation here. Encouraging others to attack or spam a creator is not permitted. Conversely, coming to this sub to brigade on behalf of a creator is also not permitted.


**4. Take it easy on the kids**
&gt;Refrain from initiating or contributing to discussions about minors or anyone‚Äôs parenting.


**5. Be nice to other Redditors**
&gt;This should speak for itself. Please keep the discussions here respectful.


**6. Keep the subreddit in the subreddit**
&gt;This is a place where we can discuss and have fun in general. Please refrain from mentioning the sub to the creators, whether that be directly, in their comments, or in their live chats.


**7. Speak for yourself, not the subreddit**
&gt;When speaking about your opinions here or elsewhere as they relate to a creator, please refrain from using 'we' statements in reference to this subreddit. Though we are a community, we are not a monolith, and generalized statements about this space as it pertains to thoughts, feelings, and opinions should be avoided.


**8. This is NOT a fan page**
&gt;Though many of us may be fans of various creators, this subreddit does not function as a fan space. Differing opinions and criticism are welcome here, as long as the discussion is respectful and the above rules are followed.

Have fun!

In fact, there used to be a bunch of eastern-european porn producers that would shoot a lot of random PG shots of arbitrary models that they'd market as good for spicing personals sites.  Though those were meant to be used by the sites themselves to make it seem like they had more users than they did ... the same concept applies - most people would rather use someone \*less\* recognizable for bogus profiles.

All that said, if this is really stuff she hasn't posted anywhere else herself (and don't forget about the potentially ephemeral nature of certain Instagram ""stories"") - there is also a chance this could cause blowback on your friend if you bring it up, since there's the possibility that those shots are ones of her that \*he\* shared covertly online (""Hey, look how hot my wife is""-type stuff), which, in turn, someone is now abusing.

And the ones who are women seem convinced that they are an exception to the rule in a conspiratorial way, rather than a sensible way, e.g. instead of acknowledging that most women are being brainwashed into following a lousy version of Feminism, they think that Feminism is nonsense and they're the only woman on Earth who's not out to steal a man's money and dump him onto a street corner or get him arrested for no reason).

Turns out this isn't necessarily true. In Malcolm Gladwell's book Talking to Strangers, he has a number of examples of ""coupling"", situations where a time, place, and means combine with will to make an event happen; removing any element would make the event stop happening (even though logically people could choose another time, place, or means). One example is asphyxiation by coal gas ovens in England, which accounted for half of all suicides until the 1970s when natural gas took over. You'd think all those people that would want to kill themselves would just find another way, but by and large they didn't - the suicide rates just went down. Same thing with the Golden Gate bridge when they added netting to prevent jumpers. People were pissed that the city spent all that money when ""people will just find another way"" - but the numbers didn't bear that out.",1654041621

"agile","t5_2qhp0","I think there it is important to point out the differences between what I call ""ideal Agile"".  That is, what all of the articles and books tell you.

And what I call ""pragmatic Agile"", which is the reality at a huge number of organizations with implementations of varying degrees of success, usually due to executive interference or failure to commit.

That being said, at team level, you can definitely bring a lot of value by implementing an Agile mindset and proper framework, but you have to do it with a full understanding of your organization.  This is why I call it pragmatic Agile, you need to be pragmatic about the shortcomings of your organization and steer your team towards improvements that can actually succeed.

It isn't an ideal situation but for the vast majority of professionals on this sub, it *is* the reality.

Edit: I am torn on whether or not this mindset would ultimately lead to a watering down of real agile transformation - in my case, I coach my organization constantly but they will not change.  I don't stop trying.",1654041621

Instead, my primary care was accepting, and helped me scheduel to a specialized who was within the same clinic, but are intentionally not on a public listing due to safety concerns in the region outside of the ""bubble"" area. They even explained to me if my State did flip it's laws, this clinic network would largely be unaffacted as I could just change clinic locations to the other side of the state border, and insurance would still cover the treatment under some clause where medical assistence is not availible in X location, so the next-closest Y location that accepts the insurance would cover.

( Safety concerns and even police escort/guard for medical staff, but also LGBT+ peoples )

However, it can easily lead to the addiction and even worse substances abuse, and that's going to be a huge problem. You don't want that problem. Plus, the alcohol negatively affects antidepressants and antipsychotics, so if you take any, this is any extra reason not to drink. I miss that carelessness, but I won't drink again.

"weed","t5_2qhpc","**Hi, u/crackojox. Unfortunately, Your submission has been removed as it appears to violate one of our rules:-**


&gt; **Rule 10:** No politics / Controversial OR Involves children or pets

***

&gt; Posts with political references or of a political nature are not allowed due to their tendency to start a political war in the comments. Even if this was not the intention of your post, often times commenters can't help themselves and they begin fighting aggressively with each other about politics, which is not the purpose of this subreddit. 

&gt; Controversial topics, such as vaccines, COVID, abortion, racism, etc. are prohibited for the same reason as political posts. They stir up differing opinions in the comments and then everyone starts going at each other until it's beyond out of hand and we can't get a hand on it.

&gt; Posts involving references to pets or children being around weed, ingesting weed, gaining access to or otherwise anyway related to weed are strictly prohibted as these topics make people angry and you will usually just recieve non-stop harassment from angry parents and pet owners. We also do not encourage using weed around your children or pets. **If your pet has ingested weed and you are worried or they are showing adverse symptoms contact a VET. Similarly, with children, take them to the hospital. [Click here for a further explanation of this in our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/weed/wiki/rules#wiki_10.1_-_no_posts_regarding_your_pets_or_children_taking_weed)** | [Mobile-friendly version](https://www.reddit.com/r/weed/comments/r1ds0p/comment/hm44j3x/)**

"interestingasfuck","t5_2qhsa","The 3.4oz rule isn't as arbitrary as we snarkily believe (or are told by other people trying to achieve Maximum Snark).

Yes, there is some compromise there with a pre-existing volume that was relatively widely-used in various travel-size goods at the time, but the underlying rationale for the rule is actually based on testing.

First, we need to understand that there are two broad categories of explosives. To over-simplify for brevity, they are: 

* **Low explosives**, which technically ""deflagrate""--burn extremely quickly--but produce no boom *unless they are contained in a way that allows for pressure to build up*. Gun powder and gasoline vapor are low explosives. It's why the *pipe* in a pipe bomb is necessary for the boom. These are generally easy to set off.

* **High explosives**, which actually ""detonate"" and produce highly damaging pressure waves--the kaboom--just sittin' around in open space. C4, RDX, and other ""plastic"" explosives are high explosives, as are certain chemical binary explosives. These tend to require a bit more work to get to pop off, since they are generally more stable; many plastic explosives require *a smaller explosive* to trigger them.

The specific danger the government is concerned about with your 3.4 oz bottles is a chemical binary explosive: mix this liquid with that liquid and you get a boom. Moreover, **they are primarily worried about explosions of a particular strength**. There is already a balancing act at work in the size chosen, a sort of explosive power threshold under which is ""acceptable"", given the inconvenience to passengers and airliners. 

It's the difference between having a water gun party and allowing only dollar store squirt guns vs. powerful Super Soakers vs. a literal protest-suppressing water cannon hooked up to the hydrant. Obviously, you can still hurt someone if you bludgeon them with a Super Soaker or shoot them straight in the eye up close, but the chances of that are considered acceptable when weighed against the increased fun of not just having rinky-dink dollar store squirt guns. But that doesn't mean you want a water cannon that tears flesh and bowls adults over from 15 yards.

So the government's worried about explosions that cause catastrophic, unavoidable loss of life and planes. Blowing a hole in the side of a plane is *to be avoided*, sure, but depending on boom and size, it isn't always true that everyone (or even anyone) is going to die. A boom that takes out a plane window doesn't have to kill anyone and the plane can still land. And we can know, through assembled knowledge and testing against airframes, what *sorts* of explosives and *in what quantities* we're likely to reach this unacceptable threshold.

So the government looked at what sorts of binary explosives could be realistically acquired, combined, and meaningfully detonate in a plane and shot under that. **This includes the concept of a ne'er-do-well bringing multiple bottles.** Yes, it's cool to rip on government work because haha dumbos, but they're *at least* the same dumbos as the general public who *also* realized, ""Oh, what if someone has *three* 3.4 oz bottles? Or four? What if they had an accomplice? What if they pour it all out in the pre-security disposal bin? They'd be able to combine over the limit! Waaagh!""

Every accomplice you add to this equation and every bottle you require to finagle adds complexity to the overall operation that improves its foil rate: that the plot will be discovered before boarding, that something will alarm, that a partial explosion happens, that your half-hour chemistry session with 50 fucking mini-toothpaste tubes in the bathroom goes awry, and so on. **It's a game of degrees weighed against convenience**, not ""literally no explosion can ever happen if we're using 3.4 oz bottles"".

**ALL. SECURITY. IS. THEATER.** It's not just a cLeVeR aNd WiTTy phrase when applied to TSA or airports by dorks who get commissions on selling you a starter pistol. ""Security"" alone does fucking nothing: it's all just a delaying tactic for the real defense, which is ""people showing up to do something about it"". No wall or lock or camera or metal detector keeps a thief out if there is never going to be a human response to what's going on. You are only ever increasing the likelihood that a human notices and can get to a place in time to stop the bad thing underway, ideally before it's finished.",1654041625

"boringdystopia","t5_39u79","I know it sounds boomer of me, but one ingredient is to vote for progressives. The progressives are genuinely trying to turn it around but they are in the minority.

Yeah, I know it's not the only answer, but it's a key ingredient. I know younger folk don't believe they can make any difference at all by voting, and that's why voter turnout is super low for the under 30 year old crowd. I also appreciate that younger folks are working hard trying to just make rent, and taking time off to vote means a slimmer paycheck. Vote absentee, vote by mail, whatever you can do. Just vote. Every goddamn time, every election. The reason they are trying so hard to make it hard to vote is so you won't bother, and they stay in power. That's also why they spread the idea that the elections are rigged anyway, the parties are both the same, and telling you it won't make a difference. They're trying to sow doubt in the system so you'll give up. Don't.

The reasons the monied people win so they can horde more money is because they also own the elections and politicians. The truth is, there are a lot more of us than there are of them. A lotta lot more. Change wont' happen overnight. It took us 40 years since Reagan to get us here, of them selling us out to win the next round of elections, and not looking past the next election cycle. It will likely take another 40 years to swing back.

I worked hard, and I got lucky. I'm doing okay so far. It can all change in an instant.  I'm working to hold the door open for others who aren't so lucky. I help out, I tip heavily, I try and patronize small businesses that treat employees well, and I vote to raise my own taxes for programs that make this a better place.  


As the line in the movie Idiocracy said, shit sucks. No burrito coverings. But don't give up. They aren't giving up trying to enslave you. Don't give up fighting back.",1654041626

These things are 0.1% utter fucking traumatizing terror... and 99.9% boredom. They both wear on people in different ways. The boredom component is often underrepresented. Tasks like digging holes for excrement (so nothing can track you) will take up a significant portion of your time.

Without much for artificial light, people will be sleeping 10 hours per day on average. It won't be restful sleep, but a significant proportion of one's time will be spent cold, in a sleeping bag, hoping not to get found by something that will eat you. 

Also, zombie apocalypse movies tend to focus on the political fascism and cultural decay, which would certainly occur, while underestimating the proliferation of new religious movements. You'll have the wacko cults, but you'll also have a bunch of more moderate movements, and they'll all be fighting for mind share.

"suggestmeabook","t5_31t41","[**We, the Drowned**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7988467-we-the-drowned)

^(By: Carsten Jensen, Charlotte Barslund, Liz Jensen, Emma Ryder | 678 pages | Published: 2006 | Popular Shelves: historical-fiction, fiction, owned, historical, denmark)

&gt;It is an epic drama of adventure, courage, ruthlessness and passion by one of Scandinavia‚Äôs most acclaimed storytellers.
&gt;
&gt;In 1848 a motley crew of Danish sailors sets sail from the small island town of Marstal to fight the Germans. Not all of them return ‚Äì and those who do will never be the same. Among them is the daredevil Laurids Madsen, who promptly escapes again into the anonymity of the high seas.
&gt;
&gt;As soon as he is old enough, his son Albert sets off in search of his missing father on a voyage that will take him to the furthest reaches of the globe and into the clutches of the most nefarious company. Bearing a mysterious shrunken head, and plagued by premonitions of bloodshed, he returns to a town increasingly run by women ‚Äì among them a widow intent on liberating all men from the tyranny of the sea.
&gt;
&gt;From the barren rocks of Newfoundland to the lush plantations of Samoa, from the roughest bars in Tasmania, to the frozen coasts of northern Russia, We, The Drowned spans four generations, two world wars and a hundred years. Carsten Jensen conjures a wise, humorous, thrilling story of fathers and sons, of the women they love and leave behind, and of the sea‚Äôs murderous promise. This is a novel destined to take its place among the greatest seafaring literature.

However, transaction costs, realtor fees, taxes, etc. are all calculated as a function of sale/purchase prices, so the higher the property prices are, the more you'll pay for all that fun stuff, and you're basically taking your equity and moving it from one property to another. So through that lens, lower prices = better.

RLLR, well, sucks. I don't believe at all that Harvey suddenly forgot how to drive fast, and Lungaard hasn't come close to the pace he showed in his one-off last year. 

And while it was impressive given there was no practice, Santino's Texas finish was in large part due to just avoiding mistake and the attrition of that race.

Not possession, but the bill would have ensured that legal possession died out with the current owner with no cance for sale or transfer.

A ban on existing possession of a firearm type that is unquestionably in ""common use"" is very likely to run into a Supreme Court challenge.  Feinstein's 2021 version recognized that.

Runs it with his wife. One day he's up there, working on something in the back of the store while his wife was out at the counter. Two guys come in and pretend to browse for a few minutes, then pull out a pistol and a knife and order her into the back of the shop. 

Of course that's where her husband is at, and he shoots and kills one of the two guys. The other fled, wounded if I remember right. The husband was carrying a lawfully owned, legal firearm, had the training to use it safely, and used it to save his wife's life. Please tell me how his ""glorified safety blanket"" as you so eloquently put it, should have never been available to him in the first place? How is it reasonable or fair for you to dictate how someone else, that has nothing in common with you, how they should ensure their safety? 

The cops told him later on that these two guys had been hitting local businesses for months, and were responsible for 2 killings. So the guy literally likely saved himself and his wife from at most a brutal double homicide, and at best an aggravated robbery.

**AITA for trying to teach my son to pee in the bath?**

Ok so I know the title is weird but hear me out. We were camping this weekend and my son (5) wanted to go swim in the lake. It was awesome and fun but every hour he had to go pee. I told him to just pee in the lake but he said that was gross. It‚Äôs a giant lake and not many people were there but every hour we walked back to the bathroom then relaxed then back to the lake. We got home and i gave him a bath and thought. ‚ÄúThis would be a great time to teach him how to pee in the water!‚Äù  My wife was appalled. That was the grossest idea I have had she thought. ‚ÄúMy previous breast milk post I don‚Äôt think so‚Äù anyway I‚Äôm bringing it to you wonderful people am I the asshole?

I fear COVID distracted admins (and engaged faculty) from talking about the looming demographic cliff too. The population of high school seniors peaked in 2008 and will drop off precipitously in 2025...and now COVID means there will be a second cliff c. 2037 unless birth rates rebound.  Of course those births are increasingly among populations that have lower historic college attendance rates and are concentrated in specific regions (west coast, SE, Texas, etc.) rather than  in the places where the supply of colleges is far too high (Midwest, New England).

"CompetitiveWoW","t5_35p2p","If you're pushing for KSM you don't need to worry about your comp that much. A few things will make it significantly easier though:

* Someone that can bloodlust - this should be fairly obvious but sometimes it gets overlooked. Shamans (Resto Shams are sick pocket healers if you are regularly pugging DPS), Hunters (ideally not MM), and Mages.
* Someone that can brez - engineering can cover this but having access to Soulstone or Rebirth is going to prevent a ton of wipes on bosses where you can't get close to the body (e.g. 1st boss Necrotic Wake).
* A reasonable amount of kicks __*and stuns*__ (you have no idea how hard it is pushing keys with 3 RDPS and a RDruid, god forbid one of them is a boomie).

Stuff that's nice to have:

* Soothes and purges/dispells. There's a lot of really critical enrages out there that will absolutely truck the shit out of you in ways that Prot Warrior mitigation cannot deal with (2nd boss of Wake has an insane cast speed buff). 
* Aggro misdirects - luckily your rogue friend can cover this
* A good mix of AOE and single target damage - it's normal to have 1-2 flex DPS (Sub Rogue, good WW players, Warlocks, Fire Mages), 1 giga-AOE spec (Destro, Survival, WW, Frost Mage), and potentially 1 single target specialist. In my experience it's A LOT harder to find DPS that are good at smashing bosses. 
* Someone that can play each of the covenants - Prot Warrior still goes Kyrian I think? Assassination rogues are playing Venth and Necro so that's good coverage if your friend plays it. Warlocks and Fire Mages are the most common Night Fae DPS out there.

TL;DR: can't go wrong with running Warlock, Survival Hunter, and Rogue. Healer choice doesn't matter too much but I'd avoid Holy Paladins and Disc Priests.",1654041630

America leveraged its enormous influence to cancel the deal because China was interested in getting close to the Israeli military industrial complex to build up the PLA.

Israel submitted to the request under forced pressure, to not piss off the United States, since this was an actual potential threat to its global hegemony.

China stole the Lavi fighter jet design to build the J-10, much to Israeli furor anyways

Those who teach and study constitutional law have government handlers who monitor their classes, in case they turn subversive. And most importantly, in a still-debated incident, the government arrested and detained 16 Catholic community organisers without trial in 1987, because they were ""Marxists"" (liberation theology), and never was able to prove the charge. The methods they employ here would have long prompted revolt in any Western country.

&gt; A survivor of the mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, this week said another student was shot after following police orders to call for help.

&gt; &amp;quot;The cops barged into that classroom. The guy shot at the cops. And the cops started shooting.""

&gt; The Uvalde police chief said during a press conference Thursday that officers responded to the shooting &amp;quot;Within minutes,&amp;quot; but did not address allegations from parents that police officers did not initially enter the school to confront the shooter.

Do you have access to healthcare? Anti anxiety meds? benzos? Ambien? Benedryl? 

See if you can get seen by a tinnitus specialist. I saw one and she absolutely saved my life. Have you had your hearing tested? It can be really bad even if you don‚Äôt think it is. I thought mine was perfect and it‚Äôs actually terrible lol

You can get devices that project custom noise into your ear. I use hearing aids for that, and it works wonders. They also have sleep headbands and sleep earbuds on Amazon, but I can‚Äôt speak for them, but I did buy one last night so I‚Äôll update soon. No matter what, just don‚Äôt try to mask it completely. It can make it worse. 

Deep breaths. The noise cannot hurt you. The anxiety of it is trigger your fight or flight mode, and perceiving the noise as a threat, which spurs anxiety and it‚Äôs just a terrible loop. Reminding myself that my terrible tinnitus cannot hurt me makes me feel better, somewhat. 

I understand what you‚Äôre going through and where you‚Äôve been. You‚Äôve been doing this for nine months already, you are strong as hell. You‚Äôre surviving and that‚Äôs not a small thing at all.

"NoahGetTheBoat","t5_117wt6","Damn, that is pretty cool about the UK.  I wish that the US could say similar.  But looking at either raw numbers or just murders doesn't tell the whole story.  Trans people are like, what, half a percent of the population?  maybe 1%?  In a truly equal civilization there will always be an enormously larger number of cis people killed than trans, regardless of violence.  The overwhelming majority of those people are killed by a) people they know and b) cis people.  If we're going to actually look at how dangerous it would be to allow trans people to use the women's restroom you would have look at the relative rates of violence committed by trans people vs. cis people.  I don't know those off the top of my head, so I'm not going to pretend like I do, but afaik trans people are far more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators of it.  I'm not on a moral crusade or anything, if you have any data on just how common trans people assaulting women in restrooms I would love to see it because what I have seen would be categorized as anecdotal at best.

I'll also be honest with you, I don't know enough about the prison system to make a comment on that one.  I'm not sure about the state of UK prisons (my general pessimism leads me to thinking of them as probably better in quality of life for prisoners than American ones) but I do know that sexual assault in prison is a big problem here in the states and that transgender inmates (both mtf and ftm) are more likely than cisgender inmates to be the victim of it.

For the sports issue, I do have much more sympathy for actual athletes who speak out about issues that they have had.  Even with how little I care about sports, I do have respect for people who dedicate their lives to something and want an equal chance at succeeding at their competition.  However I very rarely hear their voices in the mix and it's largely coming from areas that I explicitly hear denigrating women's sports at almost any chance they get (sorry for all the US examples but the controversy over the pay gap between the US men's and women's soccer teams despite the women's team having a far better playing record comes to mind).  So what conclusions is someone supposed to draw from that?  To use the Olympics as an example again, transgender athletes have been allowed to compete against others with their gender identity for almost 20 years and yet it wasn't until last year that a transgender athlete won a gold medal.  I don't know how many trans athletes have competed total but it seems to me that if there was this overwhelming advantage there would probably be more than just a single gold medalist, right? 

I'll also say that I would agree that there might need to be a higher bar when it comes to combat sports than other kinds just due to safety concerns for the participants.  Clearly the safety of the athletes should come first and foremost for any sport, 'equality' be damned, but it just doesn't seem to bear out that the amount of 'concern' for the issue of transgender people competing in sports is warranted in relation to their actual impact on the sports they are competing in.",1654041635

Personally, I ran Swords Dance/Iron Head/Sucker Punch/Brick Break. Brick Break was great as a weapon against Steel-types and to break opposing Aurora Veils, Sucker Punch is almost a must-have along with Swords Dance, and I wanted to give Mawile a STAB move and ultimately felt that Iron Head offered more in terms of my broader team constellation, given that the rest of my team has no shortage of Fairy-type moves to spam.",1654041635

"Lethbridge","t5_2rp1o","daycares: i dont have any children of my own but my friends who do have a few places theyve liked. im not sure what wait lists look like tho. 

schools: lots of good schools, you attend schools depending on where you live. however, the ucp is introducing a new curriculum from k-5 i think? maybe k-9? do some research on that before for sure bc its been a hot topic here. 

doctors - almost half of lethbridge doesnt have a doctor. its a crisis, so dont expect to find one. ER wait times are generally high too as a result. 

dentists - we have no shortage of dentists and lots of good options 

winters - winters are a mix of fairly mild, -10¬∞ weather with no snow followed by weeks of snow every day and -35¬∞ temps. we dont shut down unless we get like a foot of snow lol but the city isnt very good with snow removal minus a few key roads. we do get chinook winds tho which warm the temps up and get the snow melted. 

gun club - not a member so cant exactly speak on this, but my friends who enjoy guns usually go to the taber range (about a half hour drive)

restaurants - i have a massive list of recommendations lol if theres any specific cuisine youre into, let me know and i can be more specific. my favorites tho are probably makisu (all you can eat sushi), mango tree (indian food), firestone (good desserts and best blended alcoholic drinks in town, food is pretty good too , more of an upscale joint), &amp; cafe verde (mexican food). all of these are locally owned and operated. we also have the usual moxies, browns, the keg, etc. 

downtown - lots of cute shops selling clothes, candy, trinkets/gifts, locally made products, natural products, and lots of restaurants/cafes. its fairly walkable, but just know we do have a large homeless population and have been hit hard by the opioid epidemic. most of the individuals are harmless and will just ask for some change. there has been a few assaults however, you may want to google lethbridge crime and read reports. 

demographic - we are often considered a retirement town and there is a lot of seniors, and with that, a lot of old folks homes. however, theres also lots of younger families so its a good mix.

since you mentioned wanting to leave your current town given its gotten busier with more crime, just know leth may not be your best option. as i mentioned, we do have a large homeless population. theres also a fair amount of car break ins, bike theft, bags of bottles being taken from yards (honestly anything in a yard can be taken lol). we do also get quite a bit of traffic, especially on the roads to the west side of town across the river and on mayor magrath drive (main road that goes thru the south end) and some others, especially at morning and afternoon rush hour. however, since you didnt state where you live i cant really say if relatively itll be better or worse. all in all, lethbridge isnt too bad, ive been here almost 20 years and have no intention to leave anytime soon.",1654041636

"AirBnB","t5_2tfa4","I'm on multiple host boards on FB, and the lack of bookings has dominated the conversation lately. 

We would have seen a decline, I think, due to gas prices and the fact that people have more options this summer (kid summer camps are open, international borders are open, etc). But couple that with a terrible update on the booking site, and every host I know is vacant right now. 

I have 4 properties and have been open since 2019, and I've never had ZERO bookings before. But I'm sure the really remote homes that came straight out of Architectural Digest are probably seeing a big uptick in bookings. I can't find my OWN properties, even when I search by my exact suburb or zip code. Instead the site suggests exotic, remote places that are hours away! This is also our typical slow season, so this has been a triple whammy for hosts in my area.

Airbnb is driving people to VRBO. Every host I know who wasn't already on VRBO, is now setting up a listing there, bc their property is empty. 

Hopefully ABB's accountants will tell them that bookings have plummeted since the exact day they released their poorly-designed update. It wouldn't hurt to tweet Chesky and @AirbnbHelp and let them know your experience since the update as well.",1654041636

Maybe.

The thing that comes up with this kind of thing is that when you're up for a clearance you may be asked to relinquish any citizenship to any state other than the United States. Often the verbiage that's used is you must be *willing* to renounce your citizenship, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you will *have* to. It depends a lot on what countries you hold allegiance to and the particular mood you're adjudicators happen to be in. Your recruiter may have a blanket policy where they don't sign dual citizens, but it doesn't necessarily mean that's an across the board rule. I advise you to let other people officially tell you ""no"" (and understand the nuance of any ""yes"" you get and be willing to follow through on any conditions), and just figure out what you want and try to go for it.",1654041638

"moderatepolitics","t5_2s6h3","&gt;Setting aside veterans with PTSD and other combat-related mental health issues, what's so awful about human existence that wasn't in 1975?

Well, Vietnam and returning vets with PTSD and lack of state funded mental health institutions would already impact society greatly, as this affects all the families of those returning veterans, and creates an influx of mentally ill people who eventually become homeless.

So lets look at the state of affairs:

\-Street gangs were getting big up around the 1970s, and really blew up around the late 80s and early 90s. So gang related crime and gang related violence started to become normalized and even romanticized during this time.

\-State funded mental institutions and psychiatric hospitals were shut down completely by 1980. So whereas in previous times if you had some serious issues that required serious, serious care, you had that option. Now, you were screwed.

\-The sexual revolution encouraged people to focus more on promiscuity, and less on starting a family. That can't be healthy.

\-The stigma around divorce had evaporated, so now people were getting divorces for things like merely finding someone better, ""the spark was gone,"" etc. This has a seriously detrimental effect on the children.

\-Women in the workforce was already a common thing by the 1970s, so now that businesses had the other 50% of the population applying for jobs, it made things more competitive for applicants, and gradually these companies could allow wages and salaries to stagnate, to the point that a single job could no longer provide for a family. Eventually it became the norm that both spouses had to work in order to raise a family, even if they were middle class. Women staying at home was pretty much discouraged, and seen as a bad thing. Kids are being raised on TV and day care as a result. Again, not too healthy.

\-Pop culture and the entertainment industry is promoting and romanticizing hedonism, violence, mental abuse. Rape culture and sexual harassment is normalized in teen comedies. Verbal and mental abuse is normalized in everything from sitcoms to mainstream films. Any woman who's not rail thin with no ass is referred to as ""fat."" Fat people are dehumanized. See sitcoms like Growing Pains and Friends. ""Fat Bastard"" in Austin Powers. Etc. Anyone who is studious and excels in school is a loser or ""nerd."" See Revenge of the Nerds, any 80s teen comedy, any 80s sitcom, etc. The kids who act like assholes and get into trouble are romanticized and idealized. See the Simpsons, Michael Seaver from Growing Pains, and again, any teen comedy. Kids learn how to act and behave based on these problematic portrayals, and they carry on this twisted belief system into adulthood.

\-The internet becomes mainstream in the early 2000s. Bootlegging music illegally is normalized and even promoted in mainstream publications. Everyone now has access to Caligula-like levels of porn thanks to the internet and no safeguards in place. This creates unhealthy attitudes of romantic relationships and sex. Social media becomes a thing, and the ability to humiliate people instantly, to the world, becomes an acceptable thing. 

\-Reality TV also becomes a thing around this time, slightly earlier, and encourages the public to both be voyeurs, and also, despicable human beings. Verbal, mental, and physical abuse becomes even more normalized when its performed by REAL people on TV.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8"," ""what if?"" has been a lifelong question and friend at this point. Even as a child I was very interested in UFOs, cryptids, and that sort of thing. The trick is to ask the question, investigate, but also be skeptical, don't switch your brain off and just follow something blindly, or because you really want it to be true. Always ask: ""okay, lets say [theory] is true, what would the perpetrators stand to gain from it and would it be worth the effort, or could it be attained without going to all that trouble?"" Sadly, those who, as you say, fell in, tend to stop there. It's a not a question they can answer with enough detail for it to make sense as a conspiracy. Like flat earth (the conspiracy side, I'm no scientist), there is never a satisfactory answer as to why anyone would waste all those resources to maintain the idea of a globe, if it wasn't true. It gains no one anything, not even power (at least not power they couldn't get in an easier less resource intensive way.) And the answer to that is often ""but NASA get government money"" to which I point out that the world has other space agencies not funded by the US government and the money argument falls on its face again. ""Why?"" Is the most powerful question in this case. 
The way my brain works, I'll always be asking what if questions. I'll always be searching for the truth of this or that, it's who I am, and I don't really want to change that. But I'm careful to always look before I leap, never leaving behind my skepticism. And I thoroughly enjoy investigating and hypothesising. The truth is out there.",1654041643

"AskWomenOver30","t5_2ya5k","I've been feeling the same way. Thanks for sharing your experience. I have been unable to do much in the past few days and last weekend I found myself paralyzed with fear and dread for the future. I'm still riding the waves of that and can barely work or do anything outside of work. I see a therapist every other week and she is great at listening to me but some days I just can't. My boyfriend is also struggling with me, he is super busy with work and is trying to spend time with me and doing sweet things like cook me meals and buy me coffee, but I can't reciprocate right now and barely even feel like speaking to anyone. 

I'm also looking for new jobs. I've been feeling left out of my team after a company reorg and my new manager couldn't care less about me. I miss the camaraderie of my pre-pandemic team and how we were friends with each other. I barely have any energy to actually apply for jobs though and wake up every morning with a pit at the bottom of my stomach.

In terms of dealing with this, I am looking for a new hobby. I love going to new restaurants and that's usually my go-to but I also put on a ton of weight because of that (adding to my depression). I used to enjoy going to board game meetups. I wish I had the mental energy and motivation to plan a vacation, that could help. I want to feel even a little bit optimistic about the future.

Learn to educate yourself.  While it is important to be good at a particular language or skill set, having the ability to learn new things and apply your existing knowledge base to accelerate your learnings is key for the upcoming decades in the field.

Spend your time learning a skill set (JavaScript in any flavor will get you far, IMHO) and learn how to acquire skills and retain in a proficient manner.  The senior levels and leaders wherever you are will ALWAYS appreciate your ability and a willingness to learn something new.  If they do not, then you are either their equal or you need to find a different employer.

Also, be able to at least speak intelligently as a developer about infrastructure, particularly if everything you do is in the cloud.  If you want to be an AWS expert, great.  If not, that is fine too.  However, know enough to know why RedShift for a read-only 200/day query is not the right solution (and how to figure out what offering would take care of it).",1654041645

"EtsySellers","t5_2wthr","That's what USPS puts when the addressee isn't known at that address.  Sometimes a postal carrier might see a name that's not familiar, etc.  But I think most of the time when I've gotten returned mail with that message, the customer says something like ""I've lived here for 7 years!""  

If you were in the US, I'd say wait for the buyer to respond and see if it's the correct address.  If it is, then you can bring it back to the PO and tell them the address was verified and ask them to resend it.  They will do it usually with the same tracking number, and at no additional cost.

I contacted Ableton once about it and they weren't able to offer much, which I get because it's such a unique and difficult issue to document.

After reading through this I tried unplugging a couple controllers when it happened to me just now, but the pitch didn't revert. I have several fairly used controllers and I don't know if any of them are actually the cause. I have had a couple of issues with both of my AKAI controllers, but nothing that's ever indicated pitch/automation.

When I'm experiencing it, it's like it occurs persistently no matter what project, instrument or sound I'm working with. Other times it doesn't happen at all. It's such a problem when it's happening but it's easy to forget about.

I'm a chronic hotkey saver, which makes it more difficult to just reload a previous save before the detuning occurs.

I love it's colors, 4k resolution, high refresh rate, price, and the KVM feature is a big deal for me as well. I do play at 4k, I figure at 32 inches I'm getting a little benefit from the higher resolution, but it does hurt my fps some. Luckily my pc is pretty new and powerful so I can handle it with fps around 100 or so. Could be higher at a lower resolution, but dammit I paid for 4k. For some reason it will sometimes turn black on me for a few seconds, which can be pretty annoying when pushing points. I've checked my cables and everything, maybe it's faulty or something. It doesn't happen enough for me to stop using it, but it could be something to consider if you add Gigabyte to your considerations. If I had to pick a monitor to use right now, regardless of price, I would either be using this one, the LG 27GP950-B, or maybe that new Alienware QD-OLED monitor, though I'm not a fan of ultrawides.",1654041645

"columbiamo","t5_2rr9b","Nothing wrong with most of that. And many of those would be included in common sense gun safety progress. 

But also, gun regulation and restrictions on certain guns whether it's waiting periods, licensing etc also works. So why not do other things that work just because they're directly to do with guns??

I agree with Sanders on this one - there is no reason to have an ar-15. I'm sure those hundreds of people who die from one would agree. You can't hunt with it, you're not going to challenge the government with it. All you can do is play rambo on the range once a month. So why cling to it like a failed heiress clutching her pearls??

There was already an assault rifle ""ban"" (which was really just strict permitting), it reduced assault rifle deaths, then it went away and they increased substantially. That's not how anyone feels about it, that's fact. And if people ""feel"" badly about those guns - well no shit, they're only made to kill people. If you're not going to kill people why the fuck do you need one? At a minimum why not make it somewhat restricted to own one??

"40kLore","t5_2zdqr","&gt;I said the only reason for Tau to exist in a out of universe reason is solely their unique faction playstyle.

They have a unique aesthetic and fluff niche that appeals to a significant demographic of customers. That is the reason they, and every other playable faction, exists out-of-universe.

&gt;They, in universe, have nothing going for them as a faction.

What does this even mean? They have unique narrative niches with their rapid technological advancement, their youth and inexperience, their naive/optimistic outlook, their status as a conquering force opposed to the Imperium rather than an exterminating force, etc.

If you mean power level wise, they do fine on the battlefield in basically all the books they're in.

&gt;Speaking of which, Tau don't have anything close to a Primarch

That's fine, neither do the Tyranids or Dark Eldar or Craftworld Eldar. Factions are supposed to feel different. 

&gt;And I had to double check, they don't even have titan equivalents.

Ignoring the Ta'unar, which is around the size of a Warhound and is a Tau titan in all but name, there is a good deal of fluff written about Tau vs titans. Their primary approach is to mass deploy big guns on cheap frames, as seen with the AX-01 Tigershark and the Stormsurge, or to repurpose starships like the Manta.

&gt;Imagine if the Mechanicus alone went after Tau with a few titan and skitarri legions.

This was going to be the subject of *Imperial Armour 13: Fires of Cyraxus*. It was canceled (Along with the Imperial Armour series in general) unfortunately due to a wide variety of reasons.

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","I was called to the Argentin-Rosario mission. I had already memorized my rainbows in English and bought a set for Spanish, I was already bilingual. My call was over 90 days after I received it. 

About a month out, I hit a dip and went for a pep talk with my bishop. I think my opening comment was ""Give me pep talk 842 on why I should serve a mission.""

Bish gobsmacked me by saying ""You shouldn't. You've got a little brother to worry about. Your mother will be committed before you get back. You've got to think about him.""

I called my secret fiancee, phone a family from the ward that had moved to Orem. We all tastes and prayed, got the same answer, I wasn't going.

Met the following Sunday and gave the bishop my/our answer. His wife had gotten to him and he had done a 180. I just looked him in the eye and said ""I and the ****s, you remember them, right? We all fasted and prayed and got confirmation that I shouldn't go. I believe that under the principal of personal revelation,  that light is what I will be judged by. I am not going, I will position myself to take care of my brother.""

He went spineless and never told the SP, so on the night I would have been set apart, I got a phone call asking why I wasn't there.

I got married at 19 (divorced 10 years later) and made a home for my brother. The entire weight of the church sat on my shoulders for the rest of my active life.my wife was never committed, although the sheriff did have to remove my brother from my house when he ran away.",1654041647

You should instead be able to form federations by default just like vassals, and the Diplomacy tree should instead have buffs for both Vassals *and* Federations, and make it easier to get both etc. 

A tradition that gave some bonuses towards vassal negotiations, and some flat taxes for all vassals like 5% of resource income or something would be very nice",1654041647

"DeathBattleMatchups","t5_2sj683","Annie vs Linne (Skullgirls vs Under Night in Birth). Centuries old women trapped in the bodies of young girls due to a curse that they fight with all their might to destroy the source of. Both wield broadswords in battle, both are cynical and jaded from their experiences, both have a small cutesy mascot companion that stays by their side at all times, and both play a mentor-like role to an idiot hero (Beowulf and Hyde).

Lillia vs Pom (League of Legends vs Them's Fightin' Herds). Timid equine fighters with Scottish accents that were forced to leave behind the only home they ever knew in order to save it from the darkness and monsters that they must brave in their journey. Both are also known for being unlucky, with Lillia being stated to be very clumsy and Pom wanting nothing to do with fighting only to get continuously dragged into it by her dogs.

Black Dahlia vs Bryan Fury (Skullgirls vs Tekken) Both formerly ordinary people that were critically injured and rebuilt in a lab, both turned on the ones that saved their lives, both are complete and total monsters with no regard for human life. Both have connections to crime organizations, with Dahlia being a mafia enforcer and Fury having past connections to drug lords. Both have slaughtered an entire family, Dahlia massacring both the Contiellos and the Fishbone Gang and Fury slaughtering the Manji clan. Both seek only to fulfill their own sadistic pleasure through any means necessary. And their personalities clash nicely, with Dahlia managing to keep herself under control, being calm, composed and calculating, while Fury carries himself like a smug madman, laughing and screaming most of the time.",1654041647

Barovianis extremely poor in resources.  You aren't going to find magical shops, armories, or even potion vendors RAW...players can walk out of death house with about 1000gp to their group and have absolutely nothing to spend it on other than bildraths massively marked up general goods

The module is also intentionally resource-lite. The more resources the players have, the more comfortable they will be.  That's not what you want. You want them to be nervous 

That said, giving them uncommon magical items isn't going to break the game as long as you don't go around adding a bunch of stuff that wasn't there.  The gold you give them isn't going to matter as there isn't really anything worthwhile for them to spend it on

"SarahJMaas","t5_3i46o","These are good points. üôÇ 

I want to point out - I think this is often less about the under-represented minority within the fantasy universe, but positive representation of the real human reading the books. We all want a main character we can relate to, who represents us in some way shape or form, who is portrayed in a positive light as opposed to like, mass-murderer Hybern who is apparently bisexual (only learned that in this post)

I don‚Äôt remember where I heard it, but a little kid shocked and happy because Miles Morales/Spiderman has the same skin tone as him? That‚Äôs exactly the kind of thing I hope everyone finds ‚Äî a character that they love who represents them in a way that‚Äôs meaningful to the reader. 

My friend was a wreck (in a good way‚Ä¶?) after she saw Wonder Woman, and her happiness boiled down to ‚ÄúSomeone who is like me can also be a (main character) superhero‚Äù. 

I totally see your points though, and it‚Äôs a really good distinction to be cognizant about. Fantasy is a great medium where we can do anything we want, but I still think diversity of main character representation in relatable ways is always doable and an important benchmark to have.",1654041648

I had this happen to me when I was part of a startup where the money guy was very shady, mostly through incompetence. Instead of doing payroll correctly he would pay us out of his personal account and reimburse himself. The first paycheck each person received as we brought others on would trigger the Patriot Act and freeze the payment for two weeks. A couple unlucky ones even had their accounts frozen.

Do not let her do this under any circumstances. It will cause so many more problems. The hospital is liable for this person's paycheck and they should be issuing it. If they aren't moving fast enough then that person needs to file a labor board complaint. I'm guessing they've done that already and the boss is trying to make it go away quietly.",1654041648

"neopets","t5_2r64t","&gt;have a problem with the genre. I think TNT just did it badly, like your hero is so underpowered compared to the enemies that you literally can't beat the boss you're supposed to beat without skipping ahead to the next zone for better gear and potions.

If you're still struggling with NQ, I think you have the order completely wrong:

1. Level by Neopia Central until Lv 6.
2. Dank Cave to Xantan at Level 13.
3. Jungle Ruins until til Level 27.
4. Temple of Roo until Level 33 to 34
5. Techo Caves/Mountain Fortress to Level 40 to 42.
6. Kal Planning until Level 45 to 46.
7. Two Rings Palace until Level 50.

And those levels are fairly conservative for Normal/Evil. Most bosses can be beat when you're the same level as them and pretty easily beat a level higher than them. While Insane mode may have been a bit overtuned due to the double XP gimmick, the balance on Normal and Evil are pretty generic for turn based RPGs and can easily be beaten in a couple of hours. Maybe not as easy as NQ2's balance, which most people way overlevel even when they aren't trying to overlevel. Then again NQ is a much shorter and faster game than NQ2 even with the stiffer balance.

The issue you may be facing is that NQ is a completely open world RPG. Where the only 2 bosses you have to actually beat to win the game is Faleinn, and the final boss(es) in Two Rings Palace. So you're moving around out of what is considered the best sequence. The only time I have gone out of order to get different armor piece was in Insane, when I just didn't want to risk having to start over.",1654041648

[[Parallel Lives]] will **always** double the tokens created by [[Words of Wilding]].

* In P1's Upkeep step, they activate the Words 3x times.
* In P1's Draw step, P1 replaces their Draw per turn, they create ~~one~~ **two** Bear tokens.
* P2's Mine trigger resolves, P1 replaces their Draw, they create ~~one~~ **two** Bear tokens.

[[Library of Leng]] only works ... some of the time against [[Words of Waste]].

* P1 controls Words and a Mine. P2 controls a Library of Leng
* In P1's Upkeep step, they activate the Words 3x times.
* In P1's Draw step, P1 replaces their Draw per turn, P2 Discards. 

* * Since this is a Rule, and not ""an effect"", Library cannot apply.

* P1's Mine trigger resolves, P1 replaces their Draw, P2 Discards.

* * Since this is an Effect from the resolution of a Spell/Ability, Library can apply and P2 may put the Card on the top of their Library.

&gt; 614.16. Some replacement effects apply ‚Äúif an effect would **create one or more tokens**‚Äù or ‚Äúif an effect would **put one or more counters on a permanent**.‚Äù These replacement effects apply if the effect of a resolving spell or ability creates a token or puts a counter on a permanent, and they also apply if another replacement or prevention effect does so, even if the original event being modified wasn‚Äôt itself an effect.",1654041649

We didn't have this kind of direct 1:1 interaction with expert lawyers FOR FREE back when we had other big trials, Zimmerman, Scott Peterson, Jodi Arias, and of course the infamous OJ himself.

I think this commentary has helped a lot of people figure out this maze, and it's amazing how a bunch of law Youtubers, who come from different specialties AND are most likely of different political persuasians all came to the same conclusion.  So no matter who you rode with to get to the end, we all got here to the end together.

It was a shared universal experience - a positive one for a lot of us as well, and after the past few years of this silly pandemic, I would argue we deserved to be able to come and enjoy this AND see one of our favorite childhood stars be exonerated at the same time.",1654041649

The reward for patenting a natural product into an FDA approved product is immense.

Among other things he believed the age of consent was a social construct driven by culture and that kids should be fair game after puberty. He also believed he personally had been raped by doctors from a young age because they had touched his genitals during medical examinations.

Or just use dialog. Writing doesn't have to be realistic. The goal is to convey a scene. Dialog itself isn't written how people speak. Sometimes, where one might use a gesture or look that is common in real life but is awkward to describe or understand by a reader, you will have to use dialog to convey the same effect.

I don't know what the next big advancement in tech will be, but I can guarantee something will counter it eventually. It's been that way since we picked up rocks.",1654041651

"projectzomboid","t5_2sdk8","And for a month alive, not everyone does that after 2 weeks from buying the game, and in MP too!May I give you an advice on traits? If you don't want them, information below is a spoiler.&gt;!Your trait choice is pretty good, but I'd remove ""Brave"" and get ""Cowardly"" instead, because the more you play a character the better it gets on fighting off panic capping at 5 months. You can get Claustrophobic as well because you can sleep indoors with beta blockers and as you might know fighting indoors is a bad idea already. And I think in MP it's based on how much time passed from beginning, so you still get the bonus if you die. But that maybe only working for a host. I also suggest taking ""Tourist"" and ""Prone to illness"" as first one cancels the other, and Tourist is very powerful it's 2 free points I think and ability to walk in the rain. ""Smoker"" is easily dealt with(you already know there's a lot of cigarettes) and you can cancel depression with cigarettes ""Pacifist"" lowers your exp gain on weapons, it has nothing to do with you actually using them. You will not feel it if it you take ""fast learner"", and yes I do really recommend taking it too. I would replace ""hard of hearing"" with ""keen hearing"" because you will have ""eyes on back"" and will see zombies approaching you from behind. This is considered the best trait by many. ""Short sighted"" only affects your foraging radius so think about taking it too. ""Sunday driver"" has +15% percent on fuel usage and you might get stuck off-road, especially when towing cars. Don't be hasty to take speed demon though, as you will attract every zombie in town when going backwards.!&lt;

"GenZedong","t5_1vnbn1","Day in US where people pretend to care about fallen troops. A lot of imperialist propaganda about ‚Äúfreedoms.‚Äù Free day off for most people to enjoy barbecues and feign empty nationalism.

I feel bad for the lost souls destined to die in imperialist wars. Even then, their sorrow is magnified when nobody seems to care about the damage they have inflicted overseas. 

Americans should reflect on Memorial Day and ask if the price for any of these deaths were worth it, instead of drowning in copium that it was for ‚Äúfreedom.‚Äù 

I‚Äôll never be an edge lord and celebrate young kids dying however, like some people here. I get it, we hate US empire, but I have to say that as an American we are subjected to the most elite propaganda force in history. From birth we are barraged with nationalist sentiments and similar bs. Most soldiers are working class people and joined up for a better life, they are also completely unaware in a foreign policy sense.

‚ÄúHolier than thou‚Äù attitude is cringe. So much is determined by our environments that it becomes hard to condemn individuals, especially people who aren‚Äôt in any policy making position. Most of the people that died are just grunts.",1654041651

We live in the same building and whenever we cross each other we just exchange smiles and do the usual hi whatsup how r u and I walk away. Today was Holi (a festival where ppl dance and apply powdered color on each other) so I decided not to celebrate it in my building cause I knew she would be down so I went to my friend‚Äôs building and ten minutes later I saw her there. I was like oh fuck this is going to be a bad idea. Later we again exchanged a hi and then I went away. Later when the festival started she kept applying permanent color (last three days on the skin) on me and my friends. I told her don‚Äôt apply on my friends they will get pissed. She kept applying on me and I tackled her and applied color on her too. It felt good. Then she was like let‚Äôs go dance so we were dancing to Senorita from znmd and then we had a moment and she was like we are going to kiss and I was like yes and we kissed. It just felt amazing. Then we kissed again. After that I was going to my friends and she was like listen and then I turned back and kissed again. Then we kissed again&amp;#128557;&amp;#128557;. After all this my friends were dancing and I was sitting in the pool and she came and sat on top of me and we were having a very good conversation about our relationship and how we both didn‚Äôt date anybody after breaking up. We spoke about our problems, joked about them and then..yes u guessed it right. After this the cycle repeated and we had a beer and she handed me her phone and was like unblock yourself. She followed me and added me to her close friends. Later she was leaving we kissed once more and in my head I was like fuck do I love her, we should date. But then I told myself no, whatever this was I don‚Äôt know but no you are not breaking your heart again. I came back home and we both haven‚Äôt had any interaction apart from the fact she liked my story. I AM NOT IN LOVE. i am telling this to myself again and again because no, just no. I am happy being alone with myself. Or maybe I like her but I don‚Äôt want to go back to all that Edit: thanks for the response some of y‚Äôall and thanks for helping me.

"GrandPieceOnline","t5_3c5a5r","First off if watching YouTube guides is your thing there's plenty on YouTube from leveling or getting to certain islands or trainers.

There's codes to this game, which you should look into if any race reroll codes are active, and hope you reroll into Fishman because you can solo anything with Fishman karate fighting style without a fruit. Also any other codes are good to claim too.

Speaking of fruits don't just eat any fruit because there's only one way to remove devil fruit and that's with an item that costs robux or you can trade for it but you have nothing to trade.

Look into what fruit you want and either join the gpo official trade hub discord or hang around trade lobbies to know values of things.

If you don't get Fishman your choices without a fruit are 
black leg (foot fighting style)[better option imo]
or 1 sword style (sword fighting style)

After that just do the quests on each island and go to the trainer when you have enough peli$ and style mastery. With that you'll be leveling to eventually do dungeons/cupid/krakens/ship farming",1654041653

Based on the title of your post, it appears you're looking for a forgotten series. When you find the series you are looking for, it would be appreciated if you added the title of the series as a Flair by leaving a comment that says `solved = series name here`. That way others will know that the answer has been found. This also allows others that have become interested based off your description to try the series for themselves. Do please avoid adding additional formatting to your solved comment though as I read based off the source of your comment rather than like a human being. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

But seeing all the hype around him, Ducati giving him a contract for another 2 years already. He's very fast and potentially good, but not consistent enough and falls under pressure.  I just don't see him winning the title, and even if he does, it won't be in such dominant manner as expected, given the lack of true competition. (By that, i mean bikes, not riders). Sure, he's better than the likes of Miller, Zarco etc. But they are not so much rated as Pecco. I believe FQ would win the title by huge margin if he had a superior bike like Pecco does. Again, Pecco is good rider, but people rate him up there with Fabio. I just think his bike and team status makes him look better than he actually is. Therefore, overrated.

Honorable mention to Jorge Martin. And im not saying it only because he's having a nightmare of the season. I didn't see anything spectacular from this guy last season either, apart from being very quick in qualis. Good, but probably never champion material, as many thought he is.",1654041654

Ainu? Ryukyu's people? Mongol influences in Korea?

Smells like a little RACISM there...nononooooo, the Jomon people never existed, those pots and such all came from IKEA.

And yeah, there's a lot of cultural mixing going on these days. But as long as you're still bent out of shape about that, well, I've heard these complaints before. This ""problem"" really belongs on the same shelf as ""mixing the races"", which was constantly used in the USA as a racist legal trope _until interracial marriage was finally legalized_...in 1965. Took people a while to suss out the bullshit. But before then, being in an interracial marriage would find you with an annulled marriage and probably prison time to boot.

So...we're supposed to apply this same ""anti-miscegenation"" principle to other cultures now? Yeah, good luck with that. Cultures ALWAYS tend to run together into new forms all the damn time. Sometimes this isn't good (eg: Putin vs Ukraine) but often it can be really interesting and an inarguable forward step. But if there are LAWS that must be followed, uh...well, this is vaporwave.

2. Hitler directly murdered at least 6 millions in 4 years and indirectly is responsible (but you could argue that Stalin also did start WWII) for way more than 6 times that number. 

3. Communists also hate him except for stalinists but as far as I know they stand in the corner of every room waiting for someone to mention that Stalin was an asshole.

4. Hitler invented industrialized and systematic genocide. I mean genocide exist but that thing was Tayloric.

5. ""Communism kills"" yeah and capitalism doesn't. I'm assuming you're opposing the two here. If you meant that both of them kill then what I write after that won't be interesting. I'm not taking a stand here to defend communism but capitalism invented industrialized slavery and people as a capital, yes slavery always existed but it was never an industry like it was during the triangular trade. People are dying of hunger and overwork and has been since the Irish or even with the native Americans because of capitalism.

That it was included that their defenses are near residential buildings is odd to mention. What point does that serve? It could serve the purpose of being Russian propaganda that the reason the Russians destroy so much of their residential buildings is because of proximity to Ukrainian military targets. This is absurd, because of course Ukrainian military is near residential buildings‚Äî they are defending the whole of their nation and people from the barbaric Russian invasion.",1654041656

"anime","t5_2qh22","First and foremost: any nominal sports anime fan. The first three episodes are identifiable and watchable, and then it goes into unmarked territory for sports anime in a very engaging way.

Critics: This might be selfish. I really want to hear a wide spectrum of opinions on the show, and currently I mostly see either Birdie Wing simps like me or people who dropped it like you.

After that... I'm not even sure. I'm not even sure how to categorize it. Its campy but not comedy, which is what we usually associate with camp. There is a mafia plotline that goes much darker than expected, but also doesn't seem to represent a tone shift.

If you're ordering online it might be better to just order a palette since a lot of sites will have free shipping past a certain dollar amount but it probably wouldn't be worth paying shipping for a single shadow (unless you add other stuff). I'd recommend looking for anything that is described as rose, dusty rose, baby pink, lilac or mauve (usually those ""purples"" look pink once on). Often the descriptions will even say whether they are cool-tone or blue-pink or whatever. Berries are also a good option depending on how deep your skin tone is. I'm not sure what your budget is, but if you do decide you'd rather spend money on a palette I think Athr Rose Quartz or Huda Rose Quartz are both nice options that are truly cool-toned palettes.",1654041658

&gt;    https://reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/wiki/format

This is what your title should look like:
&gt;    *AGE [R4R] - Description*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your title:

**1. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. Replace the first ""R"" with your gender and the second ""R"" with the gender you're looking for:** 
&gt;    Use only **M**, **F**, **T** or **A** for tagging gender. Use any combination for couples: **MF**, **FF**, etc.

**4. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject:**
&gt;    *[META] - Description*

&gt; VANCOUVER, British Columbia - Canada&amp;#039;s government announced Tuesday it will allow the province of British Colombia to try a three-year experiment in decriminalizing possession of small amounts of drugs, hoping it will help stem a record number of overdose deaths by easing a fear of arrest by those who need help.

&gt; &amp;quot;Stigma and fear of criminalization cause some people to hide their drug use, use alone, or use in other ways that increase the risk of harm. This is why the Government of Canada treats substance use as a health issue, not a criminal one,&amp;quot; tweeted Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada&amp;#039;s chief public health officer.

&gt; British Columbia is the first Canadian province to apply for an exemption from Canada&amp;#039;s drug laws.

"motogp","t5_2r7pg","I think that ""the talk"" already happened and he's taking one for the team staying out the next year to recover. But Honda wouldn't need to buy his exit because he's not fit for racing, they would just keep paying his salary or cash out their insurance policy regarding excess of losses, claiming they assumed his salary while he was recovering but now the cost is unjustified so the contract insurer needs to cover the rest of the salary contract. It's like what happened to that ship in Egypt, the company paid things until a given point, after that they brought the excess of losses clause for the insurance to cover the rest. Since naval shipments contracts are all based on excess loss, all the people with cargo on the ship are forced to pay their share on the loss, so they paid the rest that the reinsurance wouldn't cover (example: you had 500k worth of cargo there but 250k got safe, the total cargo was worth 1 billion, so you had 0.05% participation, if the total cost of lost cargo and repairs and fines were 3.5 billion, you would receive 250k for the cargo lost (assuming no insurance) and pay 0.007% of those billions, so you osy 25 million because 250k of your cargo was safe, assuming no insurance of excess loss on your part, naval contracts are no joke, that's why import/export companies are all shady warehouses with tax address in other countries, when this happens they just disappear). In his context, I can see marquez walking out with a big payout, Honda with a new rider and also a payout from marquez not being able to finish the contract (two sided contracts), at the end of the day only the insurance is taking a financial hit, nobody thought marquez could have a serious injury and not retire, it was a common sense that his risk was dying at some circuit or staying out for some races, nobody thought it would came to this, because his salary plus treatment must be enough to pay Rins, Mir and Acosta combined, on good salaries, not cheap paper.",1654041659

"AskUK","t5_2t4s3","My two bits: avoid Study Across the Pond. They f\*cked up my daughter's UCAS application. Some examples.   
1) The UCAS application has the ability to accept 2 references. We are used to the American process where you submit your application, and the references can get delivered separately to the school. However, with UCAS, the references have to be uploaded to UCAS \*before\* the application can be submitted. Across the Pond didn't tell us this until maybe 23 hours before the application deadline, so she had to submit her UCAS application without references. Her references had been completed months(!) previously and could have been uploaded timely if Across the Pond had been ""advising"".  
2) The UCAS application asks for ""predicted grades"". This includes predicted AP scores. So for AP tests you've signed up for, but haven't taken yet, you submit your guess as to what AP test scores you'll get, and the schools will use those numbers to evaluate the application. Again, Across the Pond failed in ""advising"", my daughter didn't include predicted AP scores, and she got denied from her first choice of school because there were no predicted grades.  
3) On the UCAS application, you can nominate a third party to talk to universities on your behalf, and Across the Pond talked us into putting them down as the nominee instead of me. BIG mistake! Some of the schools my daughter applied to were not ones that Across the Pond works with (you choose 5 and not all have to be Across the Pond schools), so Across the Pond wouldn't communicate with these universities, and because I was not the nominee, the schools wouldn't talk to me. That was a pain in the ass!  
4) Across the Pond was not very responsive. We'd send them an email, might get a response in several days.  


So there you have it. I'm thankful she got into her second choice, which was an application that Across the Pond had nothing to do with.",1654041659

A poll does not represent the will of the people. Besides, my point was not that in the first place, my point is that most Canadians have actually no idea what this bill actually encompasses and me shedding some light on the true scope of this bill is my right as a concerned citizen. You have you're right to disagree :) If you truly think this law will have any effect on gun violence then clearly you aren't informed, gun violence hasn't dropped even 1% since the last wave of gun bans from Trudeau because again, its an objective fact that legal gun owners will be the only ones hurt by this, meanwhile the ACTUAL problem is left unadressed and illegal guns keep popping up all over the country.

**Don't get scammed!**

* If someone doesn't or won't comment on your post **DO NOT WORK WITH THEM** and [report them to moderators.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FComblocMarket) This fights scammers by requiring them to comment on your post before contacting you.

An asexual is a person who experiences little to no sexual attraction.

An asexual person could have sex because their partner enjoys it, because they enjoy it, because they want to get pregnant, or any other of a thousand reasons they could have it. They could enjoy having it and enjoy doing it in certain ways that might be unconventional, and therefore have a kink.

"cpp_questions","t5_2tdbd","&gt; Is there a way to make it work inside of VS Code

Yes. Use some build system. VSCode has an extension for that provides good support for CMake. You describe project at an abstract level in CMake, which then does all the build stuff for you. VCode can control CMake via the extension with no additional setup required (apart from the CMake script).

&gt;  compilation and linking necessary each time I want to test the program?

It is, but thats what the build system does automate for you.

&gt; Also, what would be the disadvantage of just declaring and defining the whole class inside of one header file and then just including it?

Nothing stops you from defining your entire project in single file. Similarly, nothing stops you from defining everything inside of a header (as long as you do it correctly).

The advantage of splitting declarations and definitions into header and source files is separate compilation.

Instead of recompiling everything all the time, you only recompile translation units (the combination of a single cpp file and all its includes) that have actually changed. This once again is where a build system comes in handy, since that will automatically do these checks for you.

Separate compilation further allows you to compile multiple TUs in parallel.

Both combined give significant improvements to compilation time in larger projects.

"AskLibertarians","t5_2yqo4","It took the bloodiest war in the history of the country to finally put an end to the stain of slavery that should never have existed in the first place.

Lincoln should not be painted as an abolitionist and the North's cause was not to *end* slavery (Lincoln himself let Northern states continue the practice even after decreeing freedom for slaves in Southern states). The federation of states was forever changed in ways that remains antithetical to liberty, favoring authoritarian federal interventions in clear violation of the constitutional restraints placed upon it to ward off tyranny.

Southern states were fighting for their ability to keep enslaving other humans -- there was nothing noble about their motivations either. It was not a ""state's rights"" issue. The writings of politicians of the time make it pretty clear they were horrible people with no respect for liberty.

In the end, it was a total shitshow of political actors with the silver-lining being the abolition of slavery, which should have been accomplished much sooner and without the violence, destruction and death of a civil war.

What should a libertarian learn from this? States (nation states, governments of any flavor) are dangerous and destructive. Minarchists may see them as an evil that is necessary. Anarchists seek ways to show that they aren't even necessary.",1654041663

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","Here is one of my favorite stories about Ajahn Sumedho helping build a road with Ajahn Chah, from Ajahn Amaro's wonderful book ""Small Boat, Great Mountain""...

Ajahn Chah was once given a piece of forested land on a hill-top in his home province. The very generous supporter who had donated it said to him, ‚ÄúIf you can find a way to make a roadup to the top of the mountain, I will build a monastery therefor you.‚Äù Always up for a challenge of this nature, Ajahn Chah spent a week or two on the mountain and found a pathway up.He then moved the entire monastic community out there to make the road.

Ajahn Sumedho was a recently arrived monk. He had been there a year or two by this time and was a very serious meditator. He hadn‚Äôt been keen to leave the settled life at the main monastery, Wat Nong Pah Pong, but he joined in and there he was‚Äîbreaking rocks in the sun, pushing barrows of rubble around, and working hard with the rest of the community. After two or three days, he was getting hot, sweaty, and cranky. At the end of the day, after a 12-hour shift, everyone would sit down to meditate and would be reeling. Ajahn Sumedho thought, ‚ÄúThis is useless. I‚Äôm wasting my time. My meditation has fallen apart completely. This is not helping the holy life at all.""

He carefully explained his concerns to Ajahn Chah: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm finding that all the work we are doing is harmful to my meditation. I really think it would be much better for me if I didn‚Äôt take part in it. I need to do more sitting and walking meditation, more formal practice. That would be very helpful for me and it‚Äôs what I think would be for the best.‚Äù Ajahn Chah said, ‚ÄúOkay, Sumedho. Yes, you can do that. But I‚Äôd better inform the Sangha so that everyone knows what‚Äôs happening.‚Äù He could be really wicked in this way.

At the Sangha meeting he said, ‚ÄúI want to make an announcement to everybody. Now, I know that we have all come up hereto make this road. And I know that we are all working hard at breaking rocks and carrying gravel. I know this is important work for us to do, but the work of meditation is also very important. Tan Sumedho has asked me if he can practice meditation while we build the road, and I have told him that this is absolutely all right. I do not want any of you to think any critical thoughts of him. It is absolutely all right with me. He can stay alone and meditate, and we will continue building the road.‚Äù

Ajahn Chah was out there from dawn until dusk. When he wasn‚Äôt working on the road, he was receiving guests and teaching Dharma. So he was really cranking it out. In the meantime, Ajahn Sumedho stayed alone and meditated. He felt pretty bad on the first day and even worse on the second. By the third day,he couldn‚Äôt stand it any longer. He felt tortured and finally left his solitude. He rejoined the monks, broke rocks, carried gravel,and really gave himself to the work.

Ajahn Chah looked at the enthusiastic young monk with a foot-wide grin and asked, ‚ÄúYou enjoying the work, Sumedho?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Luang Por.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it strange that your mind is happier now in the heat and the dust than it was when you were meditating alone?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Luang Por.‚Äù

The lesson? Ajahn Sumedho had created a false division about what meditation is and isn‚Äôt, when in fact, there is no division at all. When we give our hearts to whatever we do, to whatever we experience, or to what is happening around us, without personal agendas or preferences taking over, the space of rigpa, the space of awareness, is exactly the same.",1654041663

It's significantly better than the previous Fantastic Beasts movies. It feels like there's more of a cohesive narrative aesthetic/vibe, and i think the switch to Mads Mikkelsen as Grindelwald was a good choice. 

I'm definitely biased, because he's been my fancast for Gellert Grindelwald since forever, but Mads really does know how to bring a gravitas and a charisma to the character that was severely lacking with the Johnny Depp casting. He feels more like the kind of guy you can imagine charming people into following him‚Äî someone who you can imagine Dumbledore falling in love with and following down the wrong path‚Äî whereas Depp's portrayal felt cartoonish and forced(?). 

That being said, there's also a lot to recover from, given how rough the previous movies were, ESPECIALLY how bad the 2nd movie was. There are still some unexplained issues, and parts of it are still pretty clunky, but it was interesting to see how resurrection and redemption seemed to be the main throughline for the movie, and how those themes were explored by expanding upon plot points from the previous movies as well as Dumbledore's backstory from the books.

I was also extremely impressed at how straightforward Dumbledore's feelings of romantic love for Grindelwald were expressed. The bar was on the ground, but I was still expecting the movie to trip over it. So when it was made very clear and direct statements in the movie‚Äî statements like ""I followed you because I loved you"" that were unable to be ignored, I was maybe a bit more impressed than the movie deserved. Add to that the taciturn, agonizing yearning that Mads Mikkelsen is famous for portraying, and the movie felt genuinely sincere at times.

If they keep Stephen Kloves in the writer's seat for the remaining movies, they might be able to salvage the series into something pretty good (by the end of things).",1654041664

I can't imagine two people with two small kids attempting to have a good time.

"raidsecrets","t5_3560n","It's not so simple. The reason being that Bungie is strategically ambiguous with the TOS. There are two important parts of the TOS this macro farm falls under:

&gt; ""Automating trivial tasks (especially for accessibility reasons) is allowed. Players will only punished for automation when it circumvents challenges all players face during gameplay (auto-aim, trigger-bot, etc)"" [(link)](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/255149330?sort=0&amp;page=0&amp;path=1)

The macro *seems* to pass this test, like you said. However, elsewhere in bannable offenses it lists...

&gt; ""Using an external program or device to automate gameplay or circumvent idle detection."" [(link)](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360049517431)

This being an AFK macro farm, it definitely fails this part. Whether Bungie chooses to enforce this against users is up to them. They have banned users in the past for idle detection and macros, but they sometimes let these exploits slide. It still means we should be careful about sharing and promoting this for unsuspecting users.",1654041664

Another important thing to note is that the algorithm for showing available pick-up/drop-off spots is based on absolute distance (it's a circle on the map) but it doesn't take into account actual pedestrian walkability. So it might suggest a pick-up spot for you that's across a major boulevard or something (without a crosswalk or a light nearby). If that happens, just pick a different option for the pick-up spot, or change the address slightly in the opposite direction from that spot, and you'll get other options.",1654041664

It might help you to cope, and you can decide to write it with a pseudonym if you want to stay quiet. But in all honesty, this is the kind of story I think people in religious communities need to hear.

So often, queer people are made to hide who we are, and forced into making choices we don't want either because of family or religion itself. Hell you can even title it, ""Forgive me Father, for I Have Sinned."" You can talk about the dissonance you feel in your life and potentially help others either understand yourself and people like you, or just help more younger gay people trapped in these environments.

So let's say I have him move out so our son can continue in the STEM program he was admitted to and it's been 11.5 months. Then a huge snowstorm hits and he can't get his vehicle out to the road so he sleeps in the guest room or living room. That would mean there would have to be 12 months of separation again starting from the day he can leave.

There's an issue with 'children need to be in education' which I understand, so you can't just suspend them all the time or expel them.

But if I'm being frank, this child I'm referring (Among others that come to mind)  have been doing this for so long now, they aren't learning anything because it kicks off literally 15 minutes into the day.  
And as it takes 2 staff members to escort and deal with a child, it severely reduces the help of the other 29/ 58 children in the class / 2 classes that the TA's have come from.",1654041665

I agree people obviously have more options now with the internet and that's awesome for learning new stuff and getting more skills.

I wasn't alive for it all, but where was that crap in the 60s 70s 80s early 90s etc? Imo people are more ""informed"" now (probably over-informed / info-overload), but more easily radicalized by the internet, have poorer judgment, worse morals, and worse actual insight and introspection. If you look at the 90's, it was a very introspective decade.

"LateStageCapitalism","t5_39qgx","Your numbers aren't that far off.  Diverting more money into savings in the 401k lowered our tax burden (and increased our savings rate through matching), as did having children.  And Washington is a no income tax state, so our total income tax burden was closer to 20% by the end. We didn't spend 2500 on rent, but we spent about that much per month on a mortgage.  50% of gross, counting mortgage paydown, mostly in maxed 401ks and Roths, then in a taxable brokerage account.

But yes, 45k/yr is probably about right for our family spending.  We bought used cars.  We ate out maybe once or twice a month.  We didn't own a sailboat, or have a drug habit, or get divorced, or commit any of the other easy financial mistakes that most people seem to fall into.  Kids went to a great public school, we took modest vacations to national parks, and we never hired a nanny.  Where else would our money go?  Being a family man is predictable, it's not like I'm out dropping $100 on cocktails at fancy clubs every night.  I went to work, came home and helped my kids with their hw,  mowed my lawn, drank cheap American lager, and had sex with my awesome wife.  What else is there to buy?

At some point in the career of a well compensated professional, you have to decide if trading away more years of your life for more dollars is going to make you happier, or more miserable.  I was 41 when I reached the crossroads at which the thing I most wanted to buy with my money was more time with my wife and kids, not a fancier car or more exotic vacations.  So we both retired, and never looked back.
 
Places like r/FIRE and r/financialindependence are chock of full of people like us.  It's not that hard, with an above average income and some self control, to retire before 50.",1654041669

We have seen Tony and Redban call out people for doing this numerous times in the past.  

Ellis also says things during the interview which feel like it's his actual material.  And it can be genuinely funny sometimes when he's just talking as himself and not doing a bit.  

My theory is he's actually a great stand-up but he's nervous on stage, so Tony is trying to make him bomb regularly using the lamest jokes, to help him deal with his crippling stage fright.

then you're not who i was responding to ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

&gt;But I do think she was naturally less attractive than the average Armenian woman

I think you picked literally the worst pic of her but overall she looks like an average middle aged woman with ethnic features. [here](https://armenianweekly.com/2021/12/09/the-female-faces-of-the-artsakh-war/) are some normal armenian women for comparison

&gt;You sound really insecure

you're the one who's obsessed with picking apart a random middle aged woman's appearance but ok lmfao!!!

&gt; the fact that I thought she wasn‚Äôt that pretty before had nothing to do with her ethnic features

where did i say she was pretty?

&gt;The main things making her less attractive back then than she is now were the mullet and really prominent nasolabial folds where she got filler. Neither of those are ethnic features.

^(By: Philip K. Dick | 259 pages | Published: 1962 | Popular Shelves: science-fiction, fiction, sci-fi, classics, dystopia)

&gt;It's America in 1962. Slavery is legal once again. The few Jews who still survive hide under assumed names. In San Francisco, the I Ching is as common as the Yellow Pages. All because some twenty years earlier the United States lost a war ‚Äî and is now occupied by Nazi Germany and Japan.
&gt;
&gt;This harrowing, Hugo Award-winning novel is the work that established Philip K. Dick as an innovator in science fiction while breaking the barrier between science fiction and the serious novel of ideas. In it Dick offers a haunting vision of history as a nightmare from which it may just be possible to wake.

\- Why did your company pay you significantly less? Just because you didn't get paid ""correctly"" doesn't mean it was a malicious action by the company.   

\- Mistakes happen. We're all human. Maybe it was simply a matter of someone entering the wrong data or the required approvals weren't provided in time. Mistakes can be fixed. 

\- The payroll department just can't magically pull money out of it's ass and pay you immediately. That's not how it works. 

\- Demanding immediately payment will just piss people off. Make them less likely to go out of their way to help you. Be nice, be patient and be considerate. 

Now if your company told you you would be paid one amount and then deliberately and fraudulently paid you another amount, then that's a totally different story. And by all means avail yourself of any legal recourse you have access to.",1654041670

*****
&gt; Taipei, Taiwan - Taiwan&amp;#039;s parliament erupted in violence on Monday as lawmakers clashed over a bill that critics say could be used to overturn former President Chen Shui-bian&amp;#039;s conviction on corruption charges.

&gt; KMT legislators say that President Tsai Ing-wen has taken advantage of Taiwan&amp;#039;s recent COVID-19 outbreak to pass the legislation decriminalising the use of &amp;quot;Secret state expenses&amp;quot; by the executive.

&gt; Monday&amp;#039;s scuffle was not the first time tensions over the bill boiled over.

I never had friends over from school besides my best friends from elementary school. I did end up inviting the swim team over for our pre-meet dinner and I heard there were people talking about all the clutter, who didn't even come, I was so embarrassed.

I try to keep all my own things in my own room and only do my own laundry, I can't let her put her clothes in my load or let her take it out of the dryer or things will go missing. She will just take underwear, shirts, or pants that are clearly not hers. Socks I can forgive, but why is she taking the tiny lacy thongs that are obviously not hers??

I'm scared I will become her. I only collect two things, plants and Breyer horses, which I started when I was little. I like them very much and I don't know where I'll put them when I move out, but I don't want to be a weirdo with over a hundred horse figurines all over.",1654041671

1. Tear is a well-rounded character, there are many sides to her despite her first impression, and she has a convincing reason to be invested in the central plot of the game. Good chemistry with the rest of her party, and her co-lead once he develops a bit. I felt like she overshadowed Shionne in every aspect, given the initial similarities their first impressions gave me.
2. Estelle is my second pick, great chemistry with Yuri and her party. While Tear largely overshadowed Shionne, Estelle does it to Colette. I also felt like Estelle had a compelling arc compared to Colette, who at many times it felt like Colette was just along for the ride or merely a plot device.
3. Lastly, Sophie, I greatly appreciated her in Graces. It felt like she was the most practical of the group in her dealings with Richard, and was a good ground for the whole power of friendship trope as she was ready to merc Richard, which honestly was the more practical solution as most bad guys aren't gonna turn a new leaf because you're friends now.

I feel the need to add this, the reason I didn't stick Velvet on here is that it feels like the writers were afraid to let her own up to the role of the tragic villain.

I had it removed in late December and by may I still hadn‚Äôt had a period. I went to the gyno and she confirmed that 1% of IUD users take 6 months to get their periods back, but it was good that I came in. She prescribed progesterone to try to induce a bleed and hopefully get things working again. I took ten days of 10mg of progesterone and my period started 2 days after I concluded meds.

I‚Äôm going to keep checking OPKs, but I‚Äôm curious if my cycle is going to come back in a week or if I‚Äôm going to have to take another round of progesterone to start things again? (My Dr wrote the prescription for 2 refills). Does anyone have any experience with progesterone getting things started again? How many cycles did it take?

Your gut biome needs to adapt to digest lentils and legumes.

-	the following week have 1/2 cup of lentils or beans daily every single day consistently- if 1/2 is too much make it 1/3 cup. 
-	week after that again make a modest increase to 3/4 cup or 1 cup every day

"LateStageCapitalism","t5_39qgx","&gt; I like how you have shifted from climate change to something completely different.

I didn't shift it, I used a pointed instance to demonstrate a more understandable use case. To point out that a blanket criticism of blocking traffic isn't warranted... I didn't think I'd have to spell that out, sorry.

&gt;If I were to try to come up with the least effective way to fight climate change I couldn't think of a less effective method than blocking traffic. Not only are you targeting random people who likely have zero power to effect any change

If the messaging is right, and the activism makes clear a tangible reason for their actions, maybe not. A city with too many roads, and too little public transportation is an example of a situation you might be able to exploit. And to be frank, the suburbia to city job logistics pollution is something that should be targeted.

&gt; you are actually increasing greenhouse gas emissions by forcing people to sit idle in traffic.

Direct action is more than the moment, this feels as vapid as the criticism of green energy for using fossil fuels in their production. Attempting to force change is about the ends, and unless the damage of the means is awful, then this is a moot point.

&gt;Sure direct action disrupts, but you can actually target it in effective ways. Disrupt a corporation who is trying to build a new pipeline. Disrupt the lives of the politicians who sell their constituents out for checks from big oil companies. Do something that actually makes a difference.

I don't think you understand how disruptive blocking highways into a city can be, if the people decide to block traffic, they're doing far more than disrupting people getting to work, they attacking the economy of that city, they're making operation under the status quo impracticable. And if organized enough to resist removal, can use the treat of future blockages to force political action. The suburban to city road infrastructure is an ecological disaster. An ongoing one that we as a species cannot afford to allow.

If you're here in good faith, please, read this:

&gt;##‚ÄúBut people need to drive to work.‚Äù

&gt;I suggest that it is because the seemingly benign act of blocking traffic is actually far more powerful than it appears at first glance. Consider, if you will, all that is required for you to drive your car to work:

&gt;First, roads have to be built, which involves the felling of trees, the flattening of land, the diversion of streams. Massive amounts of asphalt (which is petroleum tar) are applied to the ground. Oil has to be mined from the earth through various and increasingly destructive methods, and then transported long distances, which involves burning that oil. Legislation is then passed which allows these industries to socialize the costs of their business while privatizing the profits.

&gt;Then, vehicles have to be built, from plastics (also petroleum) and energy intensive steel, and then transported long distances to markets, advertised, purchased using loans. Those loans are made possible through government bailouts to car companies and other lending institutions which are deemed ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù.

&gt;Then we drive to work. Many of us drive, instead of walking or biking, because zoning laws make it impossible for us many of us to work close to where we live, and public transportation is often inadequate. Because of that distance, we also eat at more fast food restaurants, which pumps our veins with gross quantities of factory farmed meat, monoculture farmed carbohydrates, and massive quantities of high fructose corn syrup. All of this requires massive quantities of pesticides and fertilizer, which often contains petrochemicals, as well as legislation to prop up these industries.

&gt;Now add in the fact that, if you are a person of color, there is virtual war being carried against you on by a racist police and court system‚Äîa war which takes often place on our streets and highways.

&gt;All of this is maintained and perpetuated by a political system. That political system criminalizes blocking traffic--with increasingly harsher penalties in states with Republican controlled legislatures. But these new bills are just part of an entire upside-down system in which the the movement of cars is deemed to be more important that the lives of forests, animals, and even human beings, and in which the profit derived from automobiles and the associated industries is deemed to be more important that the survival of the very planet.
##How standing in the street can be revolutionary

&gt;This contradiction is highlighted in the act of blocking traffic.

&gt;‚ÄúBut people need to drive to work,‚Äù you may be thinking. So much is contained in that response, so many unstated assumptions and unexamined value judgments. The seemingly innocuous phrase ‚Äúgoing to work‚Äù obscures an entire system which is killing people and quite literally destroying our world.

&gt;That‚Äôs why blocking traffic is a revolutionary act. It literally forces people to stop. It forces the whole system to stop, even if just for a few minutes and in a limited geographical area. And by stopping, there is at least an opportunity to consider, to consider what the costs of our participation in this economic and political system are.

&gt;The point is not to stop people from driving to work (though it would be nice if the system didn‚Äôt require us to do that). The point is to get people to consider how even seemingly benign acts, like driving to work, are part of an incredibly destructive and violent system. And also to see how seemingly simple acts, like standing in the street, can interrupt that system. Our economic and political systems will not be changed by individuals giving up driving to work. They can only be changed by completely reconsidering our value systems and the many things we take for granted. That begins with getting people to stop.

&gt;Yes, blocking traffic inconveniences people. That‚Äôs the point. Social change is never convenient.

&gt;And, yes, blocking traffic upsets people. That‚Äôs also the point. ‚ÄúBut surely angering people won‚Äôt make them sympathetic to your cause,‚Äù you may be thinking. You‚Äôd be right. Angry people will not be sympathetic. But neither will somnambulant people. Getting angry is the first step to waking up.

&gt;In fact, I would suggest that the people who are most angered by protesters blocking traffic are closer to understanding than those who just blithely put their car in park and turn to their cell phones. People who are most angered by protesters blocking traffic at least seem to have an unconscious sense of how threatening the act of blocking traffic is to the existing social order.

&gt;If we are to bring about real change‚Äîpolitical, economic, social, and ecological change‚Äîthen a lot more people will need to be inconvenienced. A lot more people will need to be made angry. A lot more cars will need to be stopped. A lot more commerce will need to be slowed. And a lot more people will need to wake up from the dream of business as usual.

Modeling those effects some other way, so that they have the same level of impact on the *character*, while still allowing the *player* to engage with the game, would alleviate the problem.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","By far Clark's greatest advantage is his speed. He's consistently shown to be able to move and deflect bullets after they've been fired. As far as strength, even during season 1 he stops a speeding bus without being hurt. Towards the end of season 3 he casually no-sells cars and trucks hitting him at 80+ mph.

The one thing Homelander can do that Clark can't is fly.

R1: In character Clark prefers to try to talk villains down, and Homelander rarely engages in combat from flight. So I'd say that season 4 Clark could defeat Homelander pretty easily as long as he realises the threat before Homelander realises Clark can't fly. Even if Homelander does fly I don't think he'd have the speed needed to take out Clark with his laser vision, so it would just go on forever until Homelander lands.

R2: Clark just speedblitzes Homelander and it's not even close. Season 2 Clark is so much faster than anything Homelander has shown that he won't even get time to realise he needs to fly to have a chance.",1654041672

I just got back from the theatre with my wife for a Tuesday 3:30 showing. I have got to say, I fucking loved this movie. This might be the best sequel of any movie, period. Movies like this make the theatre experience. I wish more productions and other fictional IPs were this thought-out, well-cared for, and expertly crafted. The way Tom Cruise helmed this project, honored a great friend regardless of his physical state, and paid tribute to the original in all of it's glory... proves that A-List talent really can make the box office. 

To say a picture like this is rare would be an understatement. There were so many nostalgic memories of family and emotional stirrings of boyhood dreams; the rekindling of that same youthful optimism where one stares at the sky or imagines the cul-de-sac as the final corner of the race. I'm glad it rarely settles on it's nostalgia by constantly pushing the envelope with  new cinematic experiences.

*(I never understood the ""leading-man"" A-List pedestal. Sure Bogart, but it ends there. It's something I never understood. I remember watching Tom Cruise become a meme on Ellen and South Park. I remember hiding the fact I enjoyed his movies throughout my childhood due to the social scene around me; judgmental non-musical hipster-noise-scene nerds into bands like Com Truise. But Tom Cruise as Maverick... across the decades is still larger than life. I hope if you're a fan and if you're debating on whether to watch this one in theatres, I can only tell you I wish my brother was there with me.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; if we think that someone cant consent to sex if they are felling euphoric after a high adrenaline moment and would have not consented if they were not this euphoric.

Consent needs to be fully informed consent.  If it is not fully informed, then the consent is not valid - certainly morally, possibly legally.

So if someone in a ""euphoric"" state consents to sex with you, then it is your responsibility to ensure that they actually want to have sex with you and not that they are not consenting because they are ""out of their mind"".

The only way you're going to get accused of rape in such a situation is if the person regrets that the two of you had sex.  So it is your responsibility to make sure they aren't going to regret it.  Because if they *do* regret it, it means that the consent wasn't fully informed.  Clearly some new information came to light in the time between when they ""consented"" and when they regretted the sexual activity.  Whatever that information was, if it was known at the time ""consent"" was granted, would have cause the party to not consent.  Therefore, the consent was not fully informed and was not valid.",1654041673

He did nothing to stop it from happening and then ran away with his tail between his legs before the consequences of his actions could catch him. 

Most of the time (in my experience at least) someone in the band will say something if they see violence breaking out or people getting hurt in the crowd. Gerard is great about calling it out right as it happens, and other bands take safety precautions as well (at one point Green Day had studded belts banned from their shows because Billie saw someone in the pit get beaten with it).

My parents love their dentist because he's skilled, upfront on costs, and flexible on payment options (also always available in an emergency).

For me, one of the fun parts of oil based perfumes is sniffing it as it develops, and also tracking first impressions vs 2 days later vs 2 weeks vs 6 months (: I also highly recommend applying a light dab to the wrist/elbow after a few days where the scent will really ""bloom"" on the skin.

"AskDocs","t5_2xtuc","Question about periods after tubal ligation:  
I‚Äôm looking into my sterilization options and something I‚Äôm trying to understand is how it is that you still get periods when you get your tubes tied.  
How I‚Äôve understood periods is an unfertilized ovum is absorbed into your uterine lining after traveling through the Fallopian tubes, and then your uterine lining is shed thus menstruation bleeding begins.  
I understand that the ovaries still release eggs after a tubal ligation, they are just obviously blocked from reaching the uterus. So since this happens, they are absorbed into the body instead of the endometrium.  
My question is, if your uterine lining shedding is from absorbing an unfertilized ovum and the fluctuating change in hormone levels through your menstrual cycle, what is actually shedding in your endometrium that causes you to have your period if there is no ovum being absorbed into the lining? Is there just enough built up lining that it continues to shed up until menopause?  
Just trying to understand the medical explanation behind this and understand the body post-sterilization. Thank you!",1654041677

"FODMAPS","t5_2sxvy","I'm sorry you took it that way, it was not my intention. The human brain and the digestive system is closely connected,  which your gastroenterologist might have told you, and it's very common for people with IBS and similar diagnoses to feel stress and anxiety - which can trigger symtoms like diarrhea, nausea, cramps etc. I malabsorb mannitol as well, but food needs time to start to digest. If you haven't removed a very large portion of your intestines I don't see how something you ate just an hour ago would give you IBS-related symptoms. But of course you know your own body best. I'm not saying you make it up, and I don't see why it is patronising to share knowledge. 

I wrote this mostly for OP since they asked about how long it takes for symtoms to occur and I think your comment could be misleading because your experience differ from the research about FODMAPs. Not saying your experience is false, just that OP should keep this in mind so they better can asses their symptoms and have in mind what they ate up to 48h earlier + think about how stress etc also trigger symptoms.

And I'd argue cryptocurrencies aren't even good for decentralization in the first place, because the economic and financial incentives don't line up that way. If simply _allowing_ for decentralized operation was enough to incentivize it, the existing internet would still look more like the 90s/2000s in the first place. All the same incentives that led to the internet being more centralized are even _more_ true of cryptocurrencies, and cryptocurrencies have very few legitimate applications on top of that.",1654041679

"FanFiction","t5_2r5kb","Got enough to post my own.  The fandom is Cross Ange.  For the sake of context, Hilda is a Norma, an oppressed muggle minority, and the unnamed character is a member of an Underground railroad-esque organization that rescued her from the police after she escaped from the penal colony she was imprisoned at:

Somewhere in the dark, birds were singing. Then there was a warmth spreading across her face. The darkness brightened into a dull glow and Hilda slowly woke up. 'What happened?' she wondered. 'Where am I?' Slowly, painfully, she rose to a sitting position and bit by bit the events of yesterday came to her. The rejection by her mother, walking though the rain, being attacked by those police, and then a blur of shadows and movement that she couldn't piece together. Hilda bitterly smirked as she realized that she was either in prison or shipped back to Arzenal. So why did her bunk feel so warm and soft?

""Well,"" she sighed, ""no sense putting it off."" But as her vision cleared and she looked around she found herself in the last place she ever would have expected. ""What...is this?"" Wherever she was it looked like the bedroom of a log cabin. Way too luxurious to be a prison cell. She swung her legs over the edge of the bed and winced from the stabbing pain in her ribs. Her hand went to her side, felt bare skin and Hilda gasped as she realized she was naked. Not only that, someone had dressed her wounds. Gauze had been wrapped around her rib cage while a bandage had secured a now thawed out cold pack over her eye.
 ""What the hell is going on here?"" she asked as across the room, the doorknob began to turn. A surge of adrenaline launched Hilda off the bed as she seized a drinking glass from a nearby nightstand and took position behind the door. 'I don't know who you are,' she vowed. 'But you're going to regret being so careless.' The knob continued to turn until finally, the door creaked open and a man's face peeked into the room. When he saw the bed was empty, he threw the door open and dashed inside, realizing too late someone could be hiding behind the door. Hilda sprung just as he turned around, smashing the glass against the wall and thrusting the jagged edge against his throat.

""Who are you?"" she hissed. ""Where am I? Start talking!""

""Easy!"" he told her as he raised his hands. ""It's okay! I'm a friend!""

""A friend?"" she spat. ""You kidnap me, strip me, and you expect me to believe that!"" Another dagger erupted in her side, distracting her long enough for the human to move. In a blur, he knocked the glass away, spun around her, and seized her in a chokehold. Hilda struggled to get free but the human tightened his grip and she felt her breath struggling to get through.

""Now look!"" he warned. ""I'm not going to hurt you! But I can't have you attacking me either! So calm down and I'll let you go! Alright?"" With her breath cut off and her body still sore from the police assault, Hilda relaxed and nodded. The human released her, and Hilda turned to face him. His eyes bulged slightly and his face flushed as he turned and half fled out of the room. Too late Hilda remembered she was nude and covered herself as she glared at the half open door. ""There's a change of clothes in the closet and dresser,"" he called from out in the hall. ""And if you want to take a shower there's a bathroom next door. I'll be in the next room when you're ready."" He then closed the door and footsteps on the hardwood floor outside signaled his departure.

As she regained herself, Hilda stepped back until her legs hit the mattress and she plopped back onto the bed. Nothing about this made any sense. Whoever this human, was, he wasn't police nor did he seem like someone from the Norma Management Board. Hilda looked out the window and briefly considered trying to escape. With no bars she could squeeze through it easily enough. Ultimately, she realized doing so would be futile. If the police knew who she was then they'd find her again. And even if they didn't, she could be anywhere for all she knew. 'All right,' she decided. 'I'll play along for now. Once I get a better idea of where I am, then I'll run.' Retrieving a bathrobe from the closet, Hilda also took a pair of sneakers along with a pair of jeans, t-shirt, and a set of underwear before crossing over to the bathroom, the sight of which threw her off for a moment. She had gotten so used to the group showers of Arzenal that a private one was nearly alien to her. It was clean, practically untouched, there was even free soap and shampoo left out for her. 'He probably has cameras all over this place watching me,' she decided as she dropped her robe. 'Fine, enjoy the show.'",1654041679

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Man... Looking at your responses there seem to be a couple of things you need to clarify first:

- what do you define as a different person? 

Your responses to other replies suggest you mean different DNA. Remember identical twins have exactly the same DNA and yet are two different people. Any change, even infinitesimally small, may change what you would define as you. I may love flying kites, but possibly my parents waiting an hour to do the deed would lead to a situation where my father died in a horrific kite accident soon after completing the deed, making me hate kite flying. Contrary to popular belief, very very little about our DNA decides who we are. Therefore before we tackle whether the same sperm would make it to the egg if the race started later, even if it did make it to the egg, that hour difference may still make you a fundamentally different person.

- would a difference of an hour make a difference to which sperm won the race?

Who knows for sure? It may be that your dad's balls had only one good man in his whole shot that had any chance of making it, but the chances of your guy making it a second time would still be infinitesimally small, if that was the case. Sperm work because although the journey is difficult the sheer number of men sent on the journey means that some will make it. Throwing a dice with 300m sides and getting the same number twice is not going to happen. You won the life lottery.

- what about if a sperm with really really similar DNA won? would someone who has 99.999% the same DNA be the same person?

No! Although having the same DNA does not make you the same person, having different DNA definitively makes you a different person.",1654041679

The number is rising, and with growing electricity issues, hard questions are being asked of intermittent, predatory renewables.

&gt;The mainstream media portrays renewables siting as an isolated issue. But the intrepid Bryce is breaking through the narrative of a inevitable ‚Äòrenewables future‚Äô and ‚Äòreset‚Äô from mineral energies.

"NYStateOfMind","t5_1068vi","***tbh, its next to impossible to get a gun here, unless u traffic one...
this is a lip service bill, i repeat a lip service bill \***

ollowing a pair of heinous tragedies, Gov. Hochul and state lawmakers announced a deal Tuesday on a package of bills that will tighten New York‚Äôs already strict gun laws and raise the minimum age to buy a semiautomatic rifle to 21.

The agreement comes in the wake of mass shootings at a Texas elementary school and a Buffalo supermarket that left dozens dead and prompted renewed calls for change at the national level.

Hochul said New York must step up as it remains unclear if Congress will take action.

‚ÄúNew York already has some of the toughest gun laws in the country, but clearly we need to make them even stronger,‚Äù the governor said in a statement. ‚ÄúNew Yorkers deserve to feel safe in schools, in grocery stores, in movie theaters, in shopping malls, and on our streets ‚Äî and we must do everything in our power to protect them.‚Äù
The package includes measures prohibiting the sale and purchase of body armor for anyone not in law enforcement and closing the ‚Äúany other weapon‚Äù loophole that allows the sale of certain weapons that would otherwise be banned. Another bill could lead to the microstamping of ammunition.

Among the biggest changes to New York‚Äôs gun laws will be a new requirement that anyone seeking to buy a semiautomatic rifle must be at least 21, up from 18, and must first obtain a gun license.

Currently, licenses and permits are needed only for handguns.

‚ÄúOur nation has been brought to a moment of reckoning due to weapons of war that have been too easily accessed by those seeking to kill,‚Äù state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D-Yonkers) said. ‚ÄúThese weapons have made places in our communities like schools, grocery stores, houses of worship and concerts places of carnage.‚Äù

Other bills will strengthen the state‚Äôs ‚Äúred flag‚Äù law, which helps remove guns from those who may be a threat to themselves or others, and create a new ‚ÄúTask Force on Social Media and Violent Extremism‚Äù within the attorney general‚Äôs office to ‚Äústudy and investigate the role of social media companies in promoting and facilitating violent extremism and domestic terrorism online.‚Äù

On May 14, 10 people, all Black, were killed while shopping at a Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo. Authorities allege that 18-year-old Payton Gendron gunned down his victims after posting racist screeds in online chat rooms and plotting the massacre for months.

Last week, Salvador Ramos, also 18, slaughtered 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, before being killed by police. Ramos reportedly posted pictures of guns and made threatening comments online ahead of his rampage.

Both suspected shooters used variations of semiautomatic rifles known as an AR-15s, which are legal in New York. The gun used in the Buffalo shooting was modified with a high-capacity magazine that allows 30 shots per round and was bought in Pennsylvania, according to police.

‚ÄúJust 10 days separated the mass shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde that took the lives of 31 people. Nowhere else in the world is this happening,‚Äù said Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx). ‚ÄúWe are in desperate need of a conversation about guns, but we are also in desperate need of action.

‚ÄúI hope that one day we‚Äôll see the end to the horrific gun violence we see in this country. But until then, I will keep fighting,‚Äù he added.

Lawmakers are expected to vote on the package before the scheduled end of the legislative session Thursday.

Other bills slated for approval will eliminate the grandfathering of large-capacity ammunition feeding devices lawfully possessed prior to the enactment of the SAFE Act in 2013 or manufactured prior to 1994. Under the new laws, police will have to report seized or recovered guns to the criminal gun clearinghouse and share information with federal authorities as well as test-fire seized or recovered guns for the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network.

The state police will also be required to conduct inspections of gun dealers every three years.",1654041680

I would make an schedule for when you want her to be there and send it to her. Make a schedule for everyone in your immediate family basically. Make it not flexible so that they can see what's expected of them and let them complain away their duties. CC everyone on each email.

*****
&gt; Turkish police clashed with protesters around Istanbul&amp;#039;s main Taksim Square on Tuesday as they gathered to mark the anniversary of nationwide anti-government demonstrations that began nine years ago in nearby Gezi Park.The 2013 demonstrations were the biggest popular challenge to then-Premier Tayyip Erdogan&amp;#039;s rule.

&gt; Erdogan, who is now president, has equated the protesters with Kurdish militants and those accused of orchestrating a coup attempt in 2016.A Turkish court sentenced eight people, including philanthropist Osman Kavala, to jail last month, finding them guilty of organizing and financing the so-called Gezi protests.

&gt; Police took down the banner that read &amp;quot;Everywhere is Taksim, everywhere is resistance&amp;quot; - a popular slogan during the 2013 protests.

"transgender","t5_2qxpm","So it turns out that the Nazi symbols appropriated by Ukraine were done so because Ukraine has an interesting history. I‚Äôm not saying to appropriate Nazi symbols, but simply trying to explain why they‚Äôre so prevalent. 

Long story short, Ukraine had a brief window of independence which was immediately ended by soviet occupation. The Soviets weren‚Äôt necessarily benevolent and many suffered. When WWII happened to war many in Ukraine the Nazis were seen as liberators from the oppressive communists, despite the abuse against the Semitic peoples and others. When the Soviets and allies defeated the Nazis, Ukraine had a dark period of history as the Soviets forced famine and brutality on many. The Soviet Union was anti-Semitic as well, so that group suffered nonstop. Due to this some groups are huge on using Nazi symbols because it is seen by many as a symbol of fighting the Soviets or repelling Russian imperialism. So symbols like the wolfsangel, black sun, and others are everywhere. Weird fact about Ukraine, soviet symbols are banned but nazi ones aren‚Äôt. It has to do with forced famine. Holocaust memorials are a real thing in Ukraine, which the Russians targeted mind you. So the symbols aren‚Äôt inherently Nazi as in Hitler and the third reich but more so reappropriated symbols for nationalist ideas. I‚Äôve seen plenty of videos of them doing salutes with tons of Nazi insignias tattooed on them. It‚Äôs real, but not quite what it seems. 

They‚Äôre hugely important in the fight against Russia, as they‚Äôre highly trained and well armed.  Plus the investment in training those guys? A pretty penny. They use symbols many find offensive, though there‚Äôs plenty of Russians with Nazi stuff too. The Russian national socialist party is no joke. It‚Äôs on both sides, and in many more militaries than anyone wants to admit. Ukraines‚Äô history just put them in a weird position where they‚Äôre more open about it. They hate the Soviet Union because forced famine and genocide decade after decade. 

Again, not saying to appropriate Nazi symbols or anything but there‚Äôs an interesting historical reason behind the prevalence. I‚Äôd read somewhere there‚Äôs not only Jewish members but allegedly a Jewish financier or two.",1654041682

"whatsthissnake","t5_2xtic","Common Watersnakes *Nerodia sipedon* are medium (record 150 cm) natricine snakes with keeled scales often found near water in large numbers. They are commonly encountered fish eating snakes across much of eastern North America.

*Nerodia* watersnakes may puff up or flatten out defensively and bite. They secrete a foul smelling substance from the cloaca called musk and can deliver a weak anticoagulant venom used in prey handling from the back of the mouth, but are not considered medically significant to humans - bites just need soap and water.

A very wide ranging snake in North America, it is replaced in the extreme south by, and likely exchanges genes with, the Banded Watersnake *Nerodia fasciata*. Banded Watersnakes have even, connecting bands across the top of the snake all the way down the body. In common watersnakes *N. sipedon*, bands typically break up or become mismatched after the first third of the body. 

[Range Map](http://www.tnwatchablewildlife.org/rangemaps/11062908495575574rangemap.gif) | Relevant/Recent Phylogeography: None, but [interesting work on color pattern exists](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1995.tb02324.x).

This genus, as well as this species specifically, are in need of revision using modern molecular methods.





--------------------------------------------------------

Like many other animals with mouths and teeth, non-venomous snakes can use them to bite in self defense. These animals are referred to as 'not medically significant' or traditionally, 'harmless'. Bites from these snakes benefit from being washed and kept clean like any other skin damage, but aren't often cause for anything other than basic first aid treatment. Some snakes use venom from front or rear fangs as part of prey capture and defense. This venom is not always produced or administered  by the snake in ways dangerous to human health, so many species are venomous in that they produce venom, but considered harmless to humans in most cases because the venom is of low potency, and/or otherwise administered through grooved rear teeth or simply oozed from ducts at the rear of the mouth. Species like Ringneck Snakes *Diadophis* are a good example of mildly venomous rear fanged dipsadine snakes that are traditionally considered harmless or not medically significant. Many rear-fanged snake species are harmless as long as they do not have a chance to secrete a medically significant amount of venom into a bite; [severe envenomation can occur](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23800999) if some species are [allowed to chew on a human](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004101011831016X) for as little as 30-60 seconds. It is best not to fear snakes, but use common sense and do not let any animals chew on exposed parts of your body. Similarly, but without specialized rear fangs, gartersnakes *Thamnophis* ooze low pressure venom from the rear of their mouth that helps in prey handling, and are also [considered harmless](https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/theres-no-need-to-fear-that-garter-snake/). Even large species such as *Malayopython reticulatus* [rarely obtain a size large enough to endanger humans](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/108/52/E1470.full.pdf) so are usually categorized as harmless.

Again, no. It doesn't matter what their desire or intention is. They can will it to not happen all day long, that doesn't mean if it does happen, they are allowed to kill an innocent person.

So to avoid a lot of pointless shit I watched the TIHYDP on it by 0utsider. It was a fucking disaster as one would expect. But the part that angered me the most was his constant complaining whenever there was a challenge. He would repeatedly say shit like ""This game doesn't seem as polished as SMW"" and constantly compared the two games.

They're completely different titles but this mouth-breather decided to compare them anytime he was frustrated. I've never seen anyone struggle with Yoshi's Island (including me and my sisters when we were really young) and never heard anyone that dislikes the game.

I will say this isn't exact confirmation that Yamato will join, after all, she called herself Oden which just feels strange to me and something which will presumably be questioned. But yeah in all likelihood it's over.

As for Carrot, again not confirmation she won't join. I've consistently said if she joins she will stow away as a parallel to when she first joined, except this time with her being more determined. It doesn't sit right with me that Oda compete ignores Carrot in Wano despite the build up in WCI just to ignore her. Especially given how incredibly popular it is. So either we will be getting far more from Carrot, or Oda completely missed the mark with her character. Either way, with Carrot it's only over when she doesn't appear as a stowaway on the Sunny. Realistically though, the best I can hope for is Oda at least treats her the way he treated Vivi. Carrot sacrificed far more and was actually a working crew member in WCI even if temporary. If he doesn't even treat her like an honorary crew member as he does Vivi, that would just be incredibly cruel to the character. I hope this is something we can all agree on. Even people who dislike Carrot could surely acknowledge that her character has pretty much been butchered this arc.

If he runs he will be even more corrupt and more of a cuck to the deep state and foriegn bastards like the Saudis and Israelis.

Republicans are not offering jack squat but bash the queers this cycle and most likely 2024 as well. Maybe more China military postering and coups and sanctions against nations who never did us any harm. Trump did plenty of that too. 

Trump won't fix shit. He won't ""save America"". He will go along with every fascist piece of legislation and wrap it up in a patriotic bow and his crowd will eat it up. 

He won't end the DHS disinfo Orwellian thing. He will exploit it for himself. He won't end the PATRIOT ACT, the NDAA, or bring the troops home amd end our bullshit middle east and African engagements.

"Supremacy1914","t5_2sj5i","Here is a quick summary of how attack/defense damage is calculated;  
  
For ground vs. ground battles:  
\- The amount of damage is calculated for both armies before taking damage (so calculation first, distribution second)  
\- The attacker receives the damage first and the defender second, but since the damage is calculated beforehand it doesn't change anything in terms how much damage both armies take.  
  
For air vs. air battles or air vs. ground battles:  
\- The defender strikes first, and the attacker strikes afterwards. means the efficiency of the attacking plane may be slightly lowered because it took damage before dealing its damage.

as pessoas esqueceram do real sentido de amar, n√£o somente amar ao outro, mas principalmente a si mesmo. um dos problemas maiores de relacionamentos √© a desconfian√ßa porque n√£o tem amor pr√≥prio. √© uma gera√ß√£o doente, que procura o que o outro tamb√©m n√£o tem. a√≠ vira um ciclo vicioso de sempre estar buscando o amor que voc√™ pode receber tanto de Deus como de algu√©m daqui. sabe?",1654041685

you deliberately mixed in some personal attacks and ignored that I literally stated several *possibilities* of what could have happened, with *possibilities"" of both of them lying or none of them lying. you understand what possibilities are?

you *badly* need the man to be wrong in this situation when there's no clear evidence of that. YOU are fabricating a narrative where the man is lying just because he's a man.

your interpretation is a really interesting Rorschach test because you see him avoiding a public discussion as a lack of denial/ admission of some kind of wrongdoing. do you even realize how wildly confrontational that is? in the possibility that he's right, does he have to confront her right then and there? you just assume that because he's a man, he needs to be confrontational at all times.

if he is that much of a pain in the ass as you're assuming, why would she go on TV with him? and admit they're really good friends?",1654041686

I didn't imply you weren't? I gave my perspective? Also, I don't know where this hostility is coming from in your text, legitimately just gave my perspective on stuff and pondered a question and you seem to have gone full defensive?

&gt;And sources???? Have you been on any social media in the last 10 years?

You know social media is tailored to what you want to look for right? If you are in the outrage machine, you constantly see outrage due to algorithms trying to keep you on the platform for money. I don't really go on social media besides some reddit, so my perspective is that no one's really outraged about that because I don't see it other than the occasional image that shows up of someone complaining via a reddit post.

&gt;That was the purpose of Elon Musk purchasing Twitter. Twitter shut down posts/accounts if they weren't fitting the narrative there.

I don't know much on this, but I don't think Musk is that great of a person anymore. His ""freedom of speech"" thing doesnt mean much when he has many NDA's and fires/restricts access to negative press, seems just like twitter does to me from my perspective, they're both just doing business to make more money. 

&gt;And most straight white men feel this way. Most just don't care.

Ok but like, if this is truly the case, I imagine someone has polled exclusively men and asked similar questions to this? I imagine there has to be some research, which is what I'm kind of asking for because now that I'm delving into this topic, I find research stating the oppositeish? My point is here, without a sampling of data from people its hard to truly know what is the majority because people tend to think their opinion is always the majority.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Next. If your ""friends"" didn't accept you then find new friends. They weren't your friends. I'm bi. I told people 25 years ago. No one cared. My friends said cool and moved on. Sorry you didn't have that.

Im glad you had a better time. Grew up in an area not that accepting so it's unfortunate for me, but definitely not something to scoff at considering its my perspective. I'm not discounting your perspective, but you seem to have no desire to even see my perspective and would just rather argue your perspective is superior?",1654041686

They don't always understand why things are happening or who is causing them to experience symptoms. They can be more sensitive, but they also may not be the same type of person.

The worst thing about this sub is the ignorance of its own sub. Not only is it ignorant of the concept of the difference between psych and psychology, they also don't understand what a psych student knows or how smart they are, and don't care about the difference.

He thought that if you toss a few times in a row, for example, a tail**s**, it's **a** significantly bigger chance that ~~in~~ the next toss ~~it~~ would be a head**s/for the next toss it would be a heads**. I argued that that is wrong, and whatever sequence was before, it is always **a** 50% ~~of~~ chance to get a tail**s** or a head**s**. ~~Finally~~ **In the end,** no one could convince the other one.

&amp;#x200B;

You toss a coin 3 times:

possible outcomes at end of third toss:

H-H-**H**

H-H-**T**

H-T-**H**

H-T-**T**

T-T-**T**

T-T-**H**

T-H-**T**

T-H-**H**

There are four outcomes where the third toss is a heads and four where the final toss is a tails. So it's still 50-50 chance of heads or tails. But the chance of T-T-T is only 1/8 (=1/2x1/2x1/2), which is what your friend is thinking of - but the remaining 7/8 chance is all of the other above options and not only accounted for by ""T-T-H"".

"HunterXHunter","t5_2spu5","In my opinion, I think it's because they don't see the story getting that far. As of now there's no way Gon is going to show up anytime soon. But I honestly can't see how Gon will never show up ever again if the series ever does get past the Dark Continent. Afterall it was never stated that he's lost his nen forever, just that his nodes got all closed up. I feel like it's suggested he'll open them back up after a while. So I personally don't see how that's a factor in keeping him away.

It's kind of also like how a lot of people seem to believe Kurapika will die, it's plausible and they have good reason to believe it; while I honestly doubt it. Especially considering is self sabotaging himself ever since the beginning of the story, to have him just die is pretty tragic. Despite its dark and nuanced nature hxh doesn't seem to ever go that tragic, at least for the main characters. I mean, look at the CA and the Election, Gon goes through immense darkness but comes out basically alright. So I do have reason to believe Kurapika will be fine. But I can see why they'd think he'll die, I just have a different pov ig 

Back to Gon, I feel his story is far from over, it will always feel that way to an extent ofc, but Killua has had immense positive character development throughout the manga, Gon doesn't really. He has negative character development, and we see him at his darkest in the CA arc, but he never really gets better? Like he's healed now but he hasn't reflected at all on what had  happened. So is story just feels incomplete; He's had his delve down but no climb upward. And idk if it's just me, but I'd be pretty upset if his story just ended simply like that.

He's got a clean slate now, so I think it'd be really interesting to watch him start a whole new journey.",1654041688

For kits, ammo &gt; gun &gt; gear. You want to shoot something that will kill. Usually BP is perfect for this, but something like M62 or M80 also works. If you spend on nothing else, spend on ammo. Next priority is gun. Please use a good gun. Even if it‚Äôs just some budget ak. An extra 50-100k on a gun with max traders goes such a long way. This will impact your survival rate and thus money making ability significantly. Finally, you don‚Äôt need sick gear. If you want to run t6 and a nice helmet, go for it. But realistically, if you want to make the most money you‚Äôre running a TV-110 or something similar for space. Helmet is just ricochet chance unless you‚Äôre wearing an altyn/Rys-T. In a lot of cases people just throw on a shattered mask and forget about it. Then finally a nice big bag.

Honorable mention: stims. Sj6 and some of the others might seem expensive, but they can be the difference between you getting to the hot spot or loot spot first and being able to either catch people off guard or dip out before they ever arrive. If you‚Äôre doing something like money runs on interchange or rogue farming on lighthouse, stims are pretty much mandatory. And you absolutely make your money back.",1654041689

I think its common knowledge that berkeley is seen as ""better"" because people haven't considered the alternative and refuse to research it. Most of the rankings are total BS and rely on shit statistics of diversity of graduates. I know people in both camps and the difference between them is negligent at best. UCLA has an excellent career center for undergrads and helps in CS as well. I know folk in UCLA CSE with Amazon, Cisco, and Facebook internships same as berkeley. However the difference with berkeley is the talent pipeline that is fueled by larger graduate numbers which steal the majority opinion when it comes to the ""best"" CS. Not to mention UCLA offers a wider variety of language learning and from what I heard slightly more difficult since they cover more topics but not as in depth as in berkeley, but in CS its better to learn more on your own than have your hand held throughout the entire time imo. Then again, UCLA Boelter Hall is the birthplace of the internet, shame those who use it forgot. Also immediately calling UCLA an ""arts"" school is insulting and ignorant and close-minded to what it truly has to offer.",1654041689

Dialogue in S1 and S2 formed how we the players knew a character's background, motivations and personalities. Allegra resented S1 MC at every opportunity and let it be known in her dialogue. Bobby wanted to be friends with everyone by his actions and dialogue. In S4, it's why the relationship with Angie feels so organically grown because she shared her feelings, past and background with MC. There's no point in having gender and body diverse characters who are still boring to talk to.

Casa Amour gives us the players an interesting dilemma: Stick with an existing LI or pursue things with a new one? It brings in more diversity of characters who technically have to cram as much personality and flirting into three to four days as possible.",1654041689

*****
&gt; Left to its own devices and relatively undisturbed by human hands, scientists have discovered that seed has grown to what is now believed to be the biggest plant anywhere on Earth, covering about 200 sq km.

&gt; Ribbon weed rhizomes can grow up to 35cm a year and, using that rate, the authors of the research - published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B - estimate the plant will have needed at least 4,500 years to spread as far as it has.

&gt; **Rule 1:** Make it about weed

***

&gt; All posts must be directly focused on weed, this means that weed must be the main focus of your post. Posts with weed in them, but it is clear it is not the main focus and was only included to bypass the rule, do not fit the subreddit.

&gt; We understand this can be frustrating as we only allow weed-related posts, however, we must remind you that we are not the only 'stoner' subreddit and there are other communities you may be able to post this on. **If your post was a stoned thought, please go to r/Stonerthoughts instead.**

&gt; Screenshots, where you are ""exposing"" a seller or discussing if someone is trying to scam you in DMs or screenshots of your engagements with other subreddits or users, are classed as spam as they clog up the subreddit and have nothing to actually do with weed. **All vendors that come into your DMs and chats offering services and deals are scammers and not genuine. Do not engage with them.**

We also do not allow smoke spot pictures on any day other than a **Sunday** and we also only allow non-edibles food posts on a **Monday.** These days were allocated for these topics specifically and there is a specific flair to use on these days for these posts.

I use the same script to make the binaries I use for armv7l and aarch64, so I don't know why that's happening here.

Some tablets try to get round this by implementing a secondary interface, such as Dex (as somebody else mentioned), but all this is doing is re-inventing the Desktop, but again is limited because it only has access to the normal Android applications, which takes us full-circle back to the difficulties above.

Then if we flip this, there are the hybrids, Laptops that turn into tablets. I'm part of an IT team for at large firm that has well over 200,000 of these deployed to staff across the globe, and as far as I know, we have no apps in our catalog that actually benefit from using it in ""Tablet"" profile (with the exception of media consumption).

Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:¬†

‚ÄúAllaah commands women to let the jilbaab come down (over their faces) so that they will be known (as respectable women) and not be annoyed or disturbed. This evidence supports the first opinion. ‚ÄòUbaydah al-Salmaani and others stated that the women used to wear the jilbaab coming down from the top of their heads in such a manner that nothing could be seen except their eyes, so that they could see where they were going. It was proven in al-Saheeh that the woman in ihraam is forbidden to wear the niqaab and gloves. This is what proves that the niqaab and gloves were known among women who were not in ihraam. This implies that they covered their faces and hands.‚Äù¬†

"BelgianMalinois","t5_2wo0n","I had a similar issue with my dog.  He learned how to climb our fence.   Got a quote for an electric fence, crazy expensive.  Plus we have a large property, so manually extending the fence wasn't feasible.  It's already 6 feet.  He can't jump straight over but can climb/hop in stages.

We spent maybe $150 getting supplies from Amazon and what turned out is much better (in my opinion).  We ran the wire at the top of the fence only.  Doesn't require a collar for the dog, just the line itself.  He can still touch the fence, but gets a shock if paws go to the top area.  He hasn't tried climbing out since but also is not at all fearful of the fence.  He still runs alongside it, just doesn't try to climb over anymore.  The wire is only on ""our"" side of the fence-- what backs up to the surrounding trails isn't affected.",1654041693

2. He runs his own studio, so he appreciates game design and mechanics from a slightly differenct perspective

Maybe a couple of games where he didn't want to try as hard but he was in the lead - in the 4th set that was. It wasn't anything like Rublev in Belgrade. Plus he didn't play a lot this tournament and had days off between the matches. Fitness isn't a problem 100%.

The second part may be problematic, but I don't think that he's got time to think about that mid match and that it affects him. I just don't have the explanation. How do you lose that 4th set when you've really played great and everything was on your side? Nadal seemed gassed and that point and that's when usually Novak turns it up even more. Didn't happen this time.

With the AWG no such adapters (from Jays and Kays) AND because of the distance from bezel to spring bar very few replacement watch bands are available  https://www.watchuseek.com/threads/g-shock-awgm100b-1a-after-market-straps.4505867/post-43821107 (I don't have an AWG yet [I love the AWG-M100S-7A] but in anticipation I bought 2 nylon straps from AE which supposedly fit the AWG)",1654041694

He set her up so she would be able to free herself in 24 hours. He shouldn't have locked her up in the first place, but the crime he committed was abduction, not murder. 

Delilah died because her throat was slit with a knife, not because she was handcuffed to a table or in Joe's cage. Love took out the knife and did the kill, not Joe. 

And I would argue you are proving my point by acting like Joe is equally guilty for this. Love is a grown adult who can make her own choices, it's not Joe's fault she chose to kill Delilah. That's on Love and Love alone.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","Suros regime is in the class of ""forgotten D2Y1 exotic"" 

It needs to have a different perk active while in 360 mode. I'd say it should be rampage. Because spinning up is it's own DPS perk, the 360 mode is just bland without that. 

Same problem with jade rabbit and mida multitool. Both bland. 

I feel mida multitool should be able to swap between single fire and 3 round burst (540 rpm rapid fire) and have a larger magazine size (21 like it used to in d1) just add that to the intrinsic perk. I feel also, it could have intrinsic anti barrier while in scout mode and overload while in pulse mode. The movement speed buff for scout mode and pulse mode be a recovery boost. And just let the catalyst drop from any crucible match because it's basically unobtainable for most people being legend in comp only. With these changes it would be a real multitool. Currently it does one thing, albeit well. Not a multitool. 

Jade rabbit's intrinsic perk cannot be changed due to code limitations but, it could be added to, a new perk could be added to the catalyst. Because that's how bungie updates various things, just look at jotuun now, and graviton Lance, both just got more useful. 

I'd say a new perk for jade rabbit could be fire rate increases as you get precision hits up to a maximum of 50% (aka 5 stacks of 10%) call it bunny hopping idk lol. Stacks remain until you miss a crit or after 10 seconds. There's nothing that's been said that jade rabbit can't obtain a new perk added via the catalyst. Fate of all fools would then be useful because it would have synergy with this new perk. 

Also the bow from forsaken that's so bad I've forgotten it's name. Wishender. There we go. It is so shit. At least the above exotics are good in PvP. Wishender is shit in both modes!

It was only good when it did extra damage as a glitch. I feel it needs a PvE damage buff but also a catalyst that does something. I'd say have successful warm-up and archer's tempo.",1654041695

Back then ww2 was in my territory germans always gave something in exchange for food and they never killed as massive local population as happening now in Ukraine. You lived well because you there brainwashed. Why you not live good if you robbed all gold and other invaluable treasures back from kingdom times. We lived better before ww1. But is it matter if we all decided to live by 21 century rules set the current borders and decided no other country have right to rob and destroy population in europe anymore. You not feeding us you only support us by money in exchange for bigger majority crops and other grown goods to be sent to old europe. There law in europe what at least 60 percent of grown crops should be sent to old europe. And paper money goes back to stocks so basicaly free grown production from all eastern europe members who are in eu. If you dont like EU exit it. We will survive widthout France and Germany.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Don‚Äôt stay miserable, although the financial differences are easy to calculate it‚Äôs much harder to quantify the difference in your mental well-being, job satisfaction and so on. If you think you‚Äôd genuinely be happier and mentally healthier, if a little financially worse off, then go for it. It could lead to opportunities further down the line and at least you‚Äôre not stuck at doing something that makes you miserable.",1654041698
"denvernuggets","t5_2segs","The reason they were willing and able to pay those guys is because they were literally in different contractual spaces for the future. The Wolves were still rebuilding from the wreckage of the Jimmy Butler exit when they got Beasley and Vando, still trying to figure out if DLo and KAT would ever play together. They had plenty of money to spend, so they spent it.

We did not. Not only did we need to win, so we couldnt play raw dudes like Vando or guys like Beasley who felt they should start (but also couldnt defend, mind you) - we were already right near the salary cap. The FO knew that MPJ was eventually going to command some kind of extension on his rookie deal, and whether or not you like Barton, he's still a better overall player than Beasley. Beasley is a bench spark-plug shooter who still cant defend very well. Barton (to say nothing of Gary, who was still with us when we traded Beasley) is a better defender, far better playmaker (it really isn't close), and far more versatile than Beasley. Not the shooter Beasley is, but literally better at everything else. There was no physical way we could pay Beasley what he wanted and still keep guys who were better and more proven than he is (and in less legal trouble, besides).

It isnt even about what those GM's EVENTUALLY paid Vando / Beasley (Juancho is on a minimum so I wont even talk about him). WHEN WE TRADED THEM, they were all on rookie scale deals. That caps how much we could get back for them. We got back a first rounder for 2 guys who barely ever played and who it wasnt certain would ever become something, and 1 guy who was in legal trouble but showed potential as a shooter at the 2. Could Tim have done better than the players he got (Jordan McRae, Keita Bates-Diop, one other guy I forget)? Sure, absolutely, I wish he'd done better there somehow. But really it wasnt like when we traded those guys we were giving up guys on solid contracts who were already solid, proven contributors to playoff basketball. They just weren't (I am also FAIRLY sure that deal was about more than just consolidation for our roster/cap situation as well - I remain relatively convinced that deal was about also eliminating the Rockets as a playoff threat to us by greasing the wheels to get Capela out of the West, which it accomplished quite well).",1654041698

"Patriots","t5_2rx57","Given everything we know about how Belichick runs the team, I think he runs the coaching staff the same way. The OC spot is still wide open for whoever is the best. And by default, the best OC right now is probably Bill Belichick until someone steps up.

It's easy to name an OC, but difficult to ""un-name""  him if he ends up not being the best for the team. It would create a distraction in the press, and it would be damaging to that person's career as it would be widely interpreted as ""getting fired as OC"". So I don't think Belichick will name an OC until someone is the clear winner by a wide margin. There might be multiple playcallers in the first few weeks of the season, much like how the O-Line often shuffles around in the first few weeks before they settle on the starting 5.",1654041698

Give yourself the same love and care that you'd give a friend if this had happened to them bc you deserve it just as much. Then when you're ready, pick yourself back up and show your ex he can go eff himself in the best way possible: by becoming a stronger, better person.

Then I‚Äôd grab my stuff and leave the company vehicle wherever it is, with keys in gas receptacle. 

You issue me a company phone, a company truck and any relative velocity, location ‚Äî any all communications or activities I assume is absolutely monitored.  I still put black tape on all forward and rear cameras. 

That is within their right to do so. I also leave all company electronics locked in the company vehicle at night as well.  Unless It is my on call week.  I leave the company truck at the shop every single night and take my personal home.  I am the only tech out of a team of 30 people that do this. I value my personal time more than I value working for any employer.  

Now, my personal phone / personal truck? You go fuck yourself. I‚Äôll go work for the dude you hate down the road. It also means I can start billing my employer for my time the second I get in my work truck. Instead of when I get to the job or leave it. They can‚Äôt do shit about that.",1654041697

Other than that I feel like it would be hard to redesign the spelling system with Spanish's rules to accommodate for the broad/slender distinction in consonants, and the lenition of consonants and fricative series. Depending on what time period of Spanish the new Irish spelling system is based on, there could be repurposing of &lt;s&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;z&gt; and &lt;j&gt; for different phonemes depending on if they had merged sound values yet.

2. wwe have either bought or defeated any company that have tried to ever steal their audience by taking their talent or buying the promotion itself.  those companies were also poorly ran. AEW for all intense and purposes is not. TK is richer than VKM.

3. The inevitable is approaching. The E's future is a toss up. Everyone can see its going down hill and with the McMahon's slowly being removed from power all's left is VKM himself. He can't do it forever and for those saying that Nick Khan( no relation to TK) will take over its still not VKM so we don't know what will happen. The E could very well collapse so the fear of that grips a lot of diehard fans.

"stupidpol","t5_hitz3","i think this issue is so divisive that nytimes had to get out ahead of it at this point. it's not hard to realize when you start to compare records for strength-based sports that a very very mediocre man could absolutely smash a woman's world record, to the point where no biological woman would ever be able to touch it. at that point you're essentially excluding almost all of the competition from ever setting another record or winning a world championship/medal while the person who set that record is competing. in the eyes of women who actually participate in these sports, who dedicate their lives to them, that record will always be tainted, so we have to ask ourselves who actually matters when it comes to women's sports--99.9% of the competition, or one or two individuals?  

it may not be an issue right now, but when/if this becomes normalized, record after record will slowly be taken by trans women. it may take decades or longer, but it will happen eventually due to the inherent advantage they have. the argument that trans women have no inherent advantage will completely unravel, and everyone who spent years propping it up is going to look really, really stupid, and the fact that no one seems to give a fuck what biological women in sports thinks about this issue is such a glaring contradiction that it can't be ignored forever.",1654041700

"Morrowind","t5_2r9nv","You were me 7 years ago. A few tips:

Magic is completely busted in MW and so are trainers.
You can train with plenty of people in Balmora, but for that you need money.
Short Blade has a master trainer in Balmora (which means you can level all the way to 100), and it's main attribute is, you guessed it, SPEED.

It's also a minor skill for Mages so you'll level up with it (remember to level up other skills that fortify other attributes as well, specially Willpower {Destruction, Restoration, etc} so your magic will succeed more, Intelligence {Conjuration, Alchemy, Enchanting} so you'll have more Magicka points and more success with enchantments and alchemy, and Strength so you can carry more).

It's definitely ""cheesing"", but you can pretty much have infinite money by summoning Dremora, killing them and stealing their weapon before they disappear (which may be worth from 10K gold all the way to 100+ K gold).
Of course, you're not summoning one of these when you're low level, so FOR NOW, I'd recommend acquiring Mark/Recall spells (search on the Wiki from whom you can buy those), and by doing that, you're essentially reducing your travels by half.

These are spells that let you ""mark"" a location and teleport back to it, ""recall"".
So, if you're doing the mages guild quest, you can mark somewhere in Balmora (indoors or outdoors) and recall after you're done with whatever quest you're doing.
It's very good for saving up travel time.

Also, Alsemvi Intervention and Divine Intervention are a MUST if you want to save time and doesn't have a good marked location. These are also teleport spells, but they teleport you to temples rather than a location of your choosing.
They're good because temples will usually have some form of fast travel near them, like a silt strider or a boat (except Buckmoth Fort or somethin', but at least this one is reasonably close to Balmora).

Research Creeper and Mudcrab Merchant later on when you can summon Dremoras, if you don't mind abusing the infinite money loop.

Also, don't commit the mistake of going over 10/10 of the skills you need for leveling, because that might bite you in the ass later on.
I, for one, will only be able to level up to level 69 (or at least I think I'll, I'm not a veteran player, so I never got all my skills to 100...yet), and by not being able to level more than that, I'll never get 100/100 on Luck, which might have been useful (yes, level up luck, it's good imo, it'll affect your spell casting chance as well as alchemy and enchanting).

That's it for now.",1654041702

"dyspraxia","t5_2ssnk","I don‚Äôt like telling anyone how to feel, but I would always say that you‚Äôre better to see the funny side instead of taking it personally and feeling super down on yourself.

I can relate to how you feel. People make fun of me for all sorts of reasons, (dyspraxia and my weight being the main reason) but people will admire you and enjoy your company a lot more if you learn to accept this as part of who you are, see the funny side and roast them back. Taking it personally and reacting angrily/trying to shut it down is likely going to make people feel like they‚Äôre walking on egg shells around you and maybe want to make them stop engaging with you as much!

Whatever you do, I hope you feel better :)",1654041705

Unless your talking hypothetical, but in terms of real life applicable ethics that isn't true I don't feel. 

I guess you could reconcile egoism with veganism. You could say that being vegan will make you look more empathetic or likeable to an egoist and that may convince them? Idk. Egoism is stupid and talking to people who unironically believe it is time probably spent better elsewhere.",1654041705

"Austin","t5_2qhn5","To put time into context, the Civil Rights Act was in 1964. **We've had air-conditioning longer than black people could vote.**

AISD wasn't fully desegregated until 1963. And this was just if you happened to live in the area of a white school. 

UT was fully desegregated in 1963 (6 to 1 vote). First AISD black teacher was 1964. First white-black marriage in Austin was 1965. 

AISD integration started in 1977 when the original Anderson High School area students were allowed to transfer anywhere in AISD. 

Austin housing is fully desegregated in 1979. Until then, blacks were still highly restricted to where in Austin they could live. Thus East Austin, between E 6th and Manor was the ""ghetto"" and why people still today say to stay away from east Austin.",1654041705

Toyota decided to compete with Jeep Compass (market leader) on the SUV craze with high margins and ended up with a car that has less features, is worse than international version, and costs way more than the Compass. I know it's hard to imagine that the Compass and Renegade are the best selling SUVs in Brazil, but they are. Brazilians have a craving for Jeep that goes well with the love for American bullshit",1654041706

Sounds like tons of fun, but *who's going to be doing all the heavy lifting in order to survive*? That's right, they're going to grow their own food! Right. 

Does he know that bread doesn't grow on a bread tree? You have to prepare the right kind of land, sow the wheat, pray that insects, blight or weather doesn't destroy your crop. Now, you have to harvest it. By hand. (They're always waxing poetic about the ""good old days"", when men were men, and women knew their place. Maybe having to survive like medieval peasants will change their minds). Now, you have to grind your wheat into flour, add other ingredients, and bake it. That's a *lot* of work for just bread. Man cannot live by bread alone, you need other foods, which means you need more land. Where are you incels going to come up with the money you need just for the land alone?

As I stood up the ladder up, my ring got stuck on the rung.

And due to a peculiarity of the design of a Little Giant, that rung got further and further from the ground as the ladder leaned against the wall.

And because levers and Archimedes and shit, this pulled *really, really* hard on my ring as the ladder tried to lift my body up and fall against the wall at the same time.

Then split the other cores 50/50

Passtrough to each vm 1x GPU 
30-31gb ram 
And Half the cores that are available after giving the host 2 cores.

And you do this 2 times.

So you end up with 2-4gb ram, 2 cores and Integrated GPU for Linux

"GunAccessoriesForSale","t5_h4uwp","Paypal offers two different services.  Paypal Friends and Family (F&amp;F) has zero fees, but offer no protections and makes the buyer vulnerable to scammers.  Paypal Goods and Services (G&amp;S) charges an additional ~3% of the item price (actually 3.49% and $0.49 as of 2021), but provides the buyer insurance in case the seller dissapears without providing the item.  Paypal does prohibit [some specific items](https://web.archive.org/web/20180409201310/https://www.paypal.com/us/selfhelp/article/what-is-paypal%E2%80%99s-policy-on-transactions-that-involve-firearms-faq585) but has a ""catch all comment"" that may apply to others, so NO NOTES IN PAYPAL. As a general guideline, if a buyer wants to use Paypal G&amp;S rather than F&amp;F with an **established GAFS member**, it is expected that they will absorb the +3% fee for the increased protections that it provides them. [Here is a easy fee calculator](https://thefeecalculator.com/). If a seller specifies a F&amp;F price, assume that is his ""to his pocket"" cost. However these terms are up for negotiation between the buyer and seller. It is recommended to pay via G&amp;S and absorb the fee. If the seller mandates F&amp;F, be wary of a scam and use a [Scam prevention method](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy).  Additionally, Paypal has deleted the account of several members due to using F&amp;F for purchases.  Paypal considers this theft from them (you're stealing their fees), and a violation of their [ToS](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full). DO NOT put notes in F&amp;F payments as it is evidence you may be violating PP ToS.

2. Huntsville is turning out to be a kind of cool place.

3. It‚Äôs really conservative. Like really conservative. The whole god and guns and football. I do not discuss politics with anyone I don‚Äôt know because I have had my head chewed off for disagreeing with someone.

4. Expect a lot of church and religion talk. I just walk away when it gets a bit much.

5. While property taxes are low, it comes with few services. Education is not funded well, keeps getting cut. Any social program gets slashed for lower taxes.

And that‚Äôs my take.",1654041709

"askasia","t5_3n7f3","&gt;From what I understand, even though the ottoman empire turned to shit, did a lot of horrible things and deserved to die, It was still a big pillar of stability for both the middle east and Europe too.

It's a century and God only knows how many wars later, and we're *still* constantly dealing with the effects of Sykes-Picot. The Ottoman Empire was far from perfect but it was pretty good at preventing brutal sectarian conflict along ethno-religous lines in the greater Middle East. Nation-states have a... mixed track record of preventing gigantic violence of that sort. And I am sure more than a few Palestinians would very much prefer life under the Ottoman Empire to the status quo under which they live. 

&gt;Id say the creation of the Turkish Republic was better for Anatolia itself, but worse for the rest of the middle east, considering how they have turned out.

The Ottoman Empire was already finished by the time the Turkish Republic was established in 1923. It had lost World War I and all of its territorial holdings had been divided between the victorious allies, namely the British and French who consistently made conflicting promises to different local tribes and ethnic groups in exchange for their support against the Ottomans. The British played a huge role in organizing the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans by [promising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon‚ÄìHussein_Correspondence) Sharif Hussein bin-Ali al-Hashimi sovereignty over what is now Palestine but also made a conflicting, [vaguely-worded promise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration) to the Zionists of Europe shortly thereafter when it became tactically convenient to do so, at a time when Russia had been knocked out of the war effort and it really looked like Germany was going to win. 

Anyway, I digress. The French and the British divided up the Levant after the war and planned on doing the same to the Turkish heartland in Anatolia, promising significant amounts of core Turkish territory to the Greeks, Armenians, and Italians in the process. By the time Ataturk organized the Turkish forces and led the War of Turkish Independence, he really had no choice but to establish a modern republic, because World War I had dealt a crushing blow to half of the Old World's empires. The next World War would deal another crushing blow to the Western Empires. And finally, the late 1980s would deal another blow to the Russian Empire in the form of the Soviet Union. We are, of course, still living with the consequences of this today. 

But again, I digress. Ataturk did what he did out of necessity in order to help his people avoid suffering the same sad fate as that so much of the rest of the world had suffered at the hands of Europe. Did he have ideals and a vision? Of course. But he was also a pragmatic political figure who adapted to changing circumstances.",1654041709

"ENFP","t5_2r4yi","Ohh got you, got you! Well going by the more info I'm seeing from you, my mind is now inclined to guess that you might be an INTP. Don't really have the best reasonings I'm getting except for vibes and patterns in the way you type is reminding me of how a lot INTPs communicate on here, but in classic Ne dom fashion I'm just having guesses as we move along here! Ahaha 

Actually this might help! Does the fact that I can't really articulate my reasonings bother you here at all? I feel like high Ti users really need things to make sense to them internally in a consistent in depth manner (especially XNTPs) whereas high Fi users will be fine making things make sense to themselves in a way that doesn't require in depth reasonings unless we feel like dipping into Te and explaining said reasonings. Lol 

&gt;Even when I make a decision I‚Äôll always look back wondering what would‚Äôve happened if I‚Äôd picked the other one. I‚Äôve heard Ne doms don‚Äôt experience this to the same extent, with Ne dipping into Se creating a higher level of decisiveness despite the stereotype.

I see, I see. Do you find yourself wanting to make decisions first and reflect on observations later or take a moment to observe and make considerations before making decisions? I find trying to distinguish between the rationals (IXXPs &amp; EXXJs) and irrationals (IXXJs &amp; EXXPs) can help with typing a lot. I think IXXPs after awhile will get more anxious than IXXJs if a decisive decision or conclusion is not made after conversations, where as IXXJs will get more anxious about perceived missing information they can't see/understand moreso than IXXPs who are a lot better about just having guesses (usually, but not always true).

Basically IXXJs like EXXPs like to gain understanding and much prefer to keep things open ended before reaching hard conclusions, but IXXJs tend to be more stubborn about their decisions like EXXJs; where as IXXPs like EXXJs like to have an objective to conclusions when making decisions and gain better perspectives overtime, but IXXPs tend to be a lot more flexible when it comes to planning like EXXPs. 

Maybe watching some more videos about each of the introverted types, specifically INXPs &amp; ISXJs will help narrow things down, to narrow it down further since you believe to be on Ti/Fe axis, I would start with INTP and ISFJ videos and see which out of those two make the most sense since they share the same functions but in different order stacking if you haven't done so already!",1654041709

From the article:

&gt;Use of medications or other poisons to attempt suicide or self-harm are rising among youths as young as 9, and the largest increases are among those ages 10-12. The number of kids in that age group who ingested some type of poisonous medication or other substance to attempt suicide increased by 4.5 times from 2000 to 2020, according to one of the national studies,¬†published in JAMA Pediatrics¬†in March, compared to a 2.4-fold increase among older adolescents.¬†

&gt;In general, children are sensitive to what‚Äôs happening in their environment, and a confluence of events in recent memory ‚Äî the pandemic, the opioid crisis, political unrest, climate change ‚Äî may make children feel less secure.¬†",1654041710

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","The chase scenes were lame, I think most people agree with that, it was poorly edited and very poor cinematography. The jumping over rooftops were also badly done, too slow where it really looked like the actors were on elastic ropes rather than speed and momentum, contributed to by the force. 

All in all, the biggest problems were poor editing, choreography and cinematography, particularly in action sequences. I also found it jarring that when leia was kidnapped, it didn't have any shots of her parents realising, rather it cuts to a phone call to Obi-wan. Surely a 10 to 30 second scene of her parents discovering she'd been taken would of helped with that flow. Also perhaps some reason why Ogana didn't use his abundant resources to find her and requesting Obi-wan's assistance was the only option...I'm still not exactly clear on that whole thing, something to do with secrecy I suppose.

I also don't think anything should have been said about fans being racist, especially prior to the premier. That was incredibly short sighted and set Reva up poorly. I went in not knowing about it, thought her character was a bit weak but didn't really care, but she certainly wasn't stand out. 

However it wasn't until after I heard about that statement I started to think that Disney clearly doesn't understand their own audience and perhaps they are deflecting on an objectivley bad performance they already knew about. It doesn't give me hope in an improvement in her story and believability, thats for sure.",1654041711

"AirForceRecruits","t5_2q94jn","Hello, it looks like you're asking about jobs and job selection. 

A few quick answers.

NO ONE knows how long it will take for you to get a job, your chances of getting any particular job, or anything else about the job process FOR YOU. Anecdotal experiences from others will have absolutely no impact on you or your future.

Most recruiters will not let you wait in the Delayed Entrance Program for a long time for your one perfect job. You will have to list 5 - 15 jobs that you're interested in, and will be given one of those. 

Please read the FAQ about how job selection works, it's very in-depth and will fully educate you on the process: https://pay.reddit.com/r/AirForce/wiki/bmtfaq#wiki_jobs

If you're asking about particular jobs, please look the job up on our Job Wiki, and see if there is an entry for it: http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/wiki/index you can also see if there is a CFETP for it, which will give more details on the job: https://usaf.dps.mil/:x:/t/OSD/EQAwigp0UZ9Oklt0nkjg854BoJS6MyRxQJMMiIW3ng17AA?e=Z96G2s

If you're asking for help choosing a particular job, please keep in mind that most people only know about their individual job. Recommendations that they make will be made based mostly on what they've heard about a job, unless they have it themselves. Some people will love certain jobs while others will hate it. We don't know your preferences, so do some research on the job wiki and elsewhere to learn about the job and then make the best list you can.

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","Backstory. One of our remote sites was running an old Nutanix stack that was due to be LCR‚Äôd in a few months. Well out of support. Hell I think the hardware warranty expired in like 2014 or something ridiculous. 

We had a sysadmin at that site accidentally cross our FTT threshold by rebooting a second node instead of the hung one. FTT was 1. Nutanix wouldn‚Äôt even talk to us about options to TRY to save anything (Spoiler alert: it was long gone. Datastores we‚Äôre empty by the time it came back up. )

I understand the lecture about backups and maintaining support contracts, but this wasn‚Äôt the time to talk about that. This was 11:00 on a Friday night and I‚Äôd been working since 7 that morning. They literally said to call back Monday and talk to sales to get our support contract renewed, THEN we could talk about recovery attempts. I was not exactly polite when I told the support tech on the other end of the phone how many dicks he could go suck and where to put them when he was finished. I absolutely could not wait to get that trash out of my racks and decommission the other legacy stack at the primary site. I literally threw those blades off the dock onto the back of the flatbed truck they got hauled away on. 

Speaking of backups. We had just racked a brand new backup solution (which totally kicks ass!) the day before and I hadn‚Äôt had time to get the thing configured and backing up yet ( because of troubleshooting the original failed Nutanix node) when everything went sideways. 

I spent the weekend rebuilding the entire environment on vsphere from bare metal on new hardware, got my backups configured and haven‚Äôt missed a night‚Äôs sleep since.

Food

Building Materials

This is especially great with a base in which you have excess production materials like plates, electronics, etc. I've got six counters set up throughout my base and have personally seen each of these sell - and though I haven't tested this extensively, it seems like *each* counter attracts more NPCs, which results in a multiplicative effect in terms of exposure to your shopping center.

Each NPC has a budget though, so you don't want to stock exclusively expensive items - I try to keep a balance between  cheap foods, building materials, medkits, animal skins, etc along with more expensive items like chain mail sheets, grog, and the robotic sellables like CPU units.

I find unschooling can sometimes be expensive. I only unschool science and the extras. Art this year has been learning to draw people. That wasn't expensive. I bought a couple books. Less than $100. She is learning how to forge metal. She is a natural. Her lessons are free at a local history museum. But now her and my husband want a forge in the backyard. That is going to add up. For science she usually picks a topic and we do that. Last year it was geology. We are doing earth science over the summer. There are projects and experiments that will add up over time.

We have a separate homeschool budget.

"introvert","t5_2qlr2","The person you are describing certainly doesn't sound like an introvert.

Did you self identify as such before she did? Because she might have just said it to build rapport - frankly she seems like the type.

You miss her and that's completely understandable, but this person has shown by her actions that she is not worthy of your friendship. It sounds like she used you to satisfy some her (apparently considerable) social needs during covid but now that you're back in school and there are plenty of other people around she ghosted you. If you try to hang on to something that seems to have been based on inauthenticity from the beginning it is only going to result in more disappointment and hurt.

If it is really bothering you could try talking to her one on one and confront her about her terrible behaviour. I mainly suggest this for your own peace of mind however, because I can almost guarantee she will deny everything, and maybe even add insult to injury by telling you you're being ""oversensative"" or some such. Still, sometimes actually hearing it can help with closure.

Either way this isn't someone you want in your life. She clearly doesn't really care about you or your feelings and will only take advantage of you.",1654041715

To be clear I am only putting it in where the law is in most countries. Which I think is a reasonable place, and a relevant one. The question is if one can reason about the facts pertaining to sex, not things that are unrelated to reason like memory.

&gt; But I'd argue your solution makes it worse. It makes it even easier to say ""Oh, I thought she consented. She was visibly drunk but I didn't know she was THAT drunk.""

&gt;    https://reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/wiki/format

This is what your title should look like:
&gt;    *AGE [R4R] - Description*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your title:

**1. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. Replace the first ""R"" with your gender and the second ""R"" with the gender you're looking for:** 
&gt;    Use only **M**, **F**, **T** or **A** for tagging gender. Use any combination for couples: **MF**, **FF**, etc.

**4. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject:**
&gt;    *[META] - Description*

"collapse","t5_2qhw9","Can only offer you my personal experience from Ireland, no. There never really was an ""Irish dream"", we were taught as young uns to hold family, community and nature very closely. We were told stories of old Ireland growing up with 15 kids growing up in a 2 bed house and every family member had a role be it the farmer, the teacher, the priest, the nun or the ones you send/marry off to neighbouring farms. Fair to say we've improved exponentially from what we were 50 years ago, but we never had that capitalistic ideology of make all the money and work all the hours. 

Even during out most capitalistic moment, the Celtic Tiger (1995 - 2007 when we rapidly went from one of the poorest Western nations to one of the wealthiest, GDP raised by 230% in just 2 decades), that was our most capitalistic time and although people bought cars and houses, they also spent a lot of it on holidays, family time, buying farms, relatively holistic stuff compared to the US. It did get very ugly for many people when it crashed and led to years of austerity policies but that's besides the point, if anything made us more wary of rapid economic growth, now we put more effort into valuing social and leisure time. 

The only disconnect now between the Ireland i live in as a 29 yr old and the one I was raised in is that now the church doesn't have its claws in everything, our culture has diversified and our country has been improved by the influx of multiculturalism, gays like myself have recognition and rights, women are treated like first class citizens and democracy is stronger with citizens assembly's. 

Its still very possible for anyone to live the ""Irish dream"" of owning a cottage, a homestead producing your own food, a community of neighbours who are tighter than many families, a relatively simple and peaceful life, while also still having a broadband connection to work remotely or be involved in nearby booming industry's with a protected social safety net.",1654041715

"ffxivdiscussion","t5_22ly7r","&gt; How do certain jobs perform in tournaments? Are job strengths and weaknesses remedied or further magnified in an organized/premade setting? General comments about job balance are welcomed.

I can only speak from what  I've seen with NA tournes, the EU tournes have a general lack of interest from most 'veteran' teams. Though that'll likely change come EU CC regional championships if it happens. However the EU tournes I saw were still figuring things out and running what was good in solo queue. 

NA was also about what you would expect except for Dancer. Anyone who's played a game before: OW, Smite, League, Dota knows that there's been a meta around a particular draw-in ultimated at some point and for this game it's Dancer's 4s seduce combod with a 40k Drg Shatter. (A partnered dragoon also dumps a shit ton of aoe and curing makes up a tiny bit for it's squishiness)

Sam is also a little more prevalent in NA tournes, likely because of the threat it holds when you hold chiten. You're basically gambling everytime you use your AOEs and burst a target in hopes that the Sam didn't pop it and proc Kuzushi on you, commanding a lot of respect and not a lot of wiggle room.

Many Paladins, just like feast's many iterations, co-ordinate paladins are fucking opressive to play against because your damage is always half then mitigated some, you gotta really make your team sell baits and play around (also combat pot is lol). High skill ceiling job in high skill ceiling scenarios.  

MNK is also seen a lot, again, just a very opressive job in the right hands capable of sitting and denying one person playing all game and the 3s stun in a co ordinate team should be a kill every time (as oppose to solo queue).

&gt;By the same token; with proper teamplay being the standard, how much impact does individual player skill have on a team's win rate in this environment? Or are game results deterministic based on job picks alone, assuming similar player skill?

Hard to say, generally most players are top 50 and have earned their place. I'd imagine groups are still ironing out the 'e-sports comms' and that might be delaying some plays. 

&gt; And have counterpicking strategies been developed to dismantle specific comps or jobs?

The tourne format hasn't picks/counterpicks it's joust your 5 vs their 5, lets go. So it's a gamble, however there's some stuff like Ast being picked with Samurai to get them 3 sam lbs out a game, I saw a dirty mch + nin combo to get that free 50% rolling out. 

&gt;Is there an established tournament ruleset? Job drafts, map picks and such?

Each match gets a map, whether it's C9 or volcano, not up to them. It's 5 v 5 straight in, they don't get to see the enemy and what they play until they're vs.

&gt;What other additions would be welcomed to spice up the gameplay? More abilities? More maps? Other (5v5) game modes?

I'd like to see job bans if I'm honest, or even a whole pick/bans. 

2 bans per team, no doubles, would be interesting, maybe.",1654041716

I do agree that life/the world likely doesn't have an INHERENT purpose, but life is infinitely more fulfilling when we give ourselves one or find one. It can be something as simple as wanting to be happy in life, or something as grand as improving the lives of those around us. I also am a slightly (emphasis on slightly) spiritual person, and consider myself strongly opinionated on right/wrong and doing no harm to others. So when nihilism as a concept/belief is used as an excuse for being an ass, typically by edgy wannabe ""cool"" folks (which sadly are not a negligible portion of self ascribed nihilists), then I actually can find some distaste for the concept even. But as a thing itself, nihilism isn't inherently good nor bad. Depends on the people and how they wanna interpret/portray it. When someone's whole personality is just ""look how dark I am,"" it admittedly is rather tiresome. I have struggled with mental health in the past, so surrounding myself with positive people feels always infinitely more refreshing.",1654041716

My gf got home from work, took a shower, and got into bed for a nap. When she woke up she started crying so I ran into the bedroom and she tried to cover up this huge blood stain on the sheets so I wouldn‚Äôt see but I saw. She started stressing out and crying saying she doesn‚Äôt feel like changing the sheets and she just got up to go to the bathroom and wanted to go back to sleep since she didn‚Äôt feel well. I told her I‚Äôll change the sheets for her. After I changed the sheets she got back into bed and started crying again and I told her to stop crying since the bed is fixed and she told me she was embarrassed that I saw that. I told her to relax and stop freaking out since it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. She told me to lay in bed with her to cuddle and since I didn‚Äôt try to ‚Äúmake a move‚Äù she started crying again asking me if I‚Äôm not attracted to her anymore because of what I just saw. I told her no I just knew she didn‚Äôt fell well so I didn‚Äôt initiate anything and asked her why she‚Äôs crying so much since there is literally nothing wrong and she told me to stop asking her the same question.

Peeing in the lake is great.  So teaching them is an excellent step on being free in the outdoors.  The hilarious drawback is that once you teach him to pee in the tub he‚Äôs going to be in the tub a lot.  So he might need to shower for a while after.

People talking about bleaching the bath tub are ridiculous.  Do they realize that their shit covered asshole is in the tub with them?  Are they bleaching after fecal contamination not to mention just all the regular bacteria on your body when you bathe.  Urine in general is sterile so might be the cleanest part of the bath.

Chemical systems in pools are even designed with the expectation people pee in them.  Sweat has many of the same components urea, water, salt.

I‚Äôm always amazed about how germaphopic people are whenever these threads come up.  Make sure to teach him to be in bushes too as that‚Äôs fun. And even more importantly if you have daughters teach them to pee outdoors as well as it‚Äôs a life skill that lots of people are missing.",1654041717

The moment you go on a calorie deficit your body will start to utilize different paths to gain energy. Some people will have it harder but please stop making it seem like everyone who is fat has no option. Only a very tiny % of the population will have really hard time losing weight.

"wow","t5_2qio8","Thank you for your submission nightwolf777. It has been removed from /r/wow because:

**No spoilers in titles.**

We only consider something a spoiler if it pertains to the *story* of World of Warcraft. Datamined armor appearances, game-play changes, etc. are not spoilers. If something has happened in a released trailer, or if something is directly mentioned at Blizzcon, it is not a spoiler. If something happens in an in-game cinematic, it is considered a spoiler for 2 days / 48 hours after North American release.

Additionally, the results of eSports events (Blizzcon tournaments, AWC/MDI events, etc.) are considered spoilers for 2 days / 48 hours after the event takes place. If you would like to discuss the results of these events within that time frame, please make sure that your title does not reveal the winners. For example, titling your post ""Congratulations to the winners of the Spring Global Finals!"" (rather than ""Congratulations to [Team Name]!"") is a good way to prevent spoilers. 

Dealing with spoilers is simple:

* Post titles must not contain the actual spoiler.
* If your post links to spoilers, or is a text post that has spoilers, use Reddit's spoiler system to mark it. &gt;!example of spoiler!&lt; markdown`

"JamesBond","t5_2rsg9","My favourite is Roger Moore, his particular talents suited Bond very well, his subtle mannerisms, his look, his voice. Whilst some of his films got a bit goofy at times I enjoy most of his films.

If I was to rank Bond actors solely based on acting ability i'd probably give that point to Dalton. That being said whilst I love Dalton he didn't do enough films and he wasn't as good at the one liners. He was a bit too serious at times but he was very believable and charming.

I believe Moore and Connery are the best Bonds overall, Connery is the original he's suave, masculine and deadly, whereas Moore is classier and his voice sounds more like how I would picture Bond. They both suffer from the same weakness of doing the role for too long, they're both incredibly iconic as Bond, they're both fairly close in physical appearance to sketches of Novel Bond as well.

So TLDR sort of Moore and Connery are pretty neck and neck for me I would say, Then clear cut last is George Lazenby because he was so wooden that they had to dub him.

If anyone is curious my ranking changed a bit here are the 6 actors based on how much I like them as Bond:

1. Moore
2. Connery
3. Dalton
4. Brosnan
5. Craig
6. George Lazenby",1654041719

"SelfAwarewolves","t5_3g3zk","As much as I want to agree with you, I made this mistake, too.

[According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, ""regular"" definition #5: of, relating to, or constituting the permanent standing military force of a state](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/regular)

While this is a mostly archaic definition for laypeople...it WAS in common usage when the constitution &amp; the bill of rights was written...and is still commonly used in certain contexts.

The Founding Fathers were referring to the people in each ""official"" state run military...what we now call the ""National Guard"".

If we're being honest, the wording of the 2nd Amendment could be updated to more modern &amp; common verbiage:

""The ownership of firearms &amp; artillery; being required to supply a well organized State sponsored militia; the right to safely &amp; responsibly use such weaponry cannot be affected by federal legislation, alone.""

But, even something like that, sounds awfully convoluted and could STILL fall victim to major miscommunication!

That's kinda what happened in December of 1991...except that the ""miscommunication"" was more ""intentionally &amp; completely redefining key words of the 2nd Amendment to completely change the meaning of the sentence for political expediency"".

It was a campaign intended to remake gun *cult*ure in the US...to sell more firearms &amp; to ""sell"" less safety/responsibility.

(Edited: before getting all weird about what I'm saying &amp; trying to ""but actually"" me... because I did that already with the person who first informed me about *MY* same mistake...it forced me to learn so much more about the legal definition, and I wasn't sorry I did.)

P.S. I am absolutely FOR common sense firearms legislation. I am also the same person who responded to this comment thread's author with the Seth Meyers video discussing how, when, &amp; why the gun crazies stole the plot.",1654041720

No, I think you're gambling that's all someone wants.

I'm glad you think meth head Jimmy and crack head Darrel are more deserving of your trust and time though. That's a really weird train of thought to have.

it's not doctor, lawyers, and scholars comitting these crimes, it's junkies, thieves, and just down right rotten people society would be better without.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","First‚Äîyou should be really really proud of the progress you‚Äôve made so far! It‚Äôs normal not to see a significant change in your stomach that‚Äôs for a lot of people that is the last place you lose fat. I think you should also be really proud of the fact that you recognize that you were feeling burnt out and tired and instead of pushing yourself to continue in a deficit that was causing a lot of stress, you gave yourself a maintenance break. Learning to listen to your body is really important part of a health and fitness journey, so don‚Äôt forget to give yourself kudos for that. 

As far as eating at a really low amount, it‚Äôs not really true that you have to do that for the rest of your life just because you‚Äôre short. I am 4‚Äò11‚Äú tall, and my total daily energy expenditure is between 2000-2200 cal even though I have a desk job. I focused on building my lean muscle mass to increase my metabolism, and I incorporate as much movement throughout the day as possible. I lift every morning before work and I do a lot of yoga and go for walks as well. I always take the stairs, I park in the back of the parking lot at the store, every time my watch tells me to get up and move around once an hour, I do. When I‚Äôm hanging out with friends, I try to pick activities like hiking. That doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt have days where I just lay in bed, I do, but if you strength train in order to build your lean muscle mass and you maintain a relatively active lifestyle, you‚Äôre not doomed to low-calorie amount forever!

Also, don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out for additional support if you need it. If you have the ability to work with a dietitian who can take some of the strain off of calorie counting, don‚Äôt be afraid to try it! If you‚Äôre still really struggling with body image, you can always see your mental health support as well.",1654041721

"TwoXADHD","t5_38hf9","My tips:

* Flossing is more important than brushing
* The mechanical action of brushing is more important than toothpaste - **you can brush dry!!! You don't actually have to go into the bathroom!!!** This was a big game-changer to me.
* Mouthwash is not very important at all unless you have been given a special type or special instructions by a professional.
* Toothpaste type doesn't matter - stannous flouride toothpaste is a little better
* Think of your mouth in quadrants to get each part of it. [Just look at the crosshair](https://corinnadental.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Explaining_Teeth_Numbers_.png) and then realize each part of the crosshair also has an inside/outside. Top: top left outside, top right outside, top right inside, top right inside. Bottom: bottom left outside, bottom right outside, bottom left inside, bottom right inside. 
* Ask your dentist to actually illustrate for you in-office how you should be brushing. They will break out a fresh brush, have you show them your current technique, then critique and correct the technique.",1654041722

"HellLetLoose","t5_3ejz4","okay, I agree with everything you said here and yes steamroll is boring. But there are reasons why players like myself sometimes are guilty of picking the more experienced side.

idk if you've been in a match where the the commander put down one garrison at the start and dropping supplies all over the map, ask nearby SL to build them, \*no reply\*. Repeatedly ask for 5 minutes, \*no reply\* (unless they mute the commander on purpose or something, there is no way they didn't hear the call). I, as a solo SL, tried to drop garrison all over the map but they got taken out pretty quickly, only two guys were on arty so their recon have plenty of time playing with me. (dealing with enemy recon is actually the only highlight in that entire game for me).

Game continues, 30 minutes in, the only two garrison exists on the map are the one I put down. Two full squads think defense is sitting inside the black circle and waiting for enemy to come to them. Supplies was literally 20m away, no one bother put down another garrison for defense.

All that happened not because the enemy recons are good, but because literally no one on our team but myself is putting down garrisons. I tried to tell them in command chat, one SL complained of no support player once, and the others \*no replies whatsoever\*. I accept the L for that game and join the other side in the next one. I won't say it's a steamroll but let's just say it didn't make me want to delete the game.

and yes, I know this doesn't exactly justify my action, but I play games for fun, not for depression.

edit: oh and the saddest part of all, we actually have pretty decent tank crews. They had a lot of fun and cleared a lot of space, it's just the infantry SL not doing any shit at all.",1654041722

Yeah, you would get shot if you even proposed such an idiotic idea in front of such a loving and caring person as Putin.

""Ni Hao Winnie, please don't send me off to some random war, I fully agree with the regime, but I don't want to die."" You would get killed right then and there.

Men defend their home countries fighting for what they believe is right, or they're forced to defend it. They have no control over the creation of war. Men mostly haven't even been the ones creating war. It's actually the Queens that did most of the wars throughout history believe it or not. *Fun fact, That's a possible reason it's the Queen in chess being powerful and not the King, as when the game evolved from Chaturanga, which had a Minister and not a Queen, which could only move one square diagonally at a time, the Minister was replaced with a Queen and the Queen became the most powerful piece as Queens historically waged the wars.*

Us men don't want to fight wars. Half of the 0.0001% at the top of the pyramid want the wars.

"WarhammerCompetitive","t5_3mrre","&gt; Charging is the same as Always Fights first?
If you Charge into fight last, you therefore fight normal? (alternating with other non-charged units starting with opponent.)
(this is what GW, goonhammer, and others all say.)

These are two effects that apparently different TO's run differently. 

&gt; Can you slow roll the entire hit-wound-save-damage, next hit-w-s-d sequence if the weapon profile may change based on remaining models left? (I run nids hive fleet hydra, so that's actually something I run into)

Some people take issue with this. 

As for armies, asking too much will usually overwhelm you with information. Ask pointed questions that may interfere with your army. 

If you're playing a shooting army, forward / redepoly is important. If you're playing a melee army I don't even ask. Either way i'm sprinting at you. Fight last matters more here so I ask that. 

If your opponent and you use battlescribe, you can use the summery function to see all their units move speed / toughness / psyker powers very quick. Wouldn't do that in a tournament, but for a friendly game both can gain a lot of knowledge that way. 

A good player will trade information of their armies general goal and strategy, then it's just a game of adaptation against each other, not a game of who knows the most.",1654041724

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","Have you considered... splitting the party?

Lol I mean to run TWO groups of 5 or 6 instead of one giant group?

Thing of it like this: Your player's arent ""a giant party of adventurers"" instead, they're a ""clan"" or ""guild"". Maybe they have 1 or more leaders, or maybe none.

Picture this: the clan/guild gets together to look over the available quests on the notice board.  
Maybe this week they're just a bunch of little, unrelated quests. These unrelated quests could be one-shots, OR they could have some hidden connection they will one day realize.

&gt;ie. Quest A is ""dangerous beasts have suddenly migrated by the town's forest!"" and Quest B is ""the town's children have been disappearing, and there have been sightings of goblins!""  
the hidden connection could be ""a Goblin King has been crowned and is amassing an army. The influx of goblinoids has caused the wild beasts to flee into human lands, and the children were kidnapped for a foul ritual to power up the goblin army.

OR they could tackle one BIG quest ""together"", but tackle is separately, and each groups actions contribute to the final victory.

&gt; ie. Party A deals with infiltrating the Goblin King's lair and must defeat him, and Party B must fortify and defend the town/city from the goblin army.  
\*To make them interdependent, you can have some shamans in the Goblin Lair that are aiding the army(maybe they are each control a platoon of monsters that go crazy when the shaman dies or something?).  
\*For the army, perhaps they have casters that are absorbing the sorrow/souls/blood of people in order to fuel the Goblin King, and defeating them gets rid of some of his powers/buffs?

I just think If we start taking things very personally because of someone else's idea of what's acceptable most likely because of how they were raised and who their family is and what age they are, we risk being angry and uber sensitive about everything and then it causes us to be negative and upset over something that could be handled with a simple ""I'm not comfortable answering that"" and moving on. I just like being a positive person and thinking the best of everyone though, and I notice I smile a lot more and get less stressed about the small things than my pessimistic husband lol.

Or was just extra wheelchairs and walkers that were also at the encampment?

Oh, did you state what you just posted on your twitter?  Of course not.

Did you state it in your post here?  Nope, not until confronted.

You only posted:  ""The Police once again throwing away elderly homeless' walkers again.""  NOTHING else on this thread originally.

That's EXACTLY the same as what you just posted in your reply, right? /s

You didn't OMIT anything, right? /s

Yeah, the city workers should have taken some more care, but why were important papers left in the encampment and not taken with them when they left for the day?

Did the people in the encampment get prior notice that it was going to cleared out?   Were there any social workers that went to encampment prior to the clearing out to try to help relocate people voluntarily?  If the answer to these two questions were ""no"", then yeah, it was cruel.  But I bet you that the answer to both questions was ""yes"".

Edit: I don't think that this is the most ""humane"" way to handle the issue, but we don't live in a perfect world.  Sure some people fall through the cracks, but there's just not enough money allocated to solve the problem humanely and even if there were, not all of your ""clients"" would accept the aid and be able to permanently keep themselves out of such encampments.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt; trying something new

Three evolutionary line fire starter, water starter, and grass starter. Buddy rival. Tree Professor. Two-story house, game system, PC, Mom, no Dad. Early Pokemon, three evolutionary line boring bird, two evolutionary line boring rat, small bug that evolves quickly but is basically garbage by level 25. There's some kind of Pikachu knock-off yellow rat out there.

Why? Why are we being precious about those things? Why are those typings and Pokemon sacred to Gamefreak?

The new starters are psychic, steel, and fairy. And bug. Make it four starters. Or no starters. Here's a Pokeball, go catch something. Why not? The first Pokemon you encounter aren't a bird and a rat. There's a poison/fighting monkey and a fire armadillo. Wow, those are weird. I'm actually interested instead of knowing exactly which trash Pokemon I'm going to run into and never use because they're trash.

A lot of the things that are tradition are totally pointless. They only serve to make the game boring. Have I seen the new route 1 rat and bird? No. But I know they exist. I know they fully evolve early and aren't very useful. Everyone is going to catch one, evolve it, and shove it in a box before level 35. 

Gamefreak hasn't announced those Pokemon but we all know they exist and exactly what they're like. Is anyone excited about that? Can't wait to see what the crappy bird is this time!? What rat or ferret or weasel am I going to get, evolve at level 15, and box at level 22? No. But they keep doing it every single time. 

Do literally anything different. These traditions only serve to make the games boring and predictable. It smacks of laziness. If I walk onto route 1 and see a normal-type rat, I'm bored. I've never seen him before but it's this guy again. If I walk onto route 1 and see an ice-type raccoon or a dark/grass flower, I am intrigued.",1654041729

"psychology","t5_2qhcz","For off, I am so sorry that whoever dxed you missed the signs of bipolar depression. Treating BiPD with antidepressants has been shown at least to not help, and at worst worsen manic episodes. 

If a Primary Care FM, Peds or IM prescribes basic antidepressants that‚Äôs fine. I know that FM and Peds both do rotations In psychiatry during residency. I think most of them know their limits and will refer out if necessary. Often times the wait to see a decent psychiatrist is very long and some people may need those medications now. As for NPs I agree. PMHNPs, the supposed psych ‚Äúexperts‚Äù of the NPs can be horrid. The medication cocktails and mismanagement is horrid. I‚Äôve seen medication lists a page long for like 5 mg here and 5mg there and then obviously don‚Äôt forget to throw in antipsychotics, benzos, and narcotics for the 15 year old with mild depression. They receive a measly 500 hours of psych training it‚Äôs horrible. (That‚Äôs 3.5 months at 40 hours a week compared to a psychiatrists 4 years at 80) 

However, I will have to disagree with you on the adolescent point. I think we don‚Äôt need to he throwing Aderal at kids when better options like play therapy (esp young kids) and CBT exist. In the ideal world therapy would he first. However, a lot of teens do benefit tremendously from antidepressants used correctly. It‚Äôs been proven that MANY psychiatric disorders start in childhood. That‚Äôs why the child and Adolescent Psych fellowship was created. It is the longest of all psych fellowships because you learn how to treat kids, because kids bodies and brains aren‚Äôt just tiny adult bodies and brains. As a teen I personally, I went to therapy every week for 2-3 months. I tried HARD but I needed extra help. Originally I was against medication. I didn‚Äôt want it. But I decided to give it a try and I‚Äôm so glad i did because it leveled me out to and took away many of the symptoms (oh not wanting to kill myself and cry all the time was such a breath of fresh air) and allowed me to learn coping mechanisms and re drawn my negative thought patterns in therapy.

"Coronavirus","t5_2x4yx","It starts much earlier. First, Google and TikTok and Facebook have quietly built profiles on a person. [Here‚Äôs a link to the Google version of what they publicly think your interests are.](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated) In my case, it knows that I have interests in travel, architecture, cycling, American football, and fitness, among others. But it has some hilarious misses too - I‚Äôm very determined to live a car free life, but it has BMW, car rentals, and camper vans on my profile, and also babies and toddlers are there despite being a single male who isn‚Äôt likely to father anyone anytime soon. But no matter how flawed the profile that Google and TikTok and Facebook create might be, they leverage it to try to send you more stuff to keep your interest. So if you like videos of cats being cute, they‚Äôll send you more of that, but also try to throw some dogs and otters and baby elephants and such at you, trying to broaden the pool of what you watch. 

Part of how it broadens that pool is by looking at what people with similar interests, or in a similar area, or similar demographic, etc, are looking at. So you start out looking at something totally innocent like a golden retriever with an American flag bandana being reunited with his veteran owner, set to Christian rock, and then it slowly and algorithmically progresses towards space lasers and pizza parlours.",1654041731

Dem Kauf- oder Verkaufsgesuch des Traders wird ein entsprechendes Angebot gegen√ºbergestellt, bei Zustimmung beider Parteien findet die Transaktion statt.

sprich findest Du jemanden der bereit ist deine gro√üe Menge an Optionsschein von Dir direkt zu kaufen, geht der Deal durch. 

Je gr√∂√üer die Positionen in den falschen M√§rkten z.B. Aktien desto schwieriger k√∂nnte der Verkauf werden. 

OTC l√§sst sich auch Vor Xetra Er√∂ffnung und noch lange danach handeln. Selbst am Wochenende ist OTC Handel m√∂glich.

Die Randzeiten, in denen au√üerb√∂rslicher Handel get√§tigt wird, bergen aber ordentlich Potenzial f√ºr Risiken.

Die Liquidit√§t ist deutlich geringer, die Kurse richten sich also nach einer gedrosselten Nachfrage. Hinzugezogen werden Trends globaler Handelspl√§tze und Nachrichten. Die Ums√§tze sind eher gering, daher k√∂nnen Trader Kursentwicklungen nicht zuverl√§ssig erkennen. 

Denn ohne Umsatz ist keine technische Analyse m√∂glich. 

Hintergrundinformationen zum gew√ºnschten Finanzprodukt und den M√§rkten sind im au√üerb√∂rslichen Handel NOCH wichtiger als beim B√∂rsenhandel, damit w√§hrend der Randzeiten lohnende Transaktionen zustande kommen.

"E30","t5_2sfyt","I wouldn't recommend dailying an E30 or any classic for that matter unless you have deep pockets, work remotely, can wait on parts, and are mechanically inclined. E30s were only intended to be used as daily transportation from the mid 80s to around the late 2000s, by which point parts started going NLA. These cars are ancient now and parts support is not what it used to be; if anything brakes, you'll have to wait days, weeks, or in some cases even months for parts to arrive. Some parts are also NLA. Also remember that in a daily you need crap like AC, power steering, heat, ABS, airbags, etc. These systems all add to the cost/complexity of the car and wear/leak/break down over time. The engine you can justify wearing out as the exhaust note and valve clatter are sensational noises to enthusiasts. These days you'll have a happier time using an E30 as weekend transportation where you enjoy the noises the engines make and the suspension. My recommendation is to keep the Kia and get an E30 as an weekend car.",1654041732

The next article you sent points out that flimsy fabric masks provide the least amount of covid transmission protection, because of course they do.

2. The Little Mermaid - Live action remake of one of the last big Disney Animated films. Aladdin made over $1B, BatB made almost $1.3B, and TLK made $1.66B.

3. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning - Part 1 - A month ago, I wouldn‚Äôt have it here, but the Tom Cruise hype is real, and I can imagine that Top Gun 2 is gonna help drive people to this next movie.

4. The Marvels - Sequel to a popular $1B film, although it might not do as well due to it not being before a major Avengers film.

5. Indiana Jones 5 - The sequel that had a mixed reception grossed $800M in 2008. A well received one could gross over $1B.

"GunAccessoriesForSale","t5_h4uwp","Paypal offers two different services.  Paypal Friends and Family (F&amp;F) has zero fees, but offer no protections and makes the buyer vulnerable to scammers.  Paypal Goods and Services (G&amp;S) charges an additional ~3% of the item price (actually 3.49% and $0.49 as of 2021), but provides the buyer insurance in case the seller dissapears without providing the item.  Paypal does prohibit [some specific items](https://web.archive.org/web/20180409201310/https://www.paypal.com/us/selfhelp/article/what-is-paypal%E2%80%99s-policy-on-transactions-that-involve-firearms-faq585) but has a ""catch all comment"" that may apply to others, so NO NOTES IN PAYPAL. As a general guideline, if a buyer wants to use Paypal G&amp;S rather than F&amp;F with an **established GAFS member**, it is expected that they will absorb the +3% fee for the increased protections that it provides them. [Here is a easy fee calculator](https://thefeecalculator.com/). If a seller specifies a F&amp;F price, assume that is his ""to his pocket"" cost. However these terms are up for negotiation between the buyer and seller. It is recommended to pay via G&amp;S and absorb the fee. If the seller mandates F&amp;F, be wary of a scam and use a [Scam prevention method](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy).  Additionally, Paypal has deleted the account of several members due to using F&amp;F for purchases.  Paypal considers this theft from them (you're stealing their fees), and a violation of their [ToS](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full). DO NOT put notes in F&amp;F payments as it is evidence you may be violating PP ToS.

I care about the possibility that I drop my twins off at school one day and someone storms their school with the ability to empty a clip into an elementary class room full of students, drop it, reload and move on to the next room. 

I have a feeling neither of us want that. 

I'm so scared for the life of my children, I cannot imagine how a toy could mean more than their lives. I mean, you do not need an ak 47 to defend yourself. But what do my children have to defend themselves? The sheet of Kevlar they have in their backpacks at 2 years old? Learning how to play dead in active shooter drills? 

Is your ""right"" to carry an assult rifle more important than my child's right to grow up, go to high school or college, fall in love and get married, have children of their own? 

Whatever your answer, I don't believe you really think a child's life is worth your right to purchase a gun that has killed the most elementary aged students in this country.

What this does is break up the neurological connection between the ""trigger"" and the ""response"". That's it, and to a degree, that's all you actually need.

It seemed like the milk was still cold so I would put the remainder in the fridge for her to have later. I also just kind of assumed it was ok to reuse since the back of formula says you need to reuse the bottle that was made within 24 hours once refrigerated so my brain thought well why would you even refrigerate it if it wasn‚Äôt leftover milk that baby didn‚Äôt finish?

"eczema","t5_2rqqs","I recently discovered that L-Lysine 1000mg supplement that I started taking every morning 30min before breakfast has cleared up my pretty bad eczema on my face which I‚Äôm really happy about. My body eczema is not that bad now (25F) but my face and neck eczema has been in a bad cycle no matter what I tried. So definitely worth the try! It‚Äôs really cheap! I bought it online. Maybe try it with 3000mg per day (morning, during the day and at night 1000mg each time) so you can see if it helps your skin. You can do your own research on Lysine of course but if I may summarize: it supports your healthy immune system, collagen synthesis etc. I honestly just had small hope that it might help improve my eczema but I am pleasantly surprised that after a few days of taking it, I don‚Äôt have active eczema anymore on my face and neck. 

Just a bit of background about me: I had eczema since 6 years old and due to doctor‚Äôs worst instructions to put steroid cream until it stopped working, I really had bad eczema until 8 years old. Needed to wear gloves, blood on sheets etc. (I was lucky I was the kind of kid who really didn‚Äôt care about my appearance or what stupid mean people would say to me lol) I moved abroad at 8 and surprisingly, my skin healed and had normal skin like everyone else. But whenever I start living in my home country which is Japan, my eczema gets bad. I honestly think I‚Äôm allergic to something in the air here. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm thinking to settle abroad in the near future.

I think it‚Äôs worth the try since it‚Äôs cheap and let me know if it works for you :)",1654041734

Ask me about the time they spent like 200 years remaking the same statue.) and who has a life long fondness for classical and Renaissance history. Do NOT consider or cite me as a reliable source. 

Well it‚Äôs not as open and shut of a case as you might think. This attitude, like most of what happened in the Renaissance, was not unique to Michelangelo and derived from a rediscovery and celebration of the art and philosophy of classical Greece and Rome. Now it is true that Rome and Greece were gayer than a basket of extremely gay frogs (tho they were super weird about it in a lot of regionally specific ways) but the ‚ÄúI love men‚Äôs bodies‚Äù attitude had as much to do with a radical celebration of hyper masculinity (read EXTREME sexism) as it did actual love of dudes fuckin dudes. In fact it was probably more so. When Renaissance thinkers rediscovered classical ideals and artistic technique there was not always a lot of  critical thought given to WHY the Romans sculpted so many hot buff guys. Sorta a ‚Äúthe Romans did it so it must be superior‚Äù mentality. 

In addition, the high Renaissance was when artists got REALLY into the study of human anatomy and the emphasizing muscularity allowed artists to show off that they new where muscles go. However, bc 16th century Italy wasn‚Äôt super big on female empowerment, there weren‚Äôt a lot of jacked ladies to model for aspiring young ninja turtles. Just slapping tits and a wig on some random jacked dude was a way to get around that without fundamentally changing entrenched gender roles. 

That isn‚Äôt to say he COULDNT have been gay. There are a lot of people who think a lot of the famous Renaissance artists were scoring own goals from time to time. I‚Äôm more familiar with the theory of DiVinci being gay than Michelangelo but we are running up against the limits of my expertise off the dome. I‚Äôm sure SOMEBODY has some pretty good reasons why the think he was gay. 

TL;DR: yeah, it sounds p gay and he might have been but there are sound explanations for why he had this mindset that have far more to do with the dominant social and artistic zeitgeist of the high Renaissance than his sexuality.",1654041735

My speculation earlier was that one or two of the export variants SU-57Es possibly made their way outside of Russia to potential purchasers (India or others) as demo units for a short time. And if so, there‚Äôs a non zero chance somebody connected with Cruise‚Äôs production company (perhaps through a non American intermediary) was able to either obtain preexisting footage of the demo, or somehow cut a deal with the OTHER nation with access to the demo unit to allow them to get record some footage of the thing themselves while it was being put through it‚Äôs paces. 

-	That said, [there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a huge media embargo on the thing ](https://youtu.be/ctioYUO5flw). That link has over 6M views &amp; seems to be from a widely attended air show.

"piano","t5_2qnw8","I was in a similar position a few years ago and received (what I feel) was some great advice.

Don't worry about learning music theory just yet. Start learning to play an instrument. Learn to play some songs. Figuring out how to play is a lot of fun and by doing so you will immediately begin implementing little bits of theory (chords, keys, intervals, etc).  The benefit here is that any theory you learn will be applied directly into the music.

I started a few years ago trying to learn keyboard/piano so that I could produce more interesting electronic music. Now I can play some chopin. I never realized I'd have as much fun just playing piano.

If you are looking for some reference material, I found the book [Music Theory for Electronic Musicians](https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Computer-Musicians-Michael-Hewitt/dp/1598635034/ref=asc_df_1598635034/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=312138007830&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=14153798329986679069&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=m&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9003734&amp;hvtargid=pla-406163958953&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=&amp;ref=&amp;adgrpid=60258871097&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvadid=312138007830&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=14153798329986679069&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=m&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9003734&amp;hvtargid=pla-406163958953)

I (8H Gem Sun) have been friends with this person (2H Sag Sun) for a little while, and as I‚Äôve gotten to know them I‚Äôve realized that our lives are almost ironically the same. Both of our birth times are accurate, and we were born a year and a half apart. Neither of us are used to being able to talk from our authentic selves, and we share the same desire to talk about the fucked up parts of life. (scorpio risings, my 8th house sun, their 8th house Jupiter, their pluto conjunct sun, our 12th house mars‚Äôs‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs been hard for either of us to find people who can naturally handle our energies)

The major similarities start with the conjunct ascendants, more conjunctions in the 4th house, same sign and house of saturn, and same sign and house of mars. Their north node points towards my mercury, and my north node is conjunct their MC. 

I would love to know how to determine what kind of role this person would serve in my life. 

Partnerships? Career? Twin flames? I‚Äôve been studying astrology for several years now but I‚Äôve never come across this many conjunctions in a synastry chart‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm interested to hear anyone‚Äôs thoughts!

"gallifrey","t5_2tf29","Am I (and the others in this thread) overlooking subtext, or are you maybe just projecting your own reading onto the story and treating it as a definite intention of the author? Your answer for why Tecteun would pick the name ‚ÄúDoctor,‚Äù of all things, when that name doesn‚Äôt really have anything to do with what the Timeless Child did (i.e. fall off a cliff and then sit there and be experimented on) is literally just ‚Äúshe picked an illogical name because she‚Äôs an illogical sociopath,‚Äù which is, well‚Ä¶ not very compelling as evidence. It‚Äôs a cop-out. The phrase ‚Äúmy little Doctor‚Äù is spoken *nowhere* in the script; it‚Äôs something you‚Äôve invented whole-cloth just to exemplify your theory.

I could just as easily push my own inference about ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù being the Timeless Child‚Äôd Division-era codename and say it‚Äôs backed up by the ‚Äúsubtext‚Äù that Division are a group that ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù history to their liking (as in doctoring footage or files), and how the first Series 12 story had a whole thing about spies using codenames, but that still wouldn‚Äôt make it true. It‚Äôs still just a theory based on my own reading of the text, as is yours. (Although I‚Äôd at least be providing actual context for why the name ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù was chosen.)

As for the wife thing, see, that‚Äôs actually something where what you‚Äôve suggested has a clear throughline. We know that the Doctor has had multiple wives, and the Doctor doesn‚Äôt specify which one she‚Äôs referring to in *Legend of the Sea Devils*, so it‚Äôs plausible that it could be Mrs. Who #1. (Admittedly, I do still think it‚Äôs meant to be River, if only because that‚Äôs what most of the audience is probably going to immediately assume, but I would actually say the notion of it being Mrs. Who #1 *isn‚Äôt* much of a leap, unlike what you‚Äôre suggesting about the ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù name.)",1654041736

The main reason China is still totalitarian is because they embraced socialism.

South Korea and Taiwan chose a more capitalist model early on and eventually moved toward democracy. Open markets generally lead to more open forms of government over time.

China chose to only partially embrace capitalism, and only when it was nearly too late. Thus they are stuck as a ‚Äúmixed‚Äù economy. SOEs employ more workers, but private firms contribute more to GDP.",1654041736

Can you go more into detail as to the condition of the film and contents?  A quick search for Dog Gone 8mm turned up cartoons and [this](https://youtu.be/bg0wA3ReZm4), if it's anything like that don't worry, it's not rare.

Basically, I don't have a problem with them. Being polite rather than suspicious is ways a good start.

Just wanted to point out that a very small amount of people with bad experiences can make the issue seem much more widespread than it is. 

As far as oil consumption there's no where to find actual figures but Id bet its way way less than 1% of the engines they produced.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt; You could've said the same about AutoBattlers or CSGO.

And yet i don't see many people talking about CSGO really, i'm aware it still gets players but its past its prime, it peaked back in april 2020 when covid lockdowns happened, its now dropped around 500k from its peak playercount since then

TFT is the current popular one in that genre, but mostly on account of that genre not really getting any new blood anymore, people jumped off it after the hypetrain died

As for valorant, they don't seem to make the player numbers public but the first google result seems to imply its only around 1.5 million, which is nothing to sniff at if accurate, however i don't really see anyone talking about it and i follow a bunch of gaming channels on youtube

&gt; Riot has insane amount of resources and an already established IP that will draw in a LOT of players.

IP means nothing if the gameplay is generic, which when it comes to MMO's generally will be, FFXIV is the most popular MMO currently but thats on the strength of its story, leagues story isn't going to be that amazing when told through an MMO given you'll have to focus on the current ""timezone"" the game is set in, things like Arcane worked because they told a story through a longer period, everything is already established and you're not going to get any real major story developments as the MMO would need to maintain continuity with the games universe

So at best you get a few pretty areas to walk around with potentially a few raids/dungeons themed against yeeting some void monsters that will ultimately only really be worth looking at once

Especially given riots current PvE track record",1654041738

"DigitalArt","t5_2rwal","Mmm, that's actually a very good question.

I guess it also depends what you define as a sketch. For me a sketch is a very simple drawing like this, even if it's aesthetic and very good, it's a simple drawing with simple linework and if it's colored then it's done with simple cel-shading. For other artists a sketch might mean the process of idly making chicken scratches during a spare moment, for others it might mean a rough prototype of a picture that never made it to the final stages of production. I can see other people in this thread have their own ideas and they're all valid, in my opinion. ""Sketch"" is never a pejorative term, though.

So I can imagine what this style would look like if you took it to its extreme conclusion and I think I would still describe it as a sketch. It's the kind of style that you'd use when prototyping or exploring a new character. Say you need 20 different poses/views of this character to send it as reference to someone else to develop further, this is the style I would use. They're all finished drawings, but they're also sketches that are simple because they don't need to be complicated. They convey exactly what they're required to convey and no more than that.

Manga style lends itself by nature very well to sketching but people do push them further, most pictures e.g. on Konachan I would say aren't sketches.",1654041736

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","On #1, if the recipe is for volume measurements then make it bigger with volume measurements. It calls for 1/3 of a cup of flour, so 25% bigger is going to be 1/12. You probably don't have that size cup, so I would just take your 1/4 cup and fill it 1/3 of the way (which would give you about 1/12 of a cup). You could also fill your 1/3 cup 1/4 of the way, of course. Don't stress out about eyeballing the measuring cup part way, it'll be fine. You'll probably be off by a bit but it's not going to be a huge deal.

In general, measuring by weight is fine if you want to do it, but it's definitely not necessary. Volume can fluctuate some depending on if you pack the flour down or what have you, but that variance is simply not enough to matter for everyday baking purposes.",1654041739

"reiki","t5_2r0lt","Those seem reasonable. I am asking because I have recently become a Reiki Master (about 20 hours of training so far).

She is self taught, so I don't think it's really Reiki but her own form of energy work.

You appear to believe it should be allowed to force people to do something they judge is not good for them. I disagree with that.

Cool, I won't try to convince the person who doesn't think cheating on your wife is crappy that the other marriage was unfit.  but the show had been giving us hints of cracks pointing to this for years and years. Let me remind you of the lies they both told on baby Jack's first Thanksgiving. 

If he wanted Thanksgiving, he should have at the very least mentioned it. Same for Madison. Kate doesn't owe anyone a side or heads up here.

"TrollXChromosomes","t5_2sekm","Ordinarily I‚Äôd really agree with you, and those things are major reasons I initially was ready to write Depp off as a unilaterally abusive man. But with the court case being publicised, I feel like I‚Äôve seen plenty of raw footage from the courtroom to sway my opinion the other way - I think Depp likely was a shitty partner with abusive traits, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs accurate for Amber Heard to represent herself entirely as a victim, from what I‚Äôve been able to see. I feel that I‚Äôve been convinced, by the court case footage, that Amber was a partner with abusive tendencies rivalling depp‚Äôs

Edit: Forgot to mention - outside the context of their relationship, Depp has definitely been a negative force causing/enabling harmful situations, I fully agree that there‚Äôs evidence of that, and I‚Äôm not even really trying to absolve the man of anyone‚Äôs judgement. It seems clear that he has been a shitty person in many ways. My one and only reservation is that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily true he was the sole force of abuse in the relationship, I am leaning towards believing they both caused significant issues for each other",1654041740

GMLRS, for their size are accurate, outrange any system the Russians have, and pack a pretty hard punch. You can also launch 6 in a volley rather than 1 ATACMS.

Also, for you to ""observe"" me. Is that what you do when you see a comment that doesn't agree with you? Do you do that to every comment out there that is against you? I just find it weird.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","1. As a women with 38DD, YES, more often than i‚Äôd like to admit, i sometimes forget they are there and they will get in my way often, they make laying down difficult as well as buying shirts that actually fit me 
2. As someone who has always made the first move with all the guys i‚Äôve liked, i cannot really help here, but it could be the rom-com stereotype getting into our heads? 
3. Women know that Dropping hints is easy and doesn‚Äôt come with commitment, I am talking about before a relationship, DURING a relationship, i‚Äôve come to find when i‚Äôm ‚Äúdropping hints‚Äù it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt feel fully comfortable speaking my true/ full opinion. Now if that‚Äôs because she‚Äôs scared of your reaction or something else, i cannot answer, i know with my ex i was always scared of how he‚Äôd react, and that led me to realize i didn‚Äôt fully trust him with my emotions.",1654041741

"socialwork","t5_2rgfg","Yes I‚Äôm familiar with the above as I‚Äôm obese, have BED and have read most of the materials you mentioned. I don‚Äôt specifically mean social workers putting people on diets, nothing of the sort. But it would be helpful to have a therapeutic space to explore these issues and how they connect to eating habits. It would have saved me many years of sadness if anyone had connected the dots for me decades earlier and I‚Äôve considered offering these services to others in my position. I had cancer misdiagnosed due to my weight so I‚Äôm very familiar with weight stigma in healthcare. 

If we‚Äôre talking about the level of obesity I mentioned where someone cannot walk, wash or dress themselves then weight loss is going to be a net positive for their health. It‚Äôs socially isolating, it impacts finances, it limits the amount they can access health services, it stops them from being independent. And these clients are not going to be helped by people going ‚Äúcount your calories fatty‚Äù which is why I feel social workers are well placed to work with this difficult to engage population. Body neutrality would be helpful for these folks so they can have a life. That doesn‚Äôt mean they have to be thin or close to it.",1654041741

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","YTA. Now that the kids are older it's time for you to find a way where he can go back to work.   Your first child is in school all day, and there's no reason why he can't start consulting or doing something where one of you works from home part of the week to be able to be flexible to be there when the kids get home from school or something.

Men and women are different into most men, their occupation is very strongly tied to their identity.  It's time to let him do something and negotiate in your new role that you will have time for the kids a little more.

As you climb up, you can call more of your own shots as far as accommodations you need

In the new town your husband will know nobody and it will be harder for him to get work based on his networking and old contacts. 

Resources are much stronger for staying home moms if the role was reversed and you were moving to a new place and you were going to be a stay-at-home mom. There are Mom groups, coworking spaces that are geared towards moms with small kids, and the dads are the odd ones out.

Even if he has a field where I can do part-time consulting or something he should be able to do it now.",1654041741

My wife had a pretty severe stroke several years ago, and this is something I have been wondering about, if it would be beneficial for her recovery. Would love to know if there are any studies published related to this. I have been experimenting with microdosing myself and have noted some definite positive changes in my mood and just perception. I have been hesitant to start dosing my wife though, since she is on a handful of prescriptions for pain and mood, and I have read that psilocybin can interact with some SSRIs. Not sure what meds you are taking, but this might be something else to discuss with your doctor.

As u/jackmolay shared earlier, NH's HB 1431 would [force public school employees to police and report gender norms](https://medium.com/prismnpen/dont-say-gay-2-0-is-here-already-and-it-s-all-about-hate-d99faf83d427) to parents and make New Hampshire only the second state after Alabama to do so. Notably, the Alabama provision was not among the provisions [blocked by federal court](https://casetext.com/case/eknes-tucker-v-marshall) and remains in effect, and this provision [was dropped from the FL law](https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/diversity-inclusion/595384-amendment-in-florida-bill-to-out-students-is/) after public outcry.

It's worth noting that New Hampshire \*already\* passed a law severely restricting public school employees' ability to teach so-called 'divisive concepts.'

"sugarlifestyleforum","t5_320gp","Most definitely. This is exactly how I got turned  out onto this lifestyle. I was about your age, recently seperated and starting the divorce process. It was a Saturday night, it was the first weekend I wasn't with my kids and didn't know what to do with myself. So I went to a gentleman's club. I sat away from the stage, close to a TV and watched a ball game while nursing a couple of beers.

The dancers made their rounds and I politely declined their offers for a private dance with a ""Maybe later"", while tipping them a dollar. Eventually one slid into the booth and told me I was different and asked me what I was doing there. I jokingly said I was looking for a GF.  She picked up my phone and dialed her number. 

We made plans for the following week. When she showed up at the restaurant she looked like she stepped out of a Lenny Kravitz video (this was 20 years ago). We shared the Captains platter while doing shots of tequila. After dinner I asked if she wanted to walk the beach and she agreed. I had already checked into a beach hotel and said I wanted to stop there for something (can't remember what it was but I wasn't trying to make a move). Her eyes lit up and when we got to the room she got undresses as fast as only a stripper can. It was on! 

The next morning as we were leaving she asked if I could help her out. I was like. ""Duh!"" I only had a couple of hundred cash in my wallet and I gave it all to her. She seemed happy and that was that. We had an agreement.


The next six months were a raging blur. After almost twenty years of a shitty marriage I was partying like a rock star. I'd go to bed early when I didn't have the kids to take a nap. Get up at midnight, shower and head to the club. Close the place down and we'd be off to an after hours club or a whales house or some crazy place. I was out of control. Sex parties, drunk driving, watching the sunrise, etc., etc.. I'm lucky I didn't die, or worse, kill somebody else. 

I finally had to call it off and sober up. It was a great ride though. It also ruined strip clubs for me in general because I saw the hustle up close and personal. I would listen to the girls talk about their ""customers"". You can't believe a word they say. 

Anyways, I moved on and went back to vanilla dating for a bit but I learned that I liked the dynamics of P4P. 

I share this story because as fun as it was to reminisce it's more important to tell you to be careful. While I genuinely believe we had real feelings for each other, the extravagant lifestyle some of these girls lead is out of control. It was a vulnerable time in my life and although our PPM was reasonable I picked up some healthy tabs. Not to mention the travel and shopping andl

"lawncare","t5_2rzrk","Don't let it dry out (water it if it doesn't rain for a couple of days) and it'll be fine in a couple of weeks, it looks much worse than it is - you cut the green ""blade"" part off but there's still more grass left there than it appears at first glance. UK grasses are pretty hardy, and the UK is well suited to growing grass - so we can get away with mistreating it more than most Americans (with their hotter, drier weather) can, so there's unlikely to be any real harm done here.

In general, never cut at the bottom level - it's not necessary and generally worse for the lawn. I know that's a little counter-intuitive, and it would seem like you should cut low in order to keep it tidy - but the leaves contain lots of water and nutrients and do the photosynthesis, so you want to retain them to an extent. A slightly longer lawn still looks tidy

Normally 2-3"" (~50-75mm, call it 40-80 for simplicity if your lawnmower is in 20mm increments) is about right. That sounds long, but it really isn't. Start at 3"" (75mm), and you can slowly drop to 2"" (50mm) if your lawn is pretty level and see how you get on. You probably don't want to mow down to 1"" (20mm) or less unless you're going for a full on bowling green look

I generally aim for about 3"" (75mm) in the UK on my (less even, more bumpy) front lawn, and 2"" (50mm) in my (more smooth/level) back garden. The 2"" is a little tidier looking, but not enough that I'd really care about the difference

Many people routinely cut at 3.5-4"" (85-100mm), although I think that's mostly for drought tolerance and is a little excessive for the UK where we get plenty of rain. A middling length of 2-3"" is pretty good for the UK, and definitely err towards the top of that range as a beginner

Leave 1"" to the golf courses and bowling greens, it's unnecessary and a lot of work. Cutting to 3"" once a week (a little less often in spring/autumn) is the easiest route to a good looking lawn

As a side note, you'll probably want to get used to referring to lawn lengths in inches on this community, although it's an easy translation if you just assume 25mm per inch (and for simplicity, 6mm for 1/4"", 12mm for 1/2"", 18mm for 3/4""). They're close enough when talking about grass length and make the maths easier...

This is probably a good time to gently run a rake over the lawn and over-seed it a bit, if you can be bothered...",1654041743

tldr; 1.67 **million** defensive uses of firearms in 2021 vs. 45,222 firearm-related deaths in 2020 (this includes ALL firearm-related, not just assaults)

*The survey further finds that approximately a third of gun owners (31.1%) have used a firearm to defend themselves or their property, often on more than one occasion, and it estimates that guns are used defensively by firearms owners in approximately 1.67 million incidents per year. Handguns are the most common firearm employed for self-defense (used in 65.9% of defensive incidents), and in most defensive incidents (81.9%) no shot was fired. Approximately a quarter (25.2%) of defensive incidents occurred within the gun owner's home, and approximately half (53.9%) occurred outside their home, but on their property.*

In 2020, there were 45,222 firearm-related deaths in the United States ‚Äì that‚Äôs about 124 people dying from a firearm-related injury each day. More than half of firearm-related deaths were suicides and more than 4 out of every 10 were firearm homicides.*

"196","t5_2v92f","DNS, Bevo Tech Pack Reborn, Bo-Buddy bunkers, were my go-to packs for 1.7.10. They all had ~300-350 mods each, and I'd always add a few more if I felt something was missing. I *really* miss old school feed the beast packs. I'll always have a special place in my heart for FTB unleashed even though it only had 120 mods or so, as it was my first experience modding any game, ever. I wish some of the classics from the 1.7.10 era (lookin' at you, IC2 and carpenter's blocks) would be updated to more contemporary versions of the game. It'd be so cool to combine some of those classics with things like the Create mod. 

I remember getting like 25fps for the longest time when I first started playing 1.7.10, because I hadn't allocated more than 4gb RAM in the launcher, meaning Minecraft, and like 350 mods on top of it were trying to squeeze themselves into 4 gigs of RAM. Once I sorted that out, I'd get anywhere from 30-55 fps, on a 7th gen core i7/GTX970. Flans mod was so much fun. I remember being so inspired by the Mindcrack folks eeons ago when they did that 'team battle' thing with the crackpack w/ flans mod. The hangar and runway built into a mountain were nothing short of fantastic. Etho's 'Code Red Tunnels' were something that I copied for years because I loved how they looked so much. Every industrial build had at least one of them. All you need are carpenter's blocks, chisel 2 for the factory blocks, and projectRed Illumination for the cage lamps. I'd love to make a facility/compound entirely in that style one day with a giant ass door powered by the create mod. I tried to do that years ago with the Pistronics 2 mod (basically create but just the piston blocks. Also, it was super laggy and primitive compared to create. Regardless, kudos are due because groups of moving blocks is NOT easy) but it was just too clunky to be worthwhile. Thinker's construct hammers, and those thaumcraft arcane bore things made excavating tunnels easy. I also used buildcraft quarries and builders to make it easier.

"rickygervais","t5_2rlm2","Ricky is a grifter these days, His comedy fan base is mostly boomers/older Gen Xs who lap up this low IQ shit. Even back in 2007, when he released his Fame special - I thought his fat jokes were fairly dated and surface level. ‚ÄúFat isn‚Äôt a disability!!! You‚Äôre fat cos you eat too much and you‚Äôre lazy!!!!‚Äù Uhh yep. 99% of people get this.

2007 was around the time Ricky started to develop what I call his ‚Äúoutrage kink‚Äù. Basically he started projecting this persona of ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm going to make you offended and outraged and I don‚Äôt care üòéüòé‚Äù. Unfortunately, it had only grown and grown since then. Now in 2022 that kind of patter is so old and tired but he is doubling down on it. 

He needs to get over his outrage kink. I don‚Äôt give a shit about punching down or offence. Just tell ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù jokes without the ‚Äúha ha you triggered!!?! Ohhh did I OFFEND you????!!‚Äù patter. It‚Äôs lame. 

He also needs to get off twitter. You can clearly see how it‚Äôs degrading his comedy. Lots of his bits seem to have arisen from him reading some idiots twitter account and getting upset over it. Rick, we get it. Twitter is for loons. Who cares. 

I believe Louis CK is the best comedian. I think he‚Äôs extremely good at what he does and his jokes are almost always perfectly crafted. He tells offensive jokes, but he doesn‚Äôt have the outrage kink like Ricky. End result is he‚Äôs a far better comic.

Anyway, who gives a shit. This is embarrassing how much I have typed. Fuck me.",1654041746

"Rainbow6","t5_2t1bl","I've been playing halo since CE on Xbox, I've no real issues beyond nitpicking things on how infinite runs today. The gameplay is the best I've ever felt it been, halo 2 was my favourite but reach had the best overall gameplay imo.

Is it more shallow than previous games? Yeah, but so is every other game that comes out today, it's a symptom of the age and not really exclusive to just halo infinite. It's a mark against it, no doubt but I'm not sure I hold it against them given how shallow any game is these days, apex, valorant, csgo, all of them lack any new substance that innovates how halo USED to. 

The battle pass progression is way ahead imo than most other titles, I can purchase the pass without worrying about completing it, tho the 6 month seasons atm obviously give you more than enough time to finish it lol. Point being they are at least progressing towards more customer friendly services, which is always good in my book. 

Today I still play infinite, more than I play seige even. It's a game I can simply play without worrying about casual racism/toxicity that both seige and csgo are plagued with, and a game I can do consistently well even tho there are apparently desync issues I've yet to really come across as game breaking. I feel like siege has it worse when it comes to peakers advantage than halo has it, but that's just my own experience, not fact. 

Either way, it's a game I play and enjoy, I just find it hilarious to see new maps being criticized in one game as not being enough, yet here we are in siege with a new map that the community doesn't like to play when a vote is out forward.

"JusticeForJohnnyDepp","t5_2eempv","I served on a jury and while the reason for the trial was way different, a similar scenario occurred in deliberations. 

Long story short. The case I tried on was a DUI. A man got in an argument with his girlfriend and while inebriated he went to his car, parked in his garage, turned it on to have the heat on and passed out. While he was passed out, his foot hit the acceleration pedal and he burned out his tires and his engine since his emergency break was on. The cops arrived and charged him with a dui. 

This was a stupid no brainer. The man didn‚Äôt drive at all. He didn‚Äôt have the intention to drive. He fell asleep and unintentionally hit the pedal. But a few of my other jurors arrived to some wild conclusions (insisting he had been caught drinking and driving before. Or that the cop had seen him driving drunk earlier in the night. Etc etc none of this was presented in court). I have good reason to believe these jurors only arrived at that conclusion because the defendant was a young black man. And I was ready to hang that jury. 

So eventually, to appease the last hold outs on our jury, we had to send out the question‚Äî I shit you not‚Äî ‚Äúwhat is the definition of driving‚Äù. That‚Äôs what this man‚Äôs record was pinned on. 

But the answer came back, and when that answer came back it basically allowed those jurors to finally concede that ‚Äúno. This man did not drive under the influence‚Äù. 

I think it was basically about the hair splitting of ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt move a single inch forward and to be considered driving you have to move forward at least a little bit‚Äù. 

So yeah. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôm seeing it. Seems like they‚Äôre trying to split those final hairs to get everyone on the same page.",1654041747

Thank you so very much.  This is exactly what I needed to hear.

Every word I write here (and on my OYS) is for one of three reasons:

1)  Seeking external validation.  I either wanted someone to tell me that I was right to be angry or to tell me I did a great job at not acting butthurt.

2)  [Avoiding getting called out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriedredpill/comments/urhu27/comment/i94onkd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  Thank you to u/Ubermensch33 for your help today.

3)  Giving enough information to give the appearance of accountability without actually being accountable for anything.  Which is what this is:

Circumcision is not.

Vaccines and circumcision aren't the same thing at all.

Circumcision doesn't prevent anything. It doesn't even significantly lower the risk of anything. Millions of circumcised men have STDs, including HIV.

If you're circumcised, you still need to practice safe sex.

&gt; I would say that the AAP has a soft recommendation for medical circumcision.

They very directly say that they **do not** recommend it. It couldn't be any clearer:

**""Health benefits are not great enough to recommend routine circumcision for all male newborns.""**

That's as unambiguous as it gets. There's no debate as to what their position is. They clearly don't recommend it.

&gt; circumcision is considered medically necessary under US law

No, it's not.

&gt; Insurers have to cover the procedure

Only when it's deemed medically necessary by a doctor. Routine circumcision of children is not deemed medically necessary.

Most insurance in the US doesn't cover routine circumcision of children for no reason. Also, Medicaid in around 2 dozen states doesn't cover it either.

&gt; which means it's medically necessary.

It's not medically necessary.

Why do you continue to say false things?

&gt; though there are literally dozens of studies at this point

Any that have found a link between circumcision and HIV transmission in men who have sex with men?

In developed countries, that's the main way that HIV is transmitted through sex. It's extremely rare for a heterosexual person to get HIV through sex in a developed country.

Like I said, most of those studies were done in Africa, and only looked at female-male HIV transmission. Not relevant to developed countries.",1654041747

You'll probably enjoy most of keiko/practise, which are drills with a partner (you usually do a few repetitions, swapping offensive/defensive role, then rotate partner on a signal). Like I mentioned, shiai is a pretty important part of kend≈ç though.

I would encourage you to find out if your local kend≈ç club does iaid≈ç and try that out too if available. Also might as well look around for kenjutsu, you never know what might be in range of you. Though of course you'd probably have better luck in bigger cities.",1654041748

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","My daughter is getting close to the same age that you are now.  I fear her not wanting to talk to me about these types of topics, but I know it's likely unavoidable because teenagers don't want to have these types of conversations with someone that is always trying to teach them or fix their issues.

Your dad is probably thinking that he needs to help you develop your thoughts on these topics and wants to guide you in the way he thinks about these issues.  He likely doesn't care so much what you think about the issues today, only that you listen to him as a ""teacher"" and mold your thoughts on these issues based on the lessons he teaches you.  He likely doesn't want a two-way conversation with you, he wants you to be an open vessel that he can just pour his teachings into.

My daughter and I have already had a few conversations about how we need to approach serious topics.  As her dad, I always want to help her find solutions.  But, sometimes the solution is the discussion itself.  We have a rule now that if she wants to talk to just vent, that I need to approach the discussion with the mindset that she can handle it on her own and that I should not offer to fix her issues.  If she wants advice or counsel from me, she will ask for it specifically.  Sometimes we'll start a discussion and I will ask her ""do you want advice, or do you want an ear to talk to?""  Maybe you could establish similar guidelines with your dad.",1654041748

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

"WeOwnThisCity","t5_51o3dm","&gt; How does Wayne really see himself? He clearly is bullshitting himself a lot, but in the end, he really saw himself as a hero willing to do what others wouldn't.  

I think it's interesting to note that in the years since being sentenced, Wayne Jenkins has continued to try to portray himself as some kind of hero, first by [claiming he was railroaded](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-cr-gttf-wayne-jenkins-speaks-20200115-kfiw65pvzvcn5oa3mikdkuvshm-story.html) into his plea deal, then by claiming he should be released from prison for [performing CPR](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-cr-gttf-jenkins-seeks-release-20200812-qcsgch7ua5dtpnem257ut5cesa-story.html) on a fellow inmate, and also by wanting to use what happened to him to start some kind of [""think tank"" comprised of wayward officers](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-pr-md-ci-cr-gttf-wayne-jenkins-think-tank-20210312-igzqbhilrzblnezk6deire7qqq-story.html) to provide advice to police departments so they can avoid scandals like what happened with the GTTF. 

Also, weird as it may be to say this, after reading the book and seeing this show, not only do I feel bad for Sean Suiter, but I feel bad for Wayne Jenkins and many other cops like him. Jenkins was a former Marine who joined the force with the intention to help the community, but was trained right from the start to only look out for himself and to use his position to get stats while lining his pockets. 

He doesn't seem to have any real remorse now, and I'm glad he's serving 25 years in prison for what he did, but even though I think many cops do horrible stuff, I simply can't believe that most people become cops *because* they want to do horrible stuff. I think they simply don't know what they're signing up for when they start, and when they're confronted with the reality of how corrupt police departments are, they realize they'd have to quit entirely if they don't want to participate in some way. I think most become cops because they want to help, and quickly get sucked into the biggest organized crime family in the world before they really know what happened.",1654041749

"GunAccessoriesForSale","t5_h4uwp","Paypal offers two different services.  Paypal Friends and Family (F&amp;F) has zero fees, but offer no protections and makes the buyer vulnerable to scammers.  Paypal Goods and Services (G&amp;S) charges an additional ~3% of the item price (actually 3.49% and $0.49 as of 2021), but provides the buyer insurance in case the seller dissapears without providing the item.  Paypal does prohibit [some specific items](https://web.archive.org/web/20180409201310/https://www.paypal.com/us/selfhelp/article/what-is-paypal%E2%80%99s-policy-on-transactions-that-involve-firearms-faq585) but has a ""catch all comment"" that may apply to others, so NO NOTES IN PAYPAL. As a general guideline, if a buyer wants to use Paypal G&amp;S rather than F&amp;F with an **established GAFS member**, it is expected that they will absorb the +3% fee for the increased protections that it provides them. [Here is a easy fee calculator](https://thefeecalculator.com/). If a seller specifies a F&amp;F price, assume that is his ""to his pocket"" cost. However these terms are up for negotiation between the buyer and seller. It is recommended to pay via G&amp;S and absorb the fee. If the seller mandates F&amp;F, be wary of a scam and use a [Scam prevention method](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy).  Additionally, Paypal has deleted the account of several members due to using F&amp;F for purchases.  Paypal considers this theft from them (you're stealing their fees), and a violation of their [ToS](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full). DO NOT put notes in F&amp;F payments as it is evidence you may be violating PP ToS.

Then he grew this growth on the back of his neck that semi exploded a few days ago and smelled like rotting flesh. He wasn't making it to the areas they usually poop in and was pooping everywhere. His back legs have not been working well at all, so he would poop/pee and then drag himself through his own waste (pee stains on the back of his legs).

I noticed you commented on my other post about the other ferret getting bathed. That happened because he peed on the other ferret. 

He was doing so poorly that he actually passed from the anesthetic and didn't get the euthanizing shot. The doc commented that the eyeball surgery probably only bought him some time.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","OK, there's a technical answer and a philosophical answer. Because you're asking this, I'm going to assume you don't know much about the technology so I'll give you the philosophical answer.

 If it was shot on film.  The picture can be zoomed in and upscaled indefinitely. If it was shot digitally, it will be fuzzy/pixelated when expanded larger.

 Imagine if you had a fuzzy picture. A talented artist could paint or draw around the edges and make it look more crisp and detailed.. That makes sense right?

 Now, imagine a nice crisp picture being stretched to be bigger. It would have that same fuzziness like thebearlier example. Thats what happens with digital films (like what you shoot in your phone) ""Upscaling"" is the process of using technology to artistically create sharper lines and colors based on how it would look in higher resolution. Then exporting that higher resolution.  This is needed for digital movies.

 The reason these releases take a while to complete is because even with artificial intelligence, there's usually a great deal of human CGI assistance and skill needed to get it looking perfect.",1654041752

I agree that hack writers overuse these tropes for cheap effects... but then again, hack writers do most things wrong, not just this. (Laymon's The Cellar is a mediocre book, not because he used that particular trope, but because he is a mediocre and unimaginative writer). The thing is, good horror writers who aim to disturb the reader will also tend to write about domestic abuse, and sexual violence, and animal cruelty - because these things really are disturbing.  
Sometimes it's almost as if we're saying to horror authors: ""Yeah, I really like horror, go for it, give me your most fucked-up shit! Wait... No, not that, something more comfortable than that...""",1654041753

"medicine","t5_2qhff","Reporting nodules based on Fleischner is standard of care. That isn't in question.

For me any discussion on the standard of care for radiology also needs to take into account that a good radiologist trying their best is going to have a 5% miss rate. They don't miss intentionally. It's just part of being an imperfect human being. There's a lot of potential incidentalomas on a CT of the abdomen of pelvis. You aren't going to see 100% of them 100% of the time. This radiologist was unlucky in that one of their 5% misses happened to be a nodule that had a 15% chance of being malignant.

If this radiologist is missing much more than average within their subspecialty (due to insufficient training, poor knowledge base, low skill, reading too fast, etc.), then I'd be persuaded of the justice of this ruling. But if they're within average miss rates for the profession then I think that should be a defense against these kinds of absurd rulings.",1654041753

Well, this card was more nuanced. It was designed to not stop playing after you open it for FOUR HOURS!!!

So I figured I'll just break the card to get it to stop. Well there's something in place in case you try that. Once you break the card, it activates a glitter bomb from inside the card. On top of that, the voice box is encased in steel, making it really hard to break and get it to stop playing.

I told him my struggles and he has been supportive. We tried to be open, but at the end of the day, he realized he didn‚Äôt want to be with someone who wasn‚Äôt attracted to him. I also didn‚Äôt want to keep pretending. It‚Äôs not fair to either of us. It sucks because it felt like I did everything right according to what family, friends, society, etc. expects. We currently live together as roommates - no sex and separate rooms. We have also decided to stay living together for a while longer because of financial dependencies.

"kpop","t5_2r1ox","What? Where did I say any of that?? I never specified anything about East Asians? Stop misconstruing my words and engaging in bad faith. I never said people outside of this couldn‚Äôt experience racism. That would be like reading my comments and concluding I said black or Hispanic people never experienced racism because I‚Äôm not centering them in this conversation. It‚Äôs a basic logical fallacy.  

If someone is forced to become part of diaspora, they are still part of the diaspora?? Undocumented immigrants are still part of the diaspora? 

Again, I never said they shouldn‚Äôt be part of the conversation about racism. But just as there is black history month and Hispanic heritage month, neither of which excludes Aanhpis but rather instead centers a specific community, aanhpi heritage month is specifically meant to center the aanhpi community.

If your goal is to misunderstand and pull words I never said out of my mouth, there is no constructive conversation occurring here. I suggest you take an Asian American studies course instead of arguing in bad faith with the singular goal of supporting the White House - that might help you understand why aanhpi month even exists in the first place.",1654041757

We have kept 2/3 on 1 year starting same time at you and 1/3 we pushes on to 18 months. This was primarily so we have a cycle break in the coming years. As in they won't all mature at the same time. 
The reason we went 1/3 for 18 months as opposed to half is because that 1/3 will mature just before Christmas. So didn't want to put too much heartache for Xmas 2023. 

Personally I think the recession is going to be brutal and will be with us by q4 this year. RBNZ will be forced to drop rates next year when the the economy comes to a screeching halt (which it's already doing). 

I hear a lot of noise about rates continuing to go up next year but I just can't see it happening. People have already stopped spending on luxury goods. When people can't put food on their tables the rates will come down not because it's good economics but because politics.

I experienced joy and happiness again. I forgot to take them one day and started to feel my anxiety ramping up, and I was like, holy shit I get like this every day? You gotta find what works for you and stick to it. 

Here‚Äôs the unfortunate part, truthfully your doctors probably do not know what exactly to give you, and how much to give you. Every human brain is different. It‚Äôs unfortunately a guessing game, so make sure you report every single thing about the meds to your doctor or whoever prescribed them to you. Anyone worth a damn will listen and give you a detailed explanation as to why they either don‚Äôt want to change it or if they think you should try whatever else there is. It takes time and it‚Äôs trial and error, be open with your doctor and try your hardest to be patient with finding what works for you.

Also, the word ‚Äúkarmawhore‚Äù is a little bit offensive to me, for I am not on Reddit to score the most karma. Thanks in advance.

"Masks4All","t5_2j4zt8","Thanks for sharing this. If anyone else is flying with an elastomeric respirator in the US, please also share your story. There were many reports of people being forced to take off their elastomeric respirators prior to the mask mandate being lifted, so if we can get more reports that would be great.

The CDC's travel rules expressly banned respirators with an exhalation valve, despite the fact that NIOSH (which is part of CDC) issued a report saying that exhalation valves are fine in N95 (not elastomeric) style masks. I emailed some people at the CDC about this a while ago but never heard back.

Now that the travel rule has been lifted, I expect it would be up to the airline whether or not to allow an elastomeric respirator. Some airlines told passengers that had \*non-valved elastomeric respirators\* that they were not allowed for non-COVID reasons. E.g. I heard ""they prevent communication with the passenger.""

Until we have lots of reports, I would caution anyone who is attempting to fly in an elastomeric respirator to also have a well fitting N95 with them and be prepared to put it on without arguing\[1\] if questioned.

"shitposting","t5_2usxq","My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead‚Äì murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time ‚Äì something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange ‚Äì uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" ‚Äì on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.

"Homebrewing","t5_2qj8u","Every guide starts with making clean beer because all sour beer starts with wort (the pre-beer or barley sugar water that turns into beer) and all of the skills needed to make clean beer. I break these skills into six pillars: handling and preparing yeast, cleaning and sanitation, recipe design and making wort, fermentation control, transferring and packaging, and evaluation of results/feedback loop). 

Making sour beer builds on top of the six pillars, and it's not a cheap shortcut around it. If you can't do those, you will have a tough time making good sour beer or clean beer.

For the type of beer you are making, you probably want to start with kettle-soured beer. Kettle souring is the easiest way to make sour beer, and represents the majority of fruited sour beer out there in the USA.

&gt; this is where I want to start instead of having to modify or buy extra equipment once I know enough

In terms of equipment, the kettle sour process is just one more step in the middle of the beer making process, which **requires no special equipment as long as you choose to use a stainless steel boil kettle** (aluminum and sour beer do not mix). To make a kettle sour, you literally follow the beer making process until you have made wort. From there, for a clean beer, you begin boiling the wort and follow through until the beer is ready to drink. However, for your kettle sour beer, you heat the wort only enough to pasteurize it, then cool it to body temp or lower, add lactobacillus (often it is just a Goodbelly probiotic shot or Swanson's probiotic capsule), wait a day or two, then resume the process. Adding fruit is not unique for sour beer compared to clean beer.

There is not much to it beyond that. **You could literally just use the immediately above paragraph as your entire guide** (if you know how to make clean beer). But brewing is very technical and scientific if you want it to be, so you can certainly go deeper.

Once you can make kettle sours, you may eventually decide to make more complex sour beer, like lambic, kriek, fruited gueze, etc. That is one of those things that takes a few years to be consistently good at, not the least of all because it takes a year or sometimes years to complete a single beer's aging and maturation process.",1654041759

I do have my issues though, and that's a lack of rationality within LGBT spaces. Inclusion is a good thing to an extent, but in spaces likes sports? That's a huge disadvantage towards biological women. 

Children is another problem I have, some people believe it's okay for a child to take hormone blockers and undergo irreversible surgery just because they said they didn't feel like a boy/girl. Let that decision be made by the time the child turns 18. 

Finally the social change that's being developed. People are trying to push the idea that men can get pregnant, that trans jokes are transphobic, that people's lives should be ruined because they don't conform to a certain set of beliefs. It's madness. It's practically what conservative Christians did back in the 1800s-1900s.

For Max, RUTH brings her to her happy place and the memories of her friends. Its not necessarily the song, its the happy thoughts.

This will be a big theme in part 2, since part 1 dealt with conflicting thoughts on love: Mike vs El, Will vs Mike, Max vs herself, Jonathan/Steve/Nancy triangle, Lucas vs his two worlds, Hopper vs his feeling of being a burden to his family.

All those internal battles will come to a head when Nancy has to escape the UD. music will have no power, and Steve will have to help, and will say something like ""come back, i love you"". This triggers the end game for Vecna",1654041760

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","You need to learn how to eat for the size you want to be at indefinitely.

Let‚Äôs just say you gained 35 lbs in a year.

That means that *on average* you are eating 350 kcal/day more than your size and activity level would suggest.

That‚Äôs a 5K run or walk ~30-60 min **every day**.

You don‚Äôt need to count every calorie, but you need to identify where you can find about 300-400 kcal/day that you will not consume, or will burn off to adjust your calorie balance. A 30 minute walk every day and 200 kcal less every day would probably do the trick, but that has to become your routine. 

That‚Äôs how thinner you needs to eat and move to stay thinner.

You don‚Äôt need to work any harder than that. However it‚Äôll take you ~2 years to get back to the 35 lbs lower.",1654041760

If government-run schools is the route you are looking at then you should contact your local board of education or the town hall and they can give you information on which schools have those types of classes/programs.

When we moved here, we were super lucky. The schools we lived closest to just happened to be 1 of like 2 or 3 schools in the entire city that have this class.

We also let one child go to international school for a year...big mistake. The kid LOVED it but frankly the level of japanese instruction was not enough, so we moved to a private bilingual school.

Injectable testosterone is the most common because it is the cheapest method. Injectable and gel are equally effective depending on the dose. Injections are typically once a week, but can be done less frequently in higher doses. Gel must be applied daily. There's pros and cons to both methods, and I've tried both!

I'm going through the same thing.

Our main choice is this website called Courtly. A friend of ours recently got married through them as well, and they shared that it was pretty straightforward and the whole process was seamless and not that costly, around $500 for the whole thing. They even got their legal US marriage certificate in the mail a few weeks later.

It's also difficult to refactor, as you can easily change the names of the fields with a refactoring tool, but it won't also change the name of the GameObject it's looking for. There are also a few where the name of the field and GameObject are different.

And it's not terribly efficient, either. GameObject.Find in particular can be quite slow. I generally consider using GameObject.Find to be a code smell, your code should not be dependent on the _name_ of a GameObject unless it's something very specific with a well-defined structure, like the names of bones in a rig.

Honestly this is something best defined by data, and in Unity something best defined by data is often best implemented using a ScriptableObject. You could eliminate all of this _and_ make it more flexible this way.",1654041763

"CatholicDating","t5_3348n","Going to be a little bit more charitable here to him than some of the other posters as your boyfriend is still relatively young and presumably inexperienced. He is acting this way because he feels hurt and insecure about being a virgin in this day and age (men get virgin shamed a lot by our society, you aren't considered a 'real man' by many unless you've lost it, and it can be **intense**). I think he was holding out hope to find another virgin so he could share that special time with them and not feel judged or like he missed out by adhering to Catholic rules or not being desired, and feels internally like oh wow, I waited but she didn't and had fun, what a fool I am, she gave herself to other guys, maybe she's going to compare me to them or find me wanting, etc. So there are a lot of emotions going on with him and unfortunately he did not handle it well and lashed out because of hurt.

The prenup thing, I think, is because he likely read all those studies about how women who aren't virgins have a higher chance of divorce etc with even one partner bringing up odds significantly, I think those studies are a bit flawed and the science murky but to him in his heightened anxious state it matters.

You can see why he's freaking out in conjunction with the above, even if he's not showing it.

This is probably a conversation you should have had with him earlier in the relationship or dating phase as it can be a dealbreaker for some people (and that's okay, some people want people on their relative level partners-wise or not a big disparity and personally I like to have this talk sooner rather than later because of that). But, since it's ten months in, things are a bit messier for him. He may be fighting with his love for you but also the above thoughts at the same time and maybe retroactive jealousy.

The good news is that it is often possible to work through this if he is willing to see a therapist or maybe a couple's counselor with you, depending, and emphasize that was a stupid, former version of you and that you presumably regret it a lot. That you love him and aren't comparing him to others and you want to work through this issue with him. And give him time to talk about his fears and insecurities. That should help a bit until the above.  If you want to make it work with him don't go into a judgment thing with him but do mention you understand he was hurt but you were hurt by his comments too over something you already feel bad about and regret.",1654041764

Hire someone to help you make a budget and learn how to pay into your retirement, save for a house, etc. 

If what you are doing currently works for you, then keep doing it. But you DO need to max out your TFSAs and there are some other things you may want to consider. 

Do NOT let an advisor convince you into anything you feel uncomfortable with. There are ways to invest part of your saving into safe investments, if that's what you want. OR you can not invest at all in your life and that's okay too.

If you just want to figure out how to budget your money and save where you can, there are resources online to help with this for free. 

Personally, I do not have one because I do not make enough money and I am able to budget and save myself fairly easily at this point in my life.

Really dive into the deck building, it‚Äôs a lot of fun making a deck that maximizes combos, sleights, and adjusts adding new options mid-battle as you start to burn down your deck. Likewise enemy cards as you collect them add a new dimension to your building. Here is a good video teaching the gist of using your cards right.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WYLd0CzD9z8

Second get into the world room system. Don‚Äôt just make rooms haphazardly, pay attention the size, difficulty, and traits of each room so you can mix it up. Don‚Äôt like a particular world then turn it into constant treasure, save, and shops. Looking to grind? Try out the different room cards like bottomless darkness, large rooms, etc‚Ä¶ Feeling exhausted by exploring then create small rooms like hallways and single squares. Want to mash some heads in use martial waking or if your feeling magic based used the sorcerer equivalent. Learn each room type‚Äôs environmental traits, the best way to first strike, what to hit to farm goodies, where to get chests with new sleights and cards, etc‚Ä¶

I used to hate CoM but now I‚Äôve replayed it quite a lot. It‚Äôs essentially the command deck but with a lot more depth to sink your teeth into.

Mind you to have good fun you need to build your character right to so you have all the sleights and enough CP to make a good variable deck. You want generally to take sleights whenever they are offered, and level yourself up at a minimum 2CP bonuses for every 1HP level bonus. If your feeling brave you can do 3CP for every 1HP or no HP bonuses at all.",1654041765

I fucking hate tech bros mostly because the don't know what they're talking about and just assume if there's more tech involved in something, then it *must* be better than other things.

Hi /u/Able-Cat-4405!


Your submission was removed per Rule 4:

&gt;####RULE #4 - NO UNVERIFIED OC

&gt;* Do not post yourself unless you are prepared to verify with us.

&gt;* Don't post or claim to know someone in the photo unless you can verify permission to post the photo.

&gt;* Don't post someone you know from Facebook or Instagram or any other social media platform. If we find out, it violates this rule.

`A.  You are actually the MILF in this photo`

#**-or-**

`B. You can verify that you have the MILF's permission to post this photo.`

**Any further submissions by you, without verification, will result in a ban.**

---

#**[\*\*READ THE FULL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS HERE\*\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/milf/wiki/verification)**

#Verification must follow these simple rules:

Please provide `3+` photos of your nude/semi-nude body from `3` different angles, holding a paper sign with your user name, today's date, and /r/milf written on it.

* The paper should be crumpled and smoothed, yet still readable.

* Your hand(s) should be visible holding the sign.

* Shoot the pics from as wide an angle as you can manage. Photos cropped in close will be rejected.

The photo does not have to be artsy or fully nude, but semi-nude is the minimum. If we can't match the body depicted in your verification pictures to the body in your past and future posts, then it's not a meaningful verification. So while you do not have to post your face, we do need to see a good amount of your nude/semi-nude body.

Thank you for your cooperation!

I also finished my first listen about a fortnight ago, so I'm going through them all right now as well, so let me find some of my favourites...

 [Two Ships Passing](https://archiveofourown.org/works/22189123)
This one is a 'what if Jon and Gerry met as kids', and how that could affect the rest of their lives. It's a little self-indulgent, but it is a beautifully done fic, and does a fantastic job at fleshing out Jon's grandma as a likeable yet flawed character. 

[Ghosts, Eldritch Horrors and YouTubers, Oh My!](https://archiveofourown.org/works/24668503)
Where Jon stays in contact with Georgie, and so when she sets up her Ghost Hunting channel, she asks Jon to join her...and together they are supernatural!BuzzFeed Unsolved. Hilarious, and a great way to look again at a lot of the earlier episodes. Featuring Sasha as the archivist! 

[Chamomile ](https://archiveofourown.org/works/23373862)
Unexpectedly adorable fic set at the start of the apocalypse. A one-shot, but incredibly well written, and more than worth your time! Here's the start of the summary because I love reading this sentence:
'Whatever the ex-tea was, if it really had ever been that last bag of chamomile Martin claimed he‚Äôd found tucked in the back of the cupboard, it was fast now.'

[I (don't) come to you seeking peace](https://archiveofourown.org/works/21460978)
Jon, whilst Martin is under the influence of Lukas and the Lonely. Such a lovely read, especially for the Jon &amp; Daisy friendship whilst Jon slowly and unwillingly discovers he has feelings for Martin. Not canon-compliant!

[The Lives We've Shared](https://archiveofourown.org/works/32626561)
Jon finds Gertrude's stash under the floorboards a little earlier than expected. Elias doesn't take it well.
Featuring the tag 'Jonah u can't keep hiding archivists under the floorboards, it's just not sustainable', and if that doesn't say everything...then we aren't going to get along.

[Too Much Time ](https://archiveofourown.org/works/23647201)
Time travel! Because of course! Jon goes back in time, but uh, ends up as an 8 year old. And Elias promptly notices him and adopts him. It's a fantastic fic, although heavier on the character development than anything plot relevant, but special for the fact that you kind of like Elias in this? 

[The Reverb In These Holy Halls](https://archiveofourown.org/series/1685689)
The best of the time-travel fix-its. I love a lot of them, but damn if this isn't the best one I've ever seen. If you read nothing else, come check out this one! Incredible for its handling of side characters like Naomi Hearne, damn good plotline, and the best treatment of Sasha James you'll ever get. 

...So I have a million more. The entirety of my bookmarks section is just Magnus fics, so if you want more than I've recced here...take a look at my ao3 [bookmarks ](https://archiveofourown.org/bookmarks?commit=Sort+and+Filter&amp;bookmark_search%5Bsort_column%5D=created_at&amp;include_bookmark_search%5Bfandom_ids%5D%5B%5D=11812534&amp;bookmark_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&amp;bookmark_search%5Bother_bookmark_tag_names%5D=&amp;bookmark_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&amp;bookmark_search%5Bexcluded_bookmark_tag_names%5D=&amp;bookmark_search%5Bbookmarkable_query%5D=&amp;bookmark_search%5Bbookmark_query%5D=&amp;bookmark_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&amp;bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=0&amp;bookmark_search%5Bwith_notes%5D=0&amp;user_id=TimesBeingWhatTheyAre) :)",1654041765

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","√â mais um desconhecimento da nossa culin√°ria l√° fora. A nossa culin√°ria √© original e inovadora como no resto do mundo. 

Olhando pelo lado da inser√ß√£o do Brasil (e da Am√©rica do Sul) no mundo, n√≥s estamos a pouco tempo inserindo a nossa cultura no mundo. Atrav√©s da hist√≥ria, a presen√ßa da culin√°ria indiana vem desde os tempos da coloniza√ß√£o brit√¢nica e da imigra√ß√£o de indianos nos EUA. O mesmo para os chineses que imigraram para os EUA no fim do s√©culo XIX. Gastronomia italiana n√£o podemos comparar, pois juntamente com a francesa, √© uma das mais prestigiadas do mundo.

O Brasil n√£o √© parte de uma rota comercial ou tur√≠stica relevante o suficiente para que a culin√°ria alcan√ßasse naturalmente outras partes do mundo. √â s√≥ mais recentemente que restaurantes brasileiros est√£o ganhando espa√ßo. N√£o apenas a comida, mas o tipo de servi√ßo, vide os rod√≠zios de churrasco. 

Aqui no Brasil a gente chega a perder muita tradi√ß√£o culin√°ria devido √† globaliza√ß√£o e as mudan√ßas culturais derivadas do modo de vida urbano (tema da minha disserta√ß√£o de mestrado). As comidas t√≠picas acabam perdendo espa√ßo para a culin√°ria global e a nacional j√° estabelecida, ent√£o √© dif√≠cil algumas comidas t√≠picas se renovarem at√© se tornarem um atrativo tur√≠stico, como a comida baiana que √© uma das coisas que faz o estado da Bahia ser famoso. 

De certa forma, n√£o √© como se a comida t√≠pica de pa√≠ses como √çndia e M√©xico fossem bem representadas no resto do mundo. Ambos os pa√≠ses s√£o representados errados, como os nachos tex-mex e o tikka masala. A culin√°ria mexicana tem alguns elementos famosos mas nem chega perto da vastid√£o que √© a variedade. O mesmo para a √çndia e diversos outros pa√≠ses.",1654041766
"CredibleDefense","t5_2y5ib","When time isn't a constraint, it's not a great way to measure success. The US has abundant economic and geopolitical clout, which allows them to trade time and money to avoid causualties and unnecessary risk, both of which can torpedo a conflict in a democracy. Russia has neither of the former so has had to lean in to the latter to the extreme.

I had a chat with one of the marketing people a few years back. They told me that essentially players have two autographs; one is the kind you get when they have time to actually sign things and one is the kind you get when they are signing everything in bulk. Apparently when the season starts the players will sit down and just sign things for like two hours a day for a week which then gets stored and given out or sent to auctions and events.

"ynab","t5_2vqaa","My advice would be to have YNAB reflect real-life as much as possible. So basically, when the kids return cash, what do you do with the cash? Do you ever deposit it back in? Or do you just add it to the change you have lying around? If it's the former, then you will get an inflow transaction that you can assign to whatever category Target came out of (e.g. family loans). If you do the latter, then I would simply treat the purchase at Target as a regular shopping/ grocery expense. So basically, that month, you would have a $30 expense for allowance (the cash withdrawal), and a $10 expense for shopping/ grocery. $40 total in expenses. The next month, you can use the $10 cash you already have to pay the allowance, so that way your allowance withdrawal for the next month will only be for $20. 

I would not overcomplicate things. I would simply make YNAB reflect how things are in reality.  The kids should track their accounts and expenses in a separate YNAB budget or in a notebook (depending on what you want them to learn). When you give them the $30, their account balance and ready to assign would be $30. Then, they can assign the $30 into jars. Every time they spend money, they can manually enter transactions and categorize them as give, spend or save. E.g. in the scenario you described, they would add a transaction at Target and give you $10 for it. If they paid with cash directly at Target, they would still enter the same transaction. 

**If you absolutely want to track your kids money in your own account (i.e. have the give, spend, save categories in your own budget), how to do it:**

Add a manually tracked account for ""Kids Allowance"". When you withdraw $30 in cash, you can edit that transaction to look like a transfer to the ""Kids Allowance"" account. Since ""Kids Allowance"" is an on-budget account (as you're tracking it), the cash withdrawal will have no category. When your kids spend the money, just enter transactions manually into ""Kids Allowance"", and categorize them as give, spend, or save.",1654041766

"marvelchampionslcg","t5_22cwwn","I play one-handed solo whenever I play solo, and I prefer it by far. (We do play two-player as well, but when I solo, it's just with one hero.) Personally I recommend it just because it's much faster and simpler.

It's true that playing with a single hero can be swingier, and you can lose quickly with a bad hand or two, but that's fine. The game is so quick single-handed that it's no big deal. Although of course losing several times in a row is frustrating. :-) 

And it's true that it's more difficult single-handed for that reason, but that's fine too, I just generally play Standard. I'm not out to see how awesome I am by beating the toughest scenarios with my magnificently-tuned decks. I'm just out to have fun with some different cards, play different styles and different heroes, see how things work out.

And that's why MC has hit the sweet spot for me, coming back to your deck building comments. Deck building is definitely more forgiving in MC, largely because the difficulty is so customizable. I can throw together a quick deck of cards that look interesting, or semi-random decks, and it will work well enough for me. I just have to know how difficult to make the scenario.

If you want *objective* results of how difficult different Villains are, you can [check this Google Sheet out](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EConYNxq5QZLtlnWsek1VEr1aiBzIQ0h-_6zNiTT35A/edit#gid=30133154)
from [this thread on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2335981/gameplay-statistics-record-your-plays).
You can see how often people win or lose vs. Rhino (although most of these games are probably with built decks, but it doesn't mean the decks are well-built).",1654041767
"ukraine","t5_2qqcn","The civilians in the LPR/DPR receive information from the Russians who continue to tell them, ""It's the Ukrainians doing this, not us.  The bastards!""  So even while they are treated like kh-words by the Russians, they are forced to grin and bear it.  Those civilians who witness and attest anything other than the official line are silenced by the Russians, whether implicitly, explicitly, or permanently, same as they are in Russia.

The fact that Russia has already said that LPR/DPR will be annexed by Russia rather than recognised as independent, contrary to what they were saying just a few weeks before the war started, should say everything you need to know about the level of Russian respect for the people of LPR/DPR; the corrupt morons like Leonid and Denis who allowed it to happen saw dollar signs in their eyes and were too stupid to see the long term costs.  A rather lengthy [Perun video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9i47sgi-V4) makes a very convincing argument that corruption causes damage *well* in excess of its actual dollar figure, and in this case it can just as easily be applied to the Russian-friendly people under the heel of the Russians, just as it can be to Russians themselves.",1654041767

"Seafood","t5_2qwwo","The type of sauce a food is served with will depend on a lot of things like the region, type of food, and well cultural experimentation in general.  Without knowing where these events occurred I can't say for sure ""What is happening here!""  But, i can try to shed a little light for you as you explore your seafood journey.

There are many sauces for seafood.  Some sauces are pair explicitly with certain foods.  A shrimp cocktail is de-headed shrimp around a glass of cocktail sauce, which is ketchup, lemon juice, and horseradish.  You could also have a shrimp remoulade with a sauce of mayo, brown mustard, ketchup, relish, and horseradish.  In the western united states they make ""fry sauce"" which is a simplifed version of remoulade.

Fish can be served with any number of sauces.  Some people like tartar sauce, others like cream butter sauces.  Tartar sauce is a thick and tangy mayo sauce with relish.  Cream sauces are rarely served on the side so it is unlikely that you had gotten that on a random seafood order.

I think the restaurant where you got sauces most likely served you cocktail, fry sauce or remoulade, and tartar sauce and was in the american south.  And the place where they looked at you crazy for asking for more than butter and cracked black pepper was in the northern US.

Maybe you could order some bottles of sauces and see which ones ring the memory bells.",1654041767

One thing that can cause excessive voltage drop is high resistance in the threads of the light. Try to take the tube out, clean the threads and especially the contact surfaces at the end of the tube. Also clean the inside of the head where the tube makes connection. Same procedure with the tail cap. Screw together tight enough to get a proper connection (and so it doesn't come apart again super easy).

Also make sure to use a relatively high drain cell (not like an unknown cell pulled from a laptop) that's fully charged for testing, and see if the issue persists.

If it's indeed a firmware bug, you might find someone to flash a new version of anduril onto your light. Possibly send it to someone? The PL09MU doesn't come with anduril anyway (it's like anduril without any of the playful things), I put anduril on mine though, works well.

"MinecraftCommands","t5_2yjbi","actually, it's just a handful of commands and 2 repeating command blocks, so data pack seems like overkill here.

these commands will establish teams that restrict the players to their respective islands, simply repeat as needed for more islands/teams. you can remove the bit at the end if you don't care to have them displayed  
`/team add team1 ""Optional Team Name 1""`  
`/team add team2 ""Optional Team Name 2""`

to add a player to a team: `/team join team1 playername`

**these commands are optional** and let you set the team names above the player's heads  
`/team modify team1 nametagVisibility always`  
`/team modify team2 nametagVisibility always`

**these commands are optional** and let you set different colors for teams assuming there's a need to differentiate  
`/team modify team1 color red`  
`/team modify team2 color blue`

**these commands are optional** and let you disable damage between players on the same team/island  
`/team modify team1 friendlyFire false`  
`/team modify team2 friendlyFire false`

these commands will make it so that you can freely turn islands on and off without interacting with the command blocks after setting them up  
`/scoreboard objectives add islands dummy`  
`/scoreboard players add enabled islands 0`  
`/scoreboard objectives add enabled dummy`  
`/scoreboard players add enabled enabled 1`

to enable: `/scoreboard players set enabled islands 1`  
to disable: `/scoreboard players set enabled islands 0`

and finally the command blocks. set a repeating command block in the center of each island, powered by a redstone block beneath, and brick off the redstone block with either barriers or bedrock to prevent it being destroyed, set to the following command:  
`/execute if score enabled islands = enabled enabled run tp @p[team=team1,distance=40..] ~ ~3 ~`

you can replace `team1` with the corresponding team, and the `40` in the distance tag, but leave the dots so that it only targets players more than 40 blocks away from the command block. it will then teleport the player 2 blocks over the command block (as 1 block counts as the command block itself) this will transport any player back to the location just above the command block if they venture outside of the distance declared in the distance parameter.",1654041768

And I found some apparently good cameras, but I seek your advices if I'm misguided or missed some other great cams.

I got a budget of 600‚Ç¨ (650$), and live in EU.

These are the ones I spotted:

Olympus EM5m2, EM10m2

Fujifilm X-T2, X-T20

Lumix GH3, GH4, G80/81/85

Canon EOS M6 ( Found it cheap in second-hand, but I'm not sure about it. )

For the lens I think I'll get a 25 or 22mm prime.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","RE: ""Where does 5E not have consistency?""

 All over the place, especially with the new MPMoM stuff. E.g. hobgoblins are armored warriors who excel at team fighting through Martial Advantage... unless they are rolled up with race = hobgoblin and a class, in which case they are completely different (advantage against charm, saving throw bonus, ""mystical reciprocity"", no martial advantage). They don't even seem like the same race! Ditto kobolds.

Even worse if the character in question is a hobgoblin Enchanter, because now he resembles neither Hogoblins, Hobgoblin Devastators, nor MPMoM Enchanter Wizards. E.g. he doesn't get the MPMoM Enchanter Wizard's mega-Multiattack with an un-Counterspellable uber-cantrip, but the Enchanter Wizard also for some reason can't upcast Hold Person to 5th level like the Enchanter can... They don't even resemble one another. It's like the Enchanter Wizard is a magical archer instead of a wizard. And WotC apparently see this as a feature instead of a bug.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Abuse is a gradual thing, people that haven't experienced it may assume it should have been obvious etc etc, but the abuser is manipulative, they have excuses and cover stories and lies and they will do anything to ensure *they are to be believed*. 

I'm so happy to hear you got out and away. I was in a very abusive relationship from 16-21, I lost all my friends and family for some time (he wanted it that way, and I was just tired of fighting)... So just wanted to offer some advice that helped me, when seeking therapy I highly suggest finding a trauma-informed therapist. Also if you don't feel comfortable with them, don't be afraid to move on and get someone you ""click"" with and feel comfortable sharing with. Something I learned was that it's actually possible for memories and discussions to *re-traumatize* you. You read that right. Your brain doesn't know the difference between a vivid memory and present moment, if you go too deeply into that thought your brain will want to protect you - and react *as though it's currently happening*. Having a therapist that can help to explain that trauma process has been extremely helpful. Recognizing thought patterns etc has been life changing for me personally. 

The best thing to do is have no contact with her. In time those friends you lost may come back to you, when they realize she's a mess and your living happily ever after. It's terrible she's spreading lies, but in time truth will come to light. For me, after things ended one by one people came back into my life, and one by one they told me how much they hated that guy. I think they thought I'd be happy to hear it, but really made me feel like a fool... It's natural to think back and try to process it all, but just remember while your reactions and thoughts may have been geniune, not everyone is honest and there is such thing as *energy vampires* (an old boss used that description once and it's crazy how many books there are on the subject.. didn't know that was a thing, but it totally is! )

Wishing you all the best. You should start a gratitude journal if you're into that kinda thing.. I keep notebook on my nightstand and when I remember I add my favourite highlight from my day... In time it really adds up and it's fun to look back &amp; get back into a positive headspace when I'm having a bad day.",1654041772

For me, the 'Worst' Le Mans is the one where the story was kinda boring - it was telegraphed, there wasn't a challenge, and even then, the event felt like a sideshow to the story revolving around one driver. That was 2018, with Alonso really stealing all the spotlight and Toyota winning effectively unchallenged. Even then, we had drama in lmp2 with a post race disqualification, an awesome result in GTE-Am for proton, and the closest GTE-Pro balance of performance ever - which ended up causing a boring race because the field got split by an early safety car and effectively was decided from that point.

It's _very_ interesting to me that you cite 2017 as a 'good race' - I can tell you as a moderator of this very community at the time, that was not how it felt mid race! The story all week was Toyota finally being the strongest and going on to win, but after all of their cars effectively failed in the middle of the night, the mood in the community was _extremely_ negative. It was only when the #1 car failed with 4 hours left that the _story_ became interesting again, and the charge for the #2 created a victory that was unlikely from the beginning. Looks great in retrospect, but at the time, the _deflated_ feeling after the Toyota failures certainly put a huge damper on it!",1654041772

"TransyTalk","t5_3ijj6","there's a reason they call HRT ""second puberty""! four months is a drop in the water- hormones don't really cause the changes chemically, in the way that a normal medicine does. they change the blueprints off of which your body develops itself. you need to give it time for new cells to grow and existing T to cycle itself out of your system and be replaced by E. nutrition and health can also be a factor- especially with breast development, second puberty is a really big undertaking for your body and requires more energy and materials.


i completely understand if this isn't feasible for you, it wasn't for me when i went on T, but exercise can help speed up fat redistribution. *not* in a ""lose weight"" way! redistribution doesn't mean existing tissue is going to move, it means that the new stuff is going to be placed differently. it will happen eventually no matter what, just being alive means that the old tissue will cycle out and be used, and the new tissue will be placed according to the estrogen. however, doing even a little bit of exercise occasionally will mean that what's been put there originally will go away faster, and what's new will be put in the right places.


another thing you could try is taking progress shots every month. on like, every 15th or whatever, take some pictures. as you keep on hormones, you'll be able to compare how it goes month to month- chances are, you'll start to notice changes that you didn't even see looking in the mirror! it's way easier to spot differences looking between big chunks of time than it is looking every day.

[Actual interview](https://wyborcza.pl/ksiazki/7,154165,25646029,andrzej-sapkowski-wiedzmin-to-fantasy-i-basta.html?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=SM&amp;utm_campaign=FB_Gazeta_Wyborcza&amp;disableRedirects=true).

Quotes:

&gt;As far as I remember, skin color isn't discussed in detail in my books, so the adaptors can freely show their craft and everything is allowed, that's how it could have been, after all.  
&gt;  
&gt;I think there's a need to repeat this: the Witcher is a classical and canonical fantasy, there's as much Slavic spirit in it as there's poison on the tip of a matchstick

This is from a man well known for having strong opinions about his ownership of the Witcher concepts and about other people's interpretation of them. Yet he makes it very clear that choices about the ethnicity of Witcher characters is one thing about which he is extremely relaxed. A fair number of fans, though, not only are much less relaxed about this but seem to think that Sapkowski is either lying or delusional about this.

I do wonder how this kind of Witcher fan managed to read the books or play the games. Both the books and the games have strong anti-xenophobia messages. Geralt mostly manages not to be xenophobic (his sympathy for non-humans is made clear) but his sustained hatred of Cahir just for being a Nilfgaardian is lamented by his friends and companions and he eventually acknowledges his mistake. And yet we see some game fans idolising Radovid's race war and some Witcher fans desperately uncomfortable with non-white actors in the show. Go figure.",1654041774

Happiness is something that theoretically could be measured scientifically. We just don't currently have the tools to do that. But we have some understanding of how we can improve society. We can look at various situations and say with confidence that one is better than another. For example, I'm sure you think it's better for you to have a house than be homeless.

The gap between the tow truck and the car in front wasn't going to be large enough for the Porsche for a considerable amount of time. If the accident hadn't happened, it would likely have been even longer, since the car in front was ostensibly going to let the pedestrian pass first.

"toledo","t5_2qlrv","Lorraine Hotel revamp, St. Vincent garage demolition to be heard by plan commission
Trevor Hubert The Blade thubert@theblade.com
3-4 minutes

Plans are in the works to revive the vacant Lorraine Hotel in downtown Toledo, according to the latest city plan commission report.

The proposal would turn the property, located at 1117 Jefferson Ave., back into a functioning hotel.

According to the report, the plans for redevelopment would include 105 guest rooms, a first-floor caf√©, a rooftop lounge, and a lower-level ‚Äúspeakeasy.‚Äù

Located in Toledo‚Äôs UpTown district, the hotel is also supported by the UpTown master plan established in 2019, which calls it one of several buildings that ‚Äúcontribute to the unique and historical and cultural heritage of UpTown.‚Äù

The property was built in 1925 and was most recently active in 2019 and was housing tenants. In 2020, the owners of the building through Sierra Real Estate LLC were handed down multi-year prison sentences for running a $3.9 million fraudulent real estate investment scheme.

The owner is listed as 1117 Jefferson LLC out of Canton. Records from the Ohio Secretary of State‚Äôs Office show the LLC as being founded in January, 2021. The plan commission report does not provide a name for anyone affiliated with the LLC.

The official request listed in the plan commission report is a zoning change from limited industrial to downtown commercial, and also states that the current building ‚Äúconforms to the description and character of the requested zoning district.‚Äù

The plan commission staff has recommended approval of the zone change.

Separately in the report is a request to review plans to demolish the parking garage and build a new parking lot at Mercy Health St. Vincent Medical Center, at 2213 Cherry St. Plan commission staff cites structural concerns with the garage, deeming it ‚Äúunsafe for use for several months.‚Äù

Matt Sapara, vice president of business development and advocacy for Mercy Health, said that the project is just one piece of a larger effort to remove blight and help revitalize the area around the hospital.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a dinosaur, it needs to come down from an aesthetic perspective, and the fact that we have enough parking to service our employees and our patients, and their families,‚Äù he said.

He added that the hospital has a goal of completing the project by the end of the year and that there will be a net loss of a few parking spaces at the hospital, but the impact that it will have on visitors and staff should be minimal.

The proposed parking lot would include 127 parking spaces, including five handicap spaces. The lot would have access from Vermont Avenue and an adjacent parking lot to the west. Plan commission staff has recommended approval of the project subject to 29 conditions.

Both proposals are slated for further discussion at the plan commission meeting on June 9.

"blogsnark","t5_39xf0","Hi! I've had two insertions and two removals. Insertion is BY FAR more painful for me. (I don't want to scare anyone considering IUDs‚Äîthey were extremely worth the temporary pain for me! But I feel providers often don't prep people enough for the insertion process, so that was way more painful for me than removal.) This has also been the case for all of my friends with IUDs. 

I'd recommend taking pain relievers before removal if that's an option for you. Even though it's less painful than insertion, it's of course not pleasant. (Again, nowhere near as bad as insertion! It wasn't even the same kind of pain‚Äîmuch less sharp and just more bearable all around.) I actually took Percocet before my first removal, but I think that's because they were replacing my older IUD with a new one so they were preparing me for my second insertion and knew I was nervous about the pain. Percocet definitely helped make that removal and insertion less painful, and also made me less nervous. I know that's not an option for a lot of people for various valid reasons, but even something like NSAIDs may be helpful. 

They almost definitely will be able to find your IUD! The most likely scenario is that if you've had an IUD for years, the strings may soften and curl up around your cervix. This usually doesn't present any issues for removal. *Some*times it can make the strings a little harder to grasp, so removal can take a little longer. But it's very, very rare that they'll then need to do a more involved removal‚Äîif that were necessary, you'd probably have specific symptoms beforehand indicating that something's gone wrong with the IUD. (Which isn't common and is most likely soon after insertion.) 

Try to take deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth throughout the experience or even beforehand when you feel nervous thinking about it; I know that can be annoying advice but it legit activates your parasympathetic nervous system to help combat your body's anxiety response. Good luck!!",1654041776

The mammary glands make milk on demand, but also get trained to make milk in advance if you're breastfeeding or pumping at certain times of the day. They also only make milk after pregnancy hormones tell them to (though for some people if they stimulate their nipples frequently every day for weeks, they'll start lactating eventually).

Anyway, if you're lactating and you don't remove the milk, your breasts can get big and full, kinda like balloons, but this is pretty painful and can lead to blocked milk ducts and breast infections. So milk balloon breasts are not desirable to have.",1654041776

Their diet is primarily rodents, but they will also eat frogs, birds, and their eggs. Lake Erie/Lake Michigan populations are particularly fond of rodents, with some individuals subsisting almost entirely on voles (*Microtus*).

*P. vulpinus* are habitat generalists and use prairie, meadows, marshes, fens, agricultural land, sand dunes, oak savanna, and woodland. Lake Erie/Lake Michigan populations utilize similar habitat, but are more strongly tied to marshes and other moist, grassy areas.  They sometimes turn up in residential and even urban areas in some parts of their range, especially in the suburbs of Chicago.

A closely related and morphological similar species, the Western Foxsnake *Pantherophis ramspotti*, ranges west of the Mississippi River, and the two are known hybridize in a narrow zone along it.

--------------------------------------------------------

Like many other animals with mouths and teeth, non-venomous snakes can use them to bite in self defense. These animals are referred to as 'not medically significant' or traditionally, 'harmless'. Bites from these snakes benefit from being washed and kept clean like any other skin damage, but aren't often cause for anything other than basic first aid treatment. Some snakes use venom from front or rear fangs as part of prey capture and defense. This venom is not always produced or administered  by the snake in ways dangerous to human health, so many species are venomous in that they produce venom, but considered harmless to humans in most cases because the venom is of low potency, and/or otherwise administered through grooved rear teeth or simply oozed from ducts at the rear of the mouth. Species like Ringneck Snakes *Diadophis* are a good example of mildly venomous rear fanged dipsadine snakes that are traditionally considered harmless or not medically significant. Many rear-fanged snake species are harmless as long as they do not have a chance to secrete a medically significant amount of venom into a bite; [severe envenomation can occur](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23800999) if some species are [allowed to chew on a human](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004101011831016X) for as little as 30-60 seconds. It is best not to fear snakes, but use common sense and do not let any animals chew on exposed parts of your body. Similarly, but without specialized rear fangs, gartersnakes *Thamnophis* ooze low pressure venom from the rear of their mouth that helps in prey handling, and are also [considered harmless](https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/theres-no-need-to-fear-that-garter-snake/). Even large species such as *Malayopython reticulatus* [rarely obtain a size large enough to endanger humans](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/108/52/E1470.full.pdf) so are usually categorized as harmless.

There is a reason why everyone shits on Frodo in the movies, and it's because PJ is never once interested in showcasing his resilience, courage, and strength. When Frodo falls to the Ring in Mordor in the movie, it's not tragic or sad at all. In the book, it's extremely shocking because we are actually shown how great and strong Frodo is throughout the book. His fall is a genuine arc, and we feel it a lot more because of that contrast between who Frodo was and who he becomes at the end. 

Furthermore, Tolkien makes it clear that Frodo's sympathy towards Gollum was a good thing, and that Sam's mistrust was wrong (Gollum would have repented if not for Sam). PJ portrays Frodo as an idiot for trusting Gollum and Sam as a hero for mistrusting him. A completely baffling change.",1654041777

The current state of things can not be sustained which is why growing numbers of Western males are subscribing to the ""enjoy the decline"" mentality.  
You see hedonism and degeneracy running rampant. 

Western males see the market, more specifically what Western females have become and growing numbers of males are opting out. Whether that is MGTOW - Sex dolls - life long bachelors - the sexodus or whatever else.

The concern comes from looking at the market or pool of women out there. Try as much as you can there will be corrupting influences on daughters. So they might end up just another 304 or like the Ukraininan girl that ended up a Dubat porta potty (look it up), or worse.

Males see so many females demand traditional men but are not traditional themselves. Seek out ""good men"" but are themselves not good women, and more often than not are the end of ""good men"".

He blamed this on an imaginary friend he had ( that is very much alike me ) when he was little, claiming ""you can't just get rid of the old thing. it still lingers."" I assumed THAT was the reason why he was attracted to me, but another alter confirmed that it was just an excuse he was using to fall back on. 

I actually asked about talking to him again today, but the alters were pretty wary about it still. To be fair, the thought of him makes me want to puke, but if it stops him from hurting anyone else, I'd gladly confront him.

"liberalgunowners","t5_2vjre","I've been called selfish and told that it was people like me who are to blame for gun control never getting passed because we side with conservatives on gun issues. People have called my liberalism into question, too; which I didn't care at all about because I am further left than a liberal. When I joked that if you go far enough left, you get your guns back, people have informed me I am not, in fact, Rambo, John Wick, etc, which was also truly eye opening as I never even realized I wasn't an unstoppable killing machine of righteous indignation because the way some people react to hearing I own an AR-15 and conceal carry a pistol you would definitely suspect they think that of me.

I literally ignore all of the flaming and just encourage them to buy a gun themselves because the police and military are never going to do the dirty work of confiscation for them. So it might be up to them to clean up the neighborhood, and it would be pretty hard to forcibly take weapons from armed people when you don't have any guns yourself.

I don't have a lot of patience for the arguments because I used to be heavily anti-gun myself but the epiphany that the police aren't here to protect us and that the gun culture of America is never going away made me realize I might as well have some guns too just in case shit hits the fan.

**Hi, looks like your post's title hasn't complied with rule 5 regarding our formatting**, and has been removed.

You are required to title your post as following: ""*[platform][estimated year] Title of post*"".

*As a dumb robot*, I am *only looking for the [square brackets surrounding your text], and not the text itself.* I'm not very smart, and your formatting of your title *must* contain both the platform and the estimated year, and those two things must be enclosed in square brackets, to give context to your fellow solvers.

Your post **has been removed** at this time. You can always come back here to your post, and your previously submitted content will not be lost. You are welcome to copy-&gt;paste your content, and make another post with the corrected title.

If you are for any reason unable to do this, or you wish to make a post you feel should be exempt from rule 5, you may always feel free to contact the moderators from the link below.

I have spent plenty of time in academia and higher education and can appreciate the issues with taking a grade point average from a small number of papers and extrapolating that to your quality in your profession.

For context/an example my first year GPA was weak \~6.8-6.9 and my final GPA averaged over 5 years was a shade over 8 - first year can be weird. I work in software engineering and some of the finest developers have shocking academic records and/or didn't even attend higher education.

Oh lol. I was evidently thinking of something else :') (either that, or the scene was heavily abridged or something, but it's been years)

Well, as I said, I considered the first season of the anime to be the most faithful adaptation, so I guess wait until you've read up to volume 11 and see if you agree then? Most of the ""darker"" stuff happens later on in the series (well, from volume 7 onwards), and I guess you can't really comment on that if you haven't read those books, so‚Ä¶

Also

&gt; It doesn't shy away from mature topics but also doesn't indulge in them

Yeah, _in the anime_ lol. I definitely remember volume 7 and volumes 9‚Äì11 having _much_ more mature and nuanced takes on their darker themes.

&gt;!Haruhime is still a virgin, though, so that at least wasn't anime-original.!&lt;

&gt; Word count

I agree, but it's still pretty much the only sensible metric you could use that wouldn't require some kind of machine-learning model.

&gt; New to light novels

Ah, I figured. Well‚Ä¶ As you read more light novels, it's pretty much guaranteed that you'll either become more pessimistic about anime adaptations of light novels or you'll at least appreciate that that's a very common view to hold among people who read a lot of light novels.

You said in your earlier comment something vaguely to the effect of ""if the differences between the  DanMachi anime and light novels make the anime a bad adaptation, then every anime adaptation of a light novel series is bad"" and well‚Ä¶ Yeah. Pretty much. It's similar to how in general, book readers will complain about film adaptations of the books (and justifiably so, I'd imagine, given that the word count : runtime ratio would be a lot worse most of the time). And in the case of DanMachi, I think people judge it a bit more harshly because it's a full adaptation of the light novels, meaning that we judge it not as a glorified ad but as an actual adaptation, and the series is immensely popular.

In contrast, for example, (although I was slightly downvoted for saying this lol) I praised the Seirei Gensouki: Spirit Chronicles anime on the series' subreddit despite it being worse than the DanMachi anime in pretty much every way, because it was a lot better than I had expected and it seemed like the kind of series that would only get a single season, meaning that I judged it more leniently, more on the level of ""does this capture the spirit (ha) of the series that it is advertising"" rather than ""is this an accurate depiction of the events and tone of the series that it is adapting"". Also, while idk if you've watched the series, the series as a whole is less ""deep"" than DanMachi, so if you skim over some detail in an anime adaptation, it's not the end of the world and the viewer is unlikely to miss something later in the series as a result.

&gt; KonoSuba

Oh, never mind, then. I asked because it's a good test for how good people are at reading tone/how much they care about tone (I think that's probably the series with the most different tone between the anime and the light novels among those that I've both watched and read, but as far as I can tell, it's fairly unusual for people to notice that, because the anime is vastly more popular in English than the light novels, the series is a fairly common starter light novel, and the difference in tone isn't _that_ obvious to the point where everyone would notice it if it's their first time comparing a light novel series to its anime adaptation)",1654041781

"Judaism","t5_2qi67","&gt;The exceptions will be German and Dutch and considering the UK is neither then that again points to 6.

The Jewish community in the UK was originally founded by a mixture of Jews from...drumroll please...the Netherlands and Germany.  I am told 3 hours is the default in England.  It's not just in terms of waiting after meat, lots of Ashkenazi British things are more German in fairly obvious ways than the norm in Orthodoxy in the US.  Because German Jews very heavily influenced minhag hamakom in England in general, which is reflected in the communal norms for waiting after meat.

&gt;this is in the S""A and also Rambam, Rama, and Rif anyone under 6 is the exception to a very large rule

This is kind of circular--if the Rambam and the Rif say something so does the S""A generally, so he's not an additional data point.  And the Rif and Rambam usually agree, so really you're just saying ""the Rif says and people who usually agree with him don't argue"".  If you have no communal or family minhagim there's no particular reason to pasken like the Rif whenever the Rambam doesn't disagree.

But again, even if there were, or if one thinks we should care about family minhagim that weren't actually passed down in a particular family, the minhag hamakom in the UK really is to not wait 6 hours.",1654041783

My current pup is a 10 month old GSD and she's a whirlwind of emotions. She improves then regresses, impresses then makes us tear our hair out. We're lucky she's really lazy so one 45 min walk a day or 15-30 min long leash play is usually enough to calm her down but depending on the day she's either lazing on the couch after or running around bringing us toys and eavesdropping on the neighbours (then barking!). She still only naps in her crate. She's also reactive to other reactive dogs so it can be exhausting doing exposure training. But overall she's shaping up to be a great dog.

"badwomensanatomy","t5_2zlzd","Caster Semenya grew up not knowing there was anything different and it's just how she was born.

She's never said it but the governing board had specificly targeted events she competes in and applied rules to those who have a 46XY karotype, so many have infered that her having elevated testosterone due to androgen insensitivity since they've basically made a 12 year legal battle to ban her from competing. 

With the amount of legal battles it's certainly a form of intersex condition but for obvious reasons she has no obligation to say what. That's her business and it's been an absolute vendetta to ban her. She's under no obligation to tell the public definitively why they've targeted her. I do rather like her stance of, 'I'm a woman with naturally high testosterone, deal with it.' Michael Phelps has ridiculously long arms and big lungs. Basketball players are naturally tall. Horse jokeys are small. Marathoners tend to be naturally thin with long legs. Usain Bolt is naturally a beast. Caster Semenya is one, too.

"JoeRogan","t5_2s4tv","This is such a shit explanation. Yes, there was a smear campaign against her, but there was also a sizable amount of negative media coverage against Trump.

She lost because she simply had no identity other than ""I am a middling politician who supports slightly left wing causes"". She had no brand, she had no singular message, and she had no personality.

Her, John Kerry, and Al Gore were basically the same candidate. Intelligent career politicians with little to no charisma and emotion. Hillary was on the back burner because she did not put herself in the front. She basically took the election for granted as won and barely tried. Even her campaign motto was ""Love Trumps Hate"". She even mentioned Trump in her campaign motto.

She was basically a slightly better spoken Kamala Harris, and she lacked anything that actually made her stand out. She had no central identity, no real message other than ""Hi I'm a Democrat. Vote for me.""

The only people who actually articulated her views and stances were her supporters. She herself did little to nothing to win the vote. And blaming her loss on 'isms"" and smear campaigns is short-sighted crap. She lost because she dropped the ball...period.

"XiaoMains","t5_38f7wb","&gt; Sayu doesn't have the battery capability like Jean does but you list her as a f2p option.  

Sayu and Jean actually have very similar battery capabilities, and Sayu can actually be better. Sayu Quick Hold E generates 3 Particles. Jean is RNGd with 2 or 3. People usually just favor Jean because she's easier to utilize, her healing is much better and she can do lots of damage on top of it.  

So now you have two completely budget options, Sayu and Sucrose. And EMC will still require way more effort to build, while bringing absolutely nothing else to the table. Putting that on a generalist guide seems pretty off-base, even if it works for you.

&gt; as long as Favonius sword procs.

I think you underestimate just how expensive EMC gets compared to Sayu and Sucrose simply because you're relying on this. This is suppose to be a generalist guide that even the simplest dummy can follow. If EMC requires investment in

1. When somebody is right on top of you. QE simply isn't as reliable at point-blank range and with EQ you got that split second to aim your Q in the exact spot the enemy is getting knocked back to.
2. Surprise factor. You can use it to shake up the enemy if they start adapting to your patterns, but it's more of a novelty than anything.

Why you don't want to use EQ over QE.

1. QE is faster.
2. QE hits at the same time, so you can OHK people if they don't react immediately.

"suicidebywords","t5_3on1q","Most political beliefs can be simplified and categorized into a couple basic groups, individualism and collectivism. Political beliefs that fall under individualism are right wing and tend to support hierarchy or power/dominion over others in various ways. So right wing beliefs that men are naturally superior, stronger, the head of the household... Often lead to controlling and oppressive relationships (even in small less identifiable ways) where women are subjugated by their male partners.

This is pretty much the normal default monogamous relationship, comes from a long history of oppression over women and thus sex becomes less consensual and desirable as it becomes more of an obligation.

Relationships that have a more equal, respectful, collective power dynamic would include polyamourus relationships but also monogamous relationships where the female is trusted with self autonomy, where they can do things without being shamed or guilt tripped like have male friends, dress how they want, be treated as an individual and as a partner instead of that old 1950s family lifestyle and that ""my bitch wife"" boomer style of ""humor""

Basically when you're treated with respect and both partners are fully consenting, the sex and chemistry tends to be better and more genuine.

Politics play part of most aspects of our lives, and politics go beyond supporting a party or politicians. Politics are your perspective on life, what we think it means to be human, how to best live on this planet, how to organize society. It is a lot of things.

"TrueOffMyChest","t5_2yuqy","Just going to point out that OP is losing weight. Given this conversation and her unhappiness, that could quickly turn into an eating disorder or already BE an eating disorder. If that's the case, for her own health and psychological safety, she should consider whether his attitude will continue to impact her health and psychological wellness if she tries to keep the relationship.

Weight loss because you want it is fine. Weight loss because you are afraid to gain weight and lose love is NOT. This type of unhealthy loss is incredibly damaging and easily regained-starting a yo-yp effect that can easily become morbid obesity. That may further damage OP's relationship, but more importantly, it may because something OP has to contend with for the rest of her life.

Preserving her marriage SHOULD NOT come at the cost of her physical health.",1654041786

[1 in 6](https://1in6.org) does great work for men.  They do also work with a number of feminist orgs too and are recommended by both RAINN and MeToo.  While primarily focused on SA, they do help men facing IPV get resources.

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","So Anarchy involves order. The symbol is literally an A (anarchy) inside order (O) It‚Äôs not a free for all like everyone assumes. 

Anarcho-communism would run like how a roommate or family household runs. There‚Äôs still personal and private property and you can run businesses, but I think for now it‚Äôs just a really good lens to look at the world through and use the ideas it spouts to think of other methods of sufficiency and aid that individuals themselves can implement and stop relying on one monolith system that controls all form of violence (police,military,etc)

Look into mutual aid groups or food shelters- those are anarchy in action.

You really gotta chill with the personal attacks. It doesn't help with the conversation.  


The police not going in is a completely different issue. They 100% fucked up. It's inexcusable and I hope it results in police losing that right to safety that they get when they put on the badge. Like uncle ben said, with great power, comes great responsibility.

They will be called HD phones (because we stopped using FIRST as an acronym a while ago (now we use GET) (lol just realized it would be funny if they were called GET phones)) anyway, the new phones are definitely better from what I've been hearing as a TFC (Technology Field Captain). The new phones are still from Motorola but they are slightly thinner and they are also running Android 11. Currently FIRST phones are running Android 4.4.3. From what we've been told, the new phones will be able to scan pallets from the ground. They have more RAM built in so that way you can have more apps in the background just like your own personal phone can. Also the phone application will be going away and I believe it will be called communication where not only will you be able to call other associates in the building but also text and possibly send pictures as well but only within the store. Also the goal is for every associate to have a phone at all times. Surveys were conducted to see the peak amount of associates at any given time during the season and the store should be given that many phones plus a few extras down the road. Also, when you log into these phones, each phone will not have a dedicated extension, instead, the phone will assign you an extension after you log in depending on what department you will be in for the day. So there won't be any more fighting over who has your extension. However, there is still a limit on how many extensions there are per department. Not only that, but if you need to cover another department at the same time, you can log into two different extensions at the same time maybe more.",1654041787

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; No cars are selling for 20% of their purchase price with only $60,000 miles on them.

No doubt. No car salesman I know buys new. They all buy cash a 5 year old car and keep it 10 years. That's optimum value retention while avoiding big ticket maintenance.

&gt; Also, if leasing is such a good deal, why would dealers offer it? They aren‚Äôt just screwing themselves over to give you a good deal.

This is poor people thinking, that there can't be a winner without a loser. Capitalism is the first economic system in which there can be mutual benefit to both parties.

&gt; Leases usually have low mileage limits with penalties for going over, so you are returning a low mileage car they are happy to resell and now you need another car.

Precisely, an in return, you always have a new car. If you need a highly reliable car, as you describe in your scenario, leasing has more benefits by far than buying. That was my point all along. Buying new is strictly inferior.

&gt; Leases are good if you want to stay in relatively new cars and don‚Äôt want the hassle and uncertainty of selling your used car yourself.

That's a narrow view assuming a private sale. A trade is far more certain.

&gt; I bought an equinox in 2015. It has 74k miles and I don‚Äôt care what it‚Äôs resell value was at 5 years because I had no intent to sell it at 5 years.

So you bought a used car at nearly 40% depreciation because you agree buying a new car is stupid for most people, including you, apparently, and you implicitly agree.

And it still doesn't mean owning is the smarter option in the long run. There's a huge stigma against renting and leasing.",1654041788

Absolutely nowhere in the code does it state people with guns that don't adhere to the requirements will have their guns confiscated. It's a penal code attempting to prevent future acquirement of actual assault rifles.

Upon [further research](https://www.firearmspolicy.org/assault_weapon_splainer_why_some_featureless_guns_might_still_need_to_be_registered_as_assault_weapons_in_california), which you clearly didn't do, it appears that you are only required to **REGISTER** those assault rifles, and that if you don't, you then run the risk of incurring fines and other potential criminal penalties.

So, as I expected, you are entirely wrong. American's guns are absolutely not being taken away. Americans who have assault weapons who don't register them have the CHANCE of them being taken away.

You should educate yourself more. Which is basically just learning how to read a handful of words.",1654041790

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","I always got time for a fellow cfb fan, even if this is agony inducing. For some background, Blake got promoted to being the Miami AD from head of ticket sales essentially because he was the only guy they were sure wouldn't leave which is really a bang on way to start a tenure lol. Here are the high level points: 

 - Blake famously tried to retain Al Golden after losing 58-0 to Clemson before our biggest donor at the time thankfully overruled him 
 - Despite being touted as a ""great fundraiser"" Blake was completely unable to fundraise any money for an indoor practice facility until Mark Richt showed up and donated his own money into the program. He literally was 
   unable to launch any other major facility renovation  
 - He essentially let our baseball program atrophy, for reference Miami's baseball program is almost as prestigious as it's football program, letting Jim Morris ride off into the sunset killing our tournament streak and then hired 
   the son of one of our biggest boosters to replace him essentially hiring an unfireable coach 
 - He also managed to let our basketball program atrophy after the FBI scandal with three horrendous seasons in a row with no pressure on Larranaga whatsoever, the basketball team also literally went on an elite 8 run after 
   they named the new AD which while not correlated is still funny 
 - He managed to botch what was essentially a get out of jail free card when Mark Richt retired and left his entire buyout on the table...only to turn around and pay Temple 4 million dollars to hire Manny Diaz 6 hours after 
   Richt retired. Apparently it's because Manny gave him an ultimatum that if he didn't hire him that day he wouldn't take a call for the Miami job, which means Blake managed to lose a negotiation where he literally had all 
   the leverage 
 - He sabotaged the attempted hiring of Alonzo Highsmith to help the football program at the start of 2020. Candidly I get it, but also they desperately needed someone who had any semblance of an idea what a high level 
   football program looked like and they rejected the one option they had 
 - When asked by one of our booster if given a blank checkbook and no restrictions what he would do to help the football program he said he would fix the locker room and hire some analysts...that's it
 - Its well known in Miami circle that Cristobal wouldn't have come back to work at Miami if Blake was still the AD, because Blake disliked Cristobal's intensity in recruiting (this one requires a longer story that I can get into 
    but that's like the highest of a high level summary) 

He's essentially a guy who was woefully underqualified to be at Miami and it showed through constant inaction and small thinking. Like I said before he was a crony of the boosters at Miami who simply want Miami football to exist as a brand and do no serious winning. Hopefully he learned something and can be at least decent at BC, because I don't wish the last decade we had under him in athletics on anyone",1654041791

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","&gt; Are you done with trying to 'fix' this marriage, or is there still enough room for an emotional 'Hail Mary' from your wife?

Yes, I am done. Our couples therapist told me in the last solo session that we could try another type of therapy (she used Gottman) but also said 3 or 4 times ‚Äúit is OK to be done‚Äù in various ways.

In the last couples session I was ambivalent towards that when it was brought up. If my wife was sincere and pushed for it I would consider it provided she did solo therapy at the same time and worked on the issues that the couples therapist suggested.

My wife seems to not have the interest and/or the capacity to change.  She had the very real threat of divorce hanging over her and it did nothing in terms of motivation.   

For now I feel like the right place for me is to stay where I am.  My youngest will be a teen in a few years - right now he is still very parent focused.  That will shift like it did for our oldest. Maybe then things will seem different and I may change my mind.",1654041791

When I was in hospital with Crohns it was basically like you describe. Terrible experience, lots of pain, tests changing - in my case they had to turn off the alarm on the heart monitor because  my heart rate was so high I triggered it just by rolling over.

And some of those visits they eventually found a treatment that would work - steroids and antibiotics usually - and sometimes I had surgery.

According to several studies in the UK, US and Australia, 50% of gay men have only 0-2 sexual partners in the last year.  19% have more than 10.  It's a minority that is driving the stereotype.  For the majority, number of sexual partners is probably indistinguishable from most straight people.",1654041792

"cuckoldstories2","t5_5erlpt","It was a combination of things. She got fired from a job she really loved, and it really messed with her head. Then she went through a mid-life crisis. The new job she got had her hanging out with people 15 years younger than her. She looked 10 years younger, and having had a kid very young, and struggling with approaching 40, she had a lot going on in her head.

In addition, we were going through a cycle for over a decade. She'd tell me she didn't want to sleep with other men. She wanted to be monogamous. But this fantasy was now a reality that had been repeated many, many times. So it was the center of our sex life, and I put it there. As I mentioned in the story, it was really hard to have sex without without my mind going to everything we'd experienced.

Then she'd be out somewhere and meet someone after a drink or two, and pretty much as soon as the next opportunity presented itself, and some young good looking guy hit on her, she'd be back at it. And I reveled in it. But more often than not it was about her gratifying her self esteem and sexual needs. I was rarely involved directly, and that was a point of frustration.

To be fair, hot single MILF out to get laid on a Friday night is a much easier sell than wife whose husband wants to watch. That narrows your field quite a lot. So she gets a new job and we set some rules. Basically, no fucking the co-workers. She says not problem, she wants to be monogamous, blahblahblah.

Long story short, she was going out with the crowd for work quite a bit. And guess what? She started fucking one of the guys from work. And she told him about our arrangement, that I was cool about it. And then she started going out with her work friends more and more. And coming home really late at night. And we had three kids. And she started telling me she wasn't having sex with anyone, but she was a shitty liar.

It became a problem. One night I said, ""You're never home. I feel like you don't want to be married anymore."" And she paused like a bolt of lightning hit her from the heavens, like she had an epiphany, and said, 'I don't.'

Then she assured me she wasn't in a relationship with anyone. I was a great husband, a great father. I didn't do anything wrong. She just decided she didn't want to be married anymore. I was still hopefully we could fix things, or worst case, we'd still have a great co-parenting relationship and be close friends.

Then I found out (after finding her cum-stained panties in the laundry one morning) that she was still fucking the guy from work and they'd been 'talking' for a while. She lied at first and said she had a yeast infection. Then she came clean.

The rest is history. I tried to save the marriage and the family, but it was a dead end. I really though if I tried hard enough, I could somehow put things back together, convince her to give it another change. I offered to go to couples counseling, everything. She wasn't having it. When she got fired, something in her personality flipped. I can trace the behavior back to that.

Needless to say, in marriage, nothing is as cut and dry as I described. I'm sure if she were writing this, she'd have some different spin that makes her out to be more sympathetic. For example, part of our cycle or pattern was, she'd hook up with some guy and have great sex. Then she'd gradually get sucked in, and her behavior would become more and more obsessive, until it started to make me seriously insecure. She was like an addict, and that's not an exaggeration. The more she got, the more she wanted. And eventually I'd start to complain and try to shine a light on how bad it was getting, and then she'd cut it off. And I think that cycle built up resentment in her. I'd encourage her to get fucked, she'd get fucked, she'd crave getting fucked almost every day until she wasn't spending time with me or the kids... lather, rinse repeat.

But after she got fired, she went from being a basically good, caring, decent person, to someone who constantly lied to get what she wanted. And I realized after getting fucked over repeatedly in the divorce, while trying to be a good guy for our children's sake, that she was no longer trustworthy. We made a series of agreements during the divorce, and she broke every single one of them. And I turned the other cheek, for the sake of my children.

I realized at a certain point that the woman I was married to and had children with no longer existed. She'd changed, like a reverse butterfly (in my eyes). I was devastated. It took me a month to be able to act like a functioning human being. 

The sad thing was, the guy she ended up leaving me for wasn't even her 'type.' She went for (reasonably) tall, thin, younger guys with big dicks. We used to joke that she had Big Dick Radar, but I think it was because she was so pretty, most guys who weren't hung didn't have the confidence to hit on her. This guy was older, average height, not very attractive, and she said he wasn't hung.

They're married now. I have to see them at events involving the children/grandchildren. We don't speak unless it's absolutely necessary. I've been remarried for 16 years to a woman who is the polar opposite of her. I'll get to that, eventually, in the future stories.",1654041792
"iphone","t5_2qh2b","Almost everything about it, primarily the user interface and the range and quality of included apps. 

The UI was absolutely revolutionary‚Äîboth in ease of use and in the amount of functionality it provided (not to mention the copious eye candy).  The keyboard seemed awful at first, until word got around that you had to trust the auto-correct like it was The Force, and just type quickly without stopping half way to correct everything manually.  Then there was pinch to zoom and the rubber band effect when reaching the end of a list. And the spinning carrousel date selectors. It was all not only highly functional but also delightful to use.

Aside from the huge (at the time) high quality display, you also had an enormous collection of various sensors that provided great quality of life benefits. Like motion sensors which auto-rotated the screen and proximity sensors that automatically turned off the screen and speaker when the phone was placed up to your ear for a phone call. The Maps app was amazing, including the way it used wifi to instantly approximate your current location and the slick way it provided driving directions. iTunes and Photos were great, of course, part of the much-anticipated ‚Äúwide-screen video iPod‚Äù. The Safari browser was revolutionary, providing access to the real web for the first time in a phone.

There were a couple other phones on the market at the time (Nokia) that had a similar collection of features, but these were insanely thick, heavy, and expensive models with terrible battery life. I didn‚Äôt know of a single person who owned one, and most people I knew didn‚Äôt even know they existed.

The main drawbacks at the time were the sorry state of cellular data networks in general, and the lack of 3G in the iPhone in particular. The phone was highly usable while on a decent wifi network, but far less so when relying on cellular. Some people also mocked the ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù $500 price tag, which of course is hilarious in hindsight.",1654041792

regarding your comment, yes you're absolutely right. at the risk of bending my statistics/sample size a little, i want to say that business plates (that are very clearly for businesses...) and classic car plates, are exempt. Again, if I had a classic I probably still wouldn't get a plate, but there's something about them that seems to fit without coming across as wanky.  In fact, I think classic car plates are often quite informative, you know, along the lines of ""65CADI"" on a 1965 Cadillac.

&gt; Our estimate was that laws that ban large capacity magazines are associated with a 49% lower rate of fatal mass shootings. On a per capita basis, we see a 70% lower rate of individuals killed in mass shootings associated with state bans of¬†LCMs.

https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2021/policies-that-reduce-gun-violence-restricting-large-capacity-magazines

95% of gun homicides resulted from 3 shots or less. Limiting all firearms to 6 shots maximum would not impact self defense in any significant way. It would however limit mass shooters like in Dayton or Las Vegas where the shooter had 100 round drum magazines.",1654041794

You have no idea about the treatment that this puppy receives on a daily basis, the amount of love that she gets and etc. Your argument was first about potentially disrupting service dogs (which, in this case, is irrelevant). This Starbucks has a sign and approval from the managers that it‚Äôs dog-friendly and we regularly witness service dogs inside together with regular dogs and no one is being disrupted. Now you‚Äôre upset about a leash when I‚Äôve stated in several comments that it‚Äôs literally behind her? üòÇ So which one is it?

I got my starter going a couple years ago, so it‚Äôs very predictable by now. I generally keep it in the fridge between bakes.

For this particular loaf, I fed the starter as normal, but never got around to mixing a loaf. So it sat on the counter most of a day, rose and fell back again, then went back in the fridge for a couple days. Yesterday I took it out and mixed up some dough, and baked it this morning.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

I have a BA but its in German Studies, which honestly WAS helpful and got me good jobs as a preschool English teacher, both online and in Cambodia, but then Covid happened so I left Cambodia and China banned foreign online teachers last August and now I'm at Amazon instead. I really want a degree in early childhood, and I got into two Masters programs, one was a service-oriented federal one but it still cost $20,000 upfront, and the other one was cheaper but still too expensive to take more than a single class. Then I tried going through CC and there was only one school (National University) that offers early childhood, so I did the application and then SURPRISE! JK! That's not available through Amazon, despite being listed on the CC landing page. Then I just finally decided to fuck it and try for Elementary Education bc kindergarten isn't that different from preschool, maybe? Which I'm doing through WGU (maybe). And they're very upfront about how I'll need to do 3 to 5 months of full time student teaching for free and I won't be able to work my regular job while doing it so God only knows how that will work with Amazon, and also with paying my bills. It's like this country really, really, really, really doesn't want people to become teachers. School is too fucking much, everything about it is so complicated. Amazon is being obnoxious about it yeah, but like... everything school-related is obnoxious all the time. Amazon sounds like its just more of the same.

And it is really hard because our egos are looking to protect us in a lot of ways. Granted, a lot of these ways are irrational or unhelpful in my case given the values I want to embrace... But it doesn't stop them from being there and it requires a ton of work to reframe these and learn new patterns and reactions. The work is completely worth it and I'm grateful for the opportunity, but letting go of control and finding acceptance when the alarm bells of your ego are going off is hard and probably not something most people want or need to do. This can make finding community of people who understand what you're going through difficult and the work can be isolating, even though the work being done is to help foster openness and connection (at least in my case).",1654041799

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","No, Vivi wanted to stop the revolutionary army, she just thought she had to do it by herself because she felt she had to take on all the responsibility. Luffy educated her on the fact that she did not have to do it all by herself because she had willing volunteers who could make their own choice to get involved. 

Sanji did not want to leave the crew and saying he wanted to is just being dense. He thought he had no choice in the matter and did something he obviously didn't want to do because he thought it was the only way to save the crew. He literally said ""no fucking way"" when first asked, and had to be blackmailed into going along with it. That's literally the opposite of wanting to do it. 

Luffy's exact words to Robin were ""if you want to die, then you can die, but do it by our side."" he wasn't going to force her to live if she really wanted to die, he just didn't want her to die in a way that she obviously didn't want, considering she'd been running from the government her whole life and only gave herself up when she thought she had to to protect the crew.

You're just purposefully misinterpreting those scenarios at this point. Luffy doesn't let his friends sacrifice themselves for him out of desperation because in all those cases they're obviously forced into that position and it's not what they really want. Yamato is not being forced to go by Oden's name, Yamato is choosing to go by Oden's name. There are no consequences to doing so, and no consequence to not doing so. So Yamato is not being pressured into it, does not feel like she has no choice and is not doing something she obviously does not want to do.",1654041799

It is not legal to possess more than that.  It is still a crime to manufacture, sell, etc.  

In other words what we have here is decriminalization. Localized to a single province. And temporary too.  It is not permanent at this point and can be revoked or not renewed at the discretion of the feds.

I am unsure about the travel restrictions as I have heard nothing about that changing.

The people I don‚Äôt understand are the ones who say ‚ÄúThis is **unacceptable** for the money we are paying him. He is mediocre and this contract is looking like a big mistake.‚Äù

*Lindor Ks or makes an error*

‚Äú341 million for this‚Äù

They‚Äôre the same people who boo players when they slump because ‚ÄúNew York high expectations tough love etc.‚Äù

Is the anger and negativity fun? Aren‚Äôt you a Mets fan? Isn‚Äôt Lindor a Met? For the foreseeable future? Do you think he‚Äôs not trying? That he‚Äôs relaxing in his new mansion, laughing at how he swindled the Mets, then strolling into the clubhouse with a smile, unconcerned with his performance? Do you think he hears boos from Mets fans and thinks ‚Äújeez they‚Äôre pretty mad, guess I better play better to get them on my side‚Äù?

Maybe! I don‚Äôt think it helps.

Instead, how about ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go Francisco!‚Äù instead of booing your own player?

I get it. Lindor represents a big decision that will affect the course of the team for years to come. You might think it was a wrong decision. But why get angry at him? The contract was offered by the front office and he chose to play in Flushing. He‚Äôs a Met.

It‚Äôs fun to hate the Phillies, the Barves, the Nats, the Cardinals, the Yankees‚Ä¶ to me it‚Äôs not fun to antagonize your own players.

This is what your title should look like:
&gt;    *AGE [R4R] - Description*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your title:

**1. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. Replace the first ""R"" with your gender and the second ""R"" with the gender you're looking for:** 
&gt;    Use only **M**, **F**, **T** or **A** for tagging gender. Use any combination for couples: **MF**, **FF**, etc.

**4. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject:**
&gt;    *[META] - Description*

You don't need evidence to make a theory, I just feel like both theories I mentioned in the post are sexist. The idea that women are attention seekers is obviously a sexist sterotype, but the idea that the difference are a result of women having more empathy for their loved ones than men feels like benevolent sexism.",1654041804

Bicycles are pretty much perfect already. Its very hard to inovate something thats near perfect. So when you see a new inovation its more in how the bicycle is being used. Then later on the geometry changes to suit its new use.

Current Gravel bikes borrow a lot of modern mountain bike geometry which weirdly makes them resemble 90's era mountainbikes or did. But as we'll see the geom will change to match better what folk want to use the bikes for.

I bet what we will see next, if we ain't already seeing it, is road bikes with suspension (as well as wide tires) and even extra mounting points for gravel touring. I might already be behind with that prediction.

Pretty sure i have seen x1 gravel bikes already with tubeless. So suspension thats a bit more aero and weight saving will be next.",1654041804

"YoureWrongAbout","t5_24nrjo","It's such a bummer. I absolutely **adored** this show when I first came across it and I was delighted every time a new episode appeared in Pocketcasts. It was unique because unlike so many nostalgia/pop culture-adjacent podcasts, You're Wrong About was in-depth and well-researched, focusing on a specific person or event.

But now it's just a potpourri of topics without a central focus, from ""torture museums are kinda fake"" to ""email is bad."" (also the YWA Patreon has 23,882 patrons. Even if every one of them was at the minimum $3/mo, that's ***$860,000 per year***. If the email is overwhelming, you can absolutely afford to pay someone to handle it)

The musical chairs of guests who have their own podcasts isn't benefitting the show, IMO. I find the actual content of the episodes kind of meandering but also vague, mostly just two people agreeing at each other without trying to educate or enlighten the audience. Previously, the show was actively edited down from 2x or more recording time. I don't think that's happening anymore and it shows.

Four of the last six Patreon bonus episodes have just been ""Let's recap a movie"" and 1) the last thing in the world that I want is yet another podcast where 2-3 people talk about a movie they watched and 2) Sarah already has a whole other podcast for exactly this.

If YWA were to take 3 months off and really figure out what the show wants to be, that could be of substantial benefit. I keep hoping the rough edges were just part of this period of transition to finding a new focus/co-host/etc, but maybe that's not gonna happen...?

As it is now, the podcast is... *fine*, but there are a near infinite number of podcasts that are fine. YWA was different and special and deeply engaging, and I miss that.

Regarding the rarity of those verions, technically they might be pretty rare. Knowing Konami they must have only printed a few thousand copies at most, possibly only for the european market. Pricing them is quite hard since a lot of sealed PAL copies I meet are the 2011 version, so technically they are the most expensive ones as well. As far as I know they are the same as the original PAL versions, only the printing date and the ratings differ.

 I never met one in the wild either but also the last time I ever bought a new game for the ps2 at a store was in 2013, when I found a copy of Persona 4 at an electronics store for 5‚Ç¨.

I'm currently jobless, this doesn't stop me from going to the doctor when I need it no matter what the reason, it doesn't stop me from having my dental stuff covered (though some more expensive things are not covered), it doesn't stop me from having my mental health stuff covered. I'm transgender and I get HRT covered. If I'm not mistaken I could get SRS covered if I so wanted (which many countries try to pass off as elective).

When I was a kid I used to see the USA as this idilic place, ""greatest country in the world and all that nonsense"". Then as I grew up I realized it's actually a nightmarish dystopia.

The first time I realized this was when I was seeing people on trans subreddits who desperately needed therapy saying that ""they just can't afford it"". It shocked me to the core and really made me understand how immensely privileged I am.

The (currently) most upvoted comment on this thread basically says ""i don't dare go to the doctor because it's so expensive"". It's (still) horrifying to read stuff like that.

"Pets","t5_2qh6o","This is really short-sighted.

When you buy something, you contribute to demand. When there's a demand, there's increased production to meet it. The more you buy, the more are bred for future purchases, and the more parrots that end up in stores.

I know that doesn't solve the issue of the ones that exist *right now*, but it isn't possible to completely 100% end all production of them overnight, anyway- the point is to reduce the demand for them by encouraging people to not buy them, and educating others about why they make inappropriate pets. Gradually (not all at once...), the demand for them would go down. Then it's not so lucrative to breed parrots anymore, so less people would breed them. There will be less of them in pet stores and being advertised on online market places, which reduces impulse purchases. The less readily available they are, the less likely they are to end up in bad situations with unprepared people.

So it's definitely not ""no issue."" If people want parrots right now while there's still a surplus of them, they should adopt them from rescues- people that aren't turning a profit by flooding the pet market with them.",1654041807

She didn't catch it, and yelled back, ""What?""  The coworker tried again, using the husband's name.  ""One more time,"" she replied.  I yelled back, ""Your husband!  You know, your helpmeet?""  I saw her stop what she was doing, turn around, look completely lost, as she replied, ""My elk meat?""  I think we all laughed about that one all shift.

"ClassicRock","t5_2r3kh","Skynyrd follows a basic formula, but its a comfortable one. Very much classic rock. PF albums are a lot more thematic and heavy.

Floyd was so damn creative: Cymbaline, Green is the Colour, Biding My Time, Lucifer Sam, Fearless, the worlds first grunge: Nile Song.

But even in their themed albums they had hits that dwarfed LS. Money, Wish You Were Here, Have a Cigar, Another Brick in the Wall. These were HUGE songs. And werent formulaic. 

Set and setting though: Skynyrd is a good time at the river and park, floyd not so much. So maybe the songs are better depending on  what  you want out of them?

I would vote Floyd. Bike is better than any song Skynyrd did.",1654041808

Yes, things have changed. You have two kids, COVID happened, your career took off even faster than you expected. But him wanting a career has *not* changed. 

Has he stayed in contact with people at his old job? Was his career one in which he had to maintain credentials or licensure? Does the new location in another state mean that he's have to start over on that sort of thing?

Does the new location have opportunities for the career he's in? Even if he had to take a step down from his most recent position, he could re-start and climb from there.

"peacecorps","t5_2rh24","Most RPCVs will always start with saying ""It depends"". Really, no two volunteers service is the same. But I can let you know what it was like for me.

I first served in a rural area, about 3-hours (4-wheel drive as there were no roads) from the provincial capital (which was 14 hours from Ulaanbaatar). It was in Galuut, if you want to see it on Google maps.

I had internet most of the time even though I was in the middle of nowhere. And the school had internet. The bigger problem communicating with back home was the time difference - it will probably be ""you"" that has to accomidate to their timezone - that means you might be getting up in the middle of the night talk to them. One time, I had them place a laptop on the table so I could see, hear and talk to everyone at Thanksgiving dinner, so that meant I had to be up at 3am in Mongolia. But it was worth it.

I had to move sites because of a security issue and was moved to Dalanzadgad, which is a provincial capital so internet was no problem.

I don't remember any other volunteers having an issue. But again, you will probably have internet access but it might not be consistent or on all the time. And download speeds will definitely be slower than you're used to back in the US, just an FYI.

If you have specific questions, I'm always available through the reddit chat.

Good luck. Mongolia can be a tough country but it is also amazing.

You basically have to run the broken stuff to have a chance, since 70% of the time you're running into a group of noobveil and RoB L2 spammers. Anything that can oneshot is pretty standard on invader builds. Basically escalation of arms because both co-opers and invaders are running into people that are running oneshot and broken stuff, so they run it to level the playing field. Everything is fair game in an invasion.

I just thought the point down was excessive since they didn't seem to be using any cheese weapons or spells. I prefer to encourage the players not running meta builds and gear.

Vyke's is also really common because the madness builds up and procs through i-frames, and the weapon art does a lot of chip damage over a large area. You probably won't see co-opers using it because it's not nearly as good for PVE as it is for PVP, since madness doesn't affect most enemies. A lot of invaders and an annoying amount of duelists run it.",1654041809

"CafeRacers","t5_2rudz","Thank you very much!! Yeah when I started it was a stock 82 kz550 ltd. I bought the bike for $1,200 with 6,000 original miles. It was a woman's late husband's bike. I explained to her I would take care of it, but I was going to make a cafe bike out of it. She was amazed and emotional when she saw what I had done to it. Said her husband would have loved it. 

I have about $1,000 additional in it on top of the price of bike.  I bought most of the stuff off Amazon. Turn signals are Revival Cycles SuperNovas. I don't have a parts list but I can get it for you by looking at my amazon past transactions. Exhaust wrap is DEI titanium from Autozone. Tires are Midas Enduro on front and Duro tire on rear. I kept the stock wheels so tire selection was very limited. 

If you ever have questions I would be more than glad to answer. It was a very fun project. Seat is universal but I'd love to have a custom seat made. I have no intentions of modifying the electronics or air box. I'll leave it like it is unless I get that custom seat, and I've also looked into a possible front fork conversion.",1654041810

"Battletechgame","t5_39c47","Sometimes it can help if you are editing the saves, completely quit out of the game, do your edit, then delete the .modtek cache folder (if applicable - you say you're not using mods though), before invoking the game again.

Make sure that when you're using that mod, that you scan the installation directory correctly and if you're running vanilla, don't select any mods like modtek. 

Infinite loading can be a sign that the save game is incompatible. What does the invocation log file say? Does it report any errors?

For editing the starting mech - you are much better off changing the simgameconstants.json file than mucking with a save game.",1654041811

or the post-partum depression on the mother giving away the child would cause some issues im sure.

either way i dont like the govt telling anyone what to do.

i think if u wanna kill ur unborn fetus, well, cool.

id rather u do it with the doc and not just drink till u almost die and hope u misscarry.  than if that doesnt work u just bringing in some FAS nightmare.

i think babies will just die in a more brutal and dangerous manner. so whats the point? seems like some war on drugs logic that i can just never wrap my head around.
