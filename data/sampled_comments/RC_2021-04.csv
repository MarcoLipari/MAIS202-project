"VoxelGameDev","t5_2ton9","&gt; I never had any problems with flat areas and often used a plane as a debugging shape, so that sounds odd. Could you elaborate that at all?

Sure. As far as I've read, it's a known issue with Dual Contouring + QEF that when normals are close to parallel, the solution to the QEF becomes less well-defined. I guess the intuition is that the QEF is meant to find the approximate point of intersection of a bunch of planes, and when those planes are all basically the same, there are a lot of approximate points of intersection.

That's just my understanding though, and as I consider it, I'm actually having more problems with curves and edges than I am with flat bits. So I guess I'm way off.

[It's mentioned in this tutorial under the header ""colinear normals.""](https://www.boristhebrave.com/2018/04/15/dual-contouring-tutorial/) There are some solutions proposed, but they're all in terms of modifications to the QEF stuff which I have no idea how to implement.

As for my own implementation, I've certainly tried it without the clamping (though 'clamping' is a misleading term I think, I'm not clamping the QEF solution to the cell but instead switching to a simpler algorithm) and it looks very odd.

&gt;I badly need to lose weight and keep up with keeping my apartment clean (I live on my own).

I step away from my work computer at the end of the day and just feel so done, I end up staring at my wall or ceiling and ordering junk food.

You've established a habit of shutting down after work ends.  I suggest breaking it by doing something radically different.  I'd personally try walking outside and sitting somewhere to experience the outdoor environment, even if unpleasant.  Once you're in this space, tell yourself out loud what you're going to do when you get back in and spend just some amount of time doing it.  Even one minute is fine if that's all you can give.  

The idea is to focus on making progress through small victories.  One minute of chores you mean to do is always better than zero minutes of chores.  Build on these victories while being kind to yourself when you stumble and ""fail"".  Just focus on your next small victory and give yourself credit for it!",1617235201

Since you dont value my insight on the difference between police training in the us in comparison with germany, france, the UK etc - do your own research.   


Its pretty difficult to explain, due to all the differences in our education systems. You need the highest degree of highschooleducation to apply .  


Becoming a police officers in germany means obtaining a bachelors degree in policing at an university combined with practical training like someone who wants to become a carpenter. Both are at least 3 years - but you would do both at the same time (the last one is why you get payed during your training).  
After there is one year of beeing employed in the ""Bereitschaftspolizei"" - those are big units of 100 Police Officers  who are used to secure soccergames, demonstrations or in areas where a high police presence is needed and to support local police if they need the manpower. After that you ll join a local police department. So thats 4 years of training.   
(At least thats the way in my state).  


Is this superior than the training police officers get in the US?  


Last but not least: German police is using deadly force 5-10 times per year. Meaning people getting killed. Thats about as many videos uploaded on the Youtube Channel PoliceActivity per month.",1617235201

"datingoverthirty","t5_34cyw","That's really interesting, but I do have one point on that comment that I disagree with. Actually, I don't totally disagree... It could be true some of the time. But it could be the exact opposite of true some of the time as well:

You state that giving feedback increases insecurity.

I think for a lot of people, not getting feedback increases insecurity. Now, I'm older and mature, and I'll generally just move on. But for a lot of people, not getting feedback means overthinking everything. Since they have no idea what's ""wrong"", they start second-guessing themselves. Was it the joke I told? Was it my opinion about the news? Was it the car I drove? Was I awkward when he touched my hand?

So I think a lot of people actually feel more secure when they get good feedback. It can settle a lot of those other insecurities. But the key is that feedback needs to be good... And I think that's where your comment about feedback increasing insecurity makes sense. Bad feedback will increase insecurity - Make them self-conscious about something they can't change or feel they aren't good enough for anyone.",1617235201
"buffy","t5_2sd68","Loooorrd, don't remind me... I  just realized the other day that The OC is now on HBO Max (I was *devastated* when netflix got rid it -- and by ""it"" i mean ONLY the original series, not the reboot... how does that make any sense at all??) so needless to say, I've been binge watching that the last few days and let me tell ya, that show went **haaard** on the early 00's trends... and I mean ALL of them... fuzzy, bubblegum pink newsboy caps? Check! Generic grey sweatshirts cut up to make a whole new super girly short sleeved top? Check! Tube tops and off the shoulder pieces layered *on top* of long sleeved shirts??? Check!! Something kitschy on literally every garment such as a unproportionate satin bows so thin it just droops and loses all shape except for the long ass tails that hang about 12 inches? Or how bout a flower made of the exact same material as the hideous shirt it's sewed on to so it looks more like a growth of fabric than some lovely foliage detail? CHECK!!! 

But perhaps the biggest offender of all, would be mama Kirsten Cohen's sandy brown hair riddled with chucky 2 inch sunflower blonde highlights placed EXACTLY ACROSS from each other on either sides of her part (because looking as far from natural as possible was of course, the essence of all early 00's fashion. duh). Then top all that off with crispy ends separated into no less than 65 sections which are all SWOOPed as fuck at nearly 90° angles, so as to achieve that hella tight ""just purposely spent 2 straight hours daubing the world's driest hair with a balloon"" ~lewk~ 

Yep. The 00's trend-fatigue is *REAL* on the OC lmao those stylists do NOT fuckin play... Shit, I'm not even half way thru S1 yet and those style crimes have already been committed *multiple* times over 😪 

So in conclusion, being that I was privileged with the life-hauntingly firsthand knowledge and experience of being a teenager during the early 00's, it is my qualified opinion that this will go down in history as being the most atrocious, most hideous, ill-conceived, poorly-executed, conceptually substandard era's in fashion of all time, by *FAR*, and I highly doubt any trend or era that has yet to come in the future will ever even come *close* to being as appalling as the 00's were and I will absolutely die on that hill.

I think his organization overstepped in the marriage of Chris Hogan. They made a reconciliation plan for him and his wife. I think this is better handled in a local church.

I think it is awfully hypocritical to fire a pregnant single woman while keeping Chris Hogan on staff. Chris is no longer at Ramsey, but he was probably kept on a year or two longer than he should have been.

Obviously his theology isn’t perfect. He is a bit mainstreamy and self-helpy. His doctrine of church is influenced by Craig Groeschel and Brian Houston, which leads to some deficiencies.  

But his teaching on money and wealth is Biblical. Spend less than you make, save money, invest, have a written budget. This is applicable to 90% of Americans.",1617235201

I’m not sure the best way to release posthumous albums other than to assemble them in a way that would make each project cohesive such as chronologically in a way, maybe with his most close to being “completed” works. I’m almost certain Circles was his final project that was still a WIP at the time of his death, but that still leaves nearly a decade of material prior to that. I’m also a fan of Jimi Hendrix. The posthumous releases have been pretty good over the years, although Jimi had far less material in the vaults. It seems like Mac had maybe 100 possible albums locked up. That’s a lifetime worth of music... There are so many beautiful songs and heavy hitters in those vaults and I’d just love to hear it all. The leaks that have come out unofficially just prove this. I believe Mac would want his material out there based on what he said a few times in the past. I bought Circles and will gladly buy anything else the label puts out with his family’s approval. I know us fans want more. We always want more but in this case it’s not really out of selfishness but love. We want more of Mac Miller to remember his legacy by, to grow with it, and share it with our friends and sure to be the new fans in the future.",1617235202

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have no issue saying when I don’t like things for petty reasons. I also generally let people have their fun so I wouldn’t go into a post that asks what’s a movie you love and then shit on people’s choices, even if I disliked the movie in question. That’s just mean. But in a post about what movie you didn’t like? It’s my petty time to shine. lol

Thor may have been speaking figuratively, though he was still pretty literal at that point in the movies, and Erskine obviously didn’t know Steve would be frozen for 68 years, but it’s still odd that Steve didn’t age during the 2012-2023 years in the present MCU, yet suddenly does when they need to write him out. I guess we’ll see what they do with Bucky re: aging to see if they fully threw out that the serum stops you from aging.

I’ll also be upfront that I didn’t like that they had to throw out the entirety of Agent Carter for the Steve and Peggy Endgame ending. I really loved those two in the first CA, but I moved on because they weren’t in the same time. Plus I loved seeing Peggy grieve, accept Steve’s death, and move on to fall in love again during Agent Carter. Then Endgame erased all that and you can’t say it’s a different timeline because they had Daniel Sousa, who Peggy fell in love with on Agent Carter, say in his Agents of SHIELD appearance that he and Peggy broke up unceremoniously.

I just think Tony deserved to have his happy settled life too, especially since it wouldn’t require convoluted time travel to do it. I really love both MCU Steve and Tony and, to me, Steve had the clearer path to sacrificing himself to save the universe and Tony had the path to finally retire and just be Morgan’s dad and Pepper’s househusband.

Having said all of that, I won’t sit here and pretend I won’t watch any more MCU things because I strongly disliked Endgame. I just wish it was a better conclusion for the original core, excluding Thor who is getting to stay on longer.",1617235203

Generally speaking the issue of self defense has and always will be this: ""Do you have the right to have legal access to effective defensive tools and do you have the right to defend yourself with potentially lethal force?"" If both of those answers are  no then only law breaking citizens will posses the appropriate tools for inflicting harm, if the answer to both those questions is no then the logical jump is that law enforcement will do it for you.

"boston","t5_2qh3r","Condensing slightly for the important parts. Just a complete and total failure by DCF. 

The Massachusetts Office of the Child Advocate identified a multi-system failure prior to the death of a 14-year-old Fall River boy with special needs.

The Mass. Department of Children and Families reportedly began investigating the family for substance use and abuse and neglect of the children less than a year after they moved to Fall River. In October 2017, DCF removed the triplets and a younger half-sibling from the home, the OCA said.


The triplets were living at a group home in Mass. in early 2020 when DCF began the process to return them to John Almond and his girlfriend, who still lived in the one-bedroom Fall River apartment, the OCA added.



“The decision to reunify the children with their father and his girlfriend was a serious error that was compounded by the pandemic,” the OCA wrote in a release.


On Oct. 21, 2020, emergency crews responding to the Fall River apartment say they found David emaciated, bruised and unresponsive, as well as Michael suffering from similar indications of abuse and neglect.

The brothers were taken to a nearby hospital, where David was pronounced dead. Michael was hospitalized for several months but survived his injuries. The younger half-sibling who was also in the home appeared uninjured and physically unharmed, the OCA said.



John Almond and Jacyln Marie Coleman were indicted Friday on charges of second-degree murder and neglect of a disabled person resulting in serious bodily injury, Bristol District Attorney Thomas M. Quinn III announced.",1617235204

&gt; In accepting a 2004 deal that saw the business partners’ entwined corporations plead guilty to felony tax evasion charges and pay over $36 million to the government, the judge said his only misgiving was that Kaiser was not personally indicted. Prosecutors attributed this to the difficulty of extraditing Kaiser from Cyprus or the Bahamas where they believed him to be living at the time.

Really what it is saying is two things. 

1. We do not want to sell weapons to governments we know are committing violent human rights abuses. The NDP opposes weapons sales to Saudi Arabia for the same reason

2. We do want to use some economic power to oppose the illegal settlements in the west bank. The existence of those settlements are clearly a detriment to peace and an example of settler colonialism.

Afterwards have her pick a number like 20 or 30, whatever she’s feeling, and that’s the number of points you need to earn an orgasm. You can work with her to assign points to each of your fantasies/punishments you told her, or let her decide. The more something pushes your comfort zone the more points you’d earn from it, ideally. That way you don’t necessarily *have* to do tasks that challenge your limits but it will get your to an orgasm faster.

"Bioshock","t5_2shl2","That idea was one of the most ludicrous of so many ludicrous things in the game ...

1) The US Government was much smaller and had much less tax money available (and a major Depression was just then starting)

2) Politicians  had their pet projects (and their own constituents to appease) and they argue endlessly about the limited money.  Projects take YEARS and with many deals to work out.  Bureaucrats involved would takke even longer.   It was businessmen in Chicago who actually funded the real  Exposition.   

3) There was such a tight game specified Timeline (Wounded Knee with 16 year old Booker was late 1890 and the Exposition started EARLY 1893) - Such a project as 'Columbia' would be a massive undertaking (even with 'Columbia' downsized to be a tiny fraction of the game shown size) and  that would bankrupt several years national budgets.

4) Unproven Technology - laboratory tricks arent enough to justify proceding with spending millions.

""Subsidies' usually are a small fraction of the money involved, and the rest has to come from somewhere else  (and private financing has a huge amount of complications and delays).

Involved lots of interesting info, some experiments, field research, and a couple field trips. I hadn't taken a science course since high school so that was kinda cool, and Professor Turner is a great dude.

Edit: I should mention, he knows that people from all different majors take that class because it doesn't have requirements and caters specifically to those students making sure that it doesn't require any knowledge that is like specific to earth science majors or something. A background in high school level science and a college level work ethic should be more than enough to get you going, but it's not that hard.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","It feels weird to say but the moment I realized I didn't have to drink is when I stopped. 

I come from a family of alcoholics and I just can't remember a time in my life when alcohol wasn't a big part of my family. My parent's marriage dissolved rather messily with a lot of drunken arguments involved. My dad was not a fun person for awhile. I can say he never physically abused us or targeted us kids, but he did often yell at my mom and has said a couple things that have taken me forever to start getting over. It ultimately lead to a bit of trauma and people drinking gives me way more anxiety than it should. I would drink occasionally after that but never that much. I hated being hungover and dislike the taste of most alcohol. I drifted more towards smoking weed and had my own set of problems with that. 

Had a friend(later boyfriend) at work mention he's never had a drop of alcohol in his life and it really made me think. Didn't occur to me I didn't have to do it at all. Never drank again after that. Dropped smoking too but that was way harder for me. Just passed my 1year mark of being 100% sober. 

I feel like it's worth mentioning that my dad really ended up turning around. Once my parents got out of that marriage, he found my stepmom and is in a better place. I called him to ask him a question about cooking chicken. We chatted for awhile and he apologized for multiple things. Honestly I'm just glad he's happy and moving forward.",1617235207

You have said your piece, it’s not open to negotiation, and everybody just has to get over it.

Who cares? If you like it, post it. There’s bound to be at least a few other people who’ll appreciate it, too.

Right, and it's a big question of importance *what* constitutes an infringement of rights and what doesn't, and who gets to decide. 

What you find to be reasonable may not be reasonable to all. A good example might be patent exclusivity for life saving medicine - reasonable people can disagree on whether it should exist or for how long. 

My point is that, in principle, we all acknowledge some language should be prohibited. Most people agree on on the examples you listed, but people do find disagreement in places. 

It's rare, to the point that I've never seen it in the ""wild"", that someone who claims to be pro-free-speech in principle is fully pro-free-speech; they often have the same reservations about prohibiting harmful speech.",1617235209

Everything you aree describing is tribal psych. Marketing takes huge advantage of it. 

One side of the sociopolitical fence is driven by it - the side that thinks name calling and rhetoric and lies and making things up is okay, because SOUNDING like your tribe and protecting others who do is more important than the actual ethics of the situation. It's the basis of a certain someone saying ""I can go put on 5th Ave and shoot someone and wouldn't lose any followers.""
Yeah, its true. One side hears that their leaders say or do shitty things and they circle the wagons and excuse and protect him, the other side judge the behavior and distance themselves. 

It's no different in fandom. Their arguments change with the wind. Whatever sounds right for the moment. Lots of personal attacks and name calling. 
All in the name of ""this is what I identify with and so I have to defend it.""

The thing that gets me is that ""fans"" and people online in general no longer seem to have or consider achievements or goals or values when they think about identity. It really seems to be a foreign idea to them. There's a lot of being anti expert. Constant character assassination of anyone who went to college or who has experience to present. It's always ""Oh no! This person thinks they're better than me! My opinion gets to be equal, too!"" So they look at whether someone sounds like they are on their side or tribe and present not being part of their tribe as lesser, which let's them feel better about themselves. 

 Ask the average person online to finish the sentence ""I am ...."" and they'll now say ""a PS fan"" or ""anime fan"" or ""gay"" or ""straight"" or ""Republican"" or ""Democrat"" or ""xyz fan"" or ""Christian.""
Always a club. 
Not ""I am on my way to getting my degree"" or ""a husband"" or ""father"" or ""the youngest NY Publishing Market buyer in the retail books biz ever (I was)"" or ""a literacy volunteer"" or ""moral, upstanding gal.""
No achievements or values or expertise. Just ""Stuff I like..."" And certainly not expertise because you'll be ridiculed for mentioning it as arrogant.  

There were always bad geeks, but we tended to be bright, progressive, educated and worldly, and far above all we were EMPATHETIC and treated people well. If you look at most Speculative Fiction you'll see that it's themes are extremely so. Very progressive. Spec Fic tends to make tribal groups out to be the bad guys. 1984 and Animal Farm are classic  examples. Religion and conservative cultural trying  to ""protect the old ways"" just because they let the tribe know who they are, and  Facists... all tribal thinking and always less concerned with the individual and actual ethics. Roddenberry Star Trek is the prime example.  I think a lot of us gravitated toward it and helped to shape it that way because we didn't fit into any group or tribe. 
We were smart enough to follow high concept and story and spectacle all at the same time so could enjoy this stuff. Once Star Wars and the computer revolution brought all the high concept and visual high concept to kids and our culture started teaching it to everyone, Joe Average could suddenly ""get"" and enjoy it. It became a marketing phenomenon. And all of the typical fucked-uped-ness of humanity ruined conversations about it. Leading to everything you mentioned.  

It breaks my heart sometimes. When I was 14 I wrote to Isaac Asimov's Mag of Science Fiction and asked what I should read. I had exhausted the school and local libraries. Isaac himself wrote back, sent me two issues, and included a long list of his and his friends books. 
My dad worked on Wall Street. I gave him the list and he ordered all of the books at a city bookstore. I read them all inside of 6 weeks and wrote to Asimov again.
He responded by inviting me to be his guest at a Sci Fi convention in the city. I met all of the white-haired gents of NY Speculative Fiction. I wound up friends with Isaac and Janet Asimov and with Jules Schwartz of DC and few others, but especially them. They took me under their wing. Isaac wrote a letter to UConn convincing them to allow me to create a Speculative Fiction degree. The first one. I have a BA in Science Fiction. 
Isaac was curmudgeonly and arrogant, but he EARNED that. He was an incredibly powerful intellect. But he also had that trait of the very intelligent that makes them sometimes stupid about interpersonal issues. I think that if he had Iived to see the internet and social media that he'd be TERRIBLY disappointed and confused by this stuff we are talking about. He ready complained about the American trend towards anti-intellectual and anti-expert bullshit. In a very real and understandable way it was anti-Isaac. Lol.

I plan to create a community garden as well, so at some point i will have free plant based meals. Entertainment will be free since i could just talk to the travelers that visit and the beach is a few blocks away.  


I did buy the land of course so that wasnt free. Doing anything in Mexico is a hassle and takes forever so my frustrations have increased during this project but after its built, i SHOULD be able to relax.

As I read your post, I felt your pain and I felt my own pain to know that you feel this way. I want to encourage you by telling you something. You cannot give another person the power over who you are. By believing your mother's abusive words about you, you are giving her the power to have the last word about your identity. Your mother gave birth to you, but she did not create you. Only the creator of something can give it it's identity. For example, only Apple can say that they created an ""iphone"". Only they have that right. You understand? God created all things and human being. He is the one who has the final word on what your identity really is. You are LOVED by Him! You are precious. You are valued. You were created for a reason. It was no accident. Everything about you was created on purpose and intentionally. God does not make mistakes, because He is perfect. I don't know if you believe in God or not, but I pray that you seek Him and learn more about your true identity. Your confidence, your strength, your hope and your purpose should come from Him alone. It's the only way to find true joy and peace. If you are interested in learning more about this, please let me know, and I'll be more than happy to share some things with you to help you become the confident woman you are meant to be. I'm praying for you!",1617235210

Already done. The demonstration lies in the absence of logical contradiction.

Yes, it's possible, in the sense that I have no information that rules it out.

"CasualChina","t5_jq5xd","**INGREDIENTS, JIANBING**

* AP Flour (中筋面粉), 180g.

* Cornmeal (玉米面), 60g.

* Mungbean flour (绿豆面), 60g.

* Five Spice Powder (五香粉), 1 tsp.

* Salt, 1 tsp.

* Water, 420mL

**PROCESS, JIANBING**

For this recipe you will need a gas stove, detachable stove grates (to double up on), a metal spatula (to use in place of that sharp sort of spatula/knife), and something to help spread the batter. 

For an alternative approach that's a smoother adaption to a Western kitchen, check out My Name is Andong's video instead: https://youtu.be/2eLbLEiW1Bk​

1. Mix the dry ingredients, then add in the water. Use a rubber spatula or egg whisk to incorporate the water and break up the clumps. Do not over-mix, but there should be no clumps remaining.

2. Heat up your large cast iron skillet to ~100C - medium high flame - then ladle in your Jianbing batter. Each Jianbing will use roughly a quarter of your batter. Spread it evenly, and if there's any missing spots, add a spoonful or two of batter to patch it up.

3. Once the batter is set and no longer liquidy (~15-30 seconds), crack 1-2 eggs, break them up, and spread them over the bing. Optionally sprinkle over some toasted black sesame seeds.

4. Wait until the edges curl up and the jianbing no longer sticks to the pan. This will take a bit. Depending on the intensity of the flame and residual heat in the pan (if making multiple), we've found that this will take at least three minutes, or up to eight. It can be a nice idea to adjust the position of the pan if certain areas are looking more done than others.

5.  Flip. Brush on your sauces and sprinkle on your toppings. Fold the sides over the toppings (we find it easiest to leave the ends open), slice down the middle, and stack.

**INGREDIENTS, TACO BELL MEAT**

We used pork belly in addition to beef because beef in China is often quite lean. We used loin, but feel free to use cheaper cuts like chuck.

* Beef loin (外脊肉) -or- chuck (牛腱肉), 400g; pork belly (五花肉), 100g.

* Salt, 5g; water, 30g. Adding and mixing the salt and water in with the beef meat paste at first will help it break down.

* Seasoning: 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp MSG (味精), 1/2 tsp cumin powder (孜然粉), 1/2 tsp spanish smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp cocoa powder, 1 tsp Mexican-style chili powder, few cracks of black pepper. Pretty sure Taco bell doesn't season this aggressively, but whatever.

* Chopped oats, 10g. 

* Slurry of 15g water chestnut starch (马蹄粉), 30g water, 1.5 tbsp tomato paste.

* Dark soy sauce (老抽), 1 tsp

* Water, 1-3 tbsp. To be added near the end of cooking.

**PROCESS, TACO BELL MEAT**

1. Dice the meats, then hand mince using a couple cleavers, ~5 minutes. We got this pretty pasty for this video, but you don't have to be as paranoid with this one as you do with a proper Chinese meat emulsion.

2.  Add the salt and water, mix well.

3.  Add the seasoning and the chopped oats, mix well.

4.  Add the starch/water/tomato paste mixture, mix well.

5. Medium high flame, fry the meat mixture and break it up as it's cooking. After ~8 minutes of continuous breaking up, the meat should be cooked. Add the dark soy sauce, mix well, and add in the water - how much water will depend on how water-y you'd like the mix. I added two tablespoons in the video, but feel that I actually could have added more.

**OTHER TOPPINGS FOR THE JIANBING**

* “Fire sauce"" - mimicked with a mix of two parts hot sauce to one part tomato paste

* Sour cream

* Shredded cheese

* Diced onions

* Tortilla chips (would likely be better with, like, a proper tostada)

* Diced tomatoes

* Shredded lettuce

And while we didn't include this in the video (because Taco Bell doesn't use these ingredients IIRC), brightening this up with a bit of cilantro &amp; a tiny spritz of lime would probably make for the most delicious end result. Oaxaca cheese would also likely be a more delicious option than our mystery 'mexican cheese' mix.",1617235210

Guns are more like a vehicle or something. They are useful tools but dangerous when used incorrectly or with malice. Cars and boats and the like are regulated a hell of a lot more than guns. 
The thing I cannot wrap my head around is how the gun manufacturers have so brainwashed a bunch of gun owners into believing that any regulation is bad.

"thanatophobia","t5_3jd8b","This is exactly how i feel. Infinity is terrifying whether it's infinite nothingness or infinite existence. Emotionally i strongly feel as though there is nothingness most of the time but when I think more rationally i believe that the reality is something we as humans can't even comprehend or have thought about. Mostly because i think existence and consciousness is so complex. I'm not a scientist or a philosopher so take my opinion with a grain of salt but i truly believe that the consciousness is an incredible and complex thing that isn't just chemical reactions in the brain and is deeper than that. I'd hope for reincarnation as I think that way you live on forever but not necessarily the same each time. Even this would surely have to come to an end though? So I'm not exactly sure. I like the buddhist view but idk if i believe that. I hope you find some peace with this, i completely understand how you feel",1617235211

There were not going to be any more cases if the Democrats listened to Don and stopped the virus from coming in in the first place. Which is what Don was alluding to.

Without Don, we don't have vaccines until 2025. He knew the science, he knew how to navigate through FDA bureaucracy and it is disgusting that Moderna and Pfizer refuse to give him credit. If the media was not so biased against Donald (who can ruffle a few feathers but is a tremendous man), he would be hailed like a Jesus Einstein. Smart and based, which he is.

"politics","t5_2cneq","And some of those poor people will argue against improving that system to the grave. That's communism, and communism is what made the Soviets evil, while pure free-market Capitalism is what made America great. Demented Reagan told them so, and he Made America Great Again. Decades of propaganda since, and Reagan was the greatest president ever, until Trump came along. The good red-blooded Americans beat the terrifying commie Soviets and everything was great. Also, the liberals want to destroy America and the right, just, Capitalist, Godly way of life. The TV and radio and preacher say so, a lot. And so life has gone on, the rich taking more from the cheering, bleating masses by the day. 

The melding of the Moral Majority and The GOP, along with a steady diet of open propaganda, has allowed this political party to get away with *anything.* In the two party system we seem doomed to follow, one almost must vote against that party, and that doesn't exactly help keep the other party in check, which is bad for all of us. Understand, the Republican rank-and-file feel under attack by Democrats and society at large. They are made to feel this way, and they *must* feel this way - it is central to their identity. They are conservatives who want to preserve the status quo which they percieve as *fair* and *just* or to regress to an earlier, even more unequal society. To be told that the status quo is not fair and just or stacked against them is an attack on their manhood and their worldview, and that cannot stand. The real racism is calling a racist a racist, the real hatred is thinking freedom of religion should extend beyond Christianity, and should not extend to pushing Christian 'values' on society at large.

It's mesmerizing to see the interconnectedness of our history. McCarthyism, Kennedy, King, Nixon, Reagan, HW, Clinton, W, Obama, Trump, Biden - this is all the same era, and it's an era in which the *far* right wing became the mainstream right wing, over a period of decades, pushing further all the time. The GOP threw whatever morals they claimed out the window, openly harmed the country, and were rewarded for it, over and over again. The hold they took on people after Watergate has allowed them to doom the country to benefit themselves, and they never saw a line they wouldn't cross for that end. Trump took the mask off and spewed their vitriol from the rooftops. Tens of millions of voters love him for it, no matter what else he did, because he made the *other* mad, and that's all that really counts.

This might be a bit of an aside, but also might explain why I find it kind of odd. Most of my family have names that are basically unpronounceable to the local population. But none of them demand to have their interlocutor pronounce their name perfectly. Most of them have simply chosen local common name. I think for me it’s the idea that we gotta kind of meet half way? You don’t get to decide some kind of demeaning nickname for me, but I should also try to find something that can work for most people?

I understand now that the neo pronouns aren’t the mainstream or expected of people; I think it would be helpful for this particular cause to explain that.

This has always been an anti-gun lie. 

[You're welcome to read exactly what the founding fathers meant in The Federalist Papers:](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed29.asp)

&gt;The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious, if it were capable of being carried into execution. A tolerable expertness in military movements is a business that requires time and practice. It is not a day, or even a week, that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a serious public inconvenience and loss. [...] To attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent, would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not succeed, because it would not long be endured. **Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped[.]**

"PoliticsandWar","t5_2zu0b","It's a nation simulator/browser game. You develop your nation by building cities and setting the city layouts (what resources they develop, commerce, power, military structures). It's all number stuff. There are in-game wars, you can choose to raid other people (though don't expect it to go without consequence), there are alliance level conflicts with a lot of coordination and preparation to conduct.  


It's nice to try and see if you'll enjoy it, but it's often not for everybody. A number of newer players tend to leave on the first day, don't know what's usually the cause but I think the game doesn't meet whatever expectation they might've had. People will leave if they join the wrong alliance, as a lot of the fun comes with the community you surround yourself with.  


If you're interested in playing it, really recommend finding an alliance. Usually, the recommended ones are Top 30. Look at alliance age and make sure to check the alliance description before applying. A lot of the alliances require you to go to their Discord for an application, as it allows them to get to know you and for you to be able to better communicate with your alliance. Ask around on the P&amp;W Official Discord about what alliances that they recommend, and so on. You get a lot of beige time as a new nation, so you don't need to rush with joining one, but you're still time-limited before that beige goes away and you're able to be attacked.  


Just make sure to always wait before immediately joining an alliance if you're getting recommendations. You'll want to wait and hear more, and then go to their discord and check the public section to see the general vibe in the discord.",1617235216

We have recently added the useful feature of Title Flair! You can set this manually by clicking Flair under your post once you have submitted your post, but if you missed it in the rules there is a much better way that will automatically flair your post!   

To do this simply add what your post is about in brackets before your title. For example for a Build Log you can type [Build Log] before your post so that it looks like this; [Build Log]My new awesome build!, and the bot will automatically set your flair to Build Log! This works for Build Log, Build Showcase, News, Hardware News, Hardware Release, Discussion, and Miscellaneous!

Also remember that this is a place for discussing and sharing our love of Gaming Computers! This is NOT the place for help building or determining what parts you should buy, that is better suited for /r/buildapc.  Troubleshooting questions should be directed to /r/techsupport. Thank you again!

Her travel stopped since summer of 2020 when she started going in and out of hospital for pain mngt. Today she was told she has a couple weeks left. Your brother's cancer may be treated through chemo or radiation or both. His cancer might not become metastatic (spread). He may never become stage IV (palliative). His outcome could be different than my sister. It's a total crap shoot on who beats cancer and who doesn't. Either way, it's really normal to feel like you're held hostage by this horrid disease.

"infj","t5_2r39a","When I was in 5th grade I began to cry every day waking up for school because I knew I would have to do it for more years. The same thing. Getting up in the morning. The same thing every day. I wake up early by myself, but being told to wake up early and go to school at this certain time always rubbed me the wrong way. That feeling of being told to do something doesn't motivate.

I'm not against work, as long as it benefits everyone to make a better world, healthy community and not just a few people benefit from it (unfortunately we live in a world where a few people benefit from the massive labor of others), but I really think that work should be more flexible. For example with office jobs at least, forcing people to go to work so early. And do office workers really need to stay at work for so long? I read many people at the office work maybe 3-4 hours and that's about it. That extra 4-5 hours is massive! People can do so much more in their day if they didn't have to stay in the office all that time. It's disgusting thinking about that wasted time. How about let office workers come in at any time in the morning they want? They can select anywhere from 8:00 - 11:00 if they want. That way people have more time for things and can still complete their work.",1617235217

I packed my bags last night pre-flight

Zero hour 9:30 A.M.

And I’m gonna be high as a kite by then

Don’t miss my tech stocks much, I sold them all

It’s better buying steel

With shares and timeless calls

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

'Till April brings me 'round again to find

I'm not the man they think I am at home  Oh, no, no, no

I'm a steel man

'Till April brings me 'round again to find

Steel man, buying all my calls to leave this town

Tech ain't the kind of place to raise your gains

It’s drilling straight to hell

And no buyers there to raise them if you did

And all this finance I now understand

Neglect my job five days a week

A steel man, a steel man

You take an exam for your permit, attend a class for your license, with another exam. You get a gun license, that has to be renewed when it expires. And like how you need a special motorcycle license, there should be special license for some types of guns (not a gun expert so I don't know what those would be). 

A mental health check is a necessary part of this exam. 

If you are guilty of doing things, such as open carry in areas where you are not supposed to, then you get a pricey ticket.

Of course, like with cars, you need to have your license and registration with you, and they need to be up to date. 

What would be the gun equivalent for DUIs? Whatever that is, if you're guilty you'd get your license suspended and possible jail time. 

Of course, If you fail, commit a crime, have too many tickets or whatever, you will not be able to carry a gun. 

And just like how cars are always modified to be safer and safer, there needs to be something that makes it safer for the people regarding guns. 

I'm all for banning guns completely, but treating them like how we treat cars is a healthy medium.",1617235217

&gt;  
&gt;Election lies.??? Biden lies all the time  
&gt;  
&gt;An attack on congress by his own followers.-- Trump did not ask anyone to break the law. Do you hold the bernie supporter accountable that shot up Republican congressmen? Or the suicide attacks on Dallas police from Obama's anti-police rhetoric? Of course, you don't that would be un-hypocritical.  
&gt;  
&gt;Racist rhetoric.--No evidence.   
&gt;  
&gt;Lies about policy. --$2000 stimmy? or ""[**The boilermakers union has endorsed me because I sat down with them and went into great detail with leadership \[about\] exactly what I would do.”**](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/21/joe-biden/no-boilermakers-union-didnt-endorse-joe-biden/) **--**Biden and all other politicians lie when their lips are moving.

&gt;Cozying up to dictators. -\_Trying to achieve peace is a bad thing?  
&gt;  
&gt;Threatening WW3. ZERO wars started by Trump and he started massive drawdowns from Afghanistan. Let's see how many wars President Harris starts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Genocidal practices at the border facilities. (Sterilization) Evidence that Trump had anything to do with this? Kids in cages were founded by Obama and continued today by Biden  
&gt;  
&gt;Implied he would have more than two terms. ???LMAO We all know Biden won't  
&gt;  
&gt;Claimed credit for Obama era policies.???Biden did literally nothing but follow Trump's vaccine rollout and took credit for it

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Reposting a comment I’ve made before:

I have been reading a book titled “Searching for and Maintaining Peace” by Fr. Jacques Philippe. It contains a remark on the powerlessness of ourselves that the Lord had taught me quite well before reading this, and this passage has stuck out to me and enthused me. It’s a reference to 

John 15:5;
&gt;Apart from Me, you can do nothing

He continues: 

&gt;He did not say ‘you can’t do much,” but, *you can do nothing*. It is essential that we be persuaded of this truth. We often have to experience failures, trials and humiliations, permitted by God, before this truth imposes itself on us, not only on an intellectual level, but as an experience of our entire being. God would spare us, if He could, all these trials, but they are necessary in order that we should be convinced of our complete powerlessness to do good by ourselves. According to the testimony of all the Saints, it is indispensable for us to acquire this knowledge. It is, in effect, a necessary prelude to all the great things that God will do in us by the power of His grace. This is why St. Thérèse of Lisieux, the Little Flower, would say that the best thing God could have done in her soul was ‘to have shown her her smallness, her powerlessness.’

You are powerless, only by cooperating with His grace can you overcome it. It is not about the streak. Forget the number, seriously. Choose God each and every moment, each and every time, consciously choose him and *flee* to him. You may cry, and you may fail... but you can never let despair overcome you. The Lion of Judah has already conquered. You must not lose your peace. Christian community is essential to the faith, both to strengthen you and others. If possible, you should seek community. As you may be finding out, porn does not satisfy. You (the desire comment is applicable if your vocation is marriage) long for that which satisfies which is ultimately God. Nothing else can satisfy. My heart is restless till it rests in you, O Lord. True, self-giving love in the context of marriage is what you desire. Love is kind, love does not use. If possible, make use of the sacraments. I will pray for you.",1617235218

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","&gt; in very simple terms, explain how, not why, it fell

...welp. The thing is, this exact question is, as I understand it, a matter of debate up there in academia-land, so depending on who we're consulting, we might get a particular slant of answer. Indeed, specifically to challenge preconceptions, I've taken to calling it ""the so-called 'Fall' of Rome"". More can always be said if anyone would like to address this matter; for the meantime, here are some previous posts for your perusal:

For reading about the so-called 'Fall' and the effects thereof,

* u/royalsanguinius addresses [the matter of the Migration Period](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hrb2nq/the_roman_empire_invaded_enslaved_and_pillaged/) and why 'invasion' isn't the right term;
* and also looks at [the so-called 'collapse' of the Roman Empire](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jt1yj3/was_the_edict_of_milan_alongside_theodosius_is/)
* u/Tiako considers [living standards before and after the Roman period](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5bfw2n/the_fall_of_the_roman_empire_is_typically/);
* u/Iguana_on_a_stick has [an excellent treatment on just what the blight happened](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4oelte/how_accurate_is_the_popular_view_that/) (and I highly recommend the discussion below in the comments as well)
* and also examines [what life was like when the 'barbarians' took over](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7dt269/what_happened_to_the_inhabitants_of_roman_cities/);
* and here's [a panel AMA covering the period 400-1000 AD](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1zw63t/ama_late_antiquityearly_medieval_era_circa_400/).",1617235219

* Fedorov Avtomat - basically, a fully automatic assault rifle.
* Autoloading 8 .25 Extended - fast fire rate makes it a solid choice for close quarter engagements.

Larger, more open areas like the first part of Suez or first part of St. Quentins Scar I'll use;

* Howell Automatic Sniper - bipod enables longer range firing against snipers.
* Farquhar-Hill Storm - iron sights seem more precise than other similar guns.
* General Liu Rifle Factory or Storm - one hit sweet spot in bolt action mode plus the ability to switch to semi-automatic mode for close in engagements.

If I had to choose just one medic rifle to use in all environments:

* General Liu Rifle Factory or Storm - long range capability with one hit kill is fun plus you can still be effective in close quarters as long as you don't encounter too many enemies at once.
* Howell Automatic Sniper - there's just something about this rifle that fits my style - can't put my finger on it but there's a rhythm to it when firing that suits me so I tend to do well when using this gun.

Whatever gun or guns you end up using, just make sure you support your team by reviving and healing often. When I play medic, getting kills is not my main objective. I often get more revives than kills.",1617235221

Also the best cons are when you convince people they really want to do something. Wednesday gave Shadow the opportunity to end his contract. But Shadow eventually became convinced of a great opportunity. 

Worship and technology go hand in hand because they are both ultimately spread through story telling. We tell the story of how to create fire or hand axes to spread the technology. Without story telling technology would be a one off - random accidental genius that has to start from square one every time. Worship works similarly. People can have a feeling of awe or dread or hopefulness but stories give it shape. Stories are how we share ideas. 

 I think SHARD might play off this idea. Isn’t that what bits of pottery found in archeological sites called? They are bits of evidence that we piece together a story thats incomplete. In a sense we use SHARDs to regain lost memory and information. 

So the new/old dichotomy is really more blurred. It’s a more of a continuity of story and tradition- worship.",1617235221

Out of the 132 uniques the game has only 44 can not be gambled.
Crafting won't ever become useless. You can take item's that you found at level 4 until the end game, 'cause all that matters are tiers. To upgrade those tiers you just need the shard to drop and they drop A LOT. You easily find a item with only 1 affix, and you can easily craft the other 3 to make a item that carries you all the way to the end game. 

Reaching the end game the same happens, even more so 'cause there's even more items, with even better bases, and with higher tiers, so you just rinse and repeat at level 55 what you did at level 4 and again at level 70/80/90... 
And you even have better items on end game wich are the exalted items, with tiers that go behond t5 up to t7.
If it's a more rare shard and you find the equivalent affix of that specific shard on a item that you don't need, you only need to spend 2k gold on a vendor to buy a shaterring rune, wich is were you gonna spend most of your gold, buying those runes unless you are gambling at the NPC. 

What happened on D3, and the nerf they gave to the drops was 'because ppl were selling very rare items for a lot of cash. The system was not the only problem, the problem was the way ppl used and abused the system to make real money. 
And in PoE, currency as more value 'cause you also need it to craft on your bench, even more so in SSF. 1 Exalted is much more valuable on SSF than it is on trade league, cause you need 2 exaltes, wich are very very very rare drops to craft multimod on bench wich can turn a high average item into a end game item.

"thevenomsite","t5_2t0xw","Possible spoilers mentioned in Symbiote Appearance paragraph. Not sure if it counts.

For the planet: to my knowledge, the dragons are also symbiote goo, as the goo from these dragons are able to take over hosts and turn them into hivemind Symbiotes- the ones with the Knull swirl. Maybe the different creatures and continents occur because Knull likes to have fun and try to draw in more victims or something? 

For symbiote appearance: again, to my knowledge, the symbiotes that all look alike are of Knull's hivemind and control. The others with their own personalities appear the way they do because they've been to earth and have had hosts. The symbiotes act and have abilities based on their hosts. Venom became more powerful and was then able to create wings. Groot is a sentient tree thing, so his symbiote became tree-like. Wolverine's claws got a little more interesting, etc, etc. The humanoid appearance, such as in Planet of the Symbiotes and Gwenom vs. Carnage, they all take on a soldier-like appearance because that's what Knull wants them to look like. 

I think the red ones are red (in the Absolute Carnage event) because Carnage was controlling and spreading his symbiote goo. You know how Toxin is Carnage's kiddo? Toxin is mostly red.

Yup. It's both true and not true.  

It's true in the sense of the old Ford quote about innovating the Model T: ""If I asked people what they wanted, they wouldve requested faster horses"". Innovation involves figuring out what people don't know they want yet.

BUT

That innovation requires Blizzard to also pay attention to player feedback. Players are infamous for saying one thing but actually being driven by another thing that's almost the opposite of what they say. Cause players (people in general) suck at parsing their own feelings without guidance. 

That makes feedback very hard to sort out but it's vital to game development. And to figure that out, Blizzard and any developer needs to read between the lines to figure out the unsaid things that drives players.",1617235222

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Dorothea supports establishes that Edelgard is going to be a patron of art and theater which things like that culturally enrich a country, and while you establish you are not a fan of meritocracy I think we can both agree that a government based on meritocracy is better than the alternatives, with AM the main form of government would be a monarchy with aristocratic systems in place with nobles and houses, and with the other 2 routes Foldlan becomes a theocratic state where the main power in the continent is the church",1617235222

Du kan også sagtens snakke med både hæver og træner om det. Det er ikke sikkert at hæveren ved hvor meget i går op i det, og det er ikke sikkert at træneren har lagt mærke til hans/hendes sløsethed. Hvis du har en god træner vil denne sovet gerne hjælpe med at løse problemet! :)",1617235223

So I, like the biggest fucking idiot in the world...rubbed Ben-Gay on her back. And that's **all** I did.

Designed purely for immunity. They’re meant to reduce the severity of symptoms.

Supposed to bring death to absolute zero. It’s impossible. They’ve shown to decrease it as much as possible.

Meant to guarantee you won’t get it. As stated above, it’s not the purpose.

Meant to eliminate you spreading it. For the same reasons above.

Meant to eliminate social distancing policies. Not everybody gets it at once. Also, not how the vaccine works.

It may not eliminate these things right away, but this vaccine will pave the way to eventual herd immunity and EVENTUALLY the pandemic will end faster than what we could get without a vaccine, and with far fewer casualties.

Able to discuss problems with bowel movements comfortable. Hit that point where you can talk to them about shit you've never talked with anyone about comfortable. ""This shitty thing that happened to me as a kid and I never was comfortable talking about it with anyone but you"" level comfortable. ""I still haven't dealt with my dead fathers remains because I don't know how, because he had no will"" and my SO has my back when I'm floundering level comfortable.

It feels like you can face the world when you and your partner can stand together through anything and they know your weaknesses and still stand by you and you know how to do the same. So when hardships come up, you don't have to doubt your spouse will be by your side and if you can't handle it they can step up for you, and if you both can't handle it you're together and not alone.

"baltimore","t5_2qipq","you keep talking about ""unmotivated kids"" or ""worst performing can't improve if sent to a better school"". why is it that those kids happen to be MUCH more common in poor areas? you're glazing right over that. you're not accounting for how you take care of those at the bottom, those who's parents are drug addicted, traumatized, in any number of bad situations. your logic has this big gaps in it where you say that any poor person can just move to somewhere else for better education, but they just choose not to, while also advocating for a system that RELIES on people ""voting with their feet"" to succeed at anything more than allowing the worst-off to fall even farther down. why would we intentionally create a system that requires significant actions in order to avoid even worse schools? why wouldn't we pursue a system where those who need the most help get more help? this could be charter schools, if done right. there are only two options here. either A) improved education can help poorly performing kids do better, in which case we should create a system that gets maximal help to those who aren't doing well and who don't have as much family help, or B) there is something fundamental about the poorly performing kids/parents that cannot be compensated for and we should just let them fall even further through the cracks. I'm advocating for situation A).

this is the common failure in logic where the thing that works best for one individual (often the person advocating for it) does not perform better overall. further marginalizing the already marginalized does not improve our society, even if it means that some kids will do better.",1617235226

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; France in particular has acknowledged pretty openly that there was collaboration going on at many levels. The current Polish government has made it a fundamental part of Polish identity that ""none of us did anything, ever!""

Not really. The current Polish government did it so they can present it internally as defending the nation from the people outside coming to a conclusion that Poland was responsible for the Holocaust. Unfortunately, plenty of people believe this to be true - and every time such article/mention appears, they blow it up out of proportion.

They don't really claim ""literally no Pole collaborated"".


---

Second point: comparing French occupation to Polish one is very misleading. Nazis didn't want to exterminate French people. They did want to exterminate everyone in the east. They just didn't prioritize it during the war the way they prioritized Holocaust. But Polish lives didn't really have any value to them. They killed plenty of civilians just because they were Poles. They just weren't as systematic about it.

So this

&gt; maybe they wanted to take property the Jewish neighbor owned, maybe they just wanted to get along with the new government. (Would you watch your children starve to avoid telling the authorities about the Jewish family that lives in the apartment down the hall?)

Is somewhat false. Yes, there were antisemites of course. But not-antisemites? The question is less like ""want to take advantage of the situation to grab property"" or even ""want to provide food for the children"" and more like ""if they find them, they'll kill us too for 'hiding' them"". Well, maybe not quite that if they wouldn't have a reason to think they were hiding that information.

IMO that doesn't really count as collaboration; same as [Judenrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judenrat). That's simply unfair. Risking your life to protect others is heroic - not normal, to be expected.

There's a subtle way in which making-situation-not-black-and-white is not really *right*; it's an [isolated demand for rigor](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/14/beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor). I think it somewhat applies. Yes - there were Polish collaborators. That is *true*. But pointing that out by itself in articles about the Holocaust misleads; about the scale, about situation's specifics.

To put it simply: ""X people/country had collaborators amongst them"" remains true when substituting France, Romania, Slovakia, Poland Greece, Hungary etc. -- even Jewish people themselves.

Also, two relevant quotations from a book [Eichmann in Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eichmann_in_Jerusalem)

&gt; Even at this early date, the ""solution of the Polish problem"" was well advanced: of the ""political leadership,"" it was reported, no more than three per cent was left; in order to ""render this three per cent harmless,"" they would have ""to be sent into concentration camps."" The middle strata of the Polish intelligentsia were to be registered and arrested - ""teachers, clergy, nobility, legionaries, returning officers, etc."" - while the ""primitive Poles"" were to be added to German manpower as ""migratory laborers"" and to be ""evacuated"" from their homes. (...)

&gt; (...) **The measures against Eastern Jews were not only the result of anti-Semitism, they were part and parcel of an all-embracing demographic policy, in the course of which, had the Germans won the war, the Poles would have suffered the same fate as the Jews - genocide**. This is no mere conjecture: the Poles in Germany were already being forced to wear a distinguishing badge in which the ""P"" replaced the Jewish star, and this, as we have seen, was always the first measure to be taken by the police ininstituting the process of destruction.",1617235227

Im sure you don't like the competition?   lol

You would be the hypocrite that could claim to be against the very industry they are trafficking for, yet happily go work and support the easy availability of sex for the Johns that are also blithely supporting the industry as well.

I can't understand these people.

The rise of the Nazis was an absolutely deplorable pile of repressed humanity and rewarding of cruelty and elitism to the highest degree.
_It never should be happened_

The holocaust was one of the most brutal and ruthless eradication of human life that wasn't tied to nucular bombstrikes.
People were killed as efficiently as cars were being built to be sold a few blocks from the incinerators, firing squats and nooses.

The whole reason why there is memorials, museums, camps, literature, plays and so on about it is because we bear a responsibility to never, ever let Faschisim take a hold in our government again, to stand against it because we know it happened, because it can always happen again.

Faschisim is seductive, the pipeline is slick, and before you know it you're getting a wolfsangel tattoo and know all the whistles you need to listen for in the media.

People that deny the holocaust actively enable more people to be radicalized and used as ammo.

And what for? To have an easy enemy to blame for their crap.

Just cause a persons an asshole and enjoys being an asshole doesn't mean they also do not like the thing they are an asshole about.

Typically they are an asshole about the thing BECAUSE they enjoy it and WANT to show off and dunk on others.

Cheating in a video game is no different then taking steroids in sports. Doesn't mean they don't love the game. Just means they also enjoy cheating, can't handle not meeting a perceptive shortcoming, feel overly pressured to preform, or just do not give a fuck.

Trying to pretend as if people are less then normal functional people cause they do something you don't like doesn't help. It just makes it harder to understand and do something about it. Treat cheaters like what they are, people. Shit makes more sense and is easier to understand and then do something about it.",1617235228

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I worked at a coffee shop when I was 18-22 yrs/old. Seemed like there were only two sets of age groups.  Mine and then around 29-33 yrs/old, which were primarily shift managers and such. We all hung out together as this one big happy family—had monthly dinners, met up at bars after closing, spent holidays together, knew their families—the whole thing. About 4 years into the job, it came out that one of the older guys was essentially trying to fuck all of the younger women and then flaunt about to his closer age group. This came out when another guy “wanted in” by sloppily making an attempt with me, got drunk and blurted it all out. It was a huge letdown to all of us and I felt strange being the one to find out and then have to confirm and confront those involved. It definitely created a deep wedge within our coworkers, and an exodus soon followed with 6 people leaving in quick succession including myself. District managers were involved, words were said.  It was really concerning to me that so many people knew, and even continued on as if we were all so close. But sadly it’s all too common and I’m sure this isn’t a special story by any means. 

Regardless, my two best friends and my husband were all in the younger age group, and we’ve stuck together through thick and thin. Some of my most treasured moments were at the cafe and with those friends/coworkers, and I won’t let those events tarnish the good memories.",1617235228

"BikeMechanics","t5_2gz92j","This is not the correct way to think about friction shifters. They pull a certain length of cable and that's about it, the ratio of the derailer has no bearing on this. It is totally possible to have various pull ratios and various amounts of cable travel at the derailer and the only thing the shifter needs is total pull. Ratio is just one part of the equation. The length of cable depends on it's design. I have a variety of friction shifters and most of the vintage ones don't have limits or only primitive, easily bypassed limits which allows them to pull more than enough to use even SRAM derailers, I'm friction shifting my GX Eagle setup. Its usually just the weird era of touring and MTB friction shifters from the 70s-80s that have built in limits intended to be used with certain systems. These limits can often be removed without much effort, though I recommend leaving the minimum pull limit since it prevents the head of the cable from fatiguing by preventing twisting from the sharp entry to the cable port. Friction cable pull is only an issue if the custy wants a specific shifter and doesn't want to modify it, even then I'd say there is more than a 50-50 chance it already pulls more than enough cable even for SRAM.",1617235231

&gt; **La Verne Wimberly, 82, slays in Sunday best for online church services**

&gt; by Asia Grace - March 31, 2021

&gt; For the love of God, honey. 

&gt; La Verne Ford Wimberly, 82, is serving the Lord in style.  

&gt; Shining in the holy trinity of high fashion, the Tulsa, Oklahoma, native meticulously color coordinates her outfits, hats and jewelry to attend Metropolitan Baptist Church’s virtual services via Zoom each week. 

&gt; “In the 20 years I’ve been going to church there, I’ve always had my little routine that I learned from my mother as a girl,” Wimberly told the Washington Post. 

&gt; “I’d pick out a nice outfit and hat and lay it out the night before, so that I could be prepared and look presentable.”
  
&gt; She has donned her lavish garments of praise for remote worship every Sunday since the church transitioned to online meetings in March 2020 in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. 

&gt; “I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, I can’t sit here looking slouchy in my robe,’ ” she said. “I didn’t want to sit around alone and feel sorry for myself, so I decided, ‘You know what? I’m going to dress up anyway.’ ”

&gt; Wimberly — affectionately called “doctor” by her fellow parishioners, owing to her doctorate in education and the years she spent as a school principal and superintendent — posts a Sunday selfie and a Bible verse on Facebook every week, hoping her posh presentations inspire others. 

&gt; “For years, everyone had known to look for me in the last row, section two, dressed to the nines,” she said of her signature church service slay. 

&gt; “People always looked forward to seeing what I was wearing. So when I posted that photo, everyone told me it boosted their spirits.”

&gt; But giving God the glory through her collection of heavenly headpieces and embellished ensembles is hard work. 

&gt; Since serving up an Easter Sunday look featuring a pink skirt and beaded sweater jacket, as well as a matching hat decorated with pink and yellow lilies in April 2020, Wimberly has logged each outfit on a calendar, so she doesn’t accidentally wear her divine designs twice. 

&gt; “It’s safe to say that 50 is a good number for the hats,” she confessed of her fully-stocked wardrobe and accessories, which span over three closets in her house. 

&gt; “But the clothes? I’d better not go there. Let’s just say I’m now refusing to look at any catalogues.”

&gt; Wimberly, a widow whose husband died in 2009, said the motivation behind flexing in her godly gear is to make her friends and church family feel good. 

&gt; A mission her pastor, Ray Owens, said she has accomplished. 

&gt; “Her flare for fashion really ignites and sustains our faith,” Owens told Fox 23 News in Tulsa. 

&gt; And while in-person services at her church haven’t resumed just yet, Wimberly is already planning her post-pandemic pageantry. 

&gt; “What will I wear? That will be determined by the season and the weather,” she told the Washington Post. 

&gt; “Maybe something purple with black and white. You can’t go wrong there.”",1617235231

These are ALL left-wing news outlets, you know. How many articles do you need? 

It is obvious what happened. Trump ordered the vaccines and accepted plans from individual states as to where to send the vaccines. This allowed the states to make their own prioritization and rollout, such as Florida giving to the elderly before healthcare. However, many of these states are very poorly run and between that and the hands-off federal approach the rollout was slower than they wanted. 

Like it’s so obvious mate.

"Falcom","t5_32vt5","&gt;you are linking to a porn site that allows underage artwork. 

People who post artwork here on r/falcom oftentimes post pixiv as the source because many artists are there. But pixiv also allows hentai content of such nature as well and no one ever complained that pixiv links are posted here. As long as the image I'm posting is not NSFW and you don't see any other content, I don't see a problem honestly. You really need to go out of your way to see the hentai content on that site by manipulating the URL. I don't believe I broke any r/falcom rules here, but if the mods decide to delete the topics I'm fine, it wasn't my intent to break any rules nor is there a rule that prohibits hosters that also allow hentai content. And also, as I said, I've seen people posting pixiv as the source many times here as that's where many artists are... and pixiv also allows for hentai content of such nature.

Prior to posting any submission to this subreddit please ensure you've read the rules for submissions in the sidebar of the [/r/bravia homepage](https://old.reddit.com/r/bravia/).

Users posting submissions seeking support should include as much detail as possible about their BRAVIA TV and any connected hardware related to the issue in order to get the best responses. This includes but is not limited to the model of the TV, the software and/or firmware version and the make and model of any external devices. Pictures or video can be helpful when trying to describe a video or audio issue.

Submissions not directly related to an issue with a BRAVIA TV and/or low effort posts that do not include any helpful details that would allow others to diagnose the issue will be removed.  This includes, but is not limited to, submissions asking for support directly related to a connected device (ie. soundbar, console, PC, media player, etc.) but not the TV itself.

Firmware related topics (ie. issues, announcements, support) must be discussed in the [Sony BRAVIA Firmware Discussion Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bravia/comments/l4xzqp/sony_bravia_firmware_discussion_megathread/).  Panel quality/lottery posts (ie. DSE, banding, flashlighting, etc.) must be discussed in the [BRAVIA Panel/Screen Quality Discussion Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bravia/comments/lzerhr/bravia_panelscreen_quality_discussion_megathread/).

Users should also check the [/r/bravia Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/bravia/wiki/index), current [moderator pinned](https://www.reddit.com/r/bravia/comments/k7wnc1/moderator_pinned_and_other_helpful_topics_check/) topics and the [Frequently Asked Questions thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bravia/comments/jlmpzp/frequently_asked_questions_on_rbravia_for_sony_tvs/) for some solutions to common A/V issues and more.

**To all participants, a couple of reminders before you join in:** 

Nutrition is not a solved science and diet approaches are often based on individual needs and circumstances. This sub caters to all approaches to what is deemed ""healthy"". Each POV has the opportunity to share info within the rules. Sometimes we get more of one POV than another but the waves come and go. Don't generalize other participants or even the subreddit itself just because you don't get the votes you want or because others disagree with you and certainly don't attack anyone for it. You do not have to agree but *EDUCATE your POV rather than BERATE them for theirs* 

**Avoid being rude** 

* Per our reddiquette rule; Don't engage in insults, trolling, or other antagonistic behaviors towards anyone in this sub (even when others break the rule). No vote complaining. Talk about the food, not the other person

* Be respectful towards other dietary points of view. Activism, crusading, diet shaming, food ethics / morals, and absolutism are not allowed. *This is not the place to camp in wait to bash others with your beliefs. Doing so will result in a ban.*

* Do not add comments calling food disgusting, gross, or any other non-constructive criticism.  Do not claim foods as non-healthy without citing studies (with links).  Again, people come in varieties so AVOID absolutist claims

* Don't make assumptions about the ingredients, the portions, or what kind of diet the poster has / needs

* Don't fight fire with fire.  Report rule violations.  If things get ugly, counter points with science, never insults. You can also opt to just walk away

**TLDR:** Educate. Don't berate. No rudeness, complaining, or diet war BS

"HappyEndingMassage","t5_sx610","I absolutely love the way you worded your thoughts on this and this doing so makes this a great opportunity to have a discussion about it. So I shall play devils advocate because I am interested in your thoughts. It’s a known fact that there are a lot of people who go to AMP’s for a full therapeutic experience but there are just as many people who go only for the HE. This forum is meant to discuss /advise/share story’s/ and to ask questions about AMP and HE. Just as we discuss and ask how to get a HJ, FS is just as valid. Asking how to go about it is also apart of the HE experience. The only way we can “kill the brothel mentality” as you put in the title is to 1. Get every AMP in the world not to offer FS this would make the topic of FS invalid in this forum because then it’s not apart of the AMP world. And 2 ban those who speak of FS on this forum since it is not apart of what AMP’s do. Those are the only two portions I see as viable for reducing the post about FS. However, since option 1 is impossible that makes option 2 also impossible due to the fact that FS is under the umbrella of HE/AMP and is permitted to be discussed here. So how would you go about reducing the posts of FS without being hypocritical? Because making a claim that FS isn’t apart of the AMP service menu isn’t true. Simply stating that FS post shouldn’t happen just based off your individual preferences about what you like to see in the subreddit doesn’t fit everyone’s views in the community. 

****Disclaimer***** I have never done FS and most likely never will. I do think there is a lot of FS post I.e. where to get it, can I get an STD, how to do it so on and so forth as of late. I myself am partial to the stories of getting a HE in general.",1617235233

And it occurred to me that the best reason to do so would be to get a cool screenshot of a Bismarck and PE taking on Hood and Prince of Wales in a staged battle. But there's absolutely no way I'm also going to have the motivation to build both of the British battleships as well.

So I'll just ask: are people interested enough that I should give this a go, and will anyone help by building one or both of the other two? It would be cool as a joint project.",1617235233

\-I don't get it though. No single individual owns any one of those holy sites. They aren't private property. Why can't they be the property of the federal government and protected as public property? If anything all citizens would then indirectly own those important sites

"TheAstraMilitarum","t5_3lqlg","As you clearly haven't read my post, I'll explain my query in a different way:

I have bought from BlackMarketMiniatures.su several times in the past and follow kitbashers on insta who have done the same. That site is not a scam, my concern is that the site was active less than a month ago and still appears on Google results but when I try to access it, I can't. I wasn't sure whether it was my IP or something had happened to the store, seeing as I can no longer find them on Instagram or Facebook anymore. 

I wanted to know if anyone else has found this or has any news on why it has happened. As I previously mentioned in my original post, I followed a post here about BMM from a year ago and the users seemed quite knowledgeable about the site, hence why I posted here.

Now, I have noticed an identical store under a different url. (.ru) instead of (.su). It seems to be just an old version of the store, inactive since 2018 (or whenever it was). I don't intend on buying from the ""older"" site as I haven't had dealings with them before and don't know if they're legit.

Now, back to my question, are you having the same problem or is it just me? Or do you have any idea why the store has disappeared after all these years of being active and was still only active less than a month ago?

P.s. this question has nothing to do with my risk of buying high quality recasts because I refuse to waste my money and fork out hundreds of £££ for an original box just because they're no longer made.",1617235234

Also, greed. The knowledge that they could double or tripe their UBI income by cutting the UBI off the dependents would be a large driving factor. Humans commit all kinds of atrocities in the name of greed. It's human nature. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding voting rights, I just don't see how powerless people can retain their voting rights. Think about how hard they were to *earn.* It's not impossible to take them away. Look what Russia turned into after the fall of the USSR. Look at Eastern Europe where today democracies are falling to authoritarianism .

"northkorea","t5_2r16c","My point here is more specific than that.  You gotta remember that being raised in a severely abnormal environment can alter your thinking in very negative ways, especially when you have to adopt certain behaviors as survival tactics.  For example, people who have been raised by abusive and narcissistic parents will grow up with a chronic inability to trust others or form attachments.  People who have been raised in severe poverty will make poor long term investment choices because they were raised to think only in terms of short term finances.  Even when they leave those environments those maladaptive patterns of thinking stick with them, and they have to train themselves out of those approaches.

North Korean defectors are in a similar situation.  It's very likely that due to the environment they grew up in, they have a poor conception of the concept of credibility... the idea that when you're a public figure, being as honest as possible is necessary to establish trust with an audience long-term.  They aren't stupid, or greedy, or malicious... it's more that they had to adopt deception and accepting deception as ""normal"" because it was a survival tactic.

In fact, this is exactly what Shin Dong-Hyuk said when he corrected his story.  He didn't think that exaggerating or lying was a big deal... because that's what you're **supposed** to do in North Korea.

Remember that most of these people struggled to understand basic stuff (well... basic to us) like how to use money or make decisions once they defected to the South.  I honestly think it's natural for them to think, ""Wait... exaggerating my testimony is **bad**?  But isn't that what everyone does?""

They just aren't used to operating the same institutions of trust and forthrightness that we're used to.  They aren't bad people, they're just struggling with growing out of habits they were forced to adopt due to systemic abuses they've suffered.",1617235235

I thought it’d stay &lt;40% after the nerfs. 

Think of it this way. To nerf meta ADC’s riot often removes 2 base AD. This usually hurts their performance a tad, and win rates drop from 0.5-1%. 

Now look at Azir’s nerf. His w lost 10 damage on EVERY SINGLE AUTO. This is why I compare it to base AD nerfs on an adc. If any ADC lost 10 base AD, there would be a massive outrage, and they’d be utterly unplayable. 10 damage on every auto is huge. You need just under 400 gold to buy enough AP to offset the nerf, so you essentially start the game more than a kill behind your laner.

*****
&gt; 2 Min Read.WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden on Wednesday singled out Amazon.com Inc for not paying federal taxes during his address in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as he spoke about raising the burden of taxes on multinational companies and hiking the corporate tax rate.

&gt; Biden said Amazon was one of 91 Fortune 500 companies that &amp;quot;Use various loopholes where they pay not a single solitary penny in federal income tax,&amp;quot; in sharp contrast to middle class families paying over 20% tax rates.

&gt; After paying $0 in federal taxes for two years, Amazon started paying federal income tax in 2019.This is not the first time Biden has gone after Amazon.

"matlab","t5_2r4xn","Here's how I would do it. First generate a load of random x and y points:

    x = 2*pi*rand(N,1);
    y = -1 + 2*rand(N,1);

Then split them up according to what color they should be. The conditions for the colors are:

    r = (x &lt; pi) &amp; (y &gt; 0) &amp; (y &lt; sin(x));
    g = (x &gt; pi) &amp; (y &lt; 0) &amp; (y &gt; sin(x));
    b = ~r &amp; ~g;

Now you can make the plot:

    plot(x(r), y(r), 'rx')
    hold on
    plot(x(g), y(g), 'gx')
    plot(x(b), y(b), 'bx')",1617235236

I used to write in a journal, but that would require a light source, which sometimes I don't have at the end of the day or the light would disturb others. 

I find that using the app on my phone is the best. Not only do I feel like I can type quicker than I can write, but I don't need to be in a bright room or have a light to record my thoughts. 

While traveling, at the end of the day I will type down everything I can remember, from my thoughts to what I saw and experienced that day. If I can't quite remember the name of a town I will just type ______ so I will know that location needs filled in later when I can spend time on google maps to get the correct spelling/etc.

An added bonus: if my phone/luggage/etc gets lost or stolen, my notes will be safely synced online so I wont lose those recollections (as I almost always have wifi at night while travelling abroad and cell signal/wifi while traveling domestically)

A similar thing happened with a dude that was a lawyer who just got very depressed. Everything checked out when they took him as a tenant. They owned several rentals, but this still hit them really hard and cause a lot of psychological damage.

Shortly after that my parents sold all their real estate and retired, which luckily was at the top of the market right before the market crash in '08.  They emphasize to me that real estate is a huge pain in the ass and they don't think it's worth the psychological anguish.",1617235237

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Sorry for the long tangent filled post.  I can’t seem to write anything short. 
I know I have masked, but not in the same way.  I am not Autistic, but ADHD diagnosed in adulthood. I am reasonably intelligent, and as with many ADHDers we are almost “too smart for our own good” because we have enough skills to make up for some of the glaring deficits, especially when we are younger.  The concept that if you get good grades you can’t possibly have ADHD couldn’t be more wrong, but if you aren’t climbing the walls or jumping off desks the don’t stop to look at the other symptoms.  The hard part is adulthood when you really have to put on the “everything is under control” persona even when under it all there is a mixed bag of negative emotions and feelings and you are holding on with your fingernails to keep the world from falling down around you.

I only learned about masking recently.  Unfortunately, I was a part of the system that taught that, but I got out when I realized how toxic it was.  I wish I had realized sooner, but it’s a bit of a cult that doesn’t like to hear and actively suppresses other people’s experiences.

As for toxic family members.  I can attest to the fact that cutting contact with my father has helped immensely.  Mind you I am still dealing with the PTSD crap from childhood, but I no longer have to listen to the lies and tolerate the mental abuse that comes from a narcissist.  To give you an idea, my mom “got the in-laws” in the divorce.  All of his siblings were or are very low to no contact, but they love her.  Also, only 1 of his 10 kids talk to him.  It doesn’t make anyone a bad person for limiting nor cutting contact with parents.  The people who always say that you should give them a chance, or that of course they love you, or question how you could not talk to family have never experienced that kind of relationship or just want company in their misery.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","You're completely right.  These demos are so optimal because they're intended to be exactly that - demos to model off of.  I repeat the clears a few times looking for optimizations to make and then use the best recording.  When it comes to actual in-game clears, even I'm typically a bit slower than my own spreadsheet timers, because I'm balancing the clearing with F-key usage and macro decision-making, just like every other jungler has to.  That being said, I'm still generally within \~5 seconds of the optimal pacing on a full clear if it's a champion I main.  

In general, pros are *expected* to have mediocre clears.  It's not just that there's other factors that you have to juggle ingame, but also the fact that pros have to maintain very wide champion pools that they can pull out on a moment's notice, and a lot of the time they spend practicing is dedicated to team macro and synergy.  So there's no way they should be expected to match the clear timers of, say, an OTP that's expressly practicing his clear for the champion that he runs every single game.  

That being said, quite a few pro junglers objectively also just have really bad clearing fundamentals, and there's very little excuse for that, as it's pretty comparable to a pro laner being bad at last-hitting.",1617235239

"QContent","t5_fao2r","I appreciate deliberation in favor of knee-jerk reactions. I also think the mod team is wrong to keep cougardraven on, based on their (cougar's) bad-faith exchanges, passive-aggressive comments, accusations of ulterior motives on the part of those who disagree with them, and general inability to engage the disagreement respectfully. As you sort through the complaints, there must be some point at which enough is enough and there are consequences for bad behavior.    
    
It is additionally concerning to hear you say that all of cougardraven's actions were performed with the blessing of the moderation team, not least because the announcement of a new rule in the middle of a conversation where cougardraven removes the other party's posts is absolutely not the way to institute a new rule. Even those who agree with the rule must admit how bad that looks. This was a big misstep, as was the stickied comment asking no one in particular ""what are you pissed off about?"" and then locking the thread. This is exactly the wrong way to moderate a community.

The doctrines are Axis, Comintern, Allies and Pan-Asian; **Axis** emphasises damage and health in exchange for higher production costs, **Comintern** does the opposite(though they do not have a hitpoint reduction), **Allies** has lower production times and research times in exchange for slower speed and **Pan-Asian** has high speed, scout and attack in exchange for a hitpoints debuff. Pan-Asian is rare and can only be found on asia-pacific or world maps, but the other three are on almost all the maps.
2. Infantry can be produced in urban provinces, which are dark grey on the map(instead of the lighter shade of yellow your rurals are coloured with). They have to be built with barracks buildings and there are multiple variants of them; motorised infantry, ordinary infantry, mechanised infantry, paratroopers and commandoes. They have their uses, and while infantry is good for the early game, motorised infantry will form the bulk of your army in the mid-late game. Certain units deal less damage to unarmoured(ie. infantry) than to armoured units like tanks, and motorised infantry is cheaper and faster than all tanks, making them good support units to clear the way for your tanks, capture empty provinces or to chase pickets(those annoying small forces people use to take your undefended provinces while your line moved forward).
3. You are likely to be playing on the Euro map for quite a while, so I'd recommend you to start as **Canada**. You only have one early-game enemy(The Northern US) and your corner position gives you undisputed control over America if you manage to blitzkrieg everyone else on the continent(three factions, excluding Cuba). You can also proceed to invade Europe in your own time. A similarly effective faction on the mainland can include either Finland or Sweden. Out of all the rounds in this map, these factions typically last until the late-game or win outright if they don't leave the game and go inactive.
4. **Oil** and **Metal**. Everyone needs it, you need it to make everything from ships to motorised units to armour. No question about it, *always* save up and build up your industry for these materials.",1617235239

*****

&gt; Gustave Eiffel es uno los arquitectos más reconocidos de todos los tiempos gracias a su proyecto estrella, la torre que lleva su nombre en el corazón de París.

&gt; Hacia el final siglo XIX Gustave viajó a América Latina para, con su peculiar estilo, similar al del ícono parisino, crear catedrales, estaciones, puentes y kioscos.   

&gt; La leyenda cuenta que durante su mandato, Porfirio Díaz le encargó al francés la construcción de un puente ferroviario para cruzar el Gran Canal del Desagüe.

&gt; La estructura cumplió con su función por más de 80 años, pero durante el siglo XX, las vías del tren cayeron en desuso y el puente pasó a ser parte de la autopista México-Pachuca.

&gt; Nuevas investigaciones del Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) determinan que no hay ningún registro o plano de su construcción en el Archivo General de la Nación, con el que se pueda corroborar la autoría del mítico artista francés.

"ProgrammingLanguages","t5_2qi8m","It makes sense in C since that is/was supposed to be a very close to the metal language. The 3-parts for loop allows expressing most common loops concisely without any kind of magic or hiding what is actually going on at the hardware level.

For newer languages, I think they mostly just copied C for familiarity or other reasons. The main languages with these for loops that come to my mind are Java and JavaScript (besides the obvious C++), both of which of course not known for their innovative and cohesive/great language design. C# ofc also took it from Java and C for familiarity. *Edit: I also just remembered PHP, which is of course similarly known for its bad design and was based on C as well (iirc it originally started out as some kind of templating system for servers written in C or something).*

I'm sure there are other mainstream languages with this kind of for-loop but most modern languages like Swift, Kotlin, or Rust actually don't have them. Same goes for Python even though it can't really be considered a modern language age-wise.

The only exception I can think of is Go, where I guess it's just another point in the list of things that make it feel like a language from the 80s if it weren't for goroutines and shows that it was designed by the same people that came up with C.

I think most new or even old languages that have them are in the category where the designers either has no clue or didn't want to think or change too much this, maybe not even considering that there exist other options because they are so familiar with it.",1617235240

"BloodborneLore","t5_36kso","So I'm glad you brought your point 1. up, because it kind of coincides with some of the edits certain lore experts like JSF have had around the Mensis ritual, where there are basically two things going on - one is the ritual in the nightmare using Mergo trying to contact Kos, and the other is the ritual sacrifice taking place in Advent Plaza.  This is attractive for many reasons, including why Yahargul (sp?) is hidden and it matches exactly the role of the Moon Presence - Bloodborne is largely about the descent into Beasthood vs. evolution through insight.  Obviously the MP represents the descent into beasthood - Paleblood = blood drained from the sky, moon runes = additoinal blood echoes (draining of blood), MP head looks like a leach that sucks blood from your midsection during ending embrace, etc.

However, if we are to separate those two actions going on in Mensis, why do we need to silence the harrowing cry of the newborn?  Someone in the world knew we needed a third cord from Mergo?",1617235240

"guitarpedals","t5_2r0bp","I started off with my board being just the TS9, DS-1, VP jr and Canyon delay, but between quarantine purchases, Christmas gifts and birthday gifts, I have acquired the Fender Marine Layer Verb, the Boss TR-2 Tremolo, the MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay, the EQD Sea Machine Chorus and the Keeley Comp +. I’ve been busy lately with the spring semester and so this is the first time that they have all been on my board at the same time!

Chain:

VP jr &gt; Comp + &gt; TS9 &gt; DS-1 &gt; Sea Machine &gt; Carbon Copy &gt; Canyon &gt; Marine Layer 

I am not done with this board, there are still spaces that I would like to try and fill, so I don’t want to commit to making a bunch of cables that I might have to change out in a month when I get a new pedal, so my cable management is as good as I could do with mostly pre made cables. 

Quick notes on each of the new pedals:

Comp +: Incredible compressor, I never turn it off. I love the way your guitar feels when playing through it. The blend knob allows you to put just enough dry signal that you maintain dynamic range but keeping that compressed tone. 

Sea Machine: IMO a very underrated chorus. There are a lot of knobs, so it covers a lot of area, and finding simple sounds can be difficult, but when you find them they sound great. I do wish you could do more of a vibrato but I haven’t found one yet. 

Carbon Copy: The first delay that convinced me that delay doesn’t need tap. The organic nature of the repeats is something that I have never experienced and it is not leaving my board for the foreseeable future. 

TR-2: I wasn’t that interested in tremolo until I was gifted this pedal and now I use it all the time. It is really simple and easy to understand. I do wish there was a tap so I could sync it with my delays. 

Marine Layer: Really good for the simple tones, but it has a nice shimmery modulated verb setting too. I am probably going to get another reverb that does washy ambient sounds a little bit better, but for now it’s really good",1617235240

I agree that you are allowed to have a good day on a day that is sad for someone else, and there is no reason you can’t post something.  I think your friend shouldn’t have contacted you about it, and needs to learn how to cope with her grief more effectively if she is going to interact with the world on this day because this kind of thing will keep happening.  She sounds like she was rude to you.  But she is hurting, and didn’t do anything to deserve cruelty in return.  You could have responded to your grieving friend with something like, “I understand today is a hard day for you, and I’m sorry for your loss.  I had a good day today and posted about it with no intention to hurt you.”  Instead you respond with comments like you didn’t have a connection to the child (how is that relevant?) and that you wanted to “win this argument” (did you want to make things okay between you and your friend, or did you want to win?).  That’s why YTA, not because of your original post.",1617235241

Like what? I know there are plenty of small retcons for fanservice, like the Lusty Argonian Maid and Seyda Neen existing a few centuries too early. But for the most part the actual stories and their lore are great. It's the first time since Arena that all the various cultures of Tamriel get roughly equal depth, so the world feels both broader and more cohesive than a single-province game. I think they did a pretty great job with the lands that haven't been featured in mainline games yet, like the various explorations of the Hist and Argonian culture, the non-humanoid Khajiit furstocks in Elsweyr, and orcs having a historic homeland of their own instead of just kinda being there. And the big lore moments tend to deliver IMO, with stuff like the excellent writing of Sotha Sil, and deeper dives into some of the Daedric Princes that haven't had much spotlight before.",1617235241

He's making ice clones, ice shields, ice hammers, freezing specific body parts, using ice to jump over stuff, freezing the ground and a bunch more. All in conjunction with punches, kicks etc.

DC and Marvel have black and white powers. They are only allowed to do very specific stuff and that's it. Superman will only use his strength to punch. Why? Why doesn't he tackle? Grapple?

I respectfully disagree with this. While I agree that everyone is 100% entitled to process and express their diagnosis in their own way, raging publically at strangers is never acceptable, especially when they are trying to serve/help you. If I had called her a name or done anything other than introduce myself and ask about what her medical complaint was, I could see this sort of reaction, however that is not what took place (see an above comment for an outline of our interaction).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Besides, have you never said things that were unfair when melting down? Have your meltdowns always been directed at the person responsible for them?

Oh of course! As I mentioned in another reply, I've had my fair share of meltdowns. And you're right, they're not always directed at the people my emotions might be stemming from. But I can confidently say that I have never called a HCP a ""little shit"" or ""useless neurotypical"" or pointed fingers in their face when I didn't get my way. ASD is not an excuse for abusive behavior. Ever.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You seem to mask well, or you wouldn't have been diagnosed so late.

I do mask well, but only because of the abuse and pressure I was placed under growing up to ""be normal"" from my parents and siblings. I would caution you with making statements like this. The patient I'm referring to was diagnosed in her 30s and she obviously isn't masking so well; age of diagnosis doesn't play a factor imo.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why should they assume you're not an NT?

Because you shouldn't assume anything about people you don't know, and I guess that notion is the main reason why I posted about this in the first place. That's like saying 'why shouldn't people assume you're incapable of working?' because you're autistic. Why assume at all?",1617235244

That's not even getting into the body strength issue.  This isn't a theoretical issue either:  cases of rape have been reported everywhere transwomen have been placed in women's spaces (see:  [womenarehuman.com](https://womenarehuman.com)).  And for those with reading comprehension issues:  nobody's saying ALL trans people will rape women.  But only one needs to for this to be a threat.  And it's happened over and over.

The fact that this is a RAPE shelter just makes it all the more fucked up.  Time for trans people to fight for their own spaces like women and gays have had to for the last century plus.

"science","t5_mouw","This seems like pretty fair criticism to me. What do you think about it? 

&gt;* In their model, ""livestock"" would be removed but we'd apparently keep growing their feed crops just as we do now (loads of corn/soy/wheat), which is nonsensical. Sarah DeWeerdt of Anthropocene Magazine notes that the researchers’ conclusion that vegan diet don’t scale is “likely shaped by the study’s algorithms and assumptions.” She adds, ""For example, the researchers assumed that in the absence of farmed animals, crops currently fed to livestock would be rerouted to humans. And tillable land now occupied by animals or used for hay production would be planted with crops in the same proportion as in the current agricultural system.""

Assuming that we would continue growing massive amounts of animal feed even though we wouldn't have livestock animals anymore seems to me like a plainly ridiculous scenario to model. The fact that this was peer-reviewed doesn't mean their model is actually good. In fact if you [look at some of the letters submitted to PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/E10301) you will see that some of their peers made these exact criticisms. For example in [this letter](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/8/E1704) from researchers at Oxford, University of Minnesota, and Harvard, they state:

&gt;White and Hall suggest that removing animals from US agriculture would create a food supply incapable of supporting the United States population’s nutritional requirements and increase nutritional deficiencies compared with the current food system. However, their analysis suffers from an uncritical use of nutritional values and optimization algorithms, and a highly unrealistic and narrow scenario design.

&gt;In constructing their dietary scenarios, White and Hall use a linear-programming algorithm that optimizes diets to meet nutrient constraints at lowest cost. This approach is problematic: since 1945, it has been recognized to result in highly unrealistic and monotonous diets if not properly constrained

. . . 

&gt;The assumptions made regarding the inputs used in the optimization algorithm are similarly problematic. White and Hall assume that the distribution of crops in US agriculture cannot change, despite plentiful examples otherwise (4). That assumption results in a food supply that is significantly higher in corn and other animal feeds, which is not desirable from health and environmental perspectives, given their high carbohydrate content and predominant food use as high-fructose corn syrup and the high fertilizer inputs to corn production. Despite that, the emissions related to fertilizer inputs might be double-counted, as they are commonly included in the life-cycle estimates used.

"FragReddit","t5_2r6ca","Ich bin Mitte zwanzig und muss sagen, dass ich solchen Ausübungen zumindest skeptisch gegenüber stehe und ich versuche gern, dir das zu erklären.

Zuerst einmal: ich bin absolut Pro Religionsfreiheit und nordische Bräuche fallen da natürlich auch darunter. Ist ja auch erstmal nichts schlimmes dabei. Sonnenwendfeiern, ein relativ Diverses Pantheon an Gottheiten und das Konzept von Valhalla gehört für mich definitiv zu den erstrebenswerteren Beschreibungen eines Afterlifes. Alles ziemlich cool und geil soweit.


Aaaaaber an dieser Nazisache ist meiner bescheidenen Wahrnehmung nach was dran. Die OG Nazis haben, wie hinlänglich bekannt ist, den ""arischen Menschen"" nach stereotypisch skandinavischen Phänotyp als absolut überlegene Krone der Schöpfung angesehen und wie bestialisch mit ""unterlegenen Rassen"" umgesprungen wurde sollte auch bekannt sein. Da den braunen Arschgeigen schon während der Straßenschlachtzeit in den 1920ern gedämmert hat, dass die in Deutschland damals noch einflussreichen Kirchen mit ihrer Ideologie nicht so 100% d'accord sein könnten, haben die früh eine eigene Leitkultur entwickelt, in der die sich Recht dreist Teile der nordischen Mythologie als spirituellen und systemkonformen Gegenentwurf angeeignet haben. 
Auch heute werden Elemente von dieser Aneignung von manchen explizit neonazistischen Gruppen weiter kultiviert.

Nun hab ich in meiner Jugend auch Freunde gehabt, die sich mit nordischer Mythologie auseinander gesetzt haben, die Brauchtümer aber eher auf Met aus Bullenhörnern trinken reduziert haben. Teenage-Metalhead Gehabe halt, war durch den ""heidnischen"" Ursprung und die teils okkulte Anmutung sicher auch eine Art Rebellion gegen die christlich-konservative Mehrheitsgesellschaft in meiner Heimatregion und absolut harmlos bis aufregend anders. Aber ganz vereinzelt gab es dann auch die Dollbohrer, die sich dadurch ein Überlegenheitsnarrariv ersponnen haben. 

Dass jeder Mensch, der sich nordischen Bräuchen zuwendet, faschischtes Gedankengut pflegt ist natürlich genau so Quatsch, wie dass jeder katholische Priester auf kleine Jungs abfährt oder jeder Moslem ein Dschihadist ist. Aber in dieser vergleichsweise überschaubaren Szene gibt es definitiv eine Minderheit, auf die das doch leider zutrifft. Alle unter Generalverdacht zu stellen ist Unsinn, aber Wachsamkeit ist einfach nie verkehrt, wenn man sich spirituell ausprobieren will.",1617235246

- Detransioners are not shunned. That depends on where you are, but I've generally seen sympathy towards detrans folk. The criticism comes when we're afraid detrans people will use their experience just to hurt and invalidate other transpeople.

- 'Critics are bigots' - because many 'critics' are not critics. They're not experts on sex dysphoria. What the fuck does Rowling (and she speaks VERY similar to Rowling) know about sex dysphoria? It's not like we have a researcher who can refer to his paper and methodology, and got published in peer-reviewed journals.

- The thing about cotton ceiling is constantly critiqued over at r/truscum. Acting like transwomen in general think lesbians owe us sex is the 'transwomen as predator' trope

- Of course transfolk may have the 'us vs. them' mentality. We're marginalized and stigmatized. She could at least express a little sympathy here. By the way, I also think incels deserve a little sympathy too. I sincerly believe they're easy targets for picking and punching down, because who will defend lonely virgins?

- 'Female anatomy is now heretical speech' - I'm not sure how to fucking get this through a TERF's head. I wish I had female anatomy. I want to do what I can to pass completely as a woman and be as close as I can to female anatomy. I'm not on some project to 'deconstruct what it means to be a woman'.

A guy working for a large company makes a massive mistake and I t ends up costing over a million dollars to rectify. The employer is positive he will be fired when called into his boss’ office.

“Do we know why this happened?”

“Yes. XYZ was off and I choose incorrectly. I should’ve done ABC.”

“How do we prevent that from happening again?”

“I documented everything and shared the story with the team.”

“Sounds good.”

“You’re not going to fire me?”

“Why would I? It just cost me a million dollars for you learn that lesson and train the entire team. If I fire you, you’ll go work for our competition. So why would I pay to train their employee for them?”

One the biggest mistakes shitty leaders make is firing people for making mistakes instead of capitalizing and improving their business from lessons learned.",1617235246

I think your print settings are probably good, but you have some mechanical problems with your printer. 

The biggest thing is the huge lump in the middle of your print. Looks like a Z axis issue. First of all check all the screws are tight on the frame, and make sure your Z axis moves freely up and down without catching. You might also have your Z axis wheels tensioned too tight, but it's hard to say for sure. If you can spin the Z axis wheels without moving the axis using moderate force, then they are probably tensioned correctly. If not, you might have a flat spot on your wheel.

Yeah just generally inspect your printer to see if things move smoothly, and you may find the issues.",1617235247

"superstore","t5_3858g","Amy had been working at Cloud 9 for over a decade, years of her life making minimum wage. During that time she becomes a floor supervisor and eventually store manager and then finally a Cloud 9 Liaison with Zephra. She didn’t have any college experience or fallback options and had to spend years to reach the position she was in.

After all of that she’s faced with a choice even though it had no effect on whether the store closed or not. She could either stay in her position at Zephra or quit which she did. She didn’t know she would be able to get another executive position, and yet she chose to quit anyway because of her friends and Jonah. I also believe this is a contributor to why Jonah ended up taking her back. She could’ve stayed with Zephra and shown up a month later like she did in the episode, but I’m not so sure Jonah would’ve taken her back and married her.

What do you think, do you believe that her decision to quit Zephra ultimately affected the next episode and her ending Jonah, or do you believe that it didn’t have much of an effect at all on the finale?",1617235247

I finally started focusing a lot on my videos and creating content which really makes me feel a sense of accomplishment. That being said its hard doing it all alone and is so underrated. If you can master the art of being alone- you have the power to be in control of your life. Its lonely, dark , and cold. Sometimes thats the way it goes on the way to our final destination in life.
Keep your head up held high- know that there are so many people out there who understand your struggle. 
It doesnt matter where you live, where you are going, and where you have been- that sense of being alone and not having people there to cheer you on or even spend time with.. you can atleast find your true self in the process.

How would I know?  I can't even tell you why some people like butter beans and some don't.  I love those little fuckers; can't get my wife to eat them at all.  She looks at them like they're poison.  If you can believe this, she says, ""They don't taste good"".  What bullshit.

Anyway, the reasons people believe or don't believe something are as numerous as stars in the sky.

I'm vaccinated against all the regular stuff, by the way.  I'm no anti-vaxxer.  Polio, smallpox, I even got the BCG shot, the whole spectrum.  I was born in 1971, so before I was a year old, I had more needle tracks than your average San Francisco resident.

My wife works in an industry that deals with the FDA on a daily basis.  Daily.  Like in every day.  She knows *exactly* how difficult it is to get the FDAs approval on something, and it's a lot more difficult than less than a year.  The fact that mRNA research has been going on since Bush was in office (the Elder, not the Younger) and they *still* haven't managed to get one past the FDA, even though they've got one for rabies and one for the flu, (two maladies that have a global impact *far* beyond what the WuTang flu has managed and would make any company that marketed one richer than Croesus) makes me wonder if maybe things weren't just a bit rushed.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Godzilla had taken New York. San Francisco and Tokyo, too. 

There were rumors about a portal scientists were still trying to sort out, but no one really knew how Godzilla appeared. All we knew was a city bustling one minute and smoldering hours later. 

Guns did nothing. Tanks and bombs barely left a scratch on the hulking beast. There was nothing that could be done. 

That was until the beast came here. Minneapolis, Minnesota. 

Plumes of black smoke rose with the sound of screams downtown. Godzilla’s roar sent a tremor down the busy streets. People knew what would come next, so cars were left sitting on highways in efforts to get away from the thing, hoping they might save their own lives when so many others hadn’t. There was so much chaos, no one noticed what emerged from the misty horizon. 

His whistle sent a breeze through the trees, and the citizens of Minneapolis could smell the scent of tobacco. A cheer went up through the city. 

Paul Bunyan came to save us all. 

He stood tall as a skyscraper and pointed at Godzilla in a challenge. 

“Hey! Why don’t you pick on someone your own size?” 

The angry lizard sent a tower of flame at the man, but he held his axe with two giant fists like a shield, dodging most of the blaze. Bunyan grasped a giant cherry from a nearby sculpture and flung it, hoping to catch Godzilla by surprise, but the monster shredded the hunk of metal with a flick of his enormous claws. It charged for him next, but the man dodged, damaging the surface of overpriced luxury condos in the process. 

Bunyan laughed heartily, sending waves across a nearby pond. 

“Lucky for you, you big lizard. I didn’t mean to only pick on me.” 

He whistled, and the earth trembled beneath them both. Godzilla shifted its balance and a massive horn shot through the beast’s left arm, attached to an angry ox, blue as the summer sky. 

Bunyan grinned widely, and his smile glinted against the warm sun. 

“That’ll do, Babe. That’ll do.”",1617235248

"spirituality","t5_2qhc5","I am actually slowly cutting ties with all the things that gnaw at my soul. It’s a daunting adventure. I am lucky and fortunate enough to be in a position that I have the option to leave behind a lot of things many people need in order to survive, like a 9-5, or any employment at all, or paying rent, or keeping up with a social circle, among other things. 

Things like capitalism and the experience of living inside of the american facade of democracy, or any type of traumatic event i have or havent experienced, I am finding no way around just accepting and dealing with, short of self induced psychosis, drugging it out of my mind, or moving out of the country. 😬

Aside from that yucky realization, It’s a much lighter life already, and i havent really been at it all that long. It also comes with FAR more grieving than I expected. Even things i abhor, personality traits no longer serving or toxic relationships for example, i feel myself grieving sometimes and it catches me off guard for sure.

I also doubt that this type of spiritual journey is suited for everyone, its a little (excessively actually) unnerving to be unraveling everything ive ever been and known all at once. I think i may be just..... excessively immersing myself to be trying to get through the bull of necessary change as fast as possible, so taking it easy and gentle would be my best advice. 💖💖💖",1617235248

Sorta like Good Samaritan laws that protect a person acting to help try and save a stranger from injury or death. 

It’s stupid and shitty but I kinda get it. 

Like my family has a small bakery and never keeps anything over to the next day. But because of lack of laws they can’t effectively donate it risk free.

"u_notbrokemexican","t5_2d9scv","Thank you for the suggestion, always love being able to draw from some additional insight, especially through conversation.

One of my favorite memories of my life was when I was 8  years old in 2004. I had discovered a web game called Runescape that I learned after my older brother showed me miniclips.com. I played the game for hours and I have a memory of my father waiting desperately for me to get off, but let me play anyway. When I got off, he studied some CAD software on our old HP Compaq.

As for illegal copy owners, I know all too well as my father was an owner (he was orphaned and crossed the border when he was 17). I have fond memories of going to the flea market to take care of business as a child lol!

"quantum","t5_2r871","Quantum entanglement happens when two quantum states correspond to one another.

Knowing one state means you can infer the other.

If you had two quantum states (up &amp; down) and two quantum systems (s1 &amp; s2) you can create entanglement.

The entanglement would look like this:
s1 is in a state where it is in either up or down, and
s2 is in the opposite state

If you look at s1 and find that it is in state up, you can infer that s2 is in the down state, and vice versa

You can infer the quantum state, or ""collapse the wave function"", instantly even if the other system is across the universe

The reason coins don't work as an example of entanglement is that when you flip two coins, you can't infer that the second coin must be heads if the first is tails. There are four outcomes for two coin flips:
heads heads, heads tails, tails heads, &amp; tails tails

s1 with s2 only had 2 outcomes:
up down, &amp; down up

So I emailed my past fling this January on New Year's and now we're each other's AP. He has a girlfriend. 

He's from out of country so it's long distance for now until we can see each other in person.

The new Coyote will be under 10K for RWD, approximately 2K on top of that price for 4WD. We have exact figures, an ad campaign, promotional materials, and everything else we need for a proper release, and it’s all coming very soon. I posted this clip here because it’s a teaser, and we’re looking for feedback on the product itself.

I’m not a sales rep. I’m our sole social media manager. I’m not trying to be cryptic. I’m trying to be careful. I have a boss, and we’ve been carefully planning this release timeline. Start-ups and EV companies (really companies in general) love to throw out preliminary numbers to generate hype, which almost always leads to overpromising, which leads to backtracking, which leads to public dissent. While the public is starting to get vaccinated, and it seems like things might be getting back to normal, the global supply chain has yet to recover from COVID setbacks. We are a small company, and we are still dealing with those repercussions. We are encouraging people to enquire at this time, because we can give them an up-to-date estimate, and an estimate that reflects their circumstances (location, payment structure, etc.). Also, it’s just a lot of information to bombard somebody with over text. With very few exceptions, our customers only put down 50 - 25% to reserve their spot in our production queue. By the time their bike is coming to fruition, they will only end up paying exactly what is advertised.

We will release those figures publicly when we are confident that those figures are going to be consistent. I’m aware this is a long-winded answer to what seems like a very simple question. But, I think you’ll find that this is way more information than any large corporation would even bother to divulge. Just trying to keep it real.",1617235250

Yes, Sharla's outfit is rather revealing and both XC1 and XCX have options to just run around in a bikini, but the same applies to the male characters, so it's both optional and male and female characters are treated equally. That's why I have absolutely no issue with these games.  


But XC2 managed to make the whole thing awkward and does make it hard to take the game seriously at times. I have played many Japanese games and yes, many have oversexualized characters and maybe the one or other unnecessary camera angle... but it's so blatant and constant in XC2 that it really makes me question how this franchise drifted off this far this quickly. Why do 90% of the female characters wear nothing but underwear or cover barely enough to not be indecent? (And even that can be argued.)  


Even if you consider that there are more male players than female players who will ""like"" those designs or at least won't be bothered by them as much (there's enough male players who find them just as awkward) above everything else this is a game for kids 12 and above. Do we really need those designs in a game meant for a wide audience? If it's a 16+ game, sure, it would still be unnecessary but I would at least be like ""Well, the rating is there for a reason."" In this game though... overly sexualized characters are just not what I bought the game for. And coming from the previous two games I also very much didn't expect them.",1617235250

Yes, while the top 2 currently in the LPL have been historical chokers they're looking really good right now. And well JDG/TES while both underperformed last year still have a good roster at the moment so they could get better.

&gt;DK, GenG, DRX and T1 are a solid competitive group with obviously DK as the clear best.

It would actually be HLE over DRX but Damwon, T1 and GenG would have no real issues to make it out of groups.

On the other hand I look at the LEC and everyone minus maybe G2 and MAD have glaring issues.

Rogue are one dimensional showing 0 growth from last year, S04 have major issues which can easily be exploited by elite teams and FNC well they're just mediocre at the moment and their constant aggression will get exploited by LPL/Damwon/T1.",1617235253

"KerbalSpaceProgram","t5_2smr1","I had an original message I was going to send, but I wanted to try one more thing which didn't solve anything, but does appear to show that a lot of your work is just completely unrecoverable.

The first is that it seems like the root problem is with *structuralIBeam3\_4293955934* (I found originally that I would have to make multiple changes to multiple parts) as at some point, I was able to load the craft by removing one of the two instances of it, though, the Mk2 fuselages that managed to remain on the left craft disappeared.

I also tried merging it into another craft which did ""successfully"" load it, but it still gave that loading failed error and the same significant loss of parts was still present. I even redownloaded your craft to make sure that I have messed with the original copy and the same problems appear.

So I'm really sorry to say, but I think there's not much I can do to recover it.

**Original message:**

So I've tried messing around a bit more and looking up to see if there was something else I could do, but I really don't have much else I could personally do to try to recover the craft.

This is probably the worst corrupted craft I've seen as typically it's just a single part, but this has quite a few major ones that I have to deal with. And I'm not even sure how much can be recovered as I find it odd that the part count and cost remain the same after modifying the file and I'm thinking that it might be possible that the file is outright missing parts that should have been coded.

There might be something in changing the numbers instead of deleting them to recover them, but I still have no idea what they mean and how they are determined to figure that out. I've tried replacing it with random numbers which just makes it another missing part, and I've tried replacing it with another number in the file which does load in a few more parts, but in entirely the wrong place and it also crashes my game immediately.

I can share the file of what I was able to recover, but so much is missing that it might be better to just start from scratch.",1617235253

The peace of mind was completely worth it and I ended up just having hemorrhoids and IBS. 

The prep for me wasn’t so bad as my doctor used SuPrep, a 2 day prep. If you use it be sure to refrigerate it and buy yourself some white grape juice. I chugged the bottle of prep via straw and then chased it down with white grape juice. Seriously was the best advice someone else gave me as it got rid of the disgusting aftertaste. I also ordered some clear pho broth from a restaurant the day before so I could have something that tasted like food during the period of time you can’t eat solids. 

Don’t use toilet paper, use baby wipes and get some good ole Desitin from the baby aisle. Apply it after the clean out “fun” beings. Don’t wait for pain before you start putting it on.

"copywriting","t5_2qq49","This is awesome! Two things I want to add:

**One:** You may not always have survey data to analyze, or existing customers to interview, especially for new products. So where do you go?

The answer is to look at reviews of related products/ services, and to dig around on social media to find out what people think. Some of my favorite sources are Facebook groups, comments on FB ads, and even Reddit. Joanna Wiebe [wrote an article about mining Amazon reviews for copy](https://copyhackers.com/2014/10/amazon-review-mining/), and explains how she beat a control with a line she found in a book review.

**Two:** I also want to emphasize how important an imaginary brief is when you're writing practice copy. Not only will it improve your copy, but it also makes it easier for people to give meaningful critique.

There are a lot of practice emails posted here that are hard to critique because they're just ""an email about a product."" If you want to practice writing e-commerce emails, then take a look at [something like this](https://www.inboxarmy.com/email-marketing-guide/ecommerce-email-marketing-19-emails-you-should-be-sending-religiously/)\* and figure out if you're writing an upsell, or a new product introduction (which goes to existing customers), or something else.

If it is a fly you want on the very bottom, bouncing along the floor of the body of water, I recommend starting with a weight that you think might be too heavy. If it is too heavy, you'll most likely get snagged on the bottom. Start decreasing the weight until you stop getting snagged and or get snagged very infrequently. That is my technique. For subsurface in the middle of the water column, I find it easiest to make a short cast where you can see your fly in the water. Use your judgement to see if it is the desired depth.

You have yet to show any sort of data, post any link, to support any of the now disproven claims you've made. 

Still think over five thousand deaths per year is small? When compared to what? You mentioned knives, does knife crime result in 5,000 deaths in the UK annually? I bet it fucking doesn't. 

https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn04304/#:~:text=Homicide,the%20year%20ending%20March%202018.

""In the year ending March 2019 there were 259 homicides (currently recorded) using a sharp instrument, including knives and broken bottles, accounting for 39% of all homicides – a decrease from the 285 recorded in the year ending March 2018.""

Well shit. You were wrong again. 285 is no where near five fucking thousand. I would trade numbers with the UK any day. 

Tell me, which right wing media puppet filled your head with all this stupid? Did you learn that maybe, just maybe, they're lying to you? That the bad data they feed to you, makes you LESS informed? Maybe you should turn them off, and start actually researching this stuff so that when you get hostile and start a debate you don't look like a mouth breather?

&gt;Citar para que? Faz parte da América do Norte de acordo com nosso currículo  

Isso é mais uma coisa que eu pelo menos esperava que fosse ensinado por aí. Eu lembro de ter caído em prova de geografia coisas sobre a diferença entre América do Norte, Central e Sul. Eu nem lembro ao certo 100% quais eram, mas era significante o suficiente pra fazerem a distinção.  

&gt;Em inglês, a conversa é sempre bem claro.  

Realmente, talvez ter crescido ouvindo esse termo em português tenha afetado a minha compreensão do termo, sempre tive o nome ""América"" como algo referente ao continente em geral, mas, pelo menos na minha cabeça de batata, não vejo onde há a necessidade de se usar apenas ""America"" pra se referir aos EUA, tendo os outros termos que vc msm citou.

I don't know if you want to risk it, but I would lower my price to $24 shipped if you still want it. I would pop it into my console and show you it works, but I only have a Series S now. I tried to take a good pick of the crack but my phone camera is not good at macro. I just noticed the crack, haven't used the game since I bought Rockband 4 in 2017.

Taste: BOLD! Complex! Caramel, vanilla cake with cherry and whipped cream on top. Oily coating mouthfeel, oak and rye spice with that beautiful herbal tea note.

Finish: Long finish filled with sweetness, oak, and more rye spice. This is a complex one.

I pointed it out elsewhere here: once the filibuster is gone, they will just wait quietly until they control all three branches again, and then use this against you in the worst way possible. Like, imagine the EPA being disbanded, FDA hollowed out, etc. Basically the entirely regulatory apparatus built up over the past century will be gone, or at the least subverted and then used as a bargaining chip to get something else just as bad, and their base will be laughing the entire time you are squirming.

They are patient. Much more patient than you. This whole judicial coup they did over the past 5 years was planned for over decades. They are thinking several steps ahead you.

We got lucky in that Trump was incompetent at governing so damage was ""somewhat"" limited. We will not be as lucky next time and eliminating these safeguards will end any chance at returning things to normal.

It seems to occur when using 120hz, 4K and VRR mode on. Might occur in other settings.

I’ve been extensively researching this issue with LG’s firmware engineers for months. Even sent them and the various AV forums this YouTube vid of the issue.
https://youtu.be/_k2zqHC79dk

It’s clearly a defect they can’t resolve under certain conditions for this C9 2019 model. The LG firmware engineer told me the C9 was future-proofing the hdmi 2.1 tech and as soon as devices last fall 2020 started coming out they had to quickly issue a firmware to fix compatibility issues the best they could. We also have the CX 2020 model LG oled here and this issue doesn’t occur on it. I imagine the new LG 2021 “gen 2” G1 oleds coming out next month will be ok too.

"gardening","t5_2qhkh","Congratulations on your new tree! Here's some tree planting tips:

Follow [Right Tree Right Place](https://www.arborday.org/trees/rightTree.cfm) planting guidelines. When planting trees, you can't go wrong [following the experts' planting instructions](http://www.treesaregood.org/treeowner/plantingatree) to give a tree it's best possible start. It is *critically* important to [locate the root flare](https://i.imgur.com/q2du28V.gif), make sure it is above grade and EXPOSED, and REMAINS exposed for the life of the tree. 

With bare-root trees the root flare is fairly obvious, but very often containerized or balled and burlapped trees have their root flares sunk down under the soil line, or near the middle of the root ball because it was transplanted improperly at the nursery, so you may have to search for it. Trees planted too deeply suffer because their roots cannot get proper nutrients, water and oxygen. **Mulch and soil should never be in constant contact with the trunks of trees because it causes stem rot, insect damage and girdling roots.** NO [VOLCANO MULCHING](https://kanecountyconnects.com/2019/04/earth-day-2019-stop-volcano-mulching-it-does-more-harm-than-good). (Also make sure that the roots are not circling in the pot if containerized, as they [will have to be straightened or pruned](https://hort.ifas.ufl.edu/woody/containers.shtml) so they will grow outward once put in the ground.) Mulch should be only 2-3"" deep and in a RING around the tree, NEVER in contact with it.

I do not exaggerate when I say that this is (forgive me) an *epidemic* problem. Planting too deeply usually accompanied by over/improper mulching are the top reasons why transplanted trees fail to thrive and die early.

STAKES:  
If your tree can stand on it's own, please reconsider tree stakes. Save for areas with high or constant winds, trees only need to be staked when their top growth massively outweighs their rootball, and that tends to mean a fairly large tree. When plants aren’t allowed to bend, they don’t put energy into growing stronger, so instead they grow taller. Trees allowed to bend in the wind are also improved by vigorous root growth. [Here's a terrific article from Purdue Extension that explains this further](https://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/FNR/FNR-547-W.pdf) (pdf, pg. 2).  If your area is subject to high winds, you might want to consider the wood-frame ground stake featured on page 5.

If your tree cannot stand on it's own or you feel that it's in danger of damage or tipping from weather, animals, etc. without it, the main objective is to stake as *low* on the tree as possible using nylons or other soft ties on stakes further away from the tree, and leave the stakes on for as *short* a period as possible.

WATERING:  
We don't know what type of soils you have or how large the tree is, etc., but you will be watering (possibly for years) until they're established. See this page on [watering newly transplanted trees and shrubs](https://extension.umn.edu/planting-and-growing-guides/watering-newly-planted-trees-and-shrubs) from the Univ. of MN Ext. Soil type makes a big difference in how well it will hold water. You might try [this 'perk test'](https://i.imgur.com/2KiPHab.jpg) to get a better idea. Do use a bucket so you know how much water your tree is getting; avoid things like tree gators that lay up against the stem of your tree. 

FERTILIZING AT TRANSPLANTATION:  
Along with NOT augmenting soils (always use your native soil; do not mix or backfill with bagged or other organic matter), fertilizing is not recommended at time of transplanting. *Always* do a soil test first before applying any chemicals. (If you're in the U.S. or Canada, see your local state college Extension office for help in getting this done.) You may have had a perfectly balanced soil profile only to make things worse by blindly applying whatever product you used. Fertilizers can have negative impacts on beneficial soil microorganisms such as mycorrhizal fungi, bacteria, and protozoa. These microorganisms are present in native soils and support other beneficial soil-dwelling macro-organisms which make up the soil food webs. [Univ of NH Ext](https://extension.unh.edu/resources/files/resource000590_rep612.pdf). (pdf, pg 2): 'Newly planted trees and shrubs lack the ability to absorb nutrients until they grow an adequate root system. Fertilizing at planting with quickly-available nutrient sources is not recommended and may actually inhibit root growth.'

TRUNK PROTECTORS:  
Please also, DO NOT make trunk protectors a permanent part of your tree. These are traditionally used to prevent trunk cracks, mechanical damage or sunscald and meant to be used seasonally, but too often they are left on for the life of the tree, where [insects and rodents use them as homes](https://i.imgur.com/p18ZqCs.png), going on to damage the bark of the trees they were meant to protect. Instead consider creating a cage from [hardware mesh](https://i.imgur.com/TYkRhZh.jpg) about 1-2' in diameter, staked to the ground around your tree to protect from rodents and deer if they're an issue in your area.

PRUNING:  
If you need to prune a branch, prune to [the branch collar](https://i.imgur.com/DWkNMlG.jpg) or as close as can be gauged, but NOT into it. For the other tree pruning guidelines, here's a really [excellent pdf from Purdue Univ. Extension](https://extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/FNR/FNR-506-W.pdf) written specifically for homeowners on how, when and why's to prune well. Do NOT top trees. (Here's [a recent example](https://old.reddit.com/r/arborists/comments/ly3lbb/look_at_these_poor_trees/)). Trees are not shrubs that can be hacked on as shown in that post. [Topping](https://www.pubs.ext.vt.edu/430/430-458/430-458.html)' is terrible for trees.

I hope you'll post again with what your tree looks like when you get it in the ground! Please do feel free to post with pics if I can help further.

[https://www.jccf.ca/mandatory-hotel-quarantines-and-travel-restrictions/](https://www.jccf.ca/mandatory-hotel-quarantines-and-travel-restrictions/)

Overview of choices for returning travellers

Arrive with the mandated Covid test within 72 hours of flight arrival and comply voluntarily with any additional testing and quarantine in the federal facility (hotel) , at a cost of $2000 per person, and hopefully be out of quarantine in 3 days. In this scenario, in our legal opinion this process has completely suspended all Charter rights including right to counsel, right to appear in court within a reasonable time and right to reasonable bail.

&amp;#x200B;

If you refuse testing, it is not clear what will happen. Some travellers have walked out of the airport and refused quarantine. Please see the section above on refusing testing. You could refuse to take the PCR test and/or go to the federal quarantine facility.  If you choose this path you will be in breach of the Quarantine Act, and maybe  issued a ticket/s with a set fine.  You may also be issued with a summons, which does not have a set fine amount.  In that case the maximum penalty you face could be a $750,000 fine and/or six months imprisonment.

&amp;#x200B;

Refuse testing and quarantine and if issued a ticket, contact the Justice Centre immediately, with a copy of the front and back of the ticket. We will assist you.

&amp;#x200B;

We have not heard from any Canadian citizen who has returned to Canada and been arrested. If arrested, you WILL have the right to speak to counsel, the right to be taken before a court within 24 hours and the right to get reasonable bail.  If this is the route you choose we would highly recommend that you retain a local criminal defence lawyer BEFORE you arrive in Canada so that you can contact them immediately if you get arrested. In this way, you will have a lawyer who will be able to assert your rights for you at the time of detention. We are unable to recommend criminal lawyers. Then please contact the Justice Centre.

&amp;#x200B;

If you receive a ticket or a summons you will have the opportunity to attend Court and defend yourself. You will have the opportunity to explain your personal circumstances and why you chose not to comply. A judge will then decide what penalty you should receive based on your persona circumstances. Please note it is very rare for anyone to receive the maximum set penalty, which is generally reserved for the worst offenders. The process of contesting your ticket and going to court may take up to one year and possibly longer to complete.

&amp;#x200B;

Arrive by land. The federal government has stated they have no immediate plans to force non-essential travellers entering Canada by land to spend part of their quarantine in a hotel at their own expense. at this point, the only new requirement that non-essential land travellers will soon face is to show proof of a negative Covid test at the border — a rule that has been in place for air passenger arrivals since Jan. 7. Although the Canada-U.S. land border is closed to non-essential travel during the pandemic, Canadian leisure travellers can still fly to the United States, ship their cars over, and return home by any mode of transport. The federal government has stated travellers arriving by land without a PCR test may be fined up to $3000/day. If you are fined or ticketed, please contact the Justice Centre.

&amp;#x200B;

Fly to the nearest US border point, obtain transportation, cross the border by vehicle and drive home, with the same considerations as outlined above, arrival by land.

&amp;#x200B;

Some Police Departments including Peel and Alberta have stated that at this time they are not arresting people for refusing the PCR test or mandatory quarantine.

&amp;#x200B;

There have also been  (unconfirmed) reports that people who refuse to take the PCR test or to quarantine may be tracked down by Health Canada officials and issued further tickets.",1617235260

Our recent success has come as we've returned to form, not because of Instagram campaigns. Don't forget that the banter era started the minute the club was sold to that moron Thohir. The zhang's greatest strength has been being uninvolved in footballing decisions and not going to cronies like thohir did with joorabachian. This club doesn't need an iPhone friendly crest or multiple shopping and fine dining establishments in its stadium. It needs an owner who cares about winning and fans who will stick around when lukaku isn't scores five goals a week. It needs to remain true to its roots.

I won’t fault CD for that, but I will gladly blame SE for forcing the release of a game that was not ready.

Nowadays more and more people are considering using crypto in their daily lives and some companies are considering pay salaries with crypto. If this happens it will turn the government money even more useless. A mandatory chip implant with a payment system included with it would make sure that the state would have full control of the money and the economy too.

"HPfanfiction","t5_2t100","As people said before, any ship can be interesting as long as it is well developed, and it's not like there is a ""perfect ship"" that can automatically makes a fic interesting. 

But when it comes to a favourite ship, I have always been interesting by Harry/Daphne. As a ""pureblood of Slytherin"" and a blank slate, Daphne gives a lot of possibility to make an interesting story : Star Crossed Lover, that one good Slytherin, or even that traitorous lover . . . Sadly, most story just use that some bland ""Ice Queen of Slytherin"" persona.

Recently, I have also been pretty interested by Tracey Davis. She is even less developed than Daphne (which is already an exploit in itself) and is technically not canon since she only appears in Rowling notes, but fanon seem to agree to make her a Half Blood in Slytherin. I like the idea of ""Chosen One Harry"" being with some normal, unassuming girl whose only flaw is to be in the same House than the Magical Nazis.   
Sadly, the character is almost exclusively used as a +1 for Daphne (ever as the loyal best friend, or girl that comes in package when in relationship) and it's almost impossible to find a fic with only her pairing.",1617235262

As someone who had no experience at all, it did help that I was taught some library terms and expanded my knowledge on hidden or lesser known aspects about library work.  Maybe having those classes on my resume helped to get my part time job in Technical Services, which frankly did not involve much experience or knowledge either (I basically label DVD and CDs and occasionally add an item to the database). 

Right now I don't have plans to get an MLIS but I do look at discussions about it because practically every job seems to hire those with rather than those without, even when it is not necessary--I get it, why pay for milk when you can get the cow for free?",1617235262

Following the true meaning of that text we must recall racist Collins and never permit her to have a public position of power so she cannot use that to go after minority groups with such hatred. 

Recall Racist Collins and I hope she is counter sued and made to pay a large monetary sum for the trouble her malicious actions have caused.

Her lawsuit even if she lose will cost the board and hence the education system money that could have been spent towards the goal of the education system: helping kids. By her actions you see she not care about kids only her own self serving needs.",1617235262

"osr","t5_2svde","I'd try to do a lot of it through adventure design - make it a sandbox, give them a ship, let them explore. Don't tailor challenges precisely to their level - there may be threats that are beyond them that they'll need to avoid, or return to later. Drop hooks and locations but don't structure the game around a pre-plotted arc.

OSR games often emphasize resource management, so you could get very particular about fuel, maintaining the ship, ammunition, power, medical supplies, and similar resources that often get vaguely hand-waved or de-emphasized. If they're out of fuel and stranded, they'll need to put out a distress call and hope someone comes to help (and maybe that someone turns out to be pirates or militant cyborg terrorists or whatever).

Cut down on any sort of ""fast traveling."" Make space full of threats and hazards. Mundane issues like ship repair after an asteroid impact could become entire mini-adventures.

For rules changes, you could consider tying XP to credits earned.

I'd consider ripping out the entire death rules - resolve points and all that - and just going for 0 = dead, or maybe death savings throws as in 5th edition.",1617235263

Not that match the scale of ours. Does religion have a massive cost? Indeed, how many buildings have we built just for jesus? How much time do we spend gathering? How many wars have we fought for god? Something this costly can't occur accidentally. 

In the same way, homosexuality has been with us for a long time. We may not know exactly how it helps us, but clearly it does. Otherwise, we could not afford the cost of 4% of individuals who won't reproduce.

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","You question was adequately answered in this thread but I respectfully believe there may be some misinterpretation going on. (Not that the conclusions are incorrect.)

&gt;...as **arranging** the giving and taking in marriage, engagements and divorces

This is saying that monastics should not get involved with matchmaking or performing marriage ceremonies. There are a lot of practical reasons for this - should a match not work out then all sorts of hard feelings can result that can be disruptive to the monastic as well as cause tension with lay people. In addition, focusing on this kind of work in the community is a distraction from teaching the Dharma (at best) and can open one up to potential bribery and or mis-use of authority.

So the other commenters are not wrong at all - monastics do not marry. But this passage is not talking about that. It's talking about performing marriage and other rites and just overall being involved in the interrelationships of the lay community.

Make sense?",1617235265

The IRS probably made the decision to get stimulus out immediately and hope down the line taxes could be sorted out. It seems almost on purpose to pass a large humungous tax code change right before tax season and stimulus. Order out of Chaos is their motto. Anyway...

&amp;#x200B;

I filed 2/12, accepted 2/13 and after 21 days I have been stuck. One of the people I spoke to told me there was a huge glitch that caused pretty much all kinds of craziness with the stimulus rebate to any other credits with holds. And once you get done with one hold, it has to go in cycle to get off a next hold.. It's ridiculous. They are probably using computers with 256K ram cards still in them..

The family absolutely should have some protections in place. Enough money to be living close to the poverty line (or like in Australia, far below the poverty line but enough to pay for rent and a little food).

The actions of a potential abusive partner shouldn’t put their family into a position of homelessness - if the abused can’t access money for accomodation they can get stuck in abusive relationships and become radicalised theirselves.

This whole thing is a giant what? Like yes, I agree this is a giant middle finger to all Americans (the argument he should be released so he can be an income earner for his family) but it shouldn’t even be a possible argument in the first place if the society actually cared about its members

America’s social contract is all kinds of broken

3090s sold this month: 39

3080s sold this month: 60

3070s sold this month: 75

3060 tis sold this month: 34

3060s sold this month: 71

**6700 XTs sold this month: 80**

**6800s sold this month: 16**

**6800xts sold this month: 8**

**6900xts sold this month: 3**

This data isn't 100% perfect, but it's close enough to paint a very clear picture of the situation between AMD and nVidia. Both have pretty dry stock, but AMD - with the exception of the 6700xt launch - has been much, much worse. There have been 13x as many 3090s as there have been 6900xts, and there have been over 5x as many 3070s as there have been 6800s. 7x as many 3080s as there have been 6800xts.",1617235267

Trump literally had the most corruption in the history of America and half the nation cheered him on. 500,000+ people died on his watch, he sent a mob to storm the Capitol so he could retain power, and time and again sacrificed our nation’s security and standing by trying to get foreign nations to help him win an election.

Even the lowest ranking employees can feel like they are really being brought on board, because thay *are*!  It's truly a beautiful thing, for so many reasons!   

The more thoroughly it gets implemented, the more robust the benefits become.  A job isn't just a job anymore.  Mistakes become learning opportunities, as well as opportunities to build feelings of trust, mutual respect, and a sense of *actually* being *valued*.  In turn, this builds feelings of personal investment, and that is a beautiful thing for everyone involved!",1617235267

"polyamoryR4R","t5_37saz","Welcome to /r/PolyamoryR4R. This is an ethical and respectful community.

Here are some resources you might find helpful in creating and keeping healthy, ethical poly relationships: 

**Books:** [More than Two](https://www.amazon.com/More-Than-Two-Practical-Polyamory/dp/0991399706), and [The Ethical Slut](https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Slut-Third-Practical-Relationships/dp/0399579664).

**Podcasts:** [Polyweekly.com](http://polyweekly.com), and [Multiamory.com](https://www.multiamory.com/).

**Subreddits:** /r/Polyamory

Couples: Feel free to post, but we highly recommend you please read this page about [unicorn hunting](https://morethantwo.com/coupleprivilege.html).

Couples looking for a unicorn will often say they want someone to ""join"" their family. Poly triads are not (AB)+C. C isn't ""joining"" anything. You all will create something completely new; four different relationships that all need time and attention. A+B (as with any major life change, your relationship dynamic will probably shift), B+C, A+C, and A+B+C. Imposing unethical, unfair dynamics on a partner may lead to your removal from this subreddit.

I live in the Atlanta area and one of my coworkers and her girlfriend bought a house in an Atlanta neighborhood a few years ago. I’ve been to their house a few times and it’s a nice, cute, little restored home. Nothing fancy just two bedroom, two bath, kitchen, living space, and a tiny yard. Probably the same square footage of the house I grew up in. 

My childhood home built in 1997 was bought for less than $110k. My coworker’s house, well, the conversation I had went a little like this:

Her: “So we put an offer on a house for 415.”

Me: “...415...thousand?”

Her: *without conviction* “Yeah.”

Me: *standing there thinking wtf*

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","You're right that Revelation talks about it a little differently. But to me, it just looks like a more forward and direct way of describing hell than prior passages. I think they're talking about the same thing, though, and many gospel passages use similar language eg calling it a fiery furnace with weeping and gnashing of teeth (Matthew 13:50). 

And yes, it seems that the passages in Revelation are focused more on the fates of the false prophet and those who take the mark, but I think the standard view among Christians (at least, it was standard in my circles) is that the hell described in Revelation is the one everyone will end up in - the devil, the fallen angels, the unbelievers, the false prophet, and those who take the mark of the beast. I think there's some support for it too. 

Revelation 20:10  And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.

Matthew 25:41  Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.'

Those two passages, at the very least, suggest that everybody will end up in the same place. Matthew has Jesus saying that unbelievers will be cast into hell along with the devil. 

I think some of Revelation could be allegorical, but the stuff on hell lines up with what's already been said on the subject elsewhere in the New Testament. So I think it was being literal on hell at least, even if the rest of it is like something from a fever dream lol. I'm not a Christian, so I don't believe in any of it anyway, but I think there's good biblical support for the mainstream view of hell as a place of eternal torment.",1617235269

I don’t know you or how sure you are that you believe these things, but even admitting that these thoughts make you feel guilty is a step forward, I know of misogynists that wouldn’t even consider these thoughts wrong in the first place. there’s people you can talk to that can help you change, if you really want to. I’ve seen people’s sexist behaviour change and erode over time with work and reflection and talking with people. there is a chance for you. Don’t let your sexual fantasies inform your real-life worldview and stop watching porn (obviously). and see a psychiatrist.

please let me know if this helps or if i’m sounding like i’m minimising the problem here but i just wanted to throw in a few thoughts and encourage a new angle on it?

What this movie did was mostly fine as far as I’m concerned and that’s just because it didn’t distract too much from the monsters, they were always involved in some way shape or form.

I won't go into details but I've seen this kind of behaviour many, many times.

When someone is having a panic attack their heartrate skyrockets without physical exertion; it's not life threatening, it's just extremely uncomfortable. Putting someone that is having a panic attack or other mental health episode on the ground in a position that makes breathing difficult and/or constrains bloodflow is one of the worst things that one can do. Taking him out of the squad car was the smart thing to do; he felt cornered and would have thrashed about until he injured himself.

What they should have done is rolled him onto his side so that he could breathe while keeping his legs restrained so that he can't thrash about; his arms were handcuffed behind his back so that wasn't a threat. The panic will eventually break, the drugs will eventually wear off, and reality will eventually sink in.

In the videos one can see that he stops all resistance after a minute or so, but Chauvin kept him pinned anyway.",1617235270

My dad’s mother wanted them to invite HER boss and their spouse to my parent’s wedding. Apparently it would be embarrassing if they weren’t invited. They attended with their kids, ate and drank like kings and left a $50 bill as a gift.

Moral of the story is if my parents didn’t invite those absolute strangers to their wedding my grandmother would have been mortified and she’d never shut up about it, but they did invite them and my parents have been reminding my grandmother that her rich boss didn’t even give a gift large enough to cover their plates.

So this means if you give people 5 sick days the business will expect all of them to be taken every year.

A business that cannot tolerate a missing sick employee will have to budget 2 extra weeks of salary per employee (1 off sick and 1 replacement). Where as before they just had to budget for the replacement.

Like or not it does cost money to provide sick days... it is probably money well spent when people are sick.

One way to fix it is just increasing min wage and give people 5 sick days unpaid (so you can't be fired for being sick). The unpaid days are compensated by the increase in min wage.  Not perfect, but it would be a start.",1617235270
"MouseReview","t5_2vlxi","So I've had the GPW for a while now but the skates have always been off to me. So I went on the search for better mouse feet. Over the course of time, I've used Tiger Arc 1s, Tiger Arc 2s, Tiger Ice, Hyperglides, Hyperslides (yes the off-brand ones you see on Amazon), and Corepads.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I'd rank them:

1. Tiger Arc 1s (slow and smooth that's good for control because I use a fast cloth pad, Hayate Otsu)
2. Tiger Ice (has a similar quirk to Corepads where you can receive feedback from the texture of mousepad, highly recommend for coated control cloth pads. perhaps faster than Corepads by a margin and also less control)
3. Corepads (quirk that allows you to better pick up texture on mousepads but in my experience they become sticky or muddy almost after some time)
4. Tiger Arc 2s (fast, smooth, but have tiny more friction than Hyperglides. In my experience, they're loud on small 4 corner skates but noticeably less audible on 2 large mouse skates)
5. Hyperglides (very consistent even after long use but very buttery fast. however I don't recommend them because they have such a high cost for such minimal output, like you'd literally be better of with Tiger Ice or 2s for value and performance)
6. Hyperslides (Don't recommend even if they're easily obtainable because they have such inconsistent reviews on them and I didn't like them that much either)

Speed ranking (For control, reverse it in that order so Tiger Arc 1 would be #1):

1. Hyperglides
2. Tiger Ice
3. Tiger Arc 2s
4. Corepads
5. Hyperslides
6. Tiger Arc 1s

"Ask_Politics","t5_2t160","First, almost all firearm violence is the violence you never hear about. Suicides, domestic violence and conflicts between criminals. While the spree killings splash all over the front page, they aren't a problem that can really be solved via firearm legislation because they're so rare. They may not *seem* rare because they're given such prominence and the population is so large, but they are.

Indeed, if you want to solve such spree killings, the easiest way is to simply ban reporting on them. In a world where media was forbidden to report the suspect's name or publish their picture except at the explicit request of law enforcement (such as for the purpose of apprehending the subject), most of the high profile shootings of this nature would simply stop. However, it's questionable whether such a ban would actually be practical (not to mention legal).

Second, shootings are rarely ever carried about by people who are *legitimately* mentally ill. We call such shooters crazy because they're doing something we would never want to do - or wouldn't consider ourselves capable of doing. But they're generally not afflicted by mental illness.

Rather, they're afflicted by what might be termed 'social illness'. For whatever reason, these shooters have poor connections with the rest of society and find themselves isolated. You can see the same pattern in animals in the wild - young males driven from the pack/pride often turn recklessly violent. You can't fix this sort of problem with talk therapy and pharmaceuticals.",1617235270

I wrote these to offer a better understanding to lay folks wrongly led to believe that it's meaningful to point out H2's abundance. It's not consumed or depleted...so its vaunted abundance is totally irrelevant. If it were a ""fuel"" or an energy source, abundance would be relevant. 

It's neither.

Hydrogen cars are an eventual side effect of hydrogen tech, as diesel cars were a side effect of diesel trucks, trains and ships. Editors buy car stories so pundits imagine them.

Here (Toronto 2013) is—I'm quite certain—when the hydrogen transition finally switched off the pundits' side track and onto the main line. The speaker, Canadian Daryl Wilson, now heads the 90+ corporation Hydrogen Council, convened by the Davos World Economic Forum:

Welcome to r/HomeworkHelp! It seems like you have not attempted to structure your post title to classify your question's level and discipline/topic enclosed with **square brackets** as a title prefix.

**e.g.** **[AS Level Physics: Light]** Family Life?

###Positive Examples

|Examples|**square brackets** is being used at prefix (must) + topic (optional) + clear question|
|:-|:-|
|includes syllabus|\**[GCE 'O' Level Calculus: Differentiation\]** How to differentiate e?|
||**\[AP English: Essay Writing\]** Should all adverts be factual?|
|includes grade|**\[Grade 8 Algebra: Complete the square\]** How to factorise ax^(2)\+bx+c?|
||**\[University Chemistry: Titration\]** What is my qs?|

###Bad Examples

|Examples|*It still works, but strongly discouraged*|
|:-|:-|
|Grade/level is not specific enough|**\[High School Math\]** What is my qs?|
|What is your question?|\[Grade 8 Algebra\] **Helpppp!**|
|Do not attempt to circumvent square brackets requirement. Classify your question with square brackets|**\[Q\]** What is my question?|

**There is no fixed list of standardised grades, disciplines or topics.** As long as you have tried your best to structure your post title to keep things organised in the following format: ***[&lt;Level/Syllabus&gt;: &lt;Discipline&gt;and/or&lt;Topic&gt;] Question?***, you are safe!

You could watch how-to videos, rough cuts/skate parts, plan your board setup, etc. all that in the meantime. You can even start now and cruise around so you can get comfortable with the board, and even get some cardio in without even noticing because its fun.

Back in high school during PE I took a full-speed kickball directly square in the face.  Now there's two things I have to explain before I can get to the good part: First, I am and att was a big guy.  Second, I'm not usually a very emotive person, most of my reactions being either active mental calculations or conscious behaviors made more or less instinctive.
This latter point is important, since because it all happened so quickly and it was such a perfect central hit that it didn't actually hurt that much, I wasn't really able to react at all, meaning I just kind of stood there afterward as I tried and failed to calculate what to do.

So if you were another student standing there just then putting away equipment and packing up, you and everyone else in that gym would have witnessed the school's big &amp; awkward but ultimately well-liked ""that kid"" get absolutely walloped with the most picture-perfect mach 5 kick of hard rubber ever witnessed in the American school system, and then completely and entirely shrug it off like it was nothing, casually looking around at the suddenly gobsmacked crowd as if to say ""what are you all looking at"" totally unfazed.

Once everyone started to get back to putting away equipment shortly thereafter, one of the more athletic kids who was really on the short side ran up to me and excitedly told me ""That was the coolest thing I've ever seen.""  His eyes were wide with amazement and he had a huge smile, in that exact moment he looked like I was the biggest chad he had ever seen.



Another time in what was a very similar situation during either HS or MS, I was briefly lying down near a ceiling-mounted basketball hoop during a brief leisure period in the PE.  It was as I was lounging there (don't ask me why) that another friend/acquaintance took a shot with the basket.  He missed it, however, and it began careening directly toward me on rebound.  Now while I wasn't athletic, I did have pretty great hand-eye half the time- I could never sink basketballs but I was great at the motion of passing them for example, hollow a flex as that is.

So I quickly identify what's about to happen, and despite being firmly a ""freeze"" when it comes to fight-or-flight, my instinctive body uncharacteristically kicks in ahead of my mind, my leg perfectly kicking the ball away without moving any other muscle in my body.  So this kid is watching me thinking that he's about to indirectly pummel my poor ass, when suddenly I appear to effortlessly deflect the ball without hardly even looking at it like I'm some kind of anime character.

He then told me that it looked like I was a ninja, equally as excited as the first guy.",1617235275

I made $1100 dollars off an initial $2517 if my contract gets exercised. I'm not emotionally tied to it and neither should you. If the stock starts to plummet, this is great news.

"TheHandmaidsTale","t5_3fhbh","Since the show focuses on the elite and the slaves of the elite, we don't have full details.

From what we know, people don't use currency to buy goods or services. They are allocated food tokens, with the higher classes getting higher quality and more quantities of food. As for commodities, if it's a luxury, they probably aren't going to be making it. There must be some level of service providers, but they're probably only used very rarely. Commanders could probably get people in to repair things, but not so much for the Econopeople. As for companies, all stores and factories appear to be state-owned, or at the very least, by extremely state-compliant private entities.

From what we know, there are roughly three tiers: Commanders, who get mansions allocated to them, domestic slaves in the shape of Marthas, and are the highest on the list when it comes to being assigned sex slaves if their Wives are infertile. They also typically have male servants such as live-in drivers. Their daughters cannot read, but they are taught to do more complicated needlework to be a refined lady of the house when they grow up, and their sons are educated to be Commanders. The best houses, furniture, food is all for them. Their day job is ruling over the country, or making the most important  military decisions.

Next, there are the Professional class, only mentioned in the second book. These are upper-middle class people. They can be rewarded with a Handmaid or Martha if there is a surplus, but they're not entitled to them in the same way Commanders are. They probably have good-sized homes, but not necessarily a true mansion. Their children also often receive a complex education at the same schools as Commanders. Professionals work as doctors, dentists, accountants and lawyers. Military men ranking below Commander but above Guardian (like Angels) would also be roughly on the same tier.

The final tier is the broadest, the Econo class. They cannot get any servants or Handmaids. Some might have a good-sized middle class home, especially in rural communities, but others just have cramped apartments in cities. They have a very broad range of jobs, and make up the vast, vast majority of people. Guardians who have been assigned women, store employees, people with office jobs but who aren't exactly high-skilled like the Professionals, all fall under this umbrella. Their daughters are known to just be homeschooled by their mothers in basic needlework and making paper flowers, and their sons may receive just a pretty basic education or training to be a grunt soldier or laborer.",1617235279
"PCOS","t5_2ryc6","I totally understand where you are coming from, after my Dr suspecting I had pcos 2020 before covid lcokdown and told to lose weight I did immediately and now a year later after confirmation that I do in fact have pcos both Ovaries are enlarged with 12+ cyst on each ovary, I’ve lost weight, I eat healthy, I exercise,  My weight has gone from 196lbs(14st) - 126lbs(9st) that’s a 70lbs(5st) weight loss in total, I’m still suffering! I have a constant bloated belly, I’m hairy all over my body like a gorilla even waxing is not helping me these days, i get pain in my ovarys like child birth contraction pains it’s agonising and the back pain/ leg cramps, not to mention the fatigue and sickness I get. My periods ( when they do come) are pretty much like lava flowing from a volcano. I am in the Uk and I genuinely wish that Drs where more educated with these conditions, more study’s need to be done 100% , how can so many woman be living with this as there “normal” and have to live with this horrible condition for the rest of there life unless they get cancer to be treated and ovarian cancer is usually only found when it’s spread?.

"Zoomies","t5_3bd7e","True, but a good owner knows that, buys a dog with a plan in place to encourage their instincts in a positive way instead of a destructive way. Like someone who is very active getting a border collie with the intention and know how to teach them agility and tricks that use their instincts, vs getting a border collie just because they are cute and then getting mad that the dog is destructive or hyperactive. I have met rotties that got locked in the backyard and were incredibly aggressive because they got no socialization, and rotties who were muffin family dogs who were only aggressive with strangers, but relaxed as soon as the owner introduced the new person and showed the rottie they were welcome, because that owner educated themselves and worked constantly to train the rott from puppyhood on. A dogs instincts are always there, but a good and knowledgeable owner can work with that and harness it in positive ways. (And won’t buy a dog who’s instincts aren’t a good match for the ability of the owner. I would never in a million years get a Jack Russell terrier because of their destructiveness and high energy. But someone athletic and active might find that a Jack Russell is the perfect workout buddy, and is less destructive because the owner runs and hikes daily with the dog and tires it out. )",1617235280

    sudo sh -c 'nano /etc/wireguard/configs/configFileName.conf'

then save the file, then do

But like, I'm solidly in red ranks. Most of my games are against people who know how to loop and know to sit on gens when not being pressured. And my god, those teams absolutely shit on Trickster. Pretty much the only time I've reliably done well on Trickster against good people is when I hardcamp my 3 gen from the very beginning of the game and proxy camp every hook (his play against unhooking is very strong, probably his biggest strength).

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Some people are just tougher. Or maybe they don't take the ""just a pinch"" literally.

I can always feel the poke, sometimes the slide of the needle, and sometimes the goo going into my arm, and sometimes the removal of the needle. I've never had a shot that lasted more than a few seconds, so it's easy to such up the momentary ouch. 

Sometimes the goo is just filling a space, so there's a little pressure. Sometimes there's a perceived or real change in temperature. Sometimes whatever it is gets a little disagreeable and can seem to burn.

The bulk of that is briefly uncomfortable, and usually returns to normal really quickly. If there's any lasting impact, it's usually an ache, like I bumped into something or lifted something too heavy or for too long.

Rarely, but it happens, that initial jab is less than careful, and it's a definite, but small, stabbing pain. It, too, will subside quickly.

I've received hundreds of pokes for injections or blood tests by now. The worst were in the assembly lines in school as a kid, or maybe in basic training. But they still only lasted a few seconds.

Anyone should be able to handle a few seconds of horrible that doesn't usually lead to permanent damage.",1617235281

No, sir, your disregard of the English language is.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There is a legal definition of murder, yes, but there is also a common-sense definition. 

Thank you for taking my bait, sir. You see, I didn't even post the legal definition, nor did I even pretend to. As I said in my original post, I posted the common usage of the term, as provided by Google (which uses Webster's). Had I wanted to provide the legal definition, I'd have cited Black's Law Dictionary. Again, I'd like to thank you for proving my point for me.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;   You can google it or look it up in Webster's if you want. 

Which I did. I suggest you do the same, but this time accept the definition without making up your own.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Plenty of people get away with murder. They're still murderers. 

No, they're killers. Again, please learn how to use words correctly. 

&amp;#x200B;

50/50 that they would want to survive? Let’s check. No in the US it seems that about 11 suicides occur per 100,000 people. You’re way off. And even if we multiply the number by 100, assuming that only 1 out of a hundred suicides work (which is way more than reality, in reality it’s 11 fails for each success in the US) you’d still be way way off. If it WERE a 50/50 chance that someone would want to live I’d say only have them if they were going to cure cancer or something. Then maybe. But in reality it’s more like 1000 to 1. And that’s being very pessimistic.

No, not because I think the cycle needs to be perpetuated. But because it WILL be perpetuated. And thus, sometimes having a child will actually reduce suffering. Though the best option is for no one to have kids, that ain’t happening. Second best is to try to reduce suffering as much as possible.

Dealing with chronic health issues alone is ROUGH; let alone the added impact they can have on your relationships etc. It's rough, so cut him some slack. 

Regarding the whole lying/honesty thing I'll only say this: He, and people with chronic illnesses in general, don't owe anybody any explanations whatsoever. Period. He's the one who has to live with it; likely for the rest of his life. When and what, if anything, he tells you about it is HIS choice. Regardless of how you feel about it; you can't make that choice for him and I highly suggest you not even try. I know I personally don't tell people about my health issues unless I've known them and been close to them for YEARS. 

TL;DR Living with chronic illnesses is rough. Cut him some slack and get over yourself. Because he doesn't owe you anything when you're not the one living with the illness.",1617235284

Hi stubbornchild05, 

Your post has been automatically flagged for removal because it appears you are asking:

* for brainstorming ideas.

* how to ""get started"" on a project. 

* what is the best method or approach to a project.   

* whether or not you should do a project.  

* if anyone has used a product, or for a product recommendation.
                        
While we do allow questions in /r/DIY, they must relate to a specific aspect of a project, include the research you've done to find an answer yourself and explain why that research didn't answer your question. 
                        
If you have any of these questions, some places to get help are:
            
* The [Getting Started thread](/r/DIY/about/sticky) at the top of the subreddit.  

* Our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/diy) in the appropriate channel.

"Athens","t5_2r1a6","If you value diversity, you aren’t going to find it in the counties surrounding Athens. I would see Oconee County schools’ 85-90% white student bodies as a negative if my kids were to attend there. And “grade performance” is one data point that does not tell you everything about a school. The diversity of Clarke County schools makes it so numbers don’t tell you much. Clarke County may not have the high data marks that Oconee does but that doesn’t mean kids don’t learn, excel, and go on to great colleges and careers armed with a far more progressive social view than someone who has been in only a few classes with a non-white peer. Consider as well that many UGA professors, restaurant and business owners, local politicians (mayor and state house rep), physicians, real estate agents, chefs, published authors, musicians, educators at private schools, and other highly successful Athenians choose to send their kids to Clarke county schools. What do these educated parents who love and want what’s best for their kids see that compels them to send their kids to public school in Athens as opposed to Oconee or a private school?  Again, if you choose Athens, I’d encourage you to speak with parents, teachers, and administrators and maybe even tour the schools before discounting what may be a great experience for your kids.",1617235287

"Fencesitter","t5_38fvu","Those are horrible reasons to have a child. He doesn’t sound like he really wants to be an involved parent and if he can’t handle those very normal responsibilities with a “normal” child, how would he handle it with a special needs child. Because that can happen when you roll the dice with procreating. You raise some very valid points. 

Personally I don’t think you’re super compatible if you lean CF and he’s adamant on having atleast one just to have one and caving to parental pressure. 

At the very least you need to sit down and have a very long talk and keep having those long talks. Possibly with a counselor. 

To me, it sounds like he needs to be all in and he’s not showing you that. And you clearly don’t want to do it 60/40 (or whatever unequal percentage) or end up alone! It’s better to regret not having than to have and ruin multiple peoples lives. 

Don’t end up like my sister who has 2 kids and the second only exists because of her now ex husband who doesn’t even help with the baby at all -that he “desperately wanted” and then when the going got though-he bounced.

"guitarpickups","t5_36akc","Interesting. Looks like they’re using 43 gauge wire and ceramic magnets instead of the traditional 42 gauge wire and alnico magnets used in standard/original P90 pickups. The DC resistance is higher than the standard range for traditional P90s, which tend to top out at (or below) the bottom range for these pickups. I think they’ll tend to sound dark and you might want to stay on the lower winding/DC range for a middle position or they could sound too muddy.

I think these might be more of attempt to get something closer to the output and EQ curve of a P90 pickup (I guess, although the DC rating is rather high for P90s), rather than being an actual P90 pickup in fact, but if it gets to the same ballpark, then great.

The ceramic magnet will sound warmer than alnico, and the slightly thicker 43 gauge wire implies they’re not going for overwinding and high output.

The price isn’t bad for small shop pickup. Cant say if they’ll do what you want, you’d have to hear them and see how adjusting pickup height tweaks things for you.",1617235288

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","To start off, I say adult one, because I am, and two because although I’m just 19, and he is 19, everyone is at an age where we can all handle things in a mature way and find solutions.  (Doesn’t mean that everyone will) No one here is a child, we have the capability to work through things in an understanding way. I hold myself as well as my boyfriend to the standard of if something is an issue, we can find a solution. So yes, I’m an adult. Maybe not the same age as you or anyone else, but no one in this scenario is a child. Next, I wasn’t immediately aware that she was going to take the flowers; my first thought was maybe she was setting them in a vase. I didn’t hear his conversation with his mom, he told me after the fact. And maybe your culture or way you were raised or respect boundaries is different, but in this case, it’s my boyfriends mother. Not my own mother. She was speaking to him, not me. I didn’t have a chance to say anything either way. Next, I already brought this to my boyfriends attention. We’ve had a conversation, I just wanted to hear out another unbiased opinion. 

You repeated the same question three times, clearly without reading and taking anything else I said into context. I’ve had multiple occasions where I’ve confronted his mother, and yes “advocated” for myself. Neither one of us is a child, so while yes he is learning boundaries, it doesn’t give a pass for his mother to act the way she does. And if you thoroughly read through everything, obviously it isn’t about flowers. It’s about the principal of the matter, the fact that his mom knows the behaviors she’s doing are wrong and instigating drama, and how his reactions are important. 

So I really don’t appreciate you referring to me as a delicate princess. This is a grown woman who called my mom a bitch when she doesn’t even know her, judged and ridiculed me, and when I politely tried to have a conversation with her about these things, she blew up in my face. So please don’t make some disrespectful assumptions after you failed to take my entire situation into consideration.",1617235288

On the other hand, I'm a man and not at all bothered by the phrase 'toxic masculinity.' I don't see an inherent bias in it. To me that comes from looking at the words as much as from looking at the intent--to  /u/RubyTuesday123's point, no one looks at the words 'toxic relationships' and sees a categorical statement about all relationships. In English, sticking an adjective in front of a category usually specifies a subcategory, so I struggle to see an inherent bias in the language itself.

Art is very often influenced by what's going on in the time period - take a look at Enlightenment art, and compare it to Dark Ages art. There's definitely a very clear difference. Even in recent history, modernist art and postmodernist art are drastically different, and the only way you could realize why that is is if you look at the historical context between them. Take another example, and look at Depression art vs the Roaring 20's. The key difference is optimism for the future vs pessimism, and that can change the tone of artwork by a ton.

Good on you for not going along with this. It's the kind of thing that sticks in memory. I still remember the 5th Grade science teacher who got really aggressive dressing me down when I (politely and honestly rather timidly) corrected her about the sun not being a purely stationary object in spaxe. I guess it never occurred to her that any of her bookish, space obsessed kids might pick something up from their extracurricular reading. I would not be surprised if she still thought the sun was an unmoving body in the sky and not something hurtling around the center of the Milky Way along with the rest of the solar system.

We tend to put a lot of blind trust into the education system as a society but not everyone in it has the temperament for the job.

"Divorce","t5_2qipv","Two takeaways for me here:

1- Read over what you've written here, and do it again in 6 months. What you are describing here is a terrible, fairly one sided relationship. Believe me, I can relate. But the point is, you clearly were not happy. It doesn't sound like you were ever going to be happy again within the confines of it. The amount of time you spent mitigating this, the amount of mental energy you spent trying to limp it all along will become apparent in the coming months. You may reach a place in which the behaviors, hobbies, and habits you fill that space and time with will begin to bring you joy. Take the time to focus on this, bit by bit. I promise you that over the course of the next year it will start to yield results.

2 - I too was not happy for my marriage to end, even though it was fairly awful (particularly the last two years). We're all built differently. You may have invested more meaning and more of your identity into the relationship than a lot of the sock day ""lottery winners"" on this sub. Take that fact and realize that is you and that is yours to carry forward into something more healthy. That may be a relationship, or it maybe be a full and deeply lived single life. We aren't in control of that. But your ability to invest this deeply is valuable. Don't lose it.

Good luck on your journey friend. I hope that your path has begun to emerge from this in a year's time.",1617235291

The sport buckets in my Cayman also had a removable cushion, so I had an upholstery shop custom make a new one that was thinner so I could track the car with a helmet on. Probably not as direct an option for your dad's car, but if it comes to it, someone smart can surely figure something out.

I mean, there are lots of ways to encourage the wealthy to create jobs and raise wages that don't involve cutting taxes and giving them money.  Raising taxes does not necessarily imply the goal is to get the government more money.

Conservatives are always talking about how a job is better than a check from the government.  I agree.

I found I had to distract myself with something, even if it was something more anxiety inducing. Once I figured that out, I started going hours without thinking about dpdr. This gradually continued until I went days without noticing it, which further continued until it went away by about 9-10 months.

You have to figure out some way to focus on something else. Obsessing over the dpdr makes it worse, it's been said many times here but I think it's true. You have to find a way to distract yourself, and I understand this is much easier said than done.",1617235293

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","No problem at all! I just have the ingredients written down and know how to make it from memory, so I certainly missed some steps. Sorry!

I divide the dough into 10-12 balls that are roughly the same size and roll each out individually. You may need some flour so it doesn't stick to the counter and rolling pin. Or you can place it between two layers of parchment paper and roll it out. Bake each layer separately. I roll one out and put it in the oven and prepare the next layer while it bakes, and then repeat.

It's very time consuming to make, but so worth it! You can look up medovik on Pinterest and get an idea of what it looks like. It's basically the same thing, but medovik is Russian.",1617235294

Out of alignment from delivery, had to drive to service center an hour away 3 times and they still couldn’t get it to drive straight. Eventually they just set the toe in on the front wheels to the max so at least it kind of stays straight even though it’s probably causing a ton of uneven tire wear. 
Fender under covers weren’t attached right from factory, had to have fixed at service center. 
Scrapes down the side under panels from factory. 
Hood not aligned right (still isn’t but I gave up after they couldn’t fix it)
Rear doors not aligned right. Had to manually adjust the door stoppers myself because I didn’t want another hour drive to the service center. 
Voice recognition for the music etc works maybe one out of ten times. Other times it doesn’t even hear anything like the mic is broken. After it doesn’t work a few times it just becomes broken completely until the car is turned off. 
Navigation has lots of issues with wrong exit numbers or telling you there’s no route back to your house at all. 
Screen sometimes randomly reboots while driving so you lose the speedometer and everything else for a few seconds. 
Probably a bunch of other minor things...
And the big one, car gave me a bunch of errors on a road trip. Would not charge. Would not restart. Dead. Happened on a Saturday and there’s no service on Sunday. Tesla towed the car 2 hours away to the closest service center, leaving me at a hotel. Had to pay for the hotel and rental car to get to the service center two days later since they couldn’t look at it until Monday. Turned out to be a frayed wiring harness that is a known issue.

The problem is that hitting 7 knives is a complete joke as is so trying to hit said 7 knives and then get into melee range with a 110% Killer is beyond a joke. With the addon you could play Trickster like a slightly different Plague (faster ""Broken"" state less map pressure) but since the Killer is literally unplayable atm none of his more interesting addons can really be used.

Like, I'd love to try the Main Event extending addons too or maybe Diamond Cufflinks but this Killer is literally unplayable without Initial Throw Rate and either Throw State Movement, Laceration Meter Decay, or Yumi's Murder.",1617235294

On an individual level, the vaccine *reduces* risk significantly. The nature of viruses is that they spread from person to person. So that means that if something reduces risk for an individual, that effect is *magnified* if everyone does it. (Unlike things that only reduce *personal* risk - if the cashier that you meet at the supermarket stops eating fatty foods, that isn't going to reduce *your* risk of getting high cholesterol)

So one person having a vaccine reduces risk quite a bit, but not enough to remove other measures of risk. *A lot of people* getting a vaccine will reduce the risk enough that it is (relatively) safe to remove other measures of safety",1617235294

After all, you have flatly stated that vaginas and uteruses are the same thing, obviously have never interacted with a vagina in situ, as it were, and in all probability were rejected by a genuine fleshlight, too.

Do you need me to use less complex words with fewer syllables so reading isn't so painful for you? I would try to simplify my vocabulary to a level low enough to equal your comprehension, but it would be too difficult to regress that far.

Deep seated, not seeded. And seriously? THAT'S your justification for not knowing how to spell? That these misspellings are common on a  Runescape server?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA*gaspwheeze*HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh my, aren't you a funny little thing!

Your grammar is horrendous, too. Is that the servers fault as well? I pity your professors in having to grade your assignments. Illiteracy, bigotry, false equivalencies, you are a shining example of the incel mindset.

1. They switched the car from the m8 gte which was a nicely balanced car to the gt4. bmw gt4 just isn't a very fun car to drive. Bad brakes. Understeer. And somehow also has a twitchy rear end. This can be dialed out with setup but the fixed setup for 12.0 is awful. 

2. It was popular when they switched it to the gt4 because a lot of people had just bought the brand new gt4 and wanted to drive it.  And also because they didn't have Ferrari Challenge when they switched to the gt4. So it was the only short gt race available

3. Then they brought back Ferrari Challenge and that cannibalized a lot of the bmw 12.0 drivers. And now there's gt3 challenge which will probably pull some drivers from both 12.0 and Ferrari Challenge too. 

As long as bmw is paying then sponsor money it will still be available. But without the sponsor or a car update to actually make it fun to drive like the new McLaren it will probably die within a year.",1617235296

*****
&gt; 621 billion for roads, bridges, rail, Amtrak and electric vehiclesThe American Jobs Plan would allocate $621 billion to transportation infrastructure and resilience, including the repair and construction of roads, bridges, transit and rail service.

&gt; The plan would provide $100 billion to upgrade and construct public schools; $100 billion to build high-speed broadband infrastructure to reach all Americans; and $100 billion to upgrade the nation&amp;#039;s electric grid and investment in clean electricity.

&gt; The plan sets aside $10 billion to modernize federal buildings, $12 billion for community college infrastructure, $18 billion to modernize Veterans Affairs hospitals and facilities and $25 billion to upgrade child care facilities.

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

I actually tried both and while sushi I had was great, I feel that I can match the quality of the fish in NY (where I live). Also, I'm not a very adventurous sushi eater so a lot of ""special treats"" that I've never seen or tasted before or after visiting Japan were pretty much wasted on me. 

As to the steak, after I arrived, I read that they had some special rare breed of beef that they raised locally and almost never export so I went to [this place](https://www.nekoyanagi.me/) to try it and had an amazing experience (I kind of made a point of eating local specialties and drinking local booze wherever I went). It was one of those meals that you remember for years.

PS. Visiting Kanazawa was such a happy accident for me. I was aimlessly (I mean without a plan) wandering around Japan for 3 months in 2019 and Kanazawa seemed fairly close to Nikko where I was staying before. So I just made it my next stop and kind of fell in love.",1617235297

"DataHoarder","t5_2x7he","If you look at a datasheet for your average MLC NAND flash device, you'd see that they guarantee data retention for something like 10 years. I found a scientific paper that claims some kind of TLC 2D NAND flash will retain data for 1000 years (as long as it's only been written to once)!

Anyway, this same paper claims a TLC 3D NAND flash will last for about 10 years, at an ambient temperature of 85°C, at up to 300 write/erase cycles. This is more or less the kind of memory you have in your SSD.

Bottom line is, I don't think you should be worried about it. It is non-volatile memory, after all.  Think about all the aging devices with raw flash (granted, some use NOR flash, which can hold out for longer) that still work after so long, this with a ""controller"" that does nothing but ECC and having to do wear leveling at a filesystem level.

Now, I don't understand where this panic around SSDs losing data came from. I like to think it came from people misunderstanding a JEDEC white paper that describes a standard for data retention, which basically says a completely clapped-out SSD should retain data for 5 months or so, at average working and storage temperatures, to meet a certain standard.

The worst part is, I'm willing to bet this whole ""plugging SSD in every 6 months"" is complete nonsense. 

The controller in the drive has no way of tracking time while it's powered off (because it has no RTC), the logic inside the NAND flash isn't smart enough to know when to refresh data (it is designed with the assumption the loss of charge is too slow to require constant refreshing - this is not DRAM we're talking about), and it can't know the voltage levels inside the flash cells (because the memory's readout logic abstracts it away from the controller). 

The only thing the controller can tell is the bit error rate of the stored data, thanks to the ECC required to maintain data integrity on such devices (NAND flash is prone to errors, it's just a characteristic of the technology). 

Given these devices and their software are, much like hard drives, complete black boxes, most can do nothing but speculate.",1617235298

"zelda","t5_2r61g","Ocarina of Time was actually good enough in 1998 that stubborn 8-year-old me went in to the game fully convinced that the game sucked and that there was zero chance I was going to like it - and only popped a rental copy into my N64 to ""prove what I already knew"" - but I ended up coming out the other side as a Zelda fan. That alone basically speaks for itself.

As for whether or not it still deserves to be held up as one of the greatest today, that's a tough call to make. I'm noticing that the game is increasingly seen as a bit obtuse and clunky by players who are just picking up the game for the first time today - which is fair enough - but there are still quite a few things that OoT did very well which, IMO, have never quite been matched in any game in the series since. The atmosphere and lead-up before and during the final battle is one aspect that I feel hasn't been topped.

I think there's also something to be said for how OoT sets out with the objective of being a grand, epic adventure with no (or fewer) frills attached, which I admire. I've often felt that some of the games that came after have suffered a little from ""need to be different"" syndrome, almost as if Nintendo was afraid of developing a game which was too similar to OoT, so they had to attach a gimmick or quirk to make each game stand out. Unfortunately, those gimmicks often ended up being some of the most criticized parts of many games that came after.

Though Breath of the Wild is my favourite game in the series now, Ocarina will always hold a special place in my heart, and I always come back to replay it at least once every couple of years. Definitely still a great game and an epic adventure all the way through, despite showing its age.",1617235300

I wasn't eligible at the time, so I didn't try. But my family members who were eligible felt like they had to keep trying or they'd never get an appointment. 

After a while, you started hearing more and more about immediate openings that needed to be filled. I still wasn't eligible according to the state, but there were places who had gone through the eligible groups and were putting those who were ineligible on wait lists. I signed up with two places that I was aware of who were doing that, and I heard back from both with the week. Both had immediate openings for the very next day. So I was able to get my vaccine last week.

My husband has been eligible since January. In February, he was finally able to schedule an appointment that wasn't until April 2. Not only would he have had less hassle, but he would have ended up with an earlier appointment, if he'd just waited things out a bit. Of course, he could have still cancelled his appointment and gotten an earlier one some place else. But after seeing the openings disappear so quickly in January or February, he didn't feel like trying anymore.

My advice is that if you hear of or see openings that are convenient to you, take it. But if it's at the point where you have to constantly refresh your browser, don't worry about it. It can feel like it's going to be impossible to ever get an appointment, yet things do change. They're going through the vaccines, and it won't always be such a pain to get an appointment. I wish the eligibility had been staggered out better so it didn't feel like it was all or nothing, but it is what it is.",1617235300

That means they have a clan, but the clan rejects them, and the evidence of their heritage is diminished because they’re not indoctrinated (which means the mere fact of being accepted amplifies clan traits, making them a psychological manifestation).

An atheist may want to believe in god but his addiction towards the idea that god must not exist is pushing them to make many excuses on why they can't believe especially if they don't find any incentive to do so.",1617235302

"NSCollectors","t5_3jnmz","There's actually a lot of concrete numbers straight from LRG buried in various old threads, twitter, etc that removes a lot of that speculation. I have never seen the ""Best Buy gets the excess stock"" theory. There's plenty of information available showing that Best Buy orders a set quantity of each game they pickup. I have seen numbers as low as 2500 copies upwards to 15,000 copies (Yooka-Laylee). On average they seem to order 4000-5000 copies of most games though, but it really does vary on the game. For a game as big as Scot Pilgrim, I could easy see 10,000 or more copies for Best Buy, but that is a guess on my end. You can see some of the quantity produced values here (including some early Best Buy order numbers):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ko7iYqZDcr5Leq6I_1byupsVcyFjFZDYItTK5qhOwxk/htmlview#

LRG has also previously stated they keep somewhere in the 5-10% of extra copies for most games for damage purposes, blind boxes, convention sales, etc. That means a run of 5000 could have 250 to 500 spare copies in some cases. An order of 10,000+ could have over 1000 or more copies on hand. Those exact quantities are determined by how close they get to a quantity cutoff point. If they need 5000 copies and they get 4500 orders, they can order the 5000 and have 500 extras. If they need 5000 copies and get 4975 orders, 25 spare may not be enough, so they may need to order a total quantity of 6000. I'm sure they have a pretty good science down for everything at this point, and frankly I still try to dig into the numbers when I can because I find the numbers fascinating.",1617235303

"UIUC","t5_2qkxs","Yea, pretty much! We're doing our first out of town trip of the year this Saturday (we've gotten a crap load more applications than we have slots for already, so you might not want to bother with this one).

We don't charge a membership fee and we used to do tent/pad/sleeping bag rentals (I imagine we'll go back to doing that at some point).

How it works is we post a trip on the Facebook page and send out an email too. You would sign up for a trip (the sooner the better, slots go quick!) and wait for the conformation email. Once you get the acceptance email you'd paypal/venmo the club the cost of the trip expense (backcountry permits, camp site fee, boat rental etc) and we'd tell you where and when on campus we are meeting up to get into cars and leave on the trip.

We don't provide food on the trips so you have to plan for that, but the majority of the specialty stuff you'd need for camping can be rented from OAC or the ARC for cheap. Most of your usual day to day clothes would be enough for the kind of mischief we get into, but I'd recommend a good raincoat and rain pants. Good hiking boots too if you can muster the cash for them. 

With the exception of some of the fall/spring break trips most of our stuff is super beginner friendly, and we have folks on the Exec board (myself included) who have been camping and adventuring since they were little kids so we really know what we're doing. 

We've done some amazing trips and plan to do many more. Hope to see you out here!

"legal","t5_2qhsb","There is no legal requirement regarding whose ""paper"" you contract on as long as certain specifics about the deal are clearly stated. Parties, payment terms, description of the goods/service to be purchased, and other materials terms that are important to the agreement. 

For example, if you're contracting with a venue for an event - your agreement you refer to (that has governed your business relationship(s) with consultants) likely does not contain the appropriate legal protections that the venue's contract does. That's because their agreement has been drafted specifically with their service in mind. The venue agreement may address cancellation, rental deposit, payment terms, event set-up limitations, etc. - information and situations that are probably not present in your contractor agreement.

I draft and negotiate commercial Agreements on a daily basis. As a Provider/Supplier, you always try to contract on your paper because they're specific to your goods/services. But, it's oftentimes also an initial negotiation between the parties about what agreement best fits the situation and what's ""easiest"" or whoever gets to it first. There is also a David and Goliath reality with negotiating contracts in that you will usually have to agree to whatever a larger/more influential company has asked.",1617235304

"OverwatchUniversity","t5_3ejpe","People are taking what Jeff said and are misinterpreting it.

Here’s the actual reddit comment from Jeff:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/ix2ff5/thread_about_a_matchmaking_patent_filed_by/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

All he is saying is that Overwatch doesn’t use what’s in that patent.

Overwatch matchmaking is essentially just based on your MMR, which is mainly affected by your wins and losses.

There are other minor things that influence it, eg he mentions ping, region, etc, but at the end of the day, most matchmaking is done via MMR.

And if you think about it, if your MMR is lower than it should be, then you will get easy games and climb fast.

If your MMR is higher than it should be, then you will lose a lot of games becauee you won’t be able to pull your own weight.

If your MMR is roughly around where it should be, then you’ll get around a 50% win rate.

They’re not trying to force everyone to a 50% win rate, unfortunately if you’re not smurfing or not significantly improving you will get stuck. You can call it Elo hell if it makes you feel better about yourself.",1617235304

"nuzlocke","t5_2setk","Haunter: A. It can actually use its STAB now! And while its special attack and speed aren't as insane as its evolution's, 115 and 95 are still great. Not to mention the three immunities, good coverage options, and wealth of utility/status moves like Hypnosis and Confuse Ray. Its bulk is really bad (45/45/55), though, so it can be a risky play against stuff its typing doesn't wall. Also, while I love that Gastly's available as early as the first gym, it takes a while for the offensive side to get going - until you get Shadow Ball (level 33 or the TM), it's just Night Shade and a few things that run off its low physical attack. Better than gen 3 overall, but a wee bit too flawed for top tier if it can't evolve. Still easily worth it though - Ghost is just too good.

Gengar: S. Haunter but with special attack/speed boosted from great to insane. And even though the bulk's still not that great, it's a noticeable improvement. Plus it's still a ghost type. It's ridiculously good in this game, not much else to say.

Onix: Low D. Only putting it above bottom tier since it hard-counters Falkner and Bugsy - in case you somehow missed both Geodude and Mareep. And TBH, trading away a Bellsprout to get one for Falkner isn't something I'd do outside of sheer desperation. It can wall Whitney's Miltank too, but by then its awful offense has started to really hold it back - it's probably not breaking through the cow's defenses on its own. Good to have around early on to wall the typical early-game stuff, but still a terrible long-term investment if trade evos are off the table.

Victreebel: B. Just a solid offensive grass-type that can pull off Swords Dance and Chlorophyll strats well with its great offenses on both sides. It also has excellent availability, gets all the status powders by level 17, and now gets one of the best Grass moves (Leaf Blade) later on at 47. However, Grass/Poison isn't a super-useful STAB combo in Johto, plus its coverage is still mostly limited to STAB + Normal (with Sucker Punch in the battle frontier). Still really like the overall power, though.",1617235305

They have every book I've ever looked for from Marilyn Mansion's and Brenden Novaks autobiographies to best sellers like Freakenomics to children's books to brand new books on the NYTs best sellers to Haynes manuals for car repairs and shit ton of college texts

It is my FAVORITE  website and I try to tell anyone that likes to read, about the site. They deserve as much support as possible

If that's where somebody really wants to put their money they should look into how much of that $50 actually goes there and how, big picture, the trails are actually maintained.

I'm close to a lifelong member, but every single year at renewal time I weigh the pros and cons and it is always a very, *very* close call. People should look at the AMC budget, its principles &amp; goals, its activities, its priorities. Talk with some of its field employees/contractors if you can get to know them well.

For example: the AMC Huts and ground level hospitality industry accommodations may be a blight on the mountains; or they may be a necessary evil to help contain and herd the hordes to some useful extent; or they may even be just absolutely wonderful! A potential member or renewee needs to educate himself and then consider issues like that.

Trabalhei mais de 8 anos gerenciando serviço de segurança em uma grande empresa. Te digo que tu deves sempre manter a postura e atenção. Mantenha um padrão de qualidade. 
O que mais vi nesse tempo, foi gente em posto de trabalho bom, perder o posto por relaxar, começar a se achar dono do local ou achar que ta em casa, levando amigo ou parente para o local, não sair do celular, dormir e etc... O cliente paga caro por esse serviço e  quer dedicação total.

"outriders","t5_k8mix","The devs on modern games spend a lot of time making these beautiful environments, models, and textures, then most devs enable motion blur by default which just smears a nice layer of Vaseline all over their hard work every time you move the camera too fast. It’s supposed to look “cinematic” but from a technical standpoint I think it’s just supposed to make lower frame rates look more like an action movie or something. It’s something pc players usually suggest turning off as it doesn’t really add anything and now with the consoles running at a higher frame rate there’s a lot of people asking for it to be turned off or at least have the option in new games. Depth of field blurs things not in focus especially when ADS, most people turn this off right away in shooters as it does look realistic I guess when ADS on somebody close but most people will prefer to see the s pier 100m behind what they’re immediately aiming at. Motion blur, depth of field, film grain, and chromatic aberration look pretty when taking screenshots and can aid some immersion but do make everything overall look softer which can also affect target acquisition at range or in certain lighting conditions in a lot of games (not a huge concern here I guess with all the health bars)",1617235307

You may want to find the candidate who has even one issue you agree on or lean towards agreeing on. Candidate A believes that we should be free to carry guns and wants less government involvement in the lives of private citizens, believes in low taxes and bootstrap success for those who work hard--no government handouts. Candidate B believes in gun control, wants things tightly regulated by the government to ensure everyone has a chance to succeed in life, and taxes the citizens to afford programs that help disadvantaged citizens stay afloat. You may not believe in everything candidate A stands for, but of those issues, you feel strongly about access to guns. You like candidate B's stance on helping the disadvantaged stay afloat, but you believe gun access is more important overall. So you vote for A and hope that eventually a candidate will come along that aligns more with you individual values. Also, you vote in the local elections because your money is being spent there too. You may have more control there. Write to your representatives and interact with them. Demand to be heard. You CAN make a difference. You can also run for office (:",1617235307

[You're welcome to read exactly what the founding fathers meant in The Federalist Papers:](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed29.asp)

&gt;The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious, if it were capable of being carried into execution. A tolerable expertness in military movements is a business that requires time and practice. It is not a day, or even a week, that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a serious public inconvenience and loss. [...] To attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent, would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not succeed, because it would not long be endured. **Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped[.]**

&gt; 621 billion for roads, bridges, rail, Amtrak and electric vehiclesThe American Jobs Plan would allocate $621 billion to transportation infrastructure and resilience, including the repair and construction of roads, bridges, transit and rail service.

&gt; The plan would provide $100 billion to upgrade and construct public schools; $100 billion to build high-speed broadband infrastructure to reach all Americans; and $100 billion to upgrade the nation&amp;#039;s electric grid and investment in clean electricity.

&gt; The plan sets aside $10 billion to modernize federal buildings, $12 billion for community college infrastructure, $18 billion to modernize Veterans Affairs hospitals and facilities and $25 billion to upgrade child care facilities.

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","Listen - You ONLY got this dog 5 days ago. This is a HUGE adjustment. I grew up with dogs and knew I wanted to own dogs my whole life. When I first got my ""own"" dog as an adult, I spent the first MONTH thinking ""fuck this was a bad idea"". And he wasn't even a puppy!

Forgive me if this sounds more blunt that I mean it to - You are stressing yourself out a bit. 5 days in - Yeah, you are still adjusting. But dogs grow up fast! Right now, like you said, the dog is an infant. You don't have to love this thing right away. Puppies are soooo cute, but annoying as fuck.

Putting it bluntly again (sorry, I promise I mean well!) I think you should try and suck it up and see how you feel in a month or two. Even a week or two! You don't even know this dog yet, he's just this big furry thing that bites you and pees all the time. Think about it - If I handed you a random baby who you've never met, it would probably be strange and annoying, right? Now how about if I handed you your son - Sure, he's annoying, but you also know him, and when he's annoying, it's more manageable when you remember how cute he is when he watches his favorite tv show, or how much fun you both have when you sing that song you both like. The baby itself isn't any less infant-like, but you KNOW them, and you're sort of willing to endure the annoyances for the good times you have. You and your pup have barely met each other! It's going to be a little annoying, awkward, or uncomfortable in the beginning. 

Your life just changed dramatically and now you are making yourself feel guilty about the prospect of taking the dog away from your wife. ANYONE would be freaking out in that situation. Try to be okay with this being an uncomfortable time - It's a very short time.",1617235310

"gay","t5_2qhef","Well I’m queer and Christian, feel free to ask me or other LGBTQ+ Christians or visit /r/GayChristians if you have questions about it. My home chuch had quite a few gay and lesbian couples attending. It’s true that a lot of churches are not accepting, and that’s a problem... but there is a difference between religious institutions and faith itself. A lot of us love and feel loved by God even if some misguided humans make excuses for their hate. Maybe my perspective is different because I was raised by a misogynistic, homophobic, racist atheist who used his (terribly mistaken) interpretations of science to justify himself. I just think people who want to be assholes will find whatever is handy to cover themselves.

I also try not to limit my view of Christianity to modern US or European views. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church is a huge branch and dates back to the 4th century... Christianity was never about whiteness. That’s another idol people have made to provide cover to hate. God is not a bigot and I’ll never let homophobes claim otherwise.

We see Christianity promoted as being for whiteness and maleness *because* white males are in power and want to use religion to maintain that power. Jesus was nonetheless a Middle Eastern Jewish refugee who hung out with independent women and prostitutes and the mentally ill and told rich people to give up their money. I don’t think he’d be cool with all the lies people tell about him.

Edit: I doubt many will see this since I’ve apparently offended some folks by like, existing as a queer person of faith lol... but I think it should be said. [The Bible doesn’t condemn homosexuality.](https://reddit.com/r/AskBibleScholars/comments/exesz7/_/fgd1v8j/?context=1) Christians who claim otherwise are either misinformed or intentionally blaspheming. Either way, fuck those guys, because there is no actual justification for homophobia or claiming God is a homophobe in the Bible.",1617235311

I also said that having an MVP candidate on your team impacts winning, do you disagree with that?  I'm not even going to start in on the top 15 player &amp; GOAT ball handler, because it's just not true and they don't give out awards for handles (it's Iverson, BTW, and I'd say Curry has just as good if not a better handle than Kyrie).

First you have to decide that it's okay to cut off the conversation. It's not rude, it's firm. She is being rude and you are stopping her. This can be hard if you are used to trying to please people, or be respectful to older people, etc. 

""I won't discuss this any more with you. How about that weather/sports team/funny bird outside the window?""

""No. We've been over this and will just have to agree to disagree.""

""I said I'm done with this. I'm going to get some coffee/large amounts of chocolate/booze. Do you want some?""

""You are very emotional about this, so I think I'm going to step out/show you the door/run off and join the circus.""

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","There is a gulf of difference between EXPLORING, SURVIVING, and NAVIGATING. The conflation of the three is an issue for 5e (and the expectations of players of 5e), as well as an issue for the wealth of ""open world"" video games that exist.

When *exploring*, one is never lost. They are discovering. One can choose a direction and route based on certain boundaries (eg, no point exploring west, we know the forest ends and goes into fields of [civilisation]). That attempted route may fail, but that is a failure of *navigation*. Likewise, when exploring too far, the person only becomes lost relative to returning (ie *navigating*) home. 

When *exploring*, one is not constantly on death's door. Food, water, shelter; these are not the ever present concerns of explorers, for they prepare to explore. These are the concerns of people whose preparation has failed in the face of the journey; they then stop *exploring* and start *surviving*. Some exploration may still happen, but the survival is a different track.

So exploring is not navigating, and not surviving. It is, as mentioned, discovery. I quote: ""To seek out new life and new civilisation. To boldly go where no man has gone before."" One does not explore the known, except in the hopes that it isn't properly known. 

5e handles *navigating*. It's a survival check, modified by conditions, repeated on a set period, to move from tile A to tile B.  
5e handles *surviving*. Food, water, and sleep are clearly set. Shelter is discretionary at best. Dangers are present but, as you say, scattered across half a dozen books. 

5e also handles *exploring* in exactly as much as you said:

&gt; Do you want like cold, hard rules that say ""when you walk 10 hexes, you find a dungeon of Tiamat""? That's what the pre-written modules are for.

Exploration is finding points of interest. One cannot navigate to it, so there is no navigation guideline for it. Surviving it makes no sense without the point of interest being defined beyond a point, and surviving getting to/from it is not exploring the point. The point of interest, the actual exploration, is what's called ""an adventure"" in which things of detail and cohesion happen. I know it's something of a cardinal sin to compare D&amp;D to video games, but seriously go ""explore"" Skyrim, or No Man's Sky, or Elite Dangerous. ALL of the content of note in exploration is about what happens at the POI's. Where there is a POI, either it is put into the player's path, or the player is given clues as to the path to take. A trail, a distant feature like smoke, or merely an unresolved icon appearing on a HUD saying ""GO HERE"". Where there is no POI, the exploration is a dud, an amble across a nothing landscape filled with nothing. 

So what can exploration be? It can be a hexcrawl, turning unknown into known and hoping to find clues to POIs or POIs themselves, then engaging them. Or it can be a handful of rolls in a couple minutes (with all the static features figured out *before session*), that say ""Yes, we can move on to a POI now. It cost you x to get here.""",1617235316

"mathpsych","t5_2s61c","I 100% believe that cortisol is my biggest culprit for triggering episodes. Both mania, depression, and mixed types.

I took a Cognitive Neuroscience course and that introduced me to the HPA-axis (hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal) and the HPT-axis (hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid), among other hormonal/chemical signaling pathways. 

Not sure if you’ve looked into this yet, but my gut was just screaming at me during this course that there’s something there. It’s all about a balance of excitation and inhibition.

I think it would be interesting to model a huge feedback loop looking at all these different component loops/axes. Being able to actually simulate this system and see what the cascading effect looks like when we up-regulate or down-regulate cortisol/other signalers would be immensely helpful in understanding wtf is really going on during these episodes.",1617235316

"ValorantCompetitive","t5_2g5ach","LOL nah sometimes it’s just because what they read is just that ridiculous. Like seriously, you’re doing the exact same thing I responded to like that. What about supporting franchising makes someone so condescending?

Where is this kind of attitude coming from? Is there a specific reason or do you just like being an asshole?

Honestly, if you really can’t understand why someone wouldn’t like franchising, I don’t know what to tell you. But I’m guessing you just thought that some sad digs disguised as questions would make you look smart.",1617235316

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","I don't know how many could...enough that there was a steady stream of pilgrims, who could fill up entire ships, but that doesn't really help if we're looking for an actual number. Obviously, wealthy people or people we might call ""middle class"" today like merchants and scholars could afford to go, while the average peasant or farmer presumably couldn't. Ibn Jubayr and Ibn 'Arabi were government bureaucrats; Ibn 'Arabi was also a famous scholar, as was Ibn Battuta, who was also a well-known judge. 

There is a bit more evidence from Christian Spain - Muslims who still lived there in the 15th and 16th centuries typically needed to apply for a license from the local governor if they wanted to perform the hajj. One Muslim family went on pilgrimage in 1420 but they had to pay 1500 pounds for the license...I'm not sure how much one pound was worth in 1420 Spain but that seems like an enormous amount!

You could be understood, not forgiven, for thinking that 7 was a decent film. In the same way of revalence foe the prequel films is held. It promised more than it gave, even if, with even a touch more effort and thought, it could have been a much greater film/series.

The entire thing was plagued by bad decisions and dumb corporate greed; though this should be surprise when you hear ""Disney"" but can be understood, if not forgiven. 

If you genuinely ever thought that the prequels would be on the level of, say, the original Lord of the Rings sequel knowing any of this: you could not be forgiven. 

And in even completer honesty, no matter what was produced the SW community would scream and cry about it; saying it not to not be to the levels of their own fan writes and Extended Universe.

Him ducking Colby and Leon also isn’t a good look. Him not fighting Colby I could understand at one point but if he’s willing to support jake who does the exact same thing as Colby it’s a bad look.

Sich ein Bein ausreißen - to tear your own leg out (working really hard /giving everything for something or someone)

Klappe zu, Affe tot! - the trap is shut, the monkey is dead (when expressing something is over or a door or lid is closed and won't be reopened)

"kpoprants","t5_2973ru","i think it’s really a question in general of the acceptance of minors in the industry. dreams’ earlier concepts were at least on paper clearly targeted at elementary(maybe) middle school kids, younger than the members were at the time. whether or not that was okay because a) again, child labor, and b) perverted and inappropriate adults would see it, is a valid thing to think about. 

but this, like all entertainment industries, is an industry that relies on underage child labor and there are various groups where the majority are of age but there are still underaged members and their concepts aren’t always age appropriate. sometimes it’s subtle, but from being made to dress too maturely or provocatively, have dances that are considered sexy, are sexualized at large by either the fandom or the company, often both in different ways. so many idols debuted way too young from taemin, hyuna, changmin, jungkook (the amount of adult female fans insisting on calling him “oppa” from when he was still 16....), yuna, tzuyu, dino, wonyoung, krystal, jiheon, the list goes on. 

i fully agree that dream debuted way too young and there was no reason not to wait to debut them until jisung was at the very very least 16 (still too young imo i think all idols should debut being of age or at least very close to it) and whether or not the attempt at being age appropriate was always reached is at least debatable and up for discussion depending on one’s views. but groups debuting members way too young is a very common practice and way too normalized. the original concept of dream is definitely a symptom of that but it’s not the whole picture. 

all this said, dream are all adults now so i think this is a bit of a moot point, but i do think it’s valid not to be able to get into them knowing how young they were when they started, but it’s also valid to wonder then about the validity of supporting any group that debuted members way too young and had them do concepts that were too mature (the amount of underage hip-thrusting boy groups do is a lot) or positioned them as “the visual” (basically positioning a child as the “ideal beauty standard” aka anyway you slice it “the attractive one“. ew.) etc. there was a countdown clock to taemin’s 18th birthday. this isn’t a problem unique to dream. at least dream’s concept was trying to be age appropriate overall.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","That sure sounds like America’s version of freedom to me. 

While I don’t expect grocery stores to require proof of vax to enter, it would still be fun. 

If the government doesn’t allow entry from non vaxed, and wants to apply pressure to the travel and entertainment industries, that is ideal, as it has no negatives really for society, and is no change from how fucked up our govt already is in terms of intrusiveness into lives of Americans, so relatively easy to enact. 

We will have to agree to disagree on discrimination and protected classes, and I’ll stay thankful that things are not as you feel they should, and are heading farther away from that direction in general, even if the pace is far too slow.",1617235319

Based on the body text of your post, it appears you're looking for a forgotten series. When you find the series you are looking for, it would be appreciated if you added the title of the series as a Flair by leaving a comment that say `solved = series name here`. That way others will know that the answer has been found. This also allows others that have become interested based off your description to try the series for themselves. Do please avoid adding additional formatting to your solved comment though as I read based off the source of your comment rather than like a human being.

It looks less dramatic, but your ear getting narrower means you're actually turning your head away in the after pic, which makes you appear *more* recessed than you really are. Also you look like you lost weight, if that's the case the fat you had before likely acted like 'fake' forward growth, like a botox filler would.

"AmITheDevil","t5_27t6v0","There are countries in Europe/ the UK that allow it but under certain circumstances. I believe it was originally based on the law of the church. The law states that:

1. You must both be 21
2. At no time could you have lived together under the age of 18

Since they can't fulfill the latter, their only option is for the parents to divorce so that they are no longer related. Had one been adopted, they'd have been out of luck. But I mean, if it's a religious thing, the church doesn't recognize divorce so legally they'd still be able to get married if their parents divorced but they might not be married in a church or welcome back haha (OP mentioned marriage is important to the ""atheists"").

Still super cringey.

Central Asia is a fascinating region and isn't really interchangable with Southeast Asia (SEA). I'm also more informed on the history of Central Asia, from my reading days.

I've been to Vietnam (couldn't stand it, no offense) but not to Thailand. I'd be concerned about crowds, rain, and pollution in Thailand and/or SEA.

My favorite place in EA/SEA, and the only one I know I like, is Singapore. I wouldn't mind seeing Bali.. but that's a whole other trip from what I'm asking about here.

I love Russia much more than Hong Kong (have lived in both), so Central Asia seems like a better fit than SEA. The appeal of the Baltics is also their similarity to Russia, Sweden, etc, and the fact that they're currently accepting vaccinated tourists.",1617235320

On the one hand, as ***characters***, they're all great, likeable, and fun to have around. Mirio is an excellent parallel for the kind of hero Deku wants to become, Nejire is just a bundle of sunshine, and Tamaki had an excellent fight and is a good balance to the other two.

On the other hand, their utilization is pretty scattered and can leave something to be desired. Mirio was used perfectly, don't get me wrong, but Tamaki only has his fight with the Garbage Trio, and fades into the background afterwards. Which sucks considering his powerset is really unique and can create interesting fights.

And Nejire didn't even get the honor of having a decent fight to make up for her lack of ANYTHING. She's barely anything more than a character design with the level of depth she has been given.

In general, it almost feels like only Mirio had any form of long term planning behind him, while Nejire and Tamaki were only created as foils to Mirio for the Overhaul Arc.",1617235321

“The Pentagon will send weapons and other military aid worth $250 million to Ukraine as part of the four-year-old Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, or USAI, defense officials announced Thursday.

The aid includes counter-artillery radars, air surveillance systems, other tactical equipment, military medical treatment, cyber defenses, and “strategic communications,” according to a Thursday release by the Pentagon. Intended to help Ukraine fight the Russia-backed forces that have occupied part of the country’s eastern region since 2014, the aid aims to “enhance Ukraine’s defensive lethal capabilities and situational awareness in the maritime domain” and “counter Russian cyber offensive operations and misinformation.”

Past U.S. aid to Ukraine, which totals about $1.5 billion, has included: Javelin anti-tank missiles, retired Coast Guard cutters, unarmed drones, Harris radios, armored Humvees, and communications equipment. The U.S. has also helped to train Ukrainian special forces.

The release said the new aid re-affirms the “long-standing defense relationship between the United States and Ukraine – a critical partner on the front line of strategic competition with Russia. The United States remains steadfast in its support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.”",1617235322

Maybe if you had just told them the truth if they asked, ""I'm sorry to say it looks like this is what actually happened, but isn't that interesting!""  that would have been fine.

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

Our twins have been on a schedule for about a month and it works better some days than others. The theory is to get them to eat as much as possible during the day and not sleep too much so they sleep better at night. Night time has so far been going OK but not great. Here's what we do:

7am (+/- 30 min) wake up

8:30 (+/- 15 min) nap for 1-1.5 hrs

10:00 feed and play

11:30 (+/- 15 min) nap 2-2.5 hrs (realistically one or both are usually awake and hungry by 1-1:15.... they are breastfed)

2:00-4:00 feeding and play time on and off (kind of like cluster feeding)

4:15-4:45 nap in the stroller while I go for a walk

5:00 feed them almost a full feed but not so they're totally stuffed (we supplement with a 100ml bottle); play until 6:00 (we do dinner and bedtime with our toddler here)

6:00-7:00 work with hubby to bathe each one, lotion, massage, top up breastfeed before bed

10:30 (+/- 30 min) wake to dream feed as much as they want from a bottle (sometimes this stretch goes really poorly and one won't settle or they wake at 9. We give them their bottle any time from 9pm onward. )

From 9pm-7am we feed when they wake up. If one wakes we wake the other too. On a good night, they will only wake twice in this stretch, but sometimes (still!) it's three times. Can't wait till they start waking up less/sleeping longer 🥺",1617235323
"Crossout","t5_38ar9","T3hRogue answered mostly everything, yeah people are too lazy to take off wheels, and even if they don't, they still have quite good movement.

Also what's hilarious is that I thought hovers will drop down either step by step depending on ratio of wheels OR that they will drop all the way to the ground. What happens is hovers hover just a tiny bit over ground so wheels don't affect them XD.

BTW about the icebox. The top speed isn't as much of an advantage tbh. Yesterday a guy got so ultra lucky he shot off one of my scorps with a blind double tsunami shot from across the bridge map. Icebox buff is just too good for cannons to give up on.

Also I still run same builds as before, i just changed cabins, for example changed from griffon to beholder cause of the tonnage nerf, and got pretty much the same build but without griffon perk :D",1617235323

Wife is the one who took the lead and told me about AP and I understand its importance now, but she also said if she was doing a job where she had to function at a higher level every day, like, brain surgery or something, she really would need to be more well rested even if that meant having to do CIO. Luckily neither of us are brain surgeons.  The way I see it, our little guy didn't get asked to be born, it's not fair to him to make him suffer.  I guess I can understand why some parents may feel it's necessary though.

Now, I have two friends (he works a not very rigorous job and she doesn't work) who did CIO because they ""just couldn't take it anymore"" and I wouldn't say it to their faces (I guess I'm being petty posting it here though...) But I feel like there's really no excuse to do that to a child when one parent does not need to be well rested throughout the day.

As for manufacturing: designing complex molecules and modeling them requires computer.

Likewise, a lot of high complexity micro stuff would arguably be impossible to build. The versatility and accuracy of manual tools are simply too low. ICBMs are orders of magnitude simpler than the molecular structure of cutting edge materials, and cheaper than some of them, too.

For the footnote, I think that would be nice, but it wouldn't help the casual perusal of a member of a hiring committee when they are examining someone's CV.

Concerning your last paragraph, I have noticed there has been a pattern in the defenses here. There seems to be a shared perception that there is a lot of vying for credit in the case of author precedence, but that hasn't been my experience at all. Usually that is all delimitated at the beginning of the project, so there isn't any misunderstanding. Sometimes, there is a bit of a fight, but that's the exception and not the rule.

Many people here have pointed out that most mathematical papers only have two or three authors, but some have said that they wouldn't add someone to authorship for a minor contribution (they would simply acknowledge them in a footnote). What I gather from this is that perhaps many mathematical papers have so few authors because they do not wish to dilute credit in a community where authorship is alphabetical? When you have precedence based authorship, there is a position for minor contributions in 4th or 5th positions on the manuscript.

Just my hot take from what I've been reading here. I am gathering that fields with precedence authorships might be more generous with authorship than what is otherwise perceived. This gives a position on the paper for people who help track down a data set, or prove a small theorem to help better tell the story. This helps those people who have contributed their valuable time by providing them with something they can put on their CV when the confront the job market.",1617235324

I'm probably overrating this one, but I really think of it as high tier VN. Most VN artwork appeals to me, but the shading and colors in Fatal Twelve just add so much. The soundtrack is lovely and the OP is an earworm (in a good way). The idea behind the plot itself isn't exactly super unique, but the telling of the story through the characters makes it a lot more impactful. Another plus is the variety of endings; the story pans out quite differently in each one. It looks like aiueo Kompany, the studio behind it, hasn't really been too active since this release unfortunately. But I'm glad I was able to experience it.",1617235325

Or she can have short hair and wear cargo pants.  How she dresses is not necessarily 'feminine' or 'masculine' but 'according to societal stereotypes of such things' and it *certainly* has nothing to do with her physical body.

""A feminine body - although not necessarily female' - more gibberish.  What is a 'feminine' body if not a female body?  A weak body?  A submissive body?  Bolt on tits?  Micropenis?

That being said, I think that Church programs are intended to scale with the number of people available. Many of our branches while in grad school and postdoc were similar to yours. In one ward we had 3 active young men between 12 and 18. We just had the YM presidency and met with everyone together and asked the youth to bring their friends from school each week. We usually had about 6-7 people each week.

You are the president with keys to determine how the ward should be run. In some sense, I think you are expecting things to run like big wards you have been in before and that simply doesn't need to be the case. Run it how you feel inspired and tell them to pound sand otherwise.",1617235326

Parking lot:

1. All the cars are different, and would probably be fairly complex shapes
2. Textures would probably be higher-res than Costco stock, due to the size of the objects
3. Shadows would probably also be fairly complex due to their being projected by a complex shape

Store:

1. Though I've never been inside a Costco, I would imagine everything would be low-poly (mostly flat surfaces)
2. Textures can be low-res since things you buy there are probably pretty small
3. Since nobody's really going to pay attention to the stuff at the back of the shelf, you don't really need to bother lighting them (and could probably get away with low-poly versions, too)

Slap that on top of the cloning thing and the store is the clear winner.

//The store would probably have multiple light sources, but that's offset by the other buildings that would also need to be rendered when outside.

Edit: misunderstood what you meant. The computer only needs to render the model once, then clone it, put it in position and redo the lighting. Doesn't have to re-draw the model.",1617235328

But I imagine too that there are people who genuinely respect Indigenous people and culture — and who recognize the extremely traumatic and painful history of colonization, residential schools, and systemic racism — but who also legitimately wonder whether opening up vaccinations to all Indigenous individuals over the age of 18 makes *epidemiological* sense.

We're all aware that Indigenous people are more vulnerable to Covid. It would be completely reasonable, say, to open vaccinations up to Indigenous people 15 - 20 years younger than the non-Indigenous eligible population (so if non-Indigenous 70-year-olds can get vaccinated, Indigenous people 50+ could also be, or something like that). But 18+? When non-Indigenous people aged 66 to 73 are still ineligible to get the vaccine? I think people can have a legitimate conversation about that without necessarily being prejudiced.",1617235328

Especially since at trial it became clear just how serious his offenses were. 

But she did none of those things he was convicted for. You're piling on over fucks up that aren't criminal and using that to destroy a job she took years later. It's disgusting. Especially since it was orchestrated by a group who is genuinely transphobic and cheered the downfall they orchestrated for her on Youtube.

Definitely worth a pop, but as others have said snorting it is like being kicked in the face, but not as bad as snorting 2C-E IME. Worth a try though, sober to tripping balls in less than 10 mins is always worth a shot just for the experience.

Twin Fantasy is so specifically about Will being in love with a man, and it's a bona fide indie classic - that version of Cate, the prop version, the misgendered version, is part of history in a way that no other version is. When a given CSH fan thinks specifically about Cate Wurtz, they're not thinking about a man, but when a given CSH fan thinks about Twin Fantasy, they are

And I get that Cate is fine with it and that's why I'm not like offended or anything. There's a big difference between calling something out and finding one aspect of it a little uncomfortable.

NBA Refs are sad little men and woman that have been told if the Nuggets complain about fouls don’t call any fouls just stand their and look stupid as the camera is looking at the foul and the You-ref !
So all Nugget fans let’s start sending emails to the NBA  official office . The Philly game has 12 missed calls and all seen by a camera and ref . Video clips on file .

Please accept my apologies for mentioning this, but I was watching Investigation Discovery last night and there was a man who was sexually abused by his mother daily. She would give him enemas as soon as he came home from school and it took on a sexual pleasure of its own as it was the only time (in his mind) that his mother showed him affection. She would stimulate him sexually with the enemas and then tell him he was filthy and evil when he got an erection from it. This man was never able to have a normal relationship due to the twisted actions of his mother and went on to self-harm himself anally until he did lasting damage.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Delta is by far the largest private employer in the state of Georgia. The airport, the pride of ATL, is the world's busiest airport (in terms of passengers) only because Delta is based there. [70%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartsfield%E2%80%93Jackson_Atlanta_International_Airport#Airline_market_share) of the traffic either generated, or coming in and out of ATL is controlled by DAL. If Delta moves (as supposing completely pulls out of ATL), other airlines can certainly try and capture the origination market from ATL, but there is no way they get the people flying through ATL (that'll stick with DAL, wherever they move).

On top of that, the airport supports a major part of the local economy. It's not just the airport people make an earning from, but all supporting businesses like hotels, transportation companies, catering businesses, etc. 

As far as Microsoft and Google are concerned - yes, it's great news for the people of ATL, but not everyone. These companies require high levels of education to get in. They're high paying jobs, but whereas Microsoft might pay 1 person $200k a year, Delta might pay 5 people $40k a year, making an overall bigger impact on the local economy.",1617235331

A tech came back out yesterday and this tech was night and day different from the other one in terms of professionalism and knowledge. He followed and understood what I was saying the problem was. He replaced the old, partially damaged, comcast coax hook up box on the side of the house with a new one, did cable management with those coax cables, replaced the end of my coax cable I use with a weatherproof boot/fitting, and zip tied down everything nice and snug. He agreed the orange cable had likely been part of the problem and found that behind the wall plate in the room where I keep the modem the coax cable in the wall itself had come loose from the plate/was barely screwed in. He tightened it all up, tested everything, had me look over all his work and give it the thumbs up and went about his day. The modem has been up 30 hours now and has 0 uncorrectables on all downstream channels and a high of 23 and a low of 2 corrected packets across all the downstream channels - i'm not worried about an accumulation rate that low/slow. Those corrected only popped up when today I hooked up a pair of powerline network adapters and powerline network adapters aren't known for having the cleanest signals, before that is was 0's across the board.

Ahem.

If you spend much time at all in /r/Funny, you’re probably already sick of seeing this.

That doesn’t even compare to how sick *we* are of seeing spam.

------

See, for April Fools’ Day a couple of years ago, one of our moderators put together a [tongue-in-cheek piece of satire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrtcStl2bU) entitled ""How to Make Money On Reddit."" It was actually a spam-catching guide in disguise… but the message got a bit lost, and a lot of people mistakenly assumed that it was a joke at their expense.

That’s why we’re playing a ""joke"" on spammers this year… and you’re in on it.

Give [that video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrtcStl2bU) a watch – and don’t worry, it isn’t monetized – or read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/3jss04/meta_spammers_how_they_work_and_how_to_spot_them/). You’ll quickly learn that spammers are *incredibly* prolific on Reddit. Here’s their basic playbook:

1. Register accounts.
2. Quickly farm a lot of karma with low-effort content.
3. Either sell the pumped-up accounts or convert them to scam accounts.

On /r/Funny especially, these parasitic wastes of electricity tend to post pictures of T-shirts, posters, and other merchandise, then have ""sock puppets"" – secondary spam accounts – say things like ""Oh, man, I need this! Where did you get it?"" or ""I just bought three!"" The whole thing is an act, intended to trick unwary users into giving away their personal information when they visit semi-legitimate-looking storefront sites.

Anyway, this year, we’re recruiting *you* to play an April Fools’ Day ""prank"" on the folks who are trying to undermine (and profit from) the site. They expect moderators and administrators to be hunting them down, but if thousands of users suddenly rise up against them, it will be a real pain in their sides.

------

So when you see a spammer, report it.

Spread [that video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrtcStl2bU) and [that guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/3jss04/meta_spammers_how_they_work_and_how_to_spot_them/) around.

Help us paint the spammers as the fools that they are.

With any luck, they’ll think it’s so ""hilarious"" that they’ll go away… for a while, anyway.

**TL;DR: Our ""prank"" is on spammers this year, and you can, too!**

The institutions of governance are open to being gamed. This attracts people of low moral integrity, which means you rarely have a choice which includes someone suitable. The high cost of entry to politics in many countries, where it costs millions of dollars to have any chance of being elected, makes both the probability and value of the cheating more intense.

This has happened because government structures like constitutions, separation of powers, conventions, and other checks and balances are basically sitting targets for people who want power or money, to examine, hack and pervert for their own purposes. 

&gt;In three experiments (total N = 2,124) enabling self-selection of participants in two similar tasks, one of which allowed for cheating, we found that participants who chose the task where they could lie for financial gain reported a higher number of correct predictions than those who were assigned it at random. 

&gt;Introduction of financial costs for entering the cheating-allowing task led to a decrease in interest in the task; however, it also led to more intense cheating. An intervention aimed to discourage participants from choosing the cheating-enabling environment based on social norm information did not have the expected effect; on the contrary, it backfired. 

&gt;In summary, the results suggest that people low in moral character are likely to eventually dominate cheating-enabling environments, where they then cheat extensively. Interventions trying to limit the preference of this environment may not have the expected effect as they could lead to the selection of the worst fraudsters.

They were just losing time for no good reason. They had a half dozen other stealth ships if they really wanted to stir things up .

"FFRecordKeeper","t5_3779b","I'm looking for some advice on the FRD awakening selection. For reference, I'm currently finishing up the last 6* physical magicite and starting on my second 6* magic magicite. Lately I've been pulling fire and water elemental tickets trying to pull a 2.0 or better magic chain or edges awakening. I have a lot of SBs for edge including his sync, but he just feels mediocre without his awakening. I also got lucky and pulled stragos 2.0 water chain from the daily fest pulls along with a Lunafreya sync. Sweet!

My original plan was to pick Edge's awakening and start pulling FFVII realm tickets for Vincent's 2.0 chain and Cait's awakening since I don't have anything for Cait. But now that I see Cait's awakening is selectable, I'm wondering if I should select that and start pulling just fire for a 2.0 or better chain and edges awakening again. Or is there another option?

Not praying the rosary because you think it can't help you is really alarming to be honest.

&gt; He said it was “one big bite” and now he has “24 stitches.”

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","If you restrict the supply far enough, you get individuals producing said illegal items (see illegal drugs) and distributing them. You make it so guns are so über-rare that you'll likely never see a name-brand one, but people still want one, and someone will setup a machine shop pumping them out. Even ammunition can be produced efficiently when you have cartel-like resources backing you.

The solution in that case would be to reduce demand, so that prices would never rise high enough to warrant supply being created to meet it. But if you sicessfully reduce demand low enough, you don't need to control supply at all. So what we should really be working on is not the supply-side of firearms, but demand-side. Work out what criminals want guns for, and eliminate it. If it's to protect their illegal drug empire, legalize the drugs and bottom out their market.

"UKPersonalFinance","t5_2wkka","&gt; Is using our home as the main financial vehicle a sensible plan to maximise “cash out” funds in 4-5 years time? I’m aware that a property crash would scupper these plans but wouldn’t completely trap us.

Property is illiquid and can take months to realise cash - and the time has its own costs (e.g. you've got a sale but haven't quite moved yet, so you have to spend money on rent).

So you might want to consider more cash on hand - but if your position in the destination country is a bit more solid you can have the move and the funds independently.

&gt; Would spare money (say, £1k/month of leftovers) that would otherwise be put into my S&amp;S ISA be put to better use by overpaying the mortgage, or is the greater flexibility of the ISA worth keeping things as they are?

It's just an issue of risk tolerance - how much would your plan be ruined if you were down at the time you needed to use the money?

&gt; * What can I do to help minimise early repayment penalties in the event of a full mortgage repayment on selling our home, keeping the upcoming remortgage in mind? And is it worth trying to fix in for 3 years rather than 5 in these circumstances?

Very little.

&gt; What impact would emigrating have on my UK-based accounts? Would I need to close these down as soon as I have the equivalent accounts set up in my new country, or would these need to be closed before I get on the plane? Would I be able to convert my ISA into a standard S&amp;S account without a UK residence?

Not much - some banks might close the account, some might not. Depends on the terms.

The ISA continues to operate as normal - no new contributions and potentially taxable in the foreign state though.",1617235339

Norseman does a great job with cocktails, and Vikre does as well. Vikre has some promising tasting whiskey as well, but I know they blend at least some sourced whiskey and can’t remember which ones that is for. Tattersall does some good liqueurs and clear spirits for cocktails, but their whiskey has been horrible and young in my opinion. Panther whiskey, at least the regular offerings, have been some of the worst whiskey I’ve had. Roknar and Bent Brewstillery are doing some unique things, but nothing that has been very good or had enough aging.

I agree with your point about keeping a calm voice - we have never ever yelled at each other. Doesn’t matter how upset we are, that’s a line we don’t cross. If we were both really frustrated and not coming to any solution, we would take some time to cool off and revisit it later with a more civilized approach. Would always reconcile the same day and not go to bed angry at each other. Now, we handle things a lot more calmly to begin with, and usually don’t need a “cool-off and revisit” step. One thing that helps is that we don’t resort to disrespecting/attacking each other but focus on the actual issue. I think it’s important to have a conversation about what you can improve in the future in the way you approach problems and handle disagreements.",1617235339

&gt;Should black people not get a say on anti-black racism, should Indigenous people not get a say on anti-indigenous racism? 

Jagmeet named himself as minister of indiengous affairs lol. And since when have black people ever gotten a say on anti black racism in this country let alone continent? Its sure as shit not something decided at a NDP conference thats for sure. Indiengous people here are literally still suffering under the same settler colonialism these people are debating about. Are the NDP the gatekeepers to modern day social interaction or something? Does my anti racism need to be approved by NDP? No

If you work as a machinist in a bug company you may have issues with that. As engineer for automatisierungstechnik you can earn in midsize and bigger companies anything from 40 as fresh out of university towards 80+ as well experienced engineer.

I can recommend the website gehalt.de to see what range you are in.

For southwest germany it shows 

https://www.gehalt.de/einkommen/search?searchtext=Automatisierungsingenieur&amp;location=Leonberg

For southwest germany it says yearly salary anywhere between 48000 and 72000 per year should be good. Depends heavily on your area so make sure to check for your area and be realistic if you have experience or how good you are compared to others. 

In addition: 
If you renegotiate once hired: high performers renegotiate every 2-3 years.

"anime","t5_2qh22","Hallo! I'm actually German, but my family is entirely of Turkish descent.I grew up with anime however, loved watching DBZ, One Piece, Digimon, you name 'em. Turkish people really enjoy shonen anime, or at least they did back in the day, but that's just a generalization - you should ask him what genres he's into. My go-to beginner anime I think everyone should watch is Cowboy Bebop for example, since it was practically made for Western audiences. Ghibli movies are also perfect (almost every friend of mine watched them on SuperRTL back in the day). Does your bf like Tarantino movies? Then he should give Baccano and Durarara a try, and so on and so forth. Seriously, just ask him, that would be infinitely better than trying to assume what he might like based on his nationality.

If he doesn't understand any German or English, you should check out if anime shows on Netflix, Crunchyroll etc have Turkish subtitles. Not sure about Crunchyroll (usually go for the not so legal sites, or Netflix/Amazon), but Netflix original anime should always have dubs and/or subs ready. I'll be honest with you though, Turkish dubs aren't really the best at all and it wasn't hard to notice for me even with my broken Turkish :D",1617235341

"humandesign","t5_2veac","To an individual, it means different things based on one's complete design. If you have either the Root or SP center undefined in your natal chart, it may feel a lot different than if you have either one defined. The transit will also feel different to you (with both gates undefined) than to someone with just one of the gates undefined. Jupiter and Saturn in those gates may feel significantly different than when other planets transit. If 19-49 bridges a split, this would bring a different quality.

Collectively, the influence of 19-49 on the whole planet would be toward ""tribal"" intimacy - sensitivity in search of who can belong, the power to support the tribe and also shut out the outcasts. Examples of those themes would be in marriage and divorce, new relationships and breakups, national treaties made or broken??, bringing new people to the table, and cancelling others who don't share the same vibe or genetic harmony. There is a connection to ""other"" forms of life in this channel as well, so affinity for animals, awareness of fairies (what?), or maybe other ""higher/lower"" life. 

In addition, the Root and SP centers are defined by the transit, so the themes of those centers are more active collectively. Active energy to get stuff done, and a more emotional/spiritual? backdrop, but the tribal circuitry anchors in a very practical spine (as opposed to pure emotional processing and release).

In this transit it's Jupiter in gate 49, so rejection and revolution, and the principles that support the tribe are the ""law"". And Saturn is in 19, so you might expect that breaking the ""laws"" of gate 49 right now would bring consequences colored by gate 19 - hypersensitivity, neediness, the discovery that you are not needed, etc.

OP, what is your experience of this transit? If you have any thoughts or specific questions it would be helpful to see your chart. Really interesting question, thanks for that!",1617235341

https://www.cicnews.com/2020/02/a-quarter-of-canadas-immigrants-arrived-from-india-in-2019-0213700.html#gs.xnzujl

&gt; The top five source countries of new immigrants to Canada were India, China, the Philippines, Nigeria, and the United States of America. Immigration from India and Nigeria is booming.

1. India	85,585
2. China	30,260
3. Philippines	27,815
4. Nigeria	12,595
5. United States of America	10,800
6. Pakistan	10,790
7. Syria	10,120
8. Eritrea	7,025
9. Korea, Republic of	6,110
10. Iran	6,055

Since the left is considering Asians ""people of color"" now that it is politically advantageous to do so again (until the very second it isn't anymore), that's 9/10 of the top countries.

Data *is* fun!

If your rationale for immigration is that ""we need someone to do all the work for the aging white population,"" and a vast majority of your immigrants aren't white...then yeah, all that is, is white people bringing in non-white people to do all the work for them.

If you have another rationale for immigration, then fine.  I'm talking about this really dumb one, though.",1617235342

"PersonalFinanceCanada","t5_2tasy","Yes, I definitely want to do it in the legal way for taxation purposes. But I don't want to let my manager know I work another job as the company didn't ask but I don't wish to disclose to my manager. The TD1 form request is from Payroll so I should be fine.

So below are my base salary calculations:

Job 1 (the one i'm returning to and submitting the TD1 form to): $48,450

Job 2: $72,500

Total: $120,950

So that total is what I'd put on Line 13 (Claim Amount) on the TD1 form? And the employer will basically deduct more taxes on each paystub than if I didn't do this form? With the calculator link you sent, I pay 29.95% average tax on the $121k, and 21% on $48.5k so they'd just tax me according to my new tax bracket? Also, since both of these are new, by the end of 2021 I won't be actually making the full $121k obviously due to almost 4 month already passing.

Is there anything else I need to do for legal/taxation purposes when working 2 jobs? Assuming I don't have to submit a TD1 for the 2nd job as well, just this one?

Thanks for your help btw!",1617235342

You need to identify an advantage if you want to consistently beat the market and I’m not sure what advantage a retail day trader could possibly have over other markets participants. For a start algos have a huge speed advantage and professional traders have a significant data advantage, where as you’re probably trading on your phone from an app that sells your order flow to Wall Street.

As a retail trader you might be able to identify a stock that’s undervalued with some attractive catalysts to go higher over the course of several months or years, but what that stock does on any given day will depend more on economic news or if some large holder decides to sell their position. As a retail trader you won’t get a heads up on events like these, but professionals on Wall Street are often aware before anyone else because that’s their job.

On the rare occasion that I day trade now it’s by accident. For example, occasionally I’ll be in a position that intend to hold for several months but if on the same day it just happens to be up 10-20% I’ll typically take profit. I think day trades like this are okay, but if you’re actively trying to day trade  research (and my own experience) would suggest you’re extremely likely to under perform.",1617235343

They come to America/UK/CA with the expected Euro-centric/white-centered view of things, and then they become a little woke when they find out discrimination in white-led society exists with the obvious example of black slavery/Jim Crow.

Then they stop there/don't delve further into racial politics to see where Asians are in the world. They think their worldview is new and revolutionary and crow at the top of their lungs about this well known and obvious racial hierarchy that pretty much anyone who has lived in a diverse area has known and is new only to these people who have lived in homogenous Asian/white only areas.

&amp;#x200B;

They are left with the superficial understanding that since white people have colonized black people, the entire world which is mostly white-led should pay reparations. They listen to white people telling them that since Asians are privileged and must be white adjacent, then they are included in the list of reparations.

Like what? Even to this day white people are still trying to colonize China and the rest of Asia. We are owed reparations as well. That puts us on the same side of things as black people.

But when instances of hate crimes happen where the perpetrator is black, suddenly ""Asians are basically white people"" even tho we never did anything to black people (Asians don't have a voice) and it's somehow justified for some black people to be unabashedly racist to Asians because of this Asian model-minority fallacy parroted by some scheming white people?",1617235345

The same group of fedex/ups drivers come each day to my store, at least, so they don't even have anyone sign and just put the reciever's name down. 

Mistakes happen for sure but I would suggest calling and getting in touch with a manager, avoiding the service desk associates you spoke to before if you can. The manager would hopefully have a sense of urgency to actually look for your items rather than dismiss it so quickly. As a prior service desk manager it irks me how your situation is being handled.

If the wiki, or searching the subreddit, did not yield answers, you may re-submit your post with the `Question` flair if your post does not break rule 3:

### Rule 3. Do not request for specific pirated titles (ie. a specific movie, book title, software title, etc.); do not link to pirated content. [Why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/subfaq)
 * 3a. You **may ask** generalized questions such as ""Where can I find 4K movies, children's books, sci-fi books, etc."". You **may not** name a specific work's title in your content request.
 * 3b. Do not link to specific pirated media. You **may link** to the top level of a site, eg. https://1337x.to but **never** to a specific pirated release, eg. http://1337x.to/specific-movie-torrent
 * 3c. Do not encourage rule breaking by asking which specific title someone is looking for when they make a request

"LockdownSkepticism","t5_2iokxd","&gt;COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in 2020, with an estimated 345,323 deaths, and was largely responsible for the substantial increase in total deaths from 2019 to 2020. Substantial increases from 2019 to 2020 also occurred for several other leading causes. Heart disease deaths increased by 4.8%, the largest increase in heart disease deaths since 2012. Increases in deaths also occurred for unintentional injury (11.1%), Alzheimer disease (9.8%), and diabetes (15.4%). Influenza and pneumonia deaths in 2020 increased by 7.5%, although the number of deaths was lower in 2020 than in 2017 and 2018. From 2019 to 2020, deaths due to chronic lower respiratory disease declined by 3.4% and suicide deaths declined by 5.6%. 

...
&gt;Increases in other leading causes, especially heart disease, Alzheimer disease, and diabetes, may also reflect disruptions in health care that hampered early detection and disease management. Increases in unintentional injury deaths in 2020 were largely driven by drug overdose deaths.

So 345,000 Covid deaths, and **approximately 85,000 additional deaths from heart disease, ""unintentional injuries"" (i.e., overdoses), stroke, Alzheimer's, and diabetes.**  Did lockdowns save more than 85,000 lives, rendering them a net positive? Doubtful, as multiple studies have already shown no correlation between lockdown severity and Covid mortality.

And I find it shocking that suicides actually declined in 2020; I wonder if that will change in the final data.",1617235348

Asking valid questions about masks is not the same as being anti-mask yet the two are conflated. 

In Feb and March 2020 I was actively wearing masks before it was even a social media phenomenon. I'm still fine with wearing them if it makes other people feel more comfortable. This is not most people's definition of ""anti-mask.""",1617235348

"Survival","t5_2qh7j","&gt;  As long as you are somewhere plants are growing vitamin c shouldn’t be an issue.

I assumed from OP's context that he was trying to make nutritious, ready-to-eat food, and scurvy was specifically mentioned. It's lightweight, long lasting, extremely compact, cheap, effective, and requires no foraging. 

That is of course not to say that knowing how to forage for vitamin c isn't a useful skill to have.

I think you are full of shit... France, Italy and Spain were all blind sided.

"FORTnITE","t5_2t7hh","I never said that the perk wasn't bad, I just said that the Noc and the siegebreaker are essentially the same weapon and if you do the maths on a siegebreaker with a rising crit rating 6th perk it will come out with a similar damage output to the Noc with the explosive. The benefit of the Noc is that it'll tag other enemies which is always a benefit.

At that point I'd still rather use my Maverick. A single shot will pierce half a dozen enemies and the affliction damage is enough that I don't really need a second shot. For big bosses and even mist monsters I would rather my monsoon. ~~After 15 shots that little monster will output at 60+% crit chance at 2.85x damage~~. (My mistake, I have a rising Damage perk on my Monsoon. My Candy Corn has the Rising Crit Damage and was getting the two mixed up.) It doesn't even need a War Cry to increase the fire rate cause it's already doing 16.2 shots a second.

My main point I'm getting across with the Noc and the Revolt is that just because it's a ""rare"" schematic doesn't mean that it's exclusively top tier.",1617235349

"FundieSnarkUncensored","t5_2z8fuj","To echo MediocreSubject...those I know/have known are good with money. One of my high school friends went full fundie and then fundie lite. 16 kids. Started out in the parent’s basement, then small townhome, the small house. Their current house is one they’ve built additions to as they could. Interestingly, they managed to figure out how to give each of their older girls their own, albeit small, bedrooms in the basement. The dad did all the work. 

Food wise...the family hunts, so they use a good bit of venison year round. She shops at the membership club and Amazon. She actually plans decent menus and feeds her kids well. Another one has a deal with a friend, she trades her help and gets a ton of home canned chicken. They both do a lot of their own cooking. 

My friend’s husband has had the same job for years, turned down promotions because keeping a production job meant overtime and better overall income. Good employer, good benefits. 

Lots of hand me downs for clothes. But they’re always dressed nice. Clothes are clean and fit. 

One family uses their tax return (child tax credits) each year to pay their mortgage. Paid for their new heating/cooling system via a grant that mom had the time to research and complete paperwork for.

"funny","t5_2qh33","**Oh, look! It's a sticky comment!** ***That*** **isn't obnoxious!**

Ahem.

If you spend much time at all in /r/Funny, you’re probably already sick of seeing this.

That doesn’t even compare to how sick *we* are of seeing spam.

------

See, for April Fools’ Day a couple of years ago, one of our moderators put together a [tongue-in-cheek piece of satire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrtcStl2bU) entitled ""How to Make Money On Reddit."" It was actually a spam-catching guide in disguise… but the message got a bit lost, and a lot of people mistakenly assumed that it was a joke at their expense.

That’s why we’re playing a ""joke"" on spammers this year… and you’re in on it.

Give [that video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrtcStl2bU) a watch – and don’t worry, it isn’t monetized – or read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/3jss04/meta_spammers_how_they_work_and_how_to_spot_them/). You’ll quickly learn that spammers are *incredibly* prolific on Reddit. Here’s their basic playbook:

1. Register accounts.
2. Quickly farm a lot of karma with low-effort content.
3. Either sell the pumped-up accounts or convert them to scam accounts.

On /r/Funny especially, these parasitic wastes of electricity tend to post pictures of T-shirts, posters, and other merchandise, then have ""sock puppets"" – secondary spam accounts – say things like ""Oh, man, I need this! Where did you get it?"" or ""I just bought three!"" The whole thing is an act, intended to trick unwary users into giving away their personal information when they visit semi-legitimate-looking storefront sites.

Anyway, this year, we’re recruiting *you* to play an April Fools’ Day ""prank"" on the folks who are trying to undermine (and profit from) the site. They expect moderators and administrators to be hunting them down, but if thousands of users suddenly rise up against them, it will be a real pain in their sides.

------

So when you see a spammer, report it.

Spread [that video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrtcStl2bU) and [that guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/3jss04/meta_spammers_how_they_work_and_how_to_spot_them/) around.

Help us paint the spammers as the fools that they are.

With any luck, they’ll think it’s so ""hilarious"" that they’ll go away… for a while, anyway.

**TL;DR: Our ""prank"" is on spammers this year, and you can, too!**

You're talking about 2.5 different things here. They were allowed to cut that corner(and as a footnote my opinion is that they shouldn't be allowed to cut) so no lewis wouldn't and shouldn't be penalized there and it would be consistent with the rules.

And Luke did become legend after ROTJ. He defeated Palpatine and the Jedi were reborn. That is how legends are made, stories arise around these people.

"DebateVaccines","t5_3jwf7","&gt;They already tried this. Frivolous lawsuits threatened manufacturers to simply stop making vaccines. Which is why the NVICP was set up.

They could increase the price account for lawsuits. All corporations could claim liability lawsuits against them are frivilous, yet none of the other corporations get liability protections. Why?

&gt;No, they are already incentivized to make safe vaccines. If they do not, they will not be approved.

Getting approval is a different threshold than avoiding lawsuits. Avoiding lawsuits is clearly a higher threshold

&gt;Opening them up to unreasonable liability, on the basis of unavoidable potential risks, will simply cause them to either stop producing vaccines and/or drive up the prices.

Why is it ""unreasonable""? What causes you to use that vernacular? How are you sure it is unavoidable? I am saying drive up the prices is fine, we have the money to throw at this if it means making it that much safer

&gt;Your wikipedia blurb deals with defective products, and as we already discussed, pharma companies are liable for manufacturing defects.

No, it doesn't. Let me bold that part so you actually read it:

""Even if there is no negligence, however, public policy demands that responsibility be fixed wherever it will most effectively reduce the hazards to life and health inherent in defective products that reach the market. It is evident that the manufacturer can anticipate some hazards and guard against the recurrence of others, as the public cannot. Those who suffer injury from defective products are unprepared to meet its consequences. The cost of an injury and the loss of time or health may be an overwhelming misfortune to the person injured, and a needless one, for the risk of injury can be insured by the manufacturer and distributed among the public as a cost of doing business. It is to the public interest to discourage the marketing of products having defects that are a menace to the public. If such products nevertheless find their way into the market it is to the public interest to place the responsibility for whatever injury they may cause upon the manufacturer, who, **even if he is not negligent in the manufacture of the product, is responsible for its reaching the market**. However intermittently such injuries may occur and however haphazardly they may strike, the risk of their occurrence is a constant risk and a general one. Against such a risk there should be general and constant protection and the manufacturer is best situated to afford such protection.""

&gt;""Through the 1970s and 1980s, the number of lawsuits brought against vaccine manufacturers increased dramatically, and manufacturers made large payouts to individuals and families claiming vaccine injury, particularly from the combined diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) immunization. In this environment of increasing litigation, mounting legal fees, and large jury rewards, many pharmaceutical companies left the vaccine business. In fact, by the end of 1984, only one U.S. company still manufactured the DPT vaccine, and other vaccines were losing manufacturers as well.""

&gt;You really don't know the history, or the concept of this in general, do you?

I do know the history very well, and also the history of their increasing influence in politics, as big pharma is known to spend tons of money on lobbying politicians, to get things like this. If the vaccines didn't cause the illnesses, they would win the case, so what is the issue?

Also from that article, thanks for sharing, ""Individuals harmed by **properly manufactured vaccines** had few options for compensation before an important court case in the 1950s addressed the issue. In 1955 about 200 people were paralyzed and ten died after contracting polio from the Salk polio vaccine, certain lots of which contained virus that had not been inactivated in spite of manufacturers’ adherence to federal government standards. The event came to be known as the Cutter Incident, after the manufacturer of one of the implicated vaccines. Many injured people and their families filed lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers, and most of the cases were settled out of court with monetary awards by the manufacturers. One case, Gottsdanker v. Cutter Laboratories, was heard on appeal by the California Supreme Court, and the justices upheld a jury ruling that **although Cutter Laboratories was not negligent in its design or manufacture of the vaccine, the company was financially responsible for the harm the vaccine caused**

That part of the article further advances my point, that they ought to be held liable for creating a product that harms people, regardless of how well it was manufactured",1617235351

&gt;Some stories cannot be told in just one lifetime. Harry August is on his deathbed. Again. No matter what he does or the decisions he makes, when death comes, Harry always returns to where he began, a child with all the knowledge of a life he has already lived a dozen times before. Nothing ever changes. Until now. As Harry nears the end of his eleventh life, a little girl appears at his bedside. ""I nearly missed you, Doctor August,"" she says. ""I need to send a message."" This is the story of what Harry does next, and what he did before, and how he tries to save a past he cannot change and a future he cannot allow.

&gt;West Hall, Vermont, has always been a town of strange disappearances and old legends. The most mysterious is that of Sara Harrison Shea, who, in 1908, was found dead in the field behind her house just months after the tragic death of her daughter.
&gt;
&gt;Now, in present day, nineteen-year-old Ruthie lives in Sara's farmhouse with her mother, Alice, and her younger sister. Alice has always insisted that they live off the grid, a decision that has weighty consequences when Ruthie wakes up one morning to find that Alice has vanished. In her search for clues, she is startled to find a copy of Sara Harrison Shea's diary hidden beneath the floorboards of her mother's bedroom. As Ruthie gets sucked into the historical mystery, she discovers that she's not the only person looking for someone that they've lost. But she may be the only one who can stop history from repeating itself.

I do not blame OP one bit for not wanting or being able to take on a baby. Let alone three children all in one go. Someone has to quit their job or they find childcare (which for some is so expensive it’s easier just to SAHP)

Also to add: it’s not just her choice to make, her husband has a say too. Like what happens if she was determined to take them in and husband said no? They get divorced and she struggles with 2 kids and a baby and it just becomes another cycle?

"britishcolumbia","t5_2qnc6","I think you are forgetting that they were vaccinating older FN people and older non-FN people at the beginning, then after lowered the age requirements for both groups, dropped the FN limit to 18 and general population lower and lower, adding medical conditions along the way, and adding different industries up to the standard everyone 18+. 

You are also forgetting these places are extremely remote and the cost of bringing them the vaccine is huge for such a small population that it’s way more cost-effective to vaccinate everyone there once instead of coming up every week for the changing age demographic. 

AFTER everyone 18+ was allowed to get the vaccine is when we started vaccinating non-residents.

You clearly don’t understand what is happening with the vaccine rollout in the territories, so please stop talking about how it’s “racist” when it’s not based on race, it’s simply more economically feasible (and logical) to vaccinate the smaller remote communities that HAPPEN to be full of FNs.",1617235354

Not to mention the exposure to theta and vega once your option comes close to being ATM. Your delta is not constant with options.

Edit: Upon re-reading, charm does help you as long as you're ITM.

&amp;#x200B;

I skimmed through your post. I didn't read every word carefully, but here are a couple things to reconsider:

&gt;It is worth noting that in order to have similar NV, we would need to buy 5x/MES contracts

You would only need 2 /MES contracts. I'm not sure where did you get the number 5 from. You, yourself, did the NV calculation correctly when calculation leverage. This small mistake makes the section about commissions and fees pretty much completely useless.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;(As a note that I would like to add after having finished writing this post, we go on to talk about NinjaTrader briefly for commissions and fees, their initial margin requirement for an /MES contract is $50 so you would need to have $250 initial margin (no true capped loss however) to cover 5x/MES contracts to have equivalent NV.)

This is intraday margin. If you're day trading /MES this is the number you should use to calculate your leverage, not the $1,210 overnight margin. Hence your leverage calculation needs to be redone too.

On that note, I'm not sure why the intraday margin is so low with Ninja trader. With TW, /ES intraday margin is around 1/4th of the overnight margin. Which would imply that the /MES intraday margin is around $300 per contract. I'll need to verify that.",1617235354

Anything where the DM is involved in how your character functions should not be in the game. It's why I hate, hate, hate gold being involved in subclasses. Every fricken game has a different economy. 

Wizards are the worst. Want to copy spells? A **major** class feature? Your DM better be nice about dropping a spellbook or two.

"totalwar","t5_2rq9c","I thought a major complaint of Total War was that after Rome, arrows got weaker. Peasents literally shrugging off arrows despite being peasents with no armour. 

&amp;#x200B;

Archery was overpowered in history and there were little counters to it. The Romans had the Testudo formation but was slow and could be flanked. Cav could charge them but you have to be fast and hope that they don't kill your horses. Volume was key.

&amp;#x200B;

Agnicourt was won because of the unrelenting arrow fire from the English. Sure, some armour may have stopped it but horses were easy targets, knights would have been repeatly hit and forced to their knees etc... Longbows were the weapon to have in their day and the English knew how to use it. Combined with the field being muddy and the french were slowed to a crawl, they couldn't charge and easy pickings for a hungry, desperate english army. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Mongols had their own bow but i doubt it would have been like a modern compound bow. They knew how to use it and were much more agile then most of their enemies.  

&amp;#x200B;

Archery in total war varies from an annoyance to slaughtering but can be countered by cav charges, infantry or a lucky trebuchet shot.  It's not like a WWI machine gun. At least, not in Rome or Medieval 2 because the rate of fire is slower.  Nor does it have the power. Cav tends to not get shredded if it's heavy. It really depends on the unit and even then, you have to support it. 

  
The french butchered a seperated Longbow unit in the hundred years war. Longbows were England's best weapon but had to be supported by infantry, horses etc..",1617235356

It's unclear whether private business actually exists anymore. When government began requiring businesses to obtain licenses and sign code enforcement agreements in order to operate, the businesses essentially became government entities.

Business owners are hostages to the state and will capitulate to bureaucratic regulatory whims in order to protect their livelihood. Since covid-mania began, government has demanded that businesses owners enforce mask mandates in their businesses or be fined, shut down, jailed, and maybe worse. Why wouldn't government force businesses to enforce a vaccination passport mandate as well?",1617235356

I’ve yet to find a product that actually makes my hair look sleek or shiny in any way. I always air dry, don’t rough my hair up with towels...brushing my hair while it is dry definitely causes it to turn into a cloud so I avoid that as well.

"Warhammer40k","t5_2rr81","The main thing here is that you're reading novels set 10,000 years before the current plot of 40k. Back then, the Imperium was in a MUCH better place than it is now. It wasn't perfect, but it was far superior to the horrifying mess it ""currently"" is. The events that happen later in the Horus Heresy are what sets the Imperium on the downwards spiral into the nightmare it is at the moment.

It's worth noting though that there is something else at play which is that a world as grim and dark as current 40k wouldn't make a fun novel. The Black Library authors do have to tweak the setting a little to actually make the novels enjoyable.

I have three of them in my house, two TCLs and a Hisense. And I have had no issues with any of them. The TCLs are three and four years old, and the Hisense is two. They all replaced older Vizio's and Samsung's that all lasted 7+ years. I don't expect these TVs to last that long, but it doesn't matter. 

Since the equivalent Samsung or Vizo would have been at least 3 times the price, I still come out ahead if I have to replace the TVs in the next few years. and I would probably replace them with new cheap models that are similar.

Plus, the Samsung and Vizio smart TV interfaces are terrible ad filled messes. I have a recent Samsung at work that I only use for presentations, and it actually has popup ads show up every time you access any functions (including changing inputs) and that you cannot turn off. That Samsung was a $1500 TV and it doesn't do anything my $200 TCL with the same size screen at home can't do. At least the Roku interface's ads are unobtrusive and easily ignored.",1617235358

🗳️ [`GOFUNDME` Repair a Broken Gear](http://scp.bz/Gears)

&gt; **UPDATE** | **February 27, 2020** by Daniel D, Organizer
&gt; 
&gt; So, back from the doctor. Not a long visit, but busy. I'll give the cliff notes:  
&gt;   
&gt; 1st, as of right now, I am (tentatively) cancer free. No additional tumors or growths, and my lymph nodes are fine.  
&gt;   
&gt; 2nd, my cancer is of the ""clear cell"" type, which is the most common (70-ish percent of all cancers). This means that, if at a later date i need treatment, most medications and such work with this type.  
&gt;   
&gt; 3rd, this isn't necessarily an all-clear. [...]

Yes, they had singles, but you’re meant to buy their whole albums. They weren’t going for radio airplay, so singles didn’t mean as much to them as they would have meant for a band looking to get on rock radio stations. So the single releases of those songs might have given them an early jump, but once the band built up a fan base all of that was nullified. Every Metallica fan has heard their whole albums, and many have seen them in concert. Which songs came out as singles don’t matter anymore. People gravitated towards The Four Horsemen and Seek and Destroy because they’re (for whatever reasons) the consensus “better” songs.",1617235361

When (if) that passes, and nothing happens, then the squeeze won't happen, the same shenanigans will carry on until RC sells some stock to kick transformation into overdrive. At that point what you describe as squeeze 3 is the logical outcome.

With the amount of liquidity rules ramping up across the board, plus a likely margin call chain looming with Archegos positions still sitting at banks, I would not count the squeeze squozen. (Admittedly, those hit the market generally, but GME will still get a boost with apes holding.)",1617235361

"saudiarabia","t5_2roj4","In all of your video you are hogging the left lane. Which is wrong. The left lane is for speeding. You can notice that  in the camry behind when you were speeding he left a lot of space. But when you are slowing he kept getting closer. You are the one in fault and people like you are the reason behind traffic and accidents.

 Driving etiquette and in some countries its the law, left lane is for take over. So you can go above the speed limit to take over in order to reach an exit on the highway. If you want to drive and abide by the speed limit you stay in the mid and right lane. 

Finally, some drivers think that they are the law. They want to enforce it by hogging the left lane, while maintaining speed limit. This is wrong for so many reasons. Do not do it. 

Also here is a small video to show you why you shouldn't drive slow on the left lane. https://youtu.be/4oqfodY2Lz0

About a week after the end of the warranty, the crown stopped adjusting the date.  It still keeps pretty good time, and the date still advances, but I just can't set the date.

They refused to honor the warranty for that last repair.  I even tried to use my credit card's extended warranty benefit but Swatch suddenly changed their story and claimed the date wasn't working because of a ""shock"".  I never bumped that watch, I can only think they were lying because I was a ""difficult customer"".  Well, no shit, they kept not fixing my watch and I started to get a bit heated when it was months upon months.

Then it was back to ""normal"".  Chinese come and go with their affections on products.  It may look insane to the outside world, but just consider it as a yearly ""freedom fries"" incident.

i hate how raids gauge gear, either you do no damage, you do just enough or you do far too much. there is no real slider in the current content we have.

the elitist can have their super hard mode, just means they wont be joining normal raids. that's fine, best not to group with them anyway.

i think a buff in rewards overall is a good idea, i feel it takes WAY too long to gear up. like for a new player....they wont be anywhere near done by the time this new raid comes out. even more so if they get unlucky.

the whole auction thing is meh, it only applies to harder difficulties or so they say. so whales battling other whales.

they will have to come up with a less horrible way to ""bid"" on things. i don't think biding with gold is a good idea, it's far too easy to abuse that. aka raid with 50%+ of it's members from one guild or group of people pool all of their gold to one person, that person wins but the gold spent is refunded by \~50%+ because of how many people from one guild/group make up that raid.",1617235364

"dankmemes","t5_2zmfe","I’ve had plenty of arguments with people that believe in punishment for not participating in someone’s preferences. I’m sorry if I come across as jaded or rude. I’m just tired of everyone acting like it really is possible to treat trans people like normal in *every* aspect of life and maintain a fair and equal society. As much as I wish it was possible for everyone to be treated exactly as they would want to be treated, we can’t have that. There are points in day-to-day life where trans folk need to be categorized on their own in their own separate category. Healthcare is one of them. As nice as it would be for someone to be able to just put down male or female on their medical record or license they can’t. Sometimes it’s life or death information knowing that someone is on hormones. 
Or sports. MTF conversions are beginning to dominate women’s sports. If you had to play on a sports team, where would you suggest the coach place you? On the women’s team or the men’s team? Either way you look at it someone is at a disadvantage there. The thing that’s frustrating is that I don’t even have any of these grudges with trans folk. It’s people that argue *for* them. It’s great to want to aspire for a society where everyone can live exactly as they wish but it’s also important to stay realistic within those bounds. Trans people should have the rights necessary to be happy. At the same time we have to recognize that we can pretend all day long but we aren’t wizards. We’ve accomplished some amazing things in hormone therapy and cosmetic surgery but we haven’t reached the point of truly changing an X to Y or Y to X, and because of that we have to acknowledge the implications of that limit.....until we inevitably pull a Human Kind again and surpass that limit.",1617235366

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I can make a shotgun with about $20 of pipes and parts from lowes and home depot. 3D printed guns are a thing. Reloading ammo is a thing. I have brass shells from 1953 and I still reload them. The problem is that the blueprints are already online, the tools are readily available and the instructions are online. Only thing you need is some time and money. There are more firearms in the United States than people. It would take generations to clear out all the firearms. I already know people who bought unfinished lowers on ar15s and finished machining themselves, and I dont even go to gun stores or shows or anything, just these dudes from college. If firearms were more rare then this would be possible in our life time. The market is just too saturated to ban all firearms. Another point is alot of black powdered rifles and pistols aren't considered a firearm if it is using a design from before a certain date (i forget exactly but its something like 1890 or something). Alot of Black powdered revolvers aren't considered firearms and they can shoot 6 shots in rapid session just like a normal revolver. Another point is you can bury guns, and many people will do that, many many bad people would do that. This is also considering all that all these firearms are serial marked registered guns, alot of firearms used in serious crimes have their serial numbers scratched and are not registered, so the country doesn't even know they exist. If humans are the best at one thing, its creating weaponry. The idea isn't the worst one, but its too late, its ingrained in our culture for generations. If one dude could create repeating firearms in the 1800s with 1800s technology, making repeating firearms in the 21st century is simple compared to that. Honestly the best action i think that might work is making it illegal to carry firearms anywhere outside your property. Home protection is the number 1 reason I still own firearms. I dont give a rats ass about carrying outside my property, hell I don't even have a carrying permit and I own like 6 pistols. They don't leave my property and some of them haven't left since the 80s",1617235367

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","Read Israel Kirzner's *Competition and Entrepreneuership*. 

Some great sections about monopolies, and how they (almost never) would occur in a market, without State intervention. Except for, he thought, in markets where a single producer would be most efficient, or where someone could create a ""resource"" monopoly - like owning the only mines that produce a certain mineral. 

Even still, resource monopolies are rather improbable IMO, and also would get eventually broken by the increasing demand for substitutes to that monopolized resource.

Edit: keep in mind, the more specific a product, the increased likelihood of a monopoly, and vice versa. Every single product is basically merely a subsitute for another. 

A monopoly of alcohol - probably not; a monopoly of bourbon - probably not; a monopoly of kentucky-made bourban.... ehh still probably not; a monopoly of kentucky bourban made by the Jim Beam company - yeah. And there are those in the market for JB Bourban, and no other Bourbon. You can probably think of better examples. 

Another thing Kirzner discusses, which is still overlooked, is timeframe. The discoverer of Nitroglycerin had a monopoly for as long as no one else could replicated his product, maybe for months or years an inventor or discoverer could secure monopoly prices, but the longer the timeframe, the less plausible it is that someone else couldn't invent/discover the same. Or again, invent/discover a sufficiently similar substitute.",1617235367

We have a blue tiled bathroom and I've just avoided adding more blue to it. It's so much blue that if I put other blue items in there it would feel like you're swimming in it, so I've gone the opposite and I'm adding more yellow/orangey tones since that's the opposite on the color wheel so they compliment. I've tried to keep things like the bath mat to be more solid color and not add to how busy the tile is.

Like you said combos aren’t hard in this game it just takes some creativity to get them going. 

My grudge with claws is that no one does anything else but air combos when the weapon is able to drop people to the ground and start combos but 9.99/10 people are gonna do air combos because they don’t have to worry about positioning or how close they are to the ground.

"headphones","t5_2rcyx","Lol just look through the entire comments on this post, and see how many left comments related to intentional failure or something similar. Those are all conspiracies. How do you know that it’s not a thing in the audio industry? Is it perhaps because I told you? But you have no way to confirm whether it’s true or not, right? Similarly, how do you know if “lots of other industries” are doing it? Do you have any bases that they are currently doing it, or even that it’s a common practice in “lots” of industries? That’s a very vague argument, btw. Just because they have “reasons” to do it, it doesn’t mean they are still doing it. Capacitors, for example, have fairly short life (relatively speaking), are you going to argue that it’s intentional? “Planned obsolescence” literally means they intentionally do it, for that sole purpose (and direct financial gain). How would you prove that it’s a consequence of other actions as part of “compromises”? 

You literally have given zero evidence that they are currently doing it. Are you going to assume that it’s the truth until someone from that industry comes and out tells you otherwise?",1617235371

The anime is also missing 3 big fights: Kumoko vs Hornets (in volume 1), Kumoko vs Fire Wyrms (Volume 2), and Kumoko vs Taratects (Volume 3). Furthermore, it skips over 2 other encounters she has with humans, one of which involves her assisting them.

The anime also left out a lot of details about skills, enemies, etc.

"u_grandadslounge","t5_2ckl17","nin strikes me as being quite emotionally immature, inserting sexual comments into tiktoks and interacting with minors a lot. when she labelled her tiktok as being “18+” while keeping it public, she put the responsibility on minors. bad enough, you’d think, but then she is following and interacting with minors herself? 

i’m nin’s age and run a pet account on instagram, and i always feel a little uncomfortable when minors interact with my account. there’s nothing inappropriate on there ofc as it’s just for rat pictures but as an adult i feel a certain level of responsibility for younger people online. i don’t get why nin lacks this. 

being a child abuse victim, as she told youtube in no uncertain terms, she should understand how important it is for adults to keep kids and teenagers safe, both online and off. 

also, obligatory “if a 24 year old man made a suggestive comment on a 17 year old girl’s tiktok and then tried to claim it was just a joke, people would be outraged”, because it’s true and it’s amazing what nin gets away with.",1617235371

"ottawa","t5_2qpoo","I didn't say they're 100% effective in preventing transmission; I don't think there's a single vaccine out there that is 100% effective in preventing anything. Somebody who's in long-term hospital care for an illness will naturally have a lowered immune system (which also makes the vacc less effective). When you combine those two things, yes there can still be outbreaks.

But that doesn't mean that the vaccine doesn't prevent--or, okay, reduce--transmission. Even vaccinated people who DO still catch the virus have a significantly decreased viral load. Less viral load = less likely to transmit.",1617235371

There is plenty there to grade them on, and of course the requirements vary depending on whether it's a bachelor, master's or doctorate degree. But speaking generally across multiple music degrees,  students take several semesters of courses like Graduate Music History, Analytical Techniques, Musicology, Composition, Orchestration, Counterpoint, etc. They take electives in Theory, Music Education and Performance. They have to pass proficiency examinations. They have to perform solo recitals and participate in various ensembles and music organizations. They take one on one lessons with an expert in their chosen instrument. At higher levels many have to pass exams in foreign languages, pass qualifying exams and write a dissertation. 

In short, people with music degrees dedicate their entire lives to studying performance, history, theory, technique and analysis of their selected musical field. They become experts in the performance and proficient in writing and reading the academics of music. 

They go on to play in orchestras and ensembles around the world. They become teachers and renowned performers.

"FallenTearGame","t5_3k5i6x","Full disclaimer, I'm a tester, so I have a tendency to hone in on problems, so don't take me focusing on nitpicks as a general criticism of your work. That said, I'm feelin like a *lazy* tester today so you're only going to brief descriptions instead of repro steps and screenshots and all that bull.  Took ~35 mins to reach the end of the demo (over the course of two sessions, took a break after game overing twice on the crushers).

General thoughts:

Obviously it looks great, but I don't need to tell you that.  Jumps are less floaty than I had expected, but it was something I adjusted to, and gets much better with double jump.  The run speed also seemed a little slower than I expected, but not too bad.  Initially I was thrown off my the slow/ambiguous death animations, but it didn't take long to learn that the balls die in 4 hits and squirrels die in 1.  The squirrels seem to be at the perfect level of annoying, though it would have been nice if they give a visual indicator before they do their swoop (and maybe if you could deflect/break the nuts if you hit them with your weapon).  The balls on the other hand just seemed to be there, to hurt me if I carelessly walked into them (which, to be clear, I did do, lol), but getting hit because one was chilling on the ledge I need to reach or because a moved into it during the attack combo feels less good than getting hit by a squirrel where I know I could have just timed things better (maybe it would help if hitting them knocked them back a little to account for the fact that the 4 hit combo moves you forward).  The chargy bois are also a suitably interesting enemy, though I'm a *little* concerned that I might be SoL if I had played a bit more fast and loose with my mana (whether to heal or something else).  I thought the various attacks all had a good weight to them - hits felt like hits.

Bugs:

-You temporarily lose control of your character while the gate near the double jump power-up is opening (triggered by defeating the ground enemies from what I could tell), but you are not invulnerable while this occurs, so the flying squirrels can hurt you with their nuts.  One of the squirrels is too high to reach without double jump, so you're gonna get hurt.

-I exited to the main menu after reviving at the nearest checkpoint, which caused the audio to pop in and out (maybe it was trying to play multiple tracks, not sure), and the Rest icon which appears while you're at a save shrine remained visible while on the Main menu.

-You can activate ally powers immediately before saving and while the cooldowns on the abilities reset, you still seem to keep the benefits of the abilities.  The shield bar is full, and you've got the red aura for the damage boost, but the timers in the UI indicating remaining duration go away as if the powers went away.

-I'm not entirely sure, but it seemed like sometimes when I would do the charged vertical leap it would consume mana, and other times it wouldn't have a mana cost.

-Very minor issue, but using the dash on inclines seems to kill your momentum.  I even seemed to slide back a wee bit a couple times, though I didn't reproduce this consistently (issue was observed dashing on the logs near the base of the area where the 3 crystals are).

Balance Feedback:

-**The crushers seem far too punishing at the moment.**  The first time I died to them I wasn't even sure what had happened, since they don't move *at all* until you're right next to them.  On top of that they seem to kill you immediately.  It doesn't help that the previous save point is fairly far from the crushers, so it takes a while to get back to them.  Maybe that's part of the design, like it's supposed to be Soulsborne hard, but I hadn't gotten that impression at any point before that.  That said, on my second death to the first Crusher I managed to activate the rezz in time (didn't activate it quick enough first time since I was processing what was happening), and once I knew what to watch out for, I dashed through them without issue.  But then I got to the horizontal crushers, and I died again because I didn't get past the second one quick enough, what with the ledge grabbing and all that jazz.  So you might want to have a checkpoint near new mechanics like that, if you want to keep them that punishing.  And if you're not set on it being a surprise death, then having the crushers *always* moving would probably make them easier to deal with (and maybe you can deactivate them with a switch when you get to the end). Even in Soulslike MVs like HK and S&amp;S, getting crushed would only remove a portion of your health (HK moves you to safer ground, while S&amp;S would launch you backwards).  This was the only section where balance felt really out of place.

-It's not entirely clear how strong the ally powers are.  The heal over time seemed to give like 20% of the health bar... which offsets the damage from touching spikes once I guess.  And it's not entirely clear how much damage reduction the shield actually provides.  For abilities you can only use once per checkpoint, I was expecting a bit more oomph.  Though that aspect of those things also makes me hesitant to use them, especially the damage boost, because you don't know if the next fight will be even tougher.  But I'd probably adjust to that in time.  The rezz ability is obviously useful, but I wonder if it will make balancing further down the line more difficult, since there might be an expectation that players will have it with them.  Or it might shoehorn players into wanting to keep those 3 allies at all times because what else is going to be as a strong as a second life?

QoL suggestions:

-It would be nice if the right analog stick let you look around.

-If the D Pad isn't going to be used for anything else, then it might be nice to provide the player the option of using it *or* the left analog stick for movement.

Anyhow, it seems like its coming along quite well, thanks for sharing the demo!",1617235372

James bond isn't generally written very well, but its james bond, so who cares? 

Maybe Nolan will get that treatment in the future.

Having said that, perhaps your volume is too loud. If it's loud enough to mistake for a real siren, it might be too loud in general.

There's also something to be said for meditation or other practices that can help you create a small gap between stimulus and response.

1) The person just read the headline and assumed Rogan was slandering Spotify by saying they censored him, so questioned if the truth was coming out due to a lawsuit.  
  
2) The person took the time to familiarize themself with the details and thought, “I wonder if they threatened to sue him because he said he just wanted to keep some of his content on YouTube instead of declaring the details of his contract with his new business partner to the general public?”

"AskConservatives","t5_2yb8u","Anecdotal experiences don't beat hard data. There are some examples and anecdotes of the harms I'm listing not happening but on the whole, they do. There is empirical research backing up everything I said.

As far as HIV goes, what you are listing is based on three extremely flawed studies in Africa that had many problems and contained multiple sources of bias, outlined below: 

* Researcher expectation bias − Many of the investigators had written papers advocating for male circumcision to prevent HIV infection prior to undertaking these RCTs. Siegfried et al. note, on the topic of research on circumcision to prevent HIV, that “researchers’ personal biases and the dominant circumcision practices of their respective countries may influence their interpretation of findings.”
* Participant expectation bias − The majority of participants were convinced that circumcision would reduce their risk of HIV infection. 
* Lead time bias − Men randomized to the intervention arm of the trials (the group that was circumcised) were considered to be at risk for becoming infected from the time of the surgery, even though they were told to avoid sexual activity during the period of wound healing. Men in the control arm (the ones who were not circumcised) were able to be sexually active from the beginning of the study. 
* Selection bias − Only men who were interested in a free circumcision were eligible to participate, and therefore may not have been representative of the general population. Attrition bias − For every man who became infected with HIV during the trials, 3.5−7.4 men were lost to follow-up. This is a serious methodological problem that could alter the statistical significance of the findings.
* Early termination bias − Studies that are terminated early are more likely to overestimate any treatment effect. 
* Duration bias − Because men who were not initially circumcised were circumcised at the end of the study, long-term comparison of the effects cannot be accurately extrapolated, as some modelers have proposed.
* Source of infection unknown − If the studies were designed to determine whether circumcision reduced the risk of heterosexually-transmitted HIV, the investigators should have confirmed that the infections were indeed transmitted through heterosexual sexual contact. They did not. Using the data reported, it is estimated that about half of the infections of the men in these studies were not sexually transmitted.

The cumulative treatment effect in these trials – which claimed a 38-66% relative risk reduction – was an absolute risk reduction of 1.3%. This is a very small effect, which could easily have resulted from the various forms of bias, rather than being a true treatment effect. The findings are not robust, given that all of the trials had nearly identical methodologies and nearly identical results.

Also, these studies were done on adults in Africa and therefore don't have applicability to infants in the Americas. In fact, studies in America have found that circumcision increases the risk of HIV:

[More than foreskin: circumcision status, history of HIV/STI, and sexual risk in a clinic-based sample of men in Puerto Rico - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22897699/)

Here is a systematic review and meta-analysis of the entire literature about circumcision and HIV which finds that on the whole, circumcision increases the risk of HIV:

[Circumcision and HIV infection: review of the literature and meta-analysis - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10215123/)

Here is another systematic review and meta-analysis which finds that circumcision increases the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections:

&gt;&gt; Desde el punto de vista de sus imágenes públicas, las dos mujeres se encuentran en las antípodas, pero ambas son exfuncionarias con experiencia en gestión y son las principales integrantes femeninas dentro del espacio político creado por [el expresidente Mauricio Macri (2015-2019)](https://mundo.sputniknews.com/20210301/argentina-investigara-la-deuda-tomada-por-el-gobierno-de-macri-1109367252.html).

&gt;&gt; **María Eugenia Vidal**, exgobernadora de la provincia de Buenos Aires (2015-2019) por la coalición Cambiemos, regresó al escenario político después de más de año de cauto silencio público luego de su derrota en las elecciones de 2019 para la reelección contra Axel Kicillof, candidato del Frente de Todos, la coalición oficialista del presidente Alberto Fernández y la vicepresidenta Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The rich paying more taxes and cutting back on avoidance is generally a good thing, but I think it's important to impose taxes based on evidence/effectiveness rather than ideology or popularity.

While corporate, capital gains and wealth taxes are all popular, even at high rates they tend to be ineffective revenue tools and yield very little in the way of progressive effects. Since capital and investment are highly elastic and mobile, taxes that fall on them tend to actually marginally depress revenue levels through the tiny reductions in GDP caused by the tax that exceed the small amount of revenue raised by those taxes. Corporate taxes also have an issue where between 20-70% of their burden falls on labor, which is a fairly regressive effect.

Though at the same time, what people on the right tend to get wrong is they want to lower/abolish those taxes without proposing an alternative for them. For instance, a federal [Land Value Tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax) would be considerably more progressive than those four taxes and also generate considerably more revenue. A federal LVT that collected the equivalent value of 3-5% of the total value of real estate in the U.S for instance would generate between $1.6 to 2.8 trillion in 2019-20 and significantly cut back on avoidance/capital flight.",1617235374

They can’t be your only light, don’t use them to cope. Cut them off, I know it’ll be hard but it’s the first thing to do, easier said than done though. It will let you to gain happiness and be able to see the happiness. It could be the reason these people don’t want to be in your life idk so I’d cut the drugs off, many people leave people’s lives when people need these people the most, because they don’t want to see them struggling and in addiction. Once you do that, and make it known to these people that you’ve cut off the drugs and maybe start investing time into yourself in finding jobs and working on hobbies they might want to see you more, then I’d see a therapist to deal with these feelings, it’s hard dealing with it on your own. I only say this because I’ve had those dark evil feelings of depression and I’ve had addiction in my family and while I don’t take in drugs i have an addictive personality so it can be tough.

"homegym","t5_2ts8i","I’ve used TPBs, OPBs, ODLBs, and probably a ton of other brands during my college and commercial gym years. They were all incredibly abused and used though. A friend of mine who started his home gym journey before me has a bare steel ODLB and it was great to pull with. I bought the BoS PB for my first bar last winter and it was alright, but not what I was wanting. This Rep will also be my first high end bar. The all SS was a big factor for me since Rogue doesn’t have that combo and won’t have it for awhile by the sound of it. I’m interested in the aggressive on the Rep and hoping it’ll be a lifetime bar. 🤙🏼",1617235375

I'll definitely be taking math courses during undergrad which I don't expect to be easy but I also don't expect those to kill my gpa (it that correct or not really?)

I admit that I've threatened this to my insurance company when they wouldn't refill a basic BP med on me.  

To be honest, I'm surprised that there aren't more insurance companies in the US offering some sort of copay on common OTC meds purchased at pharmacies.  I know some college campuses that have their own health clinics offer cheap generic OTC medications for purchase, and some state Medicaids do as well through participating pharmacies already.  These same pharmacies also often have some mid-level practitioner available in larger cities too that can serve in a similar capacity (but as you say, would probably refer to the ER on more severe cases).  Even looking back through history, while the physician went on house calls, the cheaper pharmacist was opening shop instead and compounding their own pre-FDA pharmaceuticals, some still around to this day as sauces and bitters.

Even then, perhaps it's possible for even an RN to start with just triage and assessing cases that are there for OTC medications.  I know an RN's scope of practice does *not* allow for prescribing medications, but if someone is there just for that, it bypasses a lot of the less severe cases, and allows for the referring upwards to a midlevel or higher practitioner on something more severe, or that just doesn't seem right.",1617235377

Into the t-mobile device, and what you’re networking needs are.

I have a pretty nice ASUS router that I bought specifically to deliver 5Ghz from end-to-end of my one story ranch style. I tested WiFi signal strength from the ASUS compared to the T-Mobile one, and to me it was definitely worth the $200 for the nicer router.

It also depends on what you do inside your network. I have an oculus quest 2 and a gaming PC, so I need a strong low latency 5Ghz connection to connect it to my PC, which has nothing to do with the speed of my internet- only to do with the quality and position of the router.

If you’re just trying to get the fastest speeds, then the built-in router is plenty capable, but if you have devices that are physically far away that you find have speed or connectivity issues (I have an Amazon echo at the far end of the house in the master bedroom that is far enough away that with the built in, I only get @ 2 bars and Alexa constantly tells me “something went wrong,” but works flawlessly with the nicer router.",1617235378

Your patience will probably heavily depend on her willingness to confront the issue/her seriousness in changing it.

I don't think she's being completely fair, though. She can cry, but getting defensive and turning the conversation back to her again completely invalidates your thoughts and feelings, which *also* matter. She's allowed to struggle with body image and not want sex right now, and you're allowed to be upset about your sex life.

I was at that point, similar thoughts (and almost actions) that you were thinking of doing.  And it was at that point that I reconnected with a old friend, he helped me get out of it, and then we ended up together.  And yeah, totally different person.  Where as the ex was nothing but self serving with no true regard for others, my SO is generous to a fault, haha.

It's great that at least for some of us there's a silver lining in the paths we took leading us to someone special.  I genuinely hope all abuse victims find it in them to trust and open up again and find that someone that helps them heal.

And really thank you for sharing that.  It makes me happy to hear some do really try to manage and cope and get therapy for it.  I've got some issues of my own (potentially bipolar based on family history, and symptoms of course) and a boatload of anxiety.  I've seen therapists in the past but not since I got away away my ex.  I really should be seeing one now but I've been struggling with reaching out to find one.

When I come back I’m going to try running and seeing how that goes, then plan my summer out from there.

I like stopping before the next month starts to not only look forward and set intentions but to give myself a pat on the back for how far I’ve already come this year, so thanks for this thread!

Think of a supermarket. They have a marketing team that make and send out a catalogue.

If the stock is not out to be sold, or the doors can’t open, that has nothing to do with the quality of the catalogue. 

As successful marketing campaign should draw in more customers, and that can put strain on an unprepared ops team. It’s management and operations that need to plan for that.

But, you have had a very frustrating experience, and completely understand that you’re wanting to talk about it. You’re absolutely entitled to do so, but this is a very sub generally for marketing people where we often talk about technical things.

Clarification/edit: Yeah, it’s tomorrow, which means it’s not April yet [for JW at the time of his tweet, who is presumably in Sweden at the time. It not being April COULD mean that it’s not an April Fools’ joke, since as far as my limited understanding goes, April Fools’ jokes happen in April. This was something OP was alluding to]... Unless JW is in Asia [there are other places/timezones that were, at the time of his tweet, already in April, but Asia is the most notable of the bunch which is why I used it as my hypothetical] rn [right now is referring to the fact that it was highly improbable that JW was in Asia (or any other parts of the world that’s East of Europe) when I submitted my comment. If we were to assume JW was in fact in Asia (or any other place that’s East of Europe) at the time of his tweet, it would make little sense for him to have quickly moved anywhere else at the time of my comment, hence why I used rn].",1617235381

u/starrgo - I recorded a podcast for women to listen to after introducing them to the idea of pegging.

https://peggingparadise.com/blog/2015/09/podcast-112-for-the-ladies/

It addresses all the usual fears and misconceptions, offers accurate information and emphasizes the relationship, not trying to convince. You need to listen to it first because only you can decide if it is appropriate for your partner. So far, this podcast has gotten rave reviews.

Also - make sure your side of the street is clean - be the best partner you can be so she feels lucky to be with you - in and out of the bedroom. If that part of your relationship isn't working - no podcast will help.

Copy+Paste character models from World but removed the two hairstyles I actually liked. Seriously, why not just copy them all if you're going to reuse the models anyway?

The hitboxes are incredible in Rise. I almost felt like the difficulty had been reduced drastically simply because there were several attacks that left me wondering why I hadn't been knocked over (coming from Iceborne, I was expecting anything even remotely close to the monster's model to whack me). There are a couple of attacks I'd almost argue got so close they probably should've at least staggered the player, but I'd prefer no hit to ""lol this small piece of wing brushing past you made you do a backflip.""

Also pretty glad to not have the MMO bullshit. Didn't mind MR Kulve too much since it was basically a standard solo hunt once you got the hang of it, but things like HR Kulve and Safi were meh.

Couples looking for a unicorn will often say they want someone to ""join"" their family. Poly triads are not (AB)+C. C isn't ""joining"" anything. You all will create something completely new; four different relationships that all need time and attention.

B, the violence here wasn’t just initiated from just not wearing a mask. As someone who has had to deal with anger issues in the past, I can see how something like this can end that way. I personally wouldn’t like someone grabbing my arm and getting all touchy, angry with and close to me, especially during a pandemic, just because I asked them to do something for public health and safety, which is required. I personally haven’t ever taken out my anger on living things, but I can see how it can come to that if one is wound up easily. I have thrown objects onto the ground (things I didn’t want to damage) because I got frustrated with them and instantly regretted it. It seems like that’s what happened here, just with a person.

Keep in mind, this didn’t start in violence, but just in multiple people asking him to wear a mask and the guy saying it isn’t required, when it is. Then grabbing this other guy’s arm (a stranger mind you) and basically throwing him around in his seat, after being asked again. Also provoking him by saying “what are you gonna do?”. Violence isn’t a good way to end, but it also didn’t just come from the topic of masks or nothing.

&gt;&gt;  La pobreza fue en el segundo semestre de 2020 del 42% de las personas y el 31,6% de los hogares, en tanto la indigencia fue del 10,5% y 7,8%, respectivamente.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; La [pobreza](http://www.diariopopular.com.ar/pobreza-a996) y la [indigencia](http://www.diariopopular.com.ar/indigencia-a3815) alcanzaron en el segundo semestre de 2020 los niveles más altos de los últimos dieciocho años, con un 42% y un 10,5% de las personas, respectivamente, informó este miércoles el Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos ([INDEC](http://www.diariopopular.com.ar/indec-a72)).
&gt;
&gt;&gt; En la comparación interanual crecieron ambos indicadores: los hogares pobres lo hicieron en 5,7 p.p. y las personas bajo la línea de pobreza, en 6,5 p.p.; mientras que los hogares indigentes aumentaron en 2,1 p.p. y las personas bajo la línea de indigencia, en 2,5 p.p.

Going into middle school i already had a long record of struggling with depression and anxiety (turned out to be PTSD from years of what can be crudely summed up as ""shitty parenting"") and I already had been bullied and such at grade school for not fitting in, largely due to my home life. Well I just kept getting worse, my family started seeing me as responsible for my own actions which did not help me out at home and I got to the point I felt like I only had one person in my family who didn't hate me and that was my step-dad. I started cutting myself to try and break out of the dissociation I was constantly stuck in and due to self worth issues so the kids at school started making fun of me for that. I finally felt like I was getting used to everyones cruelty when my step-dad committed suicide, blaming my mother in his note. Kids at school made fun of me for this as well. So basically I was a complete wreck for a few years after that until I was able to make some stable friends at a school that I didn't have the bullying issues at and was able to start distancing from my family.

This SEP article has a good overview of the history. Like I said, you can really find the argument back in Plato's *Laws* (which the article mentions too). But people typically think of Aristotle when they think about its history. It's a common argument from then on (and really, who knows if it goes further back? We have so little of the pre-Socratics).

If you're interested in more about this argument, and the religious aspects of Greek Philosophy in general, you might check out the book by David Conway, *The Rediscover of Wisdom-From Here to Antiquity in Search of Sophia.* If you're interested, but not able to find a copy, DM me.

Before he took the time to write the stories of old, these were all stories shared by mouth alone with a few exception of Runestones left throughout the old lands. Problem is, the little bit that has survived the Christian upheaval, make no references to these two and nothing of Baldr ever getting to leave Hel.

So yes, but also no.

And of course, we have lots of alters who are extremely opposite from the host, and to see those differences are crazy, but kinda validating.


I feel like it's the same case with friends, like how our single friends can be similar to us but also very different. And I think it only confuses people who you start to pick up things from each other. Like I used to do a face, as an ironic joke and now my friend does it, and I've picked up things from them. Being around people makes you learn about them and almost subconsciously mimic their behaviors, I guess.


So maybe it's the same with alters, sometimes it's like that, and I can't tell who is who, but we're still really new to all this self-awareness and it's taken a very long time just to learn a few things about like 2 alters. And I'm finally learning about another 2 more. Still a new system, so I'm sure I can relate more to think in a few years. Maybe progress is just slow for us, it ain't easy.",1617235389

&gt;&gt; # [En el año de la pandemia y la cuarentena, la pobreza llegó al 42% y afecta a 19,4 millones de personas](https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/r9xNoeWwiK9fr3U7hDwjTpwx7Wo=/1200x628/filters:format(jpg\):quality(85\)//cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/2RHUWILOHCH5DIUEGTK2ILAIDQ.jpg)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Cabe recordar que en comparación con la última medición de 2018, en el segundo semestre de 2019 las estimaciones del INDEC registraron un aumento en las tasas de pobreza e indigencia: el porcentaje de hogares pobres experimentó un incremento interanual de 2,5 puntos porcentuales y la proporción de hogares indigentes se elevó en 0,9 puntos porcentuales.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; **Si se extrapolara la medición de los aglomerados urbanos que realiza el Indec a la población de todo el país, se concluiría que la pobreza afectaba a fines del año pasado a 19,4 millones de personas,** 3,2 millones más que antes de la pandemia; se trata de la tasa más alta desde 2004, cuando llegó al 44,3 por ciento.

Learning, assessing what you can do next time, then moving on and assuring yourself you’re doing the best you can. Plenty of external people in the world can be hard on you for one reason or another - but _you_ can give yourself kindness 100% of the time, so don’t deprive yourself of that!

There’s a Buddhist concept I like that basically says we have all feelings (positive and negative) inside us at all times. When we feel a negative one pop up, like anger, embarrassment, self resentment, etc, it’s just important to realize those feelings are natural, and to treat them like a younger sibling or child. “Oh hey anger, don’t worry, I’m going to take care of you.” Then do some reflection or self care to figure out why you feel that way and relieve those feelings. Maybe try reframing it that way - you’re taking care of yourself and your feelings for the mistake. Not punishing yourself for something that’s only natural.",1617235390

Make sure you don't do anything that interacts with the treatment. Also, you might want your husband to also follow some form of treatment if you guys are having sex because he might transmit it right back to you in the upcoming days/weeks. Whenever my husband had to be treated, we used a cream like canesten (OTC medication recommended by my doctor). You could always call your doctor to see whether that would be worth it.  

For immediate relief of the itch, I'm afraid my answer will suck but it's mostly a waiting game.  Definitely steer clear of the home remedies that you find on the internet. They may provide momentary relief, but make things worse in the long run as they affect your vagina's PH balance (I'm thinking inserting foods like garlic or yogourt, putting stuff in your bathtub, which are common pieces of advice, etc.). I've found some relief in airing out my lady parts to make sure it doesn't get too humid down there (and in there of course). The itchiness should subside as the yeast production goes down. 

You might want to try reducing the amount of sugar you eat in the upcoming days. It won't be miraculous, but it wouldn't hurt to try. Other than that, if the itch doesn't go away, tell your doctor and you might try other medications and also test if it is morphing into BV (another form of infection) which requires antibiotics.

&gt;&gt; En opinión de Alejandre, “**los resultados del test de PCR no son una herramienta que permita definir aperturas y cierres**, primero porque lo que importa (más que una PCR positiva) es que el paciente tenga la enfermedad porque se pueden tener positivos por contaminaciones, positivos sin que el paciente desarrolle COVID-19 porque se lo hisopó justo cuando tenía algo de virus en sus fosas nasales aunque sea asintomático”.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; La PCR detecta un fragmento genético de un virus; no es una técnica que diagnostique COVID a pesar de que así se la haya asimilado"" (Shutterstock)
&gt;
&gt;“En el caso de la PCR puede haber falsos negativos por un timming inadecuado en la toma de muestra desde el inicio de los síntomas, o por algún problema inherente de la técnica en sí -precisó-.
&gt;
&gt;**La técnica de PCR es una técnica sensible en la que se amplifica material genético por lo que con que una microgota de una muestra positiva contamine una muestra negativa va a hacer que la muestra negativa dé positivo**”.
&gt;
&gt;Asimismo, remarcó que “en cuanto a lo técnico, después están los falsos positivos de interpretación en el sentido de que puede ser que la muestra haya tenido esa secuencia genética y la PCR dé positivo porque la secuencia está pero aun así eso no se correlaciona con un cuadro clínico de COVID ni tampoco que la persona está cursando una infección o es infectiva.

•Jesus covered all sin, past, present and future. If you accepted him you are saved and no sin can undermine that except the unforgivable sin. 
•Suicide is not something you proceed with lightly, and it does not mean the person was unrepentant. Please educate yourself about mental illness, depression particularly in this case. 
•I never said suicide you can go to Heaven by committing suicide. I stated that suicide is not the unforgivable sin that will send you straight to hell. Your eternal life depends only if you accepted Jesus or not.

This is an interesting question that almost just sparked a rant about the the history of clothing.. but I'll keep it in this era instead.

I feel like, for me, a gender epiphany is something that stays, something that is part of the inner landscape. If we were all just ethereal blobs floating in the mist we would still have those epiphanies shaping our nature.

Expression and presentation matter because we aren't ethereal blobs, we live in the world. While I don't think ""looks are everything"" or any vain nonsense like that, we are a part of the world. It feels good to find how to express ourselves and present ourselves to the world in ways that are comfortable and authentic.

So as for telling the difference... self reflection. The whole time. I feel like a gender epiphany can feed into finding more pleasure with one's presentation and expression. I feel like finding a greater happiness with presentation or expression can lead one into gender epiphanies. They feed each other, but are separate phenomenons. So always ask yourself what it all means, and then think about all the things you can think about. That's the best anybody can do.",1617235392

I think you can use march of the legion+blood magic combo (and maybe even supreme ego if you can sustain the life loses).

Not optimal but base duration of auras is 11.4s, it's fairly easy to  scale it to 15-20s.

Main use i can see is an easy trigger for the champion adrenaline node. If you time it well you can have almost permanent adrenaline and 2/3 additionals auras (could be anything, haste, hatred, even purities for big max res buff). No need for weapon swap anymore.

And with mortal conviction you get 1 free permanent aura (pride for exemple) so you would only reserve blood and sand (and a banner but you can remove the mana reservation as a champion)",1617235392

Only real problem with Tate is that since he doesn't get any separation through his route or speed, every catch has to be a circus grab. His catch radius is huge, but it's also small because the QB has to put it on the outer limits of his catch radius for the DB to not have an easy play the ball. Anything close to his body and there's a good chance the DB can make a play if he's being covered.

All that being said, I love Tate and his crazy catches. He's a lot of fun to watch, but he's not very consistent due to what I outlined before. Has a 50% catch rate on about the same number of targets as Ross had with the Bengals.",1617235392

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt; 80 is not enough to stand out these days unfortunately. I am not saying they need to to be good but they need to to garner attention to a niche game like Gravity Rush.

Plenty of games with that score do well in sales. COD can be in the 70s and sell like gangbusters. Want a smaller scale project and not a big budget series? Fall guys had an 80 on metacritic too. There's nothing supporting your claim that it didn't sell well because of the reviews.

&gt;Games like Persona 5 and Nier Automata got much better reviews and thus they got tons of positive attention for it.

No one is saying that reviews can't help sales, but it's also funny that you pick two of the most critically acclaimed games of the past decade to make your point. 

&gt;Sony and other studios fund obviously niche games to satisfy a hardcore fanbase and attract them to their platform.

Once again how is an open world superhero game attracting a ""hardcare fanbase"". And only the second one in the series. 

&gt;They are aware Returnal isn't going to sell well and same with games like Sack Boy, Dreams and even Demons Souls but they still do because itll still attract some people to the platform.

These examples are poor on many levels. By all accounts Sony does have hopes for Returnal since it didn't look cheap to make and Sony has featured it *multiple* times it their e3 level reveal streams during the year of covid. Sackboy is part of the little big planet franchise which is a big name and has sold millions. Also got proper conference coverafe. Dreams was a huge undertaking that got proper exposure and lots of support from sony. Demon Souls was marketed heavily and a tentpole ps5 launch game and is an offshoot of dark souls which has sold *27 million* copies. Like what???? You seem to have a super skewed perception of what actually is a ""nice hardcore game"" if you list fucking the fucking Demon Souls remake.

&gt;But Japan Studio hasn't made a critically or commercially successful games since the PS2.

Many of their games have been critically successfully and I have listed reasons why Sony didn't give them proper support.

So many of your points are flat-out wrong or poorly conceived, you seem to just want to hate on GR. Also many of my own points have gone unaddressed as you shifted the goal posts. This is pathetic frankly.",1617235392

Many Americans also truly believed that Soccer was a **Communist conspiracy** against the country.  No joke.

As for the BR bracket: I think the Mig 15bis versions need to go up to 8.7, that would help things out a bit. I'd rather see a BR increase over the inevitable repair increase that's coming. Some of the G.91's with missiles should also be looked at for a br increase. Drop the Mystere IIb down to 8.0 and the Super Mystere down to 8.3 if they're going to keep missiles at 8.3. They both suck at or above their br, though not completely useless.  

  
Problem with ~8.3 US team makeup is half the team spawns as strike aircraft, which aren't good at obtaining air superiority against migs.

&gt;&gt; Y tras señalar que “con respecto a la PCR y el COVID-19 hay que tener presente primero que la PCR detecta un fragmento genético de un virus; no es una técnica que diagnostique COVID a pesar de que así se la haya asimilado”, aclaró: “Una cosa es que una técnica detecte un segmento viral y otra es que haga un diagnóstico, y en absoluto con PCR puede hacerse un diagnóstico de COVID porque además atendiendo a las mismas definiciones de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, el COVID es un cuadro clínico con determinadas características de signos y síntomas, que a su vez también es una definición muy vaga y que se incluye en otras enfermedades que no son COVID.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; [""Los resultados positivos de la rRT-PCR revelan la presencia de ARN viral, pero no predicen la virulencia ni la transmisibilidad, ni tampoco descartan infecciones bacterianas o coinfecciones con otros virus"" (Shutterstock)](https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/6fGZ1ck8N1LBK9pO6XiUs_w7fV8=/420x236/filters:format(jpg\):quality(85\)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/SMEURE7IUJAIHEC4VD54J3WURA.jpg)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; En ese sentido, Salmeron señaló: “Puede decirse que la PCR es muy sensible porque detecta muy bien el segmento genético, pero esa sensibilidad que tiene técnicamente excede la utilidad clínica en el sentido de que tener una PCR positiva no necesariamente indica que el paciente está infectado o que tiene un cuadro clínico, está enfermo o va a contagiar porque la PCR detecta segmentos genéticos, no diagnostica un cuadro de COVID”.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; [""La PCR es la técnica más sensible y más específica con la que se cuenta para detectar COVID-19, lo que pasa es que hay que tener en cuenta cuándo usarla y con quién"" (Shutterstock)](https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/lhvUtpbxeEUPDda5eAVVWJ2q8as=/420x236/filters:format(jpg\):quality(85\)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/VDRNLLNGXRFZJHGPQPT44FWT7U.jpg)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ""La PCR es la técnica más sensible y más específica con la que se cuenta para detectar COVID-19, lo que pasa es que hay que tener en cuenta cuándo usarla y con quién"" (Shutterstock)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; En palabras de Salmeron, “la principal virtud de la técnica PCR aplicada al diagnóstico clínico y específicamente en este caso al diagnóstico de infecciones virales es la rapidez y la especificidad, que permite a través de la búsqueda de segmentos genéticos de un germen encontrarlo en menos tiempo que el que implica un cultivo”.

I grew up Assemblies of God in an inner city, so the racism was more subtle. On the surface, they welcome everyone. But the racism was still there.

Our part of the city had an uptick in Indian folks immigrating. Our city had always had a huge Indian population, but more families started moving down to where the church was.

People would laugh at their accents or make fun of their names.

There was also the time the pastor—right after 9/11–said that we should bomb the Middle East. They also propagated the idea that Middle Eastern folks were having parties when the planes hit. (Mind you, the pastor couldn’t get his story straight. He was either by the Hudson when the planes hit and watched them fly right overhead—even though they didn’t come from our direction. Or he was in a part of the city with a lot of Middle Eastern folks watching them cheer and dance in the street. He lied about a lot.)

There’s also the racism against Obama. This wasn’t a simple disagreement with his policies. I heard people refer to him as the literal Antichrist. When Trump was elected, a pastor said it felt like America again, now that we had someone like him (meaning white) in the Oval Office.",1617235394

&gt;&gt; La técnica de PCR se volvió ""la"" herramienta por excelencia para diagnosticar casos de coronavirus, y sobre la base de sus resultados definir políticas sanitarias en todo el mundo (Shutterstock)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; [El virólogo argentino Pablo Goldshmidt puso en duda la especificidad de la técnica de diagnóstico, a la que definió como ""instrumento de referencia y no son por sí mismo la prueba exclusiva de infección"" (Shutterstock)](https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/A1pcntw3l5bkRMlEjW6SewVSkYA=/420x236/filters:format(jpg\):quality(85\)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/IVVJ4FWWQZD53EOIVKP6YRIKTY.jpg)
&gt;
&gt;Los resultados de estos estudios sugieren que un número importante de rRT-PCR positivas en personas asintomáticas no fueron indicadoras de la infección por el SARS-CoV-2.
&gt;
&gt;De lo mencionado se infiere que, **para los individuos asintomáticos en los que no se detecten anticuerpos dirigidos contra el SARS-CoV-2, la interpretación de los resultados positivos de las pruebas de rRT-PCR requiere extrema cautela**”.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; [La técnica científica avanzada fue inventada por el bioquímico norteameticano Kary Mullis en 1985 y le valió el Premio Nobel de Medicina en el año 93 (AP)](https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/nQbe1ARvQCIVqxj7oHYhLwL0X4w=/420x236/filters:format(jpg\):quality(85\)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/YX3PJXVKYBG2FGXN62T2ZQZ4O4.jpg)

I felt way more fuzzy mentally.  Lost working memory (forgot stuff as I tried to connect other ideas).  Couldn't find words to speak with.  Had muscle jerks, like big ones.  Bit my cheek and tongue a lot more.  Felt colder, which one doctor attributed to lower thyroid hormones (no blood tests to verify).

This was at 0.8 blood levels, 1200mg/day, and with seroquel at 200mg.  Lowering lithium to 900mg helped the big muscle jerks.  Adding lamotrigine covered up a lot of the mental issues.  Going 900mg to 600mg of lithium made my body temp go back warmer and gave me more energy.  Stopping seroquel gave me more mental energy, but worse sleep (at 4 hrs/night now for weeks).",1617235396

&gt; We also lost track of all promotional items we've added.

This is worrying. What else has Jagex forgotten?

&gt;Vorago is intended as a team boss, and as such we won't change the mechanics to allow it to be soloable. (""Why not do it with friends?"")

Foxis is not going to like this.

&gt;The percentage of people playing as female characters in old basic clothing (gear hidden, dyed weapons) is smaller than we thought. We cannot cater to every niche playstyle, as such we're still planning to remove the old basic clothing.

What exactly does this mean? Are they deleting the default clothing from Thessalia's and similar stores? They'd better not.

B1) **Please read** all of our [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/index) and [Borrower FAQ's](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/borrowers)

B2) **Do not delete this submission** (or ANY submission past or present), for any reason, or any of your comments as it will result in a ban.  If your request is fulfilled or you **no longer need the money** please do one or a combination of A) edit your post to reflect the change, B) flair your post as 'complete' (the flair button is under the body text of the post), and/or C) make a comment that it's no longer needed.

B3) **Wait 24 hours** from this post to make another unless this post or the next is prearranged with a particular lender. If there are errors in this post you need to correct by posting again before 24 hours then you should contact a moderator

B4) **Vet your lenders! Be careful who you send your personal information to** A) Moderators strongly suggest requiring that a lender comment on your REQ post before you send them any personal information. Banned or ineligible lenders cannot comment here. B) CHECK your lenders r/borrow history by clicking [here.](https://www.loanmanager.co/lender-check/) Do this for every loan request you recieve. C) Are they **BLACKLISTED** or asking for **PROHIBITED ITEMS/INFORMATION** (see [THIS LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lender_blacklist_prohibited_info))? Message moderators immediately D) Are they eligible (90+ day account, 1000+ karma, not banned) and active (any big account activity gaps?). Ultimately, you are free to accept loans from any user though you do so at your own risk. Loans made with ineligible/banned users will not be tracked by LoansBot and you will not get credit for loans fulfilled by ineligible lenders, so proceed at your own risk

B5) Understand and properly use all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

LENDERS:

L1) **Please read** all of our [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/index) and [Lender FAQ's](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lenders)

L2) **Vet your borrowers!** A) Check for any past REQ posts and scan the comments for red flags, B) Check the [UniversalScammerList](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php), C) Install [RedditScamLabeler](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/ad10kg/meta_reddit_scam_labeler_extension_v15_update/) to your browser, D) Install this quick [karma-earning investigation tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/8gb6a8/metabookmarklet_to_help_identify_karma_farming/) to your browser, E) See these lists of sketchy user behaviors: [""Karma farmers""](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/9htkug/meta_be_aware_recent_influx_here_of_bot_managed/), [How to identify high risk borrowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/5n4rei/meta_lenders_how_to_identify_users_who_are_likely/)

L3) Check to see if whaaack has a [**Post Deletion History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrowdeletes/search?q=whaaack&amp;restrict_sr=on)

L4) Check whaaack's [**Spam History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/search?q=whaaack&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on), [**RedditMetis profile**](https://www.redditmetis.com/user/whaaack), or [**Atomiks Analyzer Profile**](https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#whaaack), or [Redetective profile](https://www.redective.com/) [**!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gcdeletes+gcremoves+gcmirror+gcarchive+gcalerts/search?q=whaaack&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)

L5) **We have a [Rule 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/cz5myt/meta_new_rule_concerning_lending_to_borrowers/) that requires new lenders to contact existing lenders holding late debt to OK providing more funds to this post author (borrower). Please adhere to this rule or you will be banned!** Additionally, it is suggested that lenders take into account a user’s **current open loans and repayment history when considering funding a loan**. This includes a) do they have any repayment history? Extra vetting may be required if not, b) are they asking for loans while still having some out (this is not against the rules)? **It is encouraged and courteous to contact current lenders to inquire about open loans**, c) How much has a borrower repaid historically (in total) vs. how much do they have out now in total? ""Piling"", or lenders **continuously providing loans to borrowers with many already open loans, is highly discouraged** unless the borrower has a very solid repayment history

L6) Understand and [properly use](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/6a624m/meta_the_usage_model_for_the_loan_command/) all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

"stopdrinking","t5_2s7yr","I've been on both sides of your situation. The best thing you can do for everyone involved is take care of yourself. Get sober, and be serious about addressing the reasons you drank and used in the first place. Use resources. Be around people who can call you on your shit, whether that's in AA or therapy or whatever else works for you. The opposite of addiction is not sobriety, it's connection. Addiction is about isolation. You might find a revolution in your personal relationships after a bit of time not using and doing the associated inner work. After a year of that, I'd put money on you having a very different assessment of how your friend life is going than the one you wrote here. That's how it was for me, anyway. Also: more self-love, not less. Real honest love, but love. Being able to make the choice to care for ourselves and our lives and make needed changes is a gift. Not everyone makes it to where you are. Iwndwyt.",1617235397

Browsing : opening a new windows takes let say 1s, you gain 0.2s which is negligeable
Gaming : I doubt 3600x is a bottleneck. If it is, you wouldn't gain much than few %, so few fps.
Other : let's say you do some program compilation. 16 cores one side, 6 at other side, knowing that compilation is highly parallelizable, 5950x will outperform by factors the 3600x

"littlebusters","t5_2v13a","Well, lets try to explain. I love EX because while you may have to suspend your disbelief in some cases, it really takes you through the mechanics of the conjured worlds of Little Busters, and is one of a kind.

 First, Saya's route occurs during Kyousuke's world, while the other two's routes are post refrain. Also, in Little Busters, it seems when you are near death, you can make a last wish, even skipping time. Saya wandered into Kyousuke's world when she was near death, even though she was injured many years before the bus accident, (they read the same manga, and Saya snuck into Kyousuke's world as an operative or whatever she is), her wish was to love Riki. And Sasami's route is in the conjured world of her cat, near death, its wish for Sasami to meet it again. Back to Saya, Kyousuke's plan is for Riki to love Rin, and Kyousuke cant have Saya stealing him. Though, Instead of kicking Saya out of his world, he let's Saya try again and again using concepts from the manga they both read, similar to how Riki tried and failed multiple times, until Saya realizes what is going on, and is satisfied. After leaving Kyousuke's world, she goes back to her timeline, and is a kid again in a hospital after her accident. 

The ending of Little Busters is open ended however it's safe to say they are all friends now happy ever after. This was my interpretation, hopefully this all made sense : )

Also fun fact, you can see Saya, and I believe the cat too, in the background of some episodes if you pay attention. They were there the whole time.",1617235399

"Bluray","t5_2rgdr","I really liked it, I came to see giant monster fights and I was not disappointed, in my opinion the monster fights far surpasses the previous Godzilla movies, 2014 you barley saw the things and this movie has the first fight in daylight and the second in a brightly lit neon city, Godzilla KOTM had good fights but the city looked leveled before they had even started the fight, however this movie they destroyed so much of that city it was insane I loved how king jumped off buildings. I agree that although I loved to see the conclusion of the hallow earth thing it was a little outlandish for a King Kong movie (but I would never call it boring I love the scenery in that part of the film) although you have to understand this is a Godzilla movie too and those things can get pretty wacky. Mechagodzilla I had absolutely no problem with I think they made it work and feel believable in the world they set up. The human subplot was a mixed bag the acting is pretty good but the writing is questionable, it could be funny sometimes but most of the time wasn’t anything much. I’m just happy that Godzilla and King Kong are finally in a movie for the first time since 1962, maybe it’s just cause I went to the theaters for the first time since 2019 but I really enjoyed this film, not as good as skull island but I enjoyed the fights (even if they never fought all the way) I’m kind of in the middle when it comes to the whole realism thing on one hand I don’t want them to go full out Jason X style but movies are created for these types of things to see impossible things occur in our world and I think sometimes people get too invested in making the word feel like real life they end up forgetting to make it just a fun movie and at the end of the day if I had a fun time watching it I really can’t complain so yeah pretty good imo",1617235400

I  love Disney AND Lucasfilm/Star Wars but let's not pretend these big corporations *actually* give a damn about marginalized groups and minorities, they gladly removed Finn from Chinese posters to appease their racism,  and not only filmed and thanked the Chinese province that holds many uyghur camps when filming Mulan.


They don't care about trans people, or non binary, or black or white, me or you, they only care for money and that's okay, supply and demand, that's business, but lets not fool ourselves that these specific characters were inserted for any other reason than to gain more SJW points from young liberals and be praised because of how woke they are.

And all of that is ok, it's just that sometimes it's a little transparent and as i said, brakes the immersion.

There should be a collective/class action lawsuit on trump for fucking and continuing to fuck our country up.

Prison should not be enough for him, we need to rake all 1.2 - 1.6 billion dollars he made while in office and then some from his tax frauds and other white collar crimes as well as his nepotistic daughter and son in law, and friends whom also raked in hundreds of millions. He nor his family, nor friends should have benefited monetarily per the Emoluments Clause as well.

He wasn’t supposed to get a penny more then his salary. This is why we instituted the Emoluments Clause to our Constitution to prevent this from happening.

There were conflicts of interests between trump and foreign countries. They paid his hotel and campaign millions and millions of dollars to get his ear and indeed influenced him, such as with the Kashoggi case. He had Kazakhstan money flowing into his campaign as well as Saudi and more than likely many other foreign “dark monies.”

trump violated his oath of office and betrayed the American people. We need some pay back for that. We need to make trump an example to ensure that no other person holding the office of President destroys our country nor divides our country like he has done, nor helped the COVID19 commit genocide and other crimes.",1617235400

Something like 12V, 0.5A, 6W. If you add the wattage of your three fans it can't be higher than what the 4pun connector can deliver.

"OCTO","t5_2ttew","Finished the story today. Thank you for writing it! I heard about it over in /r/rational. The story itself was really interesting, and as I said over in /r/rational, lots of new ideas in it I'd never thought of.

A bit of (hopefully constructive) critique follows. Do with it whatever you want, but it's not meant to take away from the amazing work you've created. I just.. feel like getting it out there.

There were multiple times in the story where I almost dropped it, though. My ""want to continue to next chapter"" level varied wildly throughout the story. Sometimes you had set up plot threads beautifully to make me want to read on (""who's controlling the president?"", ""what was that sword, how did it work?"") and other times there was just nothing, and it felt like the MC had it all figured out (right before humans appeared).

The alternate PoVs didn't work well for me. I.. honestly didn't care about anyone except the MC and, near the end, Danielle. Everyone else was a chore to read through, simply because I didn't have a chance to grow attached to them, had no reason to care about them.

My SoD dropped many times as all these characters kept running into each other seemingly at random.

I honestly liked the story most in the beginning when it was fighting for survival, unlocking upgrades, discovering bio systems. That's what caught me as a reader and that's what I wanted more of. Then it suddenly turned into a totally different type of story. Not sure how to feel about that. The middle was a slump, then near chapter 40 I just *had* to see how it ended and was totally hooked again as the stakes kept rising.

Guess those are my thoughts for now. I really think you deserve more exposure for this work. I think you just.. need to share it a bit more from time to time, in more places. Once the first node gets cracked, things speed up. Cheers!",1617235402

My wife called my parents and brothers.  She told her parents about what I’ve been doing for years.  I guess it was sort of an intervention. I was in a bad place, totally overtaken by booze. 

I called an old sponsor, told him “i’m getting back to it”

Did virtual meetings at beginning of covid.  Stopped doing meetings but keep in touch with the people in the program I care about.  Drink NA beer occasionally.  Hit my weed pen, it’s helped me sooooo much.  

Now I’m coming up on a year.  Not one drop.  Been on work trips, a bachelor party and more, nothing for me. 

I just needed to get it out in the open I was quitting.  I found it way to easy to lie to my wife.",1617235402

In the plane, I sat next to this 20-something man that was flying home to Malaysia. We were chatting and I mentioned I had that long lay over in KL. He was being friendly and offered to go have a meal in the city to get out of the airport for a while. He seemed nice enough, so I thought why not?

His friends pick him up and there was 4 other guys with us. He told me he needed to stop over his house before we can eat and I didn't think much of it, at his house I actually met his parents and they were lovely. After, me him and his friends go to a local street food market and we had delicious Malaysian food and generally a great time. They took me back to the airport and we said our goodbyes, he gave me his email address but I must have lost it and never heard from him again.

I'm happy to have had this awesomely random adventure, but it could have gone horribly wrong. My grandmother was horrified when I told her what happened and said I could have been sex trafficked. In hindsight, yes, but I was super lucky.",1617235402

"CoronaVirusLA","t5_2guidt","It's very frustrating, and from a point of view, I can't blame them. I know people that are ""essential workers"", that can't afford to get sick, but they're not eligible for vaccines yet. They cheated to cut in line, yes, but they're protecting themselves,so they don't get sick, and care for their families. One guy, for example, single bread-winner, with a 2 small babies. He's essential to work during the pandemic, exposed to different people daily, people that refuse to wear a mask at times, but doesn't qualify for a vaccine yet. 

Long story short, he could be ethical and moral, and wait his turn, probably get sick because most people don't care, or skip in line, and protect himself and his family. I find it hard to be mad at the guy.",1617235402

On the other hand, if a buyer bought in '82 w/ a variable rate mortgage, they would have done well as interest rates dropped through the rest of the '80s.

"SafeMoon","t5_42kuwz","Honestly I think there are several factors driving the fear based responses on this sub. People don't really understand how this works, they think this'll happen overnight, and youth. I remember back in the day a buddy telling me ""Hey this Bitcoin thing is pretty cool, you can get like 20 coins for $100 right now. You should do it."" I didn't understand it so I didn't grab any. Yeah, well hindsight is 20/20. I haven't looked at crypto since, until earlier this week when another buddy said ""Hey this SafeMoon thing is pretty cool, you can get like 260 mil coins for $100 right now. You should do it."" These days I can lose $100 and not starve and I know that I have little chance of becoming filthy rich in a couple days. So what's $100 just to see what happens, just to have fun? And if it blows up how stupid would I feel when he's on a yacht and I'm still grinding?

These dips are normal for anything traded on a market. It's how it works. I've been checking daily just for kicks, but I can tell you that in the last 24 hours I didn't think about selling, my heart didn't drop at the slow whale, and I'm still having fun. At this point it's pure entertainment. Calm down, let the market do what it's supposed to. You might become a millionaire. You might not too. That's okay.",1617235403

"iguanas","t5_2swll","There are two things you have to do to make a diet your iguana can grow on: 
1.	Feed the right foods (strawberries, spinach and lettuce are all no-nos)
2.	Provide a variety of foods - it’s damn near impossible to give all the nutrients needed with just a few foods. 

I suggest having a couple leafy greens that you go back and forth between. I use mustard greens and collard greens. Then every time you go to the store or market pull up this list and grab a couple things from the staple foods list and just one thing from the occasional/treats list: 

https://ourreptileforum.com/community/threads/basic-iguana-diet-list.16276/

It’s also good to supplement with vitamins. I use the RepCal calcium in the pink tub and the vitamin mix in the blue tub. 

Finally, none of this will matter of you aren’t using the proper UV lights and changing them frequently, every 6 to 8 months. UV lights are a must. Windows block the majority of UV from the sun so putting the enclosure by a window or something won’t work. 

As far as going outside I personally don’t advise it for small iguanas. They are extremely fast when they want to be and will get away from you before you know it. You will never find an escaped small iguana. Once they are larger and easier to hold on to that is a different story. The little guys also spook a lot more easily. One thing I’ve seen people do is get a soft sided mesh enclosure and use that outdoors, with supervision of course.",1617235405

Avoid talking about a tuition fund for grand kids. That would sound discriminatory.

Biden won less counties than EVERY OTHER PRESIDENT WHO EVER WON...EVER.

Hillary even won more than him, and she lost!

So the fact that he did both of these things, won a low number of counties AND won 81 million votes must mean one thing....where he did win, he won big!

Or, like many of us believe, they cheated in 6 key swing states (more importantly 6 key cities in 6 swing states) to get enough votes to beat Trumps numbers. 

Either way, if you are stupid enough to think that i forgot about how depressed people were when they picked Biden over Sanders, Tulsi, Warren and LITERALLY everyone else on the DNC's ticket, than you are delusional.  
 Then to pair him up with the broad that dropped out after an abysmal showing at the Iowa caucus, well nothing screams dream team like a senile old man who didnt campaign at all and a woman of color who cant even get the support from other ppl of color because she spent her whole career locking them all up!

You seem to be downplaying what she went through and completely ignoring
how she feels. When you said all the things she had been doing like having a movie marathon, do puzzles and explore other hobbies you followed up by saying ""While i was at work and then i had to cook dinner"" It sounds as if you downplay her hobbies and skills just so you can tell her she isnt doing enough when recovery takes small steps and those things could be really big to her and make her really happy. It also sounds like you dont enjoy doing the saturday split clean up. To me sounds like you want all of your chores done and all of the cooking done so you can sit back and relax cause you went through a stressful or hard day at work, To me it is kinda sexist because its like you expect her to drop her trauma and emotions and clean the house all day. She is human and went through so much and it may be hard to find the motivation to do daily chores or keep up with the small things thats what depression is and its not something to 'tough out' Its a real thing that shes going through and i feel like you should be less judgemental to her hobbies.

"spikes","t5_2utkz","2cmc to ramp a land is borderline playable. Things like [[Farseek]] saw play but they could also grab non-basics of specific types.

I think for most decks that want this kind of effect, the fact that it's a creature is a negative not a positive, so this reads as a strictly worse Farseek imo. I don't *think* it will see play, but Standard is very dry on ways to get to 4 mana on T3.

This into that other new instant that draws 2 + plays an extra land on T3 is probably the easiest way to ramp in Standard with STX, so I could see that line seeing play. I think this gets you to Ultimatum a turn earlier than most currently builds, and in a pinch you can block with the 2/2 and then use the mana.

Doesn't feel terrible but it might turn out to be shit when it gets removed every time.

Edit : Totally forgot about Migration Path too. It was clunky because Cultivate is the standard, so you'd get to 5 land on T4 and then have to migration path with a mana up. This T2 is Migration Path T3, which is Ultimatum T4. It may be the most consistent way to get there. I think the only other way currently is the Elf that requires another creature, which obviously Sultai can't really do.",1617235407

&gt;	The problem with your nonsensical claim is that GRRM hasn’t said what the outcome will be, only that it will be explained

Which is why the details of how Dunk is related to Brienne currently is not canon. The fact that Brienne is descended from him *is* canon because the one person who can determine currently what is and isn’t canon has explicitly said she is. 

&gt;	there is no “factual” circumstance from which to make the argument you are making.

The fact that the *author of the story* explicitly stated it is true is a “factual circumstance” that makes it canon. I don’t know what else to say if you can’t get that. You’ve claimed over and over again these “factual claims” have to come from the text, and I’ve not only explained to you how you are wrong but have provided you a few different examples to exemplify that fact.

"LDR","t5_2rx8p","I had a similar issue not so long ago with my bf, I've been getting irritated over really petty things. He's the sweetest guy I've ever met and I just felt extremely guilty for making him feel bad. 

Now I'm not exactly sure what the issue is in your case but no matter what remember to stay calm. When you feel like you're getting angry tell him that you'll be right back, take a deep breath, try to gather your thoughts and do your best to have a calm discussion about whatever bothers you. 

When you start to lose your temper try to remember that you love your partner, that all of the negative emotions are making you say things that you wouldn't have said normally. Try to be conscious and careful while discussing difficult subjects. 

Also I feel like the general rule would be: treat him the way you'd like to be treated. Try to reverse the situation, imagine how you'd feel if you were in his shoes, when you're being insensitive with him.

Last thing: you mentioned that you've been doing it ""his way""; if it doesn't work well then maybe suggest a different approach that could work better for you?

The TOC just feels like one system after another designed to ensure that the top 30 or so programs never have to worry about competing on a level playing field with the rest of the nation. I would imagine they will fight tooth and nail to keep all bids at exclusive high-cost tournaments, since the sky would fall if online competitions continued to awards bids and open the playing field for teams that aren't elite prep schools or their public equivalents.

 Been out of the activity 10 years and for the life of me, I still don't quite understand why UK still runs this and the TOC has a monopoly on the premier championship.

"LeftistGameDev","t5_44glbt","There is no such thing as ""ANTIFA the organization"".  I used the term ""ANTIFA groups"" because that's what they actually are and what's actually been going on.  It's like the difference between talking about ""the Christians"" as 1 organization taking public action (no such thing) vs. ""Christian groups"".  There are factually many many Christian groups, who *might* pull in similar directions, or not at all actually in that case.  ANTIFA groups probably have more ideological unity than Christian groups, but YMMV.

&gt;  i'd still refrain from drawing parallels between anti fascists and white supremacists, as i'd find it misleading.

I wouldn't.  Their public actions under the cover of BLM protests seem pretty darned clear to me.  One assaults ""capitalist"" businesses.  The other assaults immigrant, brown people businesses.  ANTIFA groups co-opt BLM protests, white supremacists co-opt ANTIFA business destroying protests.  If you're not actually paying attention to *whose* business got torched, you might think ANTIFA burned up the restaurants owned by a bunch of brown people.  I don't believe that at all, because I'm paying attention.

Then of course you also have looters who are pissed off and at the same time, want some cool shit.  *Burning* all the goods in a store, is a rather different statement than *taking* all the goods in a store.  Again, it's worth paying attention to the differences.

"NewTubers","t5_2ujnz","You see, when mommy and daddy YouTube chooses to show your video, they'll do so in their mysterious ways.

I think it has a lot to do with who's been watching. What sort of demographic your video is bringing in. CTR, watch time, what else they watch. The more time in the algorithm, YouTube will know what your content is like and who it's for. I do believe subs help in this regard. And if it's already doing well, it'll push it more and see how people respond. I would think, if it pushes it more and doesn't do as well, obviously they'll stop pushing it.

Basically time, demographics, and performance would be my guess.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","A trainer for a game is a program that modifies the memory state of a game that is actively running, effectively acting as a cheat or hack. An example being that a trainer might be able to give the player infinite health by freezing player health value at 100%, or it might allow the player to run faster by changing the value saved for player move speed.  

They were originally implemented by game cracking groups to start when running a cracked (pirated) game. The word ""trainer"" was coined because it sounded less shady than ""hack."" This was during a time where PCs were still an uncommon thing for your average person to own and movies such as *War Games,* *Tron,* and *Short Circuit* were made, so the word ""hack"" was associated with thermonuclear war and domestic terrorism. 

These days, a trainer will often be a separate program that is ran alongside a game, and are no longer exclusive to cracked or pirated games.",1617235410

“If COVID–19 played a role in the death, this condition should be specified on the death certificate. In many cases, it is likely that it will be the [underlying cause of death], as it can lead to various life-threatening conditions, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),” the guidance says. “In these cases, COVID-19 should be reported on the lowest line used in Part I with the other conditions to which it gave rise listed on the lines above it.”

The CDC advises that officials should report deaths in which the patient tested positive for COVID-19 — or, if a test isn’t available, “if the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.” It further indicates that if a “definitive diagnosis cannot be made … but it is suspected or likely … it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate as ‘probable’ or ‘presumed.'”",1617235411

Opportunities: The Contract, The Greatest Airlift

Blue Sky Airlines, one of the first in China, was a forgotten yet critically important company in Chinese history that served the Republic of China well in its darkest years. It was founded in 1931, in Nanking by Chinese-British aeronautics engineer Chen Liren.

Chen, born into the upper crust of Shanghai Chinese society, studied in Britain as an engineer. While studying there, he worked with and became fascinated by aircraft during the first World War. After the war, he worked for the de Havilland company, and acquired expertise that would aid him greatly in the future.

Upon hearing of the founding of the Republic of China in 1925, Chen, a firm believer in the Republic’s revolutionary and nationalist ideals, returned to China in hopes of applying his unique knowledge to help develop his homeland. There, he founded the National Aeronautic Society, and was provided a modest grant to develop China’s first air fleets. With the help of foreign and indigenous talent and hard work, he was able to acquire a small fleet of obsolete transports, such as the Junkers F.13, and the Avro 618 Ten and found the Blue Sky Airlines. In the years before the Second Sino-Japanese War, the airline closely cooperated with the central government and performed cargo and military transport/evacuation services. Notably, the line’s pilots transported wounded men during the Republic’s battles against the communists, and transported military supplies from the Soviet Union.

When the Japanese invasion came in 1937, Blue Sky provided invaluable support for the Chinese and later Allied war effort. As Japan brutally advanced into the country, the company was forced to relocate deeper into China’s interior. Losses were horrific; hundreds of employees would be killed in aerial and ground attacks, including Chen himself. During the terrible early years of the war, the occupation of China’s coast and the closure of roads to the outside world made spare parts and fuel extremely difficult to come by. Yet, despite the hardships, the brave men and women of the company served on with pride, airlifting valuable Lend-Lease supplies from British India over the Himalayan mountains (nicknamed “the Hump”) into war-torn China. The company’s pilots, despite their outdated aircraft, weathered Japanese attacks with the help of Allied escorts.

After the second World War, the company began picking the pieces back together and returned to civilian service, but only for a short while. Just a year after the war, the civil war erupted again between the Chinese communists and the Republic. As the Red Tide overran all of China, only a fraction of the airfleet managed to escape to Taiwan, with the majority of its aircraft and personnel being captured by the communists. By 1950, the company would be effectively dissolved; those that escaped would be absorbed into other companies, while the remnants in the mainland would serve the People’s Liberation Air Force.",1617235412

"AskAChristian","t5_2s79d","Kids are not like that.

Hell (“Sheol” and “Hades” in the Bible’s original languages) is simply the grave, not a place of fiery torment. Who go to hell? Both good people and bad people. (Job 14:13; Psalm 9:​17) The Bible says that this common grave of mankind is “the house of meeting for everyone living.”​—Job 30:23.

All those who go to hell will come back out, brought to life by Jesus through God’s power. (John 5:​28, 29; Acts 24:15) Speaking of that future resurrection, the prophecy at Revelation 20:13 says that “death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them.” (King James Version) Once hell has been emptied, it will no longer exist; no one will ever go there again because “death will be no more.”​—Revelation 21:​3, 4; 20:14.

Not everyone who dies goes to hell, though. The Bible shows that some people become so steeped in wickedness that they are beyond repentance. (Hebrews 10:26, 27) When such ones die, they go, not to hell, but to Gehenna, which is a symbol of everlasting destruction. (Matthew 5:​29, 30) For example, Jesus indicated that some of the hypocritical religious leaders in his day would go to Gehenna.​—Matthew 23:27-​33.

Even Jesus went to hell when he died. However, “he was not kept in hell,” because God resurrected him.​—Acts 2:​31, 32, The Bible in Basic English.

Those who wanted to become Christians in the first century came from various backgrounds and lifestyles, and some of them made significant lifestyle changes. For example, the Bible speaks of “those who are sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, men who submit to homosexual acts,” and then it adds: “That is what some of you were.”—1 Corinthians 6:9-11.

In saying “that is what some of you were,” does the Bible mean that those who stopped engaging in homosexual acts never again experienced any homosexual desires? That could hardly be the case, because the Bible also exhorts: “Keep walking by spirit and you will carry out no fleshly desire.”—Galatians 5:16.

Note that the Bible does not say that a Christian will never experience an improper desire. Rather, it says that he or she will choose not to carry out that desire. Christians learn to bring such desires under control, not dwelling on them to the point of acting on them.—James 1:14, 15. 

The Bible thus makes a distinction between inclinations and practices. (Romans 7:16-25) A person who has homosexual leanings can control what he allows his mind to dwell on, just as he would control any other wrong desire, including leanings toward anger, adultery, and greed.—1 Corinthians 9:27; 2 Peter 2:14, 15.",1617235412

China cannot secure trade through the Taiwan straights, the straights of malacca, or the Arabian Sea. Without the United States guarantee of merchant shipping, trade would stop at what China calls the first island chain. India alone can decide China gets no oil from the Persian gulf and it will be so and there is nothing anyone can do about it but the United States, who has no reason to do so. The Southeast Asia island nations will find unguarded Chinese oil tankers easy and profitable prey. As will East African nations. 

Further, the Chinese economy will collapse before a deep water fleet can even begin construction.

Unfortunately, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):

**Rule 3: Spread Posts and Interpretation Help Guidelines**

Incomplete 'Spread Posts' and 'Interpretation Help Posts' are limited to the [Weekly Reading and Interpretation Help Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/tarot/about/sticky?num=1), which can also be found pinned to the top of r/tarot, as always.

Spread Posts are considered complete when the user provides and in-depth break down of the spread as well as their own interpretation (and in the case of Interpretation Help, is asking only for a second opinion).

**Spread Posts must include the following** in either in a comment, or in the body of a text post:

* An explanation of the spread being used.

* The question being asked or intention for the reading

* An interpretation of each card, in the context of the spread/position and in regards to the question. 

* All images of decks and spreads must include the **Deck Name, The Deck Creator(s) and or the Artist(s)**.

Spread posts of any kind are **limited to one every 7 days**. 

'Spread Posts' include, but are not limited to, all posts sharing spreads, including personal, client or general readings, as well as requests for assistance with a reading you have given or received, tarot related dreams you have experienced, or cards your have found on the ground.

This rule **does not prohibit** broader discussion-focused posts on the general meaning of specific cards, sharing spread designs (blank spreads) or the nature of tarot itself.

Then just upgrade the CPU, motherboard, RAM, you can most likely keep the 750W, the watts are more than enough to whichever CPU you get, it just depends on how the PSU survived and how good it is. And that's extremely good for you considering the GPU situation right now, they all pretty much doubled to tripled in price, even old ones in the last months.

As to which CPU to get specifically, I'm not sure but you can easily check for your self if you don't get persuaded by suggestions here, check benchmarks online, specifically in single core performance and compare with price. ryzen 5600x I heard should have a strong single core performance, so I guess that's my off the top of my head suggestion for you if you upgrade only for gaming even more so if only for gw2.

Otherwise I would probably suggest a stronger CPU with more cores if you want to use for things other than gaming, and for more future viability, then in the future you can always just drop in a new GPU if you want to once prices return to normal.",1617235413

Hi /u/ohiowifejenn!


Your submission was removed per Rule 4:

&gt;####RULE #4 - NO UNVERIFIED OC

&gt;* Do not post yourself unless you are prepared to verify with us.

&gt;* Don't post or claim to know someone in the photo unless you can verify permission to post the photo.

&gt;* Don't post someone you know from Facebook or Instagram or any other social media platform. If we find out, it violates this rule.

`A.  You are actually the MILF in this photo`

#**-or-**

`B. You can verify that you have the MILF's permission to post this photo.`

**Any further submissions by you, without verification, will result in a ban.**

---

#**[\*\*READ THE FULL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS HERE\*\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/milf/wiki/verification)**

#Verification must follow these simple rules:

Please provide `3+` photos of your nude/semi-nude body from `3` different angles, holding a paper sign with your user name, today's date, and /r/milf written on it.

* The paper should be crumpled and smoothed, yet still readable.

* Your hand(s) should be visible holding the sign.

* Shoot the pics from as wide an angle as you can manage. Photos cropped in close will be rejected.

The photo does not have to be artsy or fully nude, but semi-nude is the minimum. If we can't match the body depicted in your verification pictures to the body in your past and future posts, then it's not a meaningful verification. So while you do not have to post your face, we do need to see a good amount of your nude/semi-nude body.

Thank you for your cooperation!

"lexapro","t5_31mz6","I’m on week 9 of 10 mg and while I’ve had minor relief from anxiety, I don’t feel much help with my depression. I’m also pretty tired and have little motivation to do anything - I think the Lexapro has made me care about everything less (which is good for the anxiety) but that has caused me to also not have much desire to do fun activities or take initiative in my studies. 

I asked my doc about adding Wellbutrin but she said since I have anxiety, it would make it worse because it’s a stimulant - yet I see many people on Lex that have great success with it so I’m frustrated. Instead, she wanted to up me to 15 mg. 

Anyway, I’m feeling torn on what to do or say to her as I haven’t found the level of relief I’m looking for. Any advice? Is it too soon to tell/should I give 10mg another month before changing anything? How long before you felt Lex fully working?",1617235414

And died in my arms while I promised her I was taking her to the vet again and she'd be fine like last time. It was true. I didn't care if it was meaningless. My family helped me carry her into the car and placed her on my lap while I had to pretend that she was going to be fine, because she was so smart she'd knew if I had cried there. But she died before my mom started the car. But I know I didn't fail her. And it's been over two years and I still hurt and haven't gotten over it.

I watched ""Binky Rules"" the other night, and even though I've always enjoyed it and its follow-up episode for nostalgia reasons, I heard some blatant misogyny in the dialogue that I can't un-hear.

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","When I do ability checks, I determine how brutal or awesome their success or failure from a role playing or description point is against the DC. So if it’s a DC15 and they get a 17 I describe it as being a very close call in disarming the trap and they were able to remove the lynch pin right before it activated the acid splash. If they are way off and roll a 3 I describe in more detail their epic failure when attempting to vault over the brick wall in an attempt to ambush someone, likely giving the enemy an advantage. Or if they get over a 20 I describe in greater detail, almost like a John Wu slow motion cut scene, the way they were able to complete that acrobatic escape through the window of the burning building (that their artificer likely caused with his Eldritch Cannon). It’s not quite the same as Nat 1s and 20s in combat encounters.",1617235416
"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Yup. I like the movie The Men who stare at Goats which talks about the Barney song and sort of gets into CIA psychological warfare. But then I discovered that the CIA is embedded in Hollywood and that movie is potentially a form of psychological warfare aimed at viewers 
 to downplay the more scary things they do.

Even this story works the same way.

The CIA owns the media. The US government made propaganda against Americans legal back in like 2013 but they run stories through foreign press outlets which then gets filtered back to US viewers. In this case, they're running it through the CBC as almost a fluff article.

CBC used to make really good documentaries about war, propaganda, and subversion until they got taken over about a decade ago. Now they just shill for the military industrial complex like the rest of them.

Songs like the Barney theme or the Meow Mix commercial are annoying. These stories don't really get into the worse aspects like waterboarding, torture, in some cases, murder. That doesn't  even get into their daily ops like overthrowing governments, coups, proxy wars, etc...",1617235416

She told me her friend randomly suggested it, but my half-sis has demonstrated to me she isn't the mist trust worthy, so IDK.

Those are fine, perfectly typical and common ways to raise funds and redistribute - but like the title says, there is no fundamental change here.

Adding new levers is important, because today’s fundamental structural change, even if marginal in scope, allows for a much greater one in the future. A modest wealth tax establishing itself today could be a massive one down the road.

I don’t think anyone can argue the Biden Admin at this point isn’t turning up the dials more than the Obama admin did, they are cognizant of the previous admin’s failings to a degree.

There’s just so much missed opportunity in expanding the toolkit in a once in a generation opportunity to do so. Even if the degree were sufficient (it’s not even close), it would still sting that we aren’t expanding the horizon of possibility.",1617235417

A few people who were previously in a Subreddit Chat before reddit shut those down have joined the server to help me test it out and learn how it all works.

My plan is to have a set of private channels for each region (NW, NE, Central, SW, and SE) to start with. Each user can only join one of these regions at a time and won't be able to change their region once they pick one. I am hoping that having some private groups will foster a stronger sense of community and help people feel more comfortable sharing information. There will be trading channels where selling and swapping is permitted but I plan to forbid Fireball (raffle sale) style crap and am not real keen on enabling another secondary marketplace for flippers. I haven't settled on a final set of rules for this so input is welcome.

There will also be public channels for each category of liquor and a general and off-topic channel.

I'm still trying to choose which bot I want to use to allow users to self-assign their region to get access to the private channels and help with automatic moderation.

It sounds like you're trying to suggest Hazard was more susceptible and no matter who it was that went in hard on that ankle would break it in the same way? Which is far more of a reach and way more difficult to prove. No evidence for deteriorating condition or higher susceptibility to long term problems.

Sanitas has very little say beyond diagnosing the problem and trying to treat it without sending player to specialists. They can't stop anyone training or trying to get back on the pitch. Many a time players stopped training under phantom pains/low pain threshold in previous several years.

Bannon clearly based this on the [1999 Italian book ""Q"" by the Luther Blissett Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(novel)) which spells out exactly what he was doing incredibly well.

Our security genius unfortunately used the password ""Matlock"" and it appears  J&amp;R Dawkins were able to crack and take over the identity and moved it to 8Chan (which they own) largely for their own financial benefit.

The Q takeover corresponds to the change in writing style that was identified along with excessive use of exclamation marks etc.

They flat out refused to draw from any of the old EU material, despite there being vast quantities of ideas that could have been used or recycled and given new life that would have satisfied old fans desire to feel catered to, and also been just as entertaining for new or non diehards. They wanted to make flashy, Marvel style, entertainment with a Star Wars skin over it, rather than make something worthy of the name. Rian Johnson had some interesting ideas, and they were more Star Wars than the entirety of the two Abrams movies put together. Was The Last Jedi perfect? No. But it could have been part of a much better trilogy, with vision, and good concepts, had Disney not dropped the ball in their rush to milk their new property.",1617235421

""Reporting a loss in Griezmann's books would be bad for the club because we would be forced to reduce our budget ""

&amp;#x200B;

My only problem with your comments is that this is false. Selling an asset for less than it's book value means that you need to book a loss on your income statement, but this is a \*\*\*non-cash charge\*\*\*. Booking this expense is only a loss on paper because no money changes hands. It is purely accounting and doesn't change anything to our budget, our debt or the money we have in our accounts.

To service debt what matters isn't your net income (which would be reduced by selling Griezmann at a book loss), but your free cash flows. 

The only way making this loss could influence anything is through FFP (or taxes but that's a different story), but I have alredy covered that in my first message.

&amp;#x200B;

If something is unclear I can explain further (and I'd be happy to do it !) but I'm 100% certain this is how the accounting works.",1617235421

"Transmedical","t5_uh8xj","Yes! I actually see this quite a bit! Marriage is less common, but I think that's because a lot of trans people are actually on a different timeline than cis people due to the social changes that tend to come with being trans. For example, I know trans men in IT, programming, social services, and psych services outside of social work. The main thing though is all these people are very stealth. I for example have a full time job in social services but am totally stealth in the workplace. Additionally, 90-95% of my friends are cis, majority bi or straight. The main partner I've been seeing is a cis gay man, and my trans male friend exclusively dates straight women pretty much. Also, a majority I know want kids. 

I understand that for some people since being trans has affected so much of their life they don't want to have to hide it. And that's totally fine! It can get tiring being stealth sometimes. But actually a majority of trans men I know are actually stealth, straight or bi, and have very successful relationships (sadly I only know a couple trans women so I won't speak for them cause I don't know enough!) 

As someone who is very much male and majority stealth, I still run into problems because I can't seem to separate my trans identity from myself in relationships and it makes me feel weird or have low self esteem. I'm also not the most masculine person, though if I like anything feminine it's because I like it, not some bs I get told about it ""connecting me to pretransition"" or whatever. And that I think is what makes things harder, more due to the view society has of men who let themselves be seen with typically feminine interests. But that's a personal issue. It is DEFINITELY possible to lead a typical life, and I've seen it many times firsthand!",1617235421

&gt; The Susurluk scandal (Turkish: Susurluk skandalı, Susurluk kazası) was a scandal involving the close relationship among the deep state in Turkey, the Grey Wolves and the Turkish mafia. It took place during the peak of the Kurdish–Turkish conflict, in the mid-1990s. The relationship came into existence after the National Security Council (NSC) posited the need for the marshaling of the state's resources to combat the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).

&gt; The scandal surfaced with a car–truck collision on 3 November 1996, near Susurluk, in the province of Balıkesir. The victims included the deputy chief of the Istanbul Police Department, a Member of Parliament, and Abdullah Çatlı, the leader of the Grey Wolves and a contract killer for the National Intelligence Organization (Turkey) (MİT), who was on Interpol's red list at the time of his death.

"GenshinImpactTips","t5_36s8hb","Thing is diona matches better with keqing for superconduct and xingqui is better with diluc for constant vaporize.  

At AR45 with your characters, you can realistically be beating all of abyss 9-12 with over 30 stars. You just need to build team right.  You do need a better healer for second team though. Xingqui is not enough unless you have insane dps and dodging skills, but since you're already having trouble with domains which are child's play compared to abyss, that's not likely.

Big damage comes from reactions, not individual talents. Remember that.  For example, converting a 10k hit from diluc into a 20k hit from a reaction is worth as much as proccing a 2k hit 5 times.  

Sure, keqing can maybe cause xingquis swords to hit a few more times, but it's wasted compared to extra output from vaporize.

Similarly, diona giving superconduct can boost keqings physical damage significantly.  Much more than the little bit extra gained from extra rain swords, assuming you focus your artifacts and talents on your main dps.",1617235422

On France 24 last week there was a discussion on the treatment of the Uighurs and the Chinese journalist who was defending Chinese policies from her apartment in Vancouver, twice made woke leaning statements.

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

Hi Miguelzinho2021, as a spam prevention measure we don't allow certain accounts to submit things to /r/AmongUs. 
Your account needs to meet both the following requirements:
- The account must be at least 7 days old
- The account must have at least 150 comment karma
- Please note that comment karma is not the same thing as total karma. Even if you have over 150 total karma, you 
    still might not have enough comment karma.

To view your current accumulated karma, please visit your profile page:
- On the web, your profile page at https://old.reddit.com/user/Miguelzinho2021 and it will be displayed in the 
    upper right corner.
- On all other platforms (new.reddit.com, mobile web, and app) your karma is not broken out into their 
    component Post and Comment values, so you only see the total amount. You must use old.reddit.com.

This is situational. 9S is a great pvp unit and is a lightning elemental. He's gonna be free like Tidus. I'm sure that means you can choose to spend 30k to get him to 120 if you so choose.

2B is really good, a wind element ""samurai"". If you have a lot of evade cards/gear, go for it. If not...maybe doesn't bring TOO much to your team.

Both units are robot type, funny enough. Gonna be unequipping Odin and Bahamut perhaps during that collab.

It's beautiful, and the weather is great, and there are lots of things to do. That's why I came here.   


One downside is that the job market sucks unless you're in certain industries. I find that a larger percentage of employers here would prefer to pay less for someone who is not so good, rather than find someone with experience and skills and pay them fairly. (Not all, it's just more common here and it can get exhausting after a while.)    


Even if you find yourself in a ""good"" industry here (like hospitality) and it doesn't affect your income, it will affect many of your friends' incomes. I'd say 80% of the friends I've made since coming to Miami now live somewhere else, mostly because they realized they can make 50% more somewhere else and also have a lower cost of living. (On the plus side of that, I have exactly 1 ex-boyfriend still living in Miami, so my odds of running into one of them are extremely low lol).   


You also have terrible drivers (and high insurance rates), plus a lot of people are just rude.   


I don't regret moving here, but I am ready to go now. (Have been ready for several years... just took me a while to figure out where to go next.) If you like it here, then don't worry about what other people say. Stay until you're ready to go.",1617235425

If accountability really was the goal then criminal charges would be the way to go. So if your reason why he isn’t going to the authorities is because he’s trying to maximize the damages he can collect for his clients, then this goes back to being a possible money grab. 

Watson’s team has already admitted that he had consensual sexual relations with other massage therapists, so even if it’s 1,000 therapists - the real question is whether the acts were consensual or not. By not going to the cops Buzbee’s claims lose credibility. Did Watson try to fuck a lot of massage therapists? Yeah. I think most people will agree with that. But did he do stuff without their consent? That’s the real question and if he really did do stuff without their consent filing criminal charges is what Buzbee and his clients would do. Not only is what they should do, but he specifically said he would and then changed his mind.

"Ubiquiti","t5_2ub3z","Lol that's funny. The bugs are indeed that only thing constant.

Ya unfortunately it might be more of a hardware problem. PPPoE is very CPU intensive and only uses a single core, so usually ISP routers that use PPPoE have hardware offloaders for PPPoE encryption/decryption so they don't need a powerful CPU. The UDMP doesn't have any special hardware for that and uses the CPU, which limits the PPPoE performance severely due to single-core performance. 

Apparently the ones who designed the UDM/P didn't think they needed hardware offloaders but then thought they should advertise it with 10 Gbps performance and PPPoE support, but didn't think they should mention speeds with PPPoE are limited to 0.7-1.2 Gbps. Some would say this is false advertising.",1617235426

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","So you've been living with him since you were under eighteen...I don't care if it is legal in whatever state you are in a 31-year-old should not be dating a 17-year-old. Please get out of this relationship and focus on yourself, you have clearly been through a lot and your mental well being is the most important thing. He has groomed you, is most likely going to manipulate you and in a few years, you will want an out but would have become too reliant on him. Do not go and break up with him.",1617235426
