"Hawaii","t5_2qi3u","Ah.  A condition of my employment at my job requires a satisfactory driving record.  Last year, I got pulled over for using the HOV lane solely on a Wednesday at 3:30 pm on the H-1 westbound approaching Aloha Stadium.  The HOV citation summoned a court hearing.  However, I contacted a lawyer who said he could reduce the HOV violation to a parking ticket, which is a non-moving violation.  His services didn't cost that much for what it was worth, and he represented me in court without me having to attend.

On another note, I wouldn't have utilized the HOV lane solely during peak hour if traffic on the H-1 isn't that stupid.  I understand that Hawaii isn't the only state that has an HOV lane, but the traffic flow on the H-1 freeway is absolutely stupid, especially because of the unreasonably slow speed limit, stupid traffic lights choking up the off-ramps, left lane loafers (especially large commercial vehicles), and stingy motorists who refuse to allow other motorists to merge or change lanes.  I have almost never seen anything like it in the mainland.  And it has nothing to do with the land size or population.",1685577600.0

"linux","t5_2qh1a","It kind of makes sense when you consider that `int *p` means ""the value pointed at by `p` (meaning `*p`) is of type `int`"".

Was that a good idea? Maybe, maybe not, but it is what it is. Thinking of the `type` being the type of whatever comes after it has helped me understand the pointer syntax better. I still don't like it, but at least I can read it.",1685577600.0

I was absolutely burning with rage but of course I had to politely explain what was going on (even though it was NONE of their fucking business) because I'm not trying to get jumped in a club or shot outside in a parking lot.

What makes the whole thing even worse is that I'm 99% sure those dudes were straight, as I saw them later in the night circling the dance floor and trying to chat up the drunk women. Literal human vultures. So these straight dudes showed up at a freaking gay club to hit on women who are literally at the gay club to avoid that sort of interaction to begin with, then they have the audacity to talk shit to me when I'm comforting a friend?

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","This wouldn‚Äôt be my first rodeo with hiring an attorney for violating a federal right. Previously (granted it was an ADA violation) I was told once they have more than 15 employees you‚Äôre held to the EEOC & ADA. And according to Google, I‚Äôm no lawyer:
 An employer must follow the strictest child labor laws, state or federal. To determine which law the employer of
employees over the age of 17 is covered by, an employer that grosses over $500,000.00 per year or is engaged in interstate
commerce is subiect to both federal and
state wage and hour law . An employer that
grosses less than $500,000.00 per year and is not engaged in interstate commerce
but has four (4) or more employees is
subject to the state wage and hour laws.

With that said, my understanding is they would be held to federal law as it is the strictest. (& I could be wrong, if you think I am, I‚Äôm open to hearing that)",1685577601.0

"EMDR","t5_3bj8w","For the aftercare, pretty much what others have already said. Make sure there's easy food, water, and maybe a comfort show (or whatever works for you) waiting. 

Really, though, how the session ends is usually the biggest part of how it's going to affect me immediately afterwards. I'm assuming you're not getting a full close on whatever target you're working on (perfectly normal), and in those cases having some kinda closing routine helps me a *lot.*

It'll vary a bit depending on what you're working on & what works for you personally, so you may need to experiment a bit, but I typically get a lot of mileage out of using a placeholder ""positive cognition."" Basically zeroing in on *any* positive aspect of the session (usually something like ""I know more than I did before; I'm figuring this out"") and then ""installing"" that (focus on that and only that and use very short sets of BLS; don't want to bridge to anything, just reinforce the sense of whatever positive thing you can find). 

Dissociated parts can make things complicated in all kinds of directions, so if that's a big factor then I can't really give solid advice, but early on mine did generally settle a bit easier if I also reinforced the idea that I'd be coming back again to work on this stuff & they weren't just gonna get shoved down into the dark and ditched again. 

Again, though, it might take some experimenting. Especially if structural dissociation is a major factor, because that's often a lot like trying to calm a very small child who can't directly communicate what's wrong. I kinda have to just keep making educated(? ish) guesses until I get it right.

Edit: oop, just re-read and saw that you mentioned internal systems specifically, so that's definitely a factor. My bad.",1685577601.0

"AskOldPeople","t5_2yg69","I recently entered a Fight Breast Cancer basketball free throw contest at the municipal recreation center with 10 $10 sponsors. The Ford dealership was matching all monies made by competitors and provided a trophy. 

A bunch of people entered and were terrible Finally a young man with a lot of family and friends cheering him on sank 16. I went next and drained my 18th at the buzzer. There was one last person after me, and expecting that trophy I began preparing a short thank you speech. 

The last shooter, a thin teenaged woman squinting through glasses at the basket  stood at the foul line and waited for the whistle. I watched her first shot rim out, combed my hair for the photographer and polished up my thank you speech. 

Then I started counting her baskets 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 (bounced around but dropped in) 15, 16 (I began jumping and cheering her on) 17, 18, 19, 20 BUZZER!

The recreation center burst into applause, whistles and cheers! I was VERY happy for her! HUMBLED by a 13 year old! When I high fived and congratulated her, she apologized, ‚ÄòSorry Mister.‚Äô  ‚ÄúNo. Don‚Äôt be sorry! You were awesome!‚Äù

"magicbuilding","t5_30kv1",">frankly, this is a strange request, you're asking for how one   
accomplishes a task that poses no relevance to the provided systems, and  
 yet i gave you two examples where the systems can be applied for this   
task, and ended it with the clarification that repairing armor is as it   
always is, you repair armor like you would in reality;  
 i do not know the process of repairing armor in real life, nor is it   
information that i need to know as of yet, because my focus is on these   
systems

ehh I think that this has rather a lot of relevance, since it would show how your magic system exactly works, because as of now I dont know how it works. Your explanation simply boils down to ""use mana"", which is very ... open. Not that it is a problem, but I think that just shows where your magic system stands atm. Again, I am not trying to confuse you here or anything, I just really wanna understand how your magic *works.* Think of Harry Potter, which has a very open system. You need to use a wand, and cite a magic spell, and then you have your armor repaired. That is very open (and it works), and if your system works similiarly, then its fine too. I was just expecting a bit more depth due to the sheer mass of your system. 

Back to the example you could provide, I strictly am not asking for cybernetics or magitech because I want to experience the other side of you system that solely relies on the magical parts of your system. Also, the process of repairing armor irl was just an example from me to clarify how I want it explained, just a metaphor if you want. You should just describe it to me in a very detailed way, because your prior explanations were only vague. If you are not comfortable with the example of repairing a piece of armor, then show me how I would light a candle, or choose something else. Just give me details. Thought that repairing a piece of armor could be rather interesting since it can get quite tricky for some systems, but seems like I wasnt clear enough, whatever no problem.

Edit: and if you cant repair armor outside of technological applications, then thats a legitimate answer too. I just dont know where the systems limits lie, which is why I am asking for this specific example.",1685577601.0

My ex called my parents and all of my siblings before everything completely blew up. Most of them knew he was full of shit or refused to even talk to him about me. Almost 10 years later, though, he's still in contact with my dad who I've been NC with this whole time.

It's always a good idea to check any above number(s) on [a carrier lookup tool](https://freecarrierlookup.com/) ([click here](https://800forall.com/SearchWhoOwns.aspx) for a toll-free lookup tool) before calling them to avoid calling a legitimate business, residential number, or private cell number. To do this, lookup the phone number on the carrier lookup and look at the results. If the results says that the number belongs to a residential carrier (ex. AT&T/""Cingular Wireless"", Verizon Wireless, Metro PCS, Rogers, etc.), *DO NOT* call the number. If the post is still up, please report the post so a mod can remove it to prevent innocent people from receiving these calls.

My point wasn‚Äôt so much that I used to live WAY OUT in the boonies so much as to say that yes distant commutes are just part of life in Maine in a way they aren‚Äôt down here. I used to get up at the ass-crack of dawn to drive that 25 minutes from the backside of Clifton to Bangor to then load up a shop truck and drive it an hour and a half to two hours to be wherever the heck we were working that day by 7 in the morning, work until 3, and do the whole commute in reverse. Maybe drive the hour or so out to Franklin to see my dad on the weekend, or if I want to visit close friends they probably still live a half hour or so away‚Ä¶

You just get so used to the saddle-time it‚Äôs almost second nature. I literally don‚Äôt feel right in the morning unless I just get up and drive SOMEWHERE, be it a trip to Dunk‚Äôs or a quick row through the gears up 190 to Rt 2 and back (if I go that far though I start feeling guilty about not going to the gym).

Meanwhile I have my wife shit the other day because she went 2 minutes to CVS to pick up the things we needed in the moment because she refused to drive the 4 minutes to Stop and Shop to get the things we needed for the day‚Ä¶

Your cholesterol surely shot up, but it would take heroic amounts of oat milk to have the slightest difference.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","One thing that I've learned from League that I have applied IRL is the fact that people who speak the loudest usually are the most wrong. Most people who preach about being nice to their teammates, preach about communication and teamwork are usually the people who make wrong calls and be 200% passive aggressive about literally anything. This is because these guys put themselves on a pedestal thinking that they're all better than everyone and that they have risen above this toxicity when in reality they have not, and these players generally play utility champs (tanks, supports, etc.) so they overestimate the ""teamwork"" factor because they think their champions can't do anything by themselves. I would much rather have a 12 year old calling me a dog than have these players on my team because their ego causes them to maintain a ""nice"" facade and stops them from following any calls or behave predictably (so we can play around their predictable behaviors), leading to a real hard game because these guys care more about ""being nice"" to each other rather than winning.

The best players/people to have around are humble mfs who legit only type 3 things: gj, mb and gg, and everything else can be communicated through pings. These people, unlike the moral compass wannabe mfs, know that they are flawed and have experienced toxicity enough to realize that toxicity is innate and almost noone is above it, so the best they can do is to not contribute to it. League is not real life, every game we have the benefit of anonymity to be the most toxic pos and you can bet on human nature that people will love to start pointing fingers the moment things go wrong. Every time I play with low elo friends (like real low, like silver low) who preaches about how ""people should be nicer to each other in game"" they make the most subhuman asinine calls and be passive aggressive to the random on the team (if there is one) about why they aren't being ""cooperative"" and at this point I've given up on trying to change them because they fail to realize that they are imperfect just like everyone else.

If you're the 1% of people who are genuinely nice and enjoy conversing your (wrong) ideas to the people you play with (because let's face it, even Challenger players make mistakes, who are we to say that our calls are always correct), good on you, but you're still getting muted because I'd rather not be influenced by wrong calls. And even I have limits.

yea, the presta valve really throws me off because there isn't a removable valve core. The mechanic at the shop was  confident he had converted it to tubeless, and pointed to a big pile of tubes in a bin and was like 'see?', so at the time didn't question him. 

Upon bringing the bike home I looked at the bike and the presta valves without the valve core and was like ' huh, no... those don't look tubeless'. Either way, I'm very new to this so just trying to figure it out.

I guess the easiest way would be to go back to the shop with the bike and ask, and if not get them to convert it to tubeless for me.",1685577604.0

"Jujutsufolk","t5_47rbe5","Tldr; (this came out really long by accident), Kaori‚Äôs probably really strong still since she has most of Kenjaku‚Äôs best weapons, but we don‚Äôt know what weaknesses she could have.

How strong Kaori is is actually a super good question. Kenjaku was pretty reliant on gravity for both offence and defence against Yuki and Choso, so even though it has one move it‚Äôs an extremely potent move. She should still know Reverse and such, so she‚Äôd be able to heal a few hits that gravity doesn‚Äôt catch. The real kicker is that it‚Äôs highly unlikely Kaori‚Äôs domain would be in any way inferior to Kenjaku in Geto‚Äôs body, since they revolve around the same technique, I doubt Kenjaku who‚Äôs 1K years old only learned barrierless domains 15 or less years ago. With that alone she could probably beat Yuki, since Kenjaku believed that without Tengen a domain battle between him and Yuki was a sure win and the fight was over the second he opened it, which is a fair assessment.

Her strength depends on a couple unknowns though. The main one being if Kenjaku does have a fourth CT like Yuki theorised he did, if so it probably came from the body before Kaori so she‚Äôd be even stronger, though if it came from a later body she‚Äôs stuck with just Gravity (although it‚Äôs possible Kaori‚Äôs body would have a technique Kenjaku got rid of to save space when he got Geto‚Äôs body). The other major one is Kaori‚Äôs CE supply, using a barrierless domain and constant reversed curse techniques is probably really expensive CE wise, she might end up with low endurance if she has low CE. Lastly her physical specs are unknown in case she has to get into a fist fight, but with Kenjaku‚Äôs experience and the fact that she‚Äôs a sorcerer which means her body‚Äôs probably pretty strong, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a big deal.",1685577605.0

"Yellowjackets","t5_j07gx","i have a loose theory that the yellowjackets haven't quite worked out what ""it"" wants from them when they pull cards. obviously we'll see how the cards function in relation to the actual roles in the hunt in further seasons, but i think it's more complicated and layered than what has been shown so far.

i think the king is more likely the actual sacrifice (this is a matriarchal almost all-female group. it would make sense if the KING was the one to be picked off.), and the queen is who ""it"" chooses as the next antler queen. i   think there's some significance to the intended prey also having to wear jackies necklace for the hunt, as if pulling the queen isn't really enough of a qualifier.

if i had to guess, i would say shauna's time as antler queen is arriving and she will pass the mantle to callie, or callie is the next antler queen and the cards were trying to use shauna to convey that.

i have a feeling that the line lottie says about the first born queens killing the others has significance in relation to the cards (it's SO not coincidence they're using the QUEEN card) and the hierarchy within the group.

do you think the other cards carry meanings as well? if following the chess rules, what would the other card numbers represent in terms of game pieces?",1685577606.0

"Banking","t5_2r392","You'd probably need to talk to a tax law expert, and possibly a historian, on why the tax law doesn't provide room for an offset account. 

According to investopedia, it's because the IRS doesn't allow you to offset interest earned with interest paid, you have to do both separately. Why it's that way, you probably won't find out here, maybe ask on the accounting or econ subreddits. You could read the IRS laws and brochure on mortgage interest deductions, but it probably will not go into why. 

As for why it's not changed, in the US mortgages are incentivized through other methods in the tax law, so there's likely not been any movement to make changes.",1685577607.0

"CatAdvice","t5_2sn56","Well I hope the vet is a good one. Some of them will just make up their mind on the spot and say it's not worth the effort because it will probably not have a good outcome. However if they test the kitten for all of the viruses it could have, some of them are fatal and there's just nothing that anyone can do and we usually would euthanize it immediately as to not extend it's suffering any longer than necessary But I call BS on the Vet's that you can tell just don't want to put in the effort, every time because I've saved so many kittens and puppies who were so sick that everyone was convinced that I was nuts in trying to save them but in the practice that I spent most of my career i had the option in situations like that. I would go into the Animal Hospital I worked for on my days off and after hours and Sundays and holidays etc.. I really invested myself into those little ones who were so bad off. That was hard though, really hard when my best efforts ending in the worst outcome but that's what we do. It's no wonder that the occupation of a Veterinary Proffesional has the largest suicide rate of any other profession. If you don't mind me asking where do you live? Are you in the US? I only ask because you said it's 2am and it's 7:50pm where I live in Florida. That's not a good sign that you were able to feel that in the kittens chest when you were holding it. It definitely needs antibiotics quickly. Please keep me informed if you don't mind of the outcome of the Vet's visit I'd really apreciate it.",1685577607.0

Public transportation to games is garbage yes, but given that HRS is in the vicinity of several major highways including I95 and the Florida Turnpike (and the Palmetto Expressway, but fuck that shit), it‚Äôs relatively easy (by stadium standards) to just commute to by car.

"Adulting","t5_394gd","The guy you're replying to is being slightly derisive

People being born and raised in large cities (the majority of people) don't do it out of choice lmao. 

They live in areas where 2BR rent costs 4k a month true. The alternative is to leave where you grew up, your family, your friends, your job, to move several hours a way to a place you've never been before to find lower rent. Not really reasonable.

>They get $40k vehicles

Most people do not do this. 

Earning 100k in a big city 

70k after taxes/insurance

rent is going to cost you between 30-50k a year. 

Thats 30k left.

Average groceries is another 5+k a year.

Thats 25k.

God forbid you have to own a car. 

Even with a shitty beater that you bought for 5k there's still 2-3k a year in petrol, 2-3k a year in insurance and rego, 1-2k a year in maintenance at a minimum.

Thats now 20k.

Phone / internet bills (mandatory in this day and age) - another 1k-1.5k a year. 

So now you're down to less than $350 a week before factoring in any other small bills / mandatory life expenses.

God forbid you have kids. Or want to ever do anything besides eat at home and go to work. Or save. Or go on holidays. 

OR your car breaks down and you've got to spend a few k fixing that / buying a new one. 

Is it livable. Sure. Is it thriving? No. You're still essentially paycheck to paycheck.  You can save at most, if you do nothing all year and live frugally and never do anything else that costs money, 15k-20k a year. Awesome. Only going to take you 5 years until you can get a down payment on a shitty apartment. You've still got zero chance of ever owning a house like the one your parents did unless you inherit it. 

And you haven't saved a cent for retirement so you're still going to have to work for the rest of your life. 

Thats definitely a lot closer to the definition of not living than it is wrong. 

One would ask at what point is it a reasonable expectation to do more than survive? How much money do you think is a reasonable amount to make before you can have comforts and not just be a workhorse.",1685577608.0

FWIW I'm demi and my partner of nearly 10 years and I started out as a FWB situation. It definitely started as what most people (myself included) would think of as casual sex but I felt physically attracted and comfortable enough to do that with them due to knowing her for a while as friends before that and building that bond.

Obviously that sort of thing doesn't work for everybody but I think there's a massive spectrum of human experience that falls between ""sex with a complete stranger I Just met"" and ""sex with my partner I'm intimately and romantically intertwined with and have known for years"" and we shouldn't get too black and white with it, or judge those who are taking part in consensual relationships that we personally wouldn't be comfortable with.",1685577609.0

"EDH","t5_2scee","If you choose, I think there's still a little more room to tweak, but it is definitely more focused now, and it should be more capable of doing what you want it to do as a result. I think Blightbeetle needs to go - its passive ability is not worth the fact that you can't target it with some of your own stuff - but other than that, the deck should be more consistent.

One thing you can consider: the deck has a bit of a mix of going wide (overwhelming your opponent with numbers) and going tall (having creatures that are simply larger than your opponent can handle). It's entirely up to you if you want to keep it that way. If you still want to have the option of going tall, [[Greater Good]] could be awesome for the deck: it's a free sacrifice outlet, it's free card draw, and it even fills your graveyard. [[Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord]] could also work with that plan, although he's less synergistic since his ability costs mana. I would say play around with it a bit, and if you find that your creatures are consistently 3 power or better, find a way to get Greater Good in there.

Your land ramp has room to improve if you decide to go that route: [[Farseek]], [[Three Visits]], [[Nature's Lore]] and [[Skyshroud Claim]] are all better than the land ramp that you currently have, and they give you the option of running the cheap dual lands that enter tapped. If you don't want to, though, it's not a huge deal: it's not like Cultivate is a bad card at all, it's just that there are stronger options.

But again. I think it's more focused now, and that should help things run more smoothly in general.",1685577610.0

"ireland","t5_2qhb9",">I feel like it would take a lot for many hard line unionists to feel  safe in a united Ireland. Would you be happy to change the flag, the  anthem, consider a federalised Ireland?

I think you have to look at what compromises unionists are currently failing to make in the North before you can have the brass balls to ask this question in all honestly.

Personally, I'm not too fussed about changing the flag (get rid of the orange) or the anthem.

Ireland has a smaller population than that of London, and Stormont doesn't work, so why add an additional, costly layer of bureaucracy?

The 'appeasment' to unionists is that in Ireland you will be treated equally as a human being, regardless of your religion or preferred identity.

"TikTokCringe","t5_mvcq5","Why do you need it to be about sex? We can celebrate hetero relationships without saying ""WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A PENIS GOING INTO A VAGINA."" When you see or hear about a straight couple do you think about sex? If someone loving someone else of the same sex translates to them talking about sex in your mind, maybe you're the one that's perverting the idea of love and attraction. PRIDE is not about sex, it is about attraction and love, and while attraction can lead to sex, that's also true for straight people.

We see plenty of straight relationships in media and people don't argue against that, why is it a problem to have lgbt+ ones? Before you say it's about the pride movement and ""You are fine with people being LGBT but we don't need a whole movement"" the point is that for centuries western culture shunned LGBT relationships and the movement is an attempt to change the western worlds mindeset and get people to not just tolerate people that are different then themselves but to actually accept it.

Kids are used to straight relationships for the most part, they don't think of sex when they see one, they just see love. Why is it so bad if they see non-straight relationships in the same way?",1685577611.0

"ShuumatsuNoValkyrie","t5_vzop7","Very close fight. I'd say that Hades wins with Extreme Difficulty. Almost a 50/50 for me.

Poseidon is faster and probably has better stamina while Hades seems overall better. Strength, Durability, Battle IQ, Experience, and overall combat skills. This makes sense as Hades is someone that Poseidon seems to respect and even look up to.


Could Hades react to Poseidon's 40-Day Flood? Well... maybe? He did react to Qin's Air Bubbles when they were basically touching him, so I wouldn't say that's impossible for him to react. He won't be able to defend himself for too long though, and would need to start thinking of a counterattack.

To be fair, I think that Zeus, Adam, Beelzebub and Hades are the only ones who can possibly keep up with Poseidon. The rest... well, I don't think they'll get instantly blitzed, but most of them wouldn't keep up very well.

10/22 and most common semi auto 22 rifles and pistols are still legal.  Those are good and cheap just to shoot.  1911's always look good to me if you only get 10 rounds. Might as well be 8-10 BIG ones like 10mm or 45 ACP.  Any of the good semi auto 7+1 shotguns are still incredibly effective as defense weapons for the home.  

Personally, i would not get a nerfed 10 shot Glock.  Fat grip that every time you look at that nerfed magazine you loose your mind.  I have 2 of those for a CZ p09 or P10.  Freaking stupid things.  Maybe something like a Tanfoglio Defiant Stock Master in 45.  I don't know, better use of space in a double stack 45 that holds 10 in a normal sized grip ala the old DQed CZ 97. 

At some point, we will figure out what semi auto rifles are still legal or made legal, along with obtainable. Right now, that is not even totally clear yet.  All I know is that if I only get 10 shots, I want BIG rounds like 10mm, 45 +P, .308 or 7 12 gauge shotshells. But that's me when it comes to defense stuff.

Sadly I think your options are very limited, given the difficulty of detection and the potential harm of frequent tick shampoo treatments (not the sort of thing one can use daily!) 

Even if you were to groom your dog with a flea comb, a tick's burrowing behaviour makes tactile detection challenging. (To my horror I once found one embedded in my navel two whole days after a hike; the extraction by tweezers was unsettling as well as painful, as they really do dig in and hold fast.)

And though there are several white dudes still, they are primarily proven track records. But then I realized, this is what America looks like. It's weirder for me to think of our blended country being limited to a playlist made up of nearly all white dudes. 

If the pendulum had to swing a little far to get the mixed bag, I'm ok with that, I'm certain it will drift back to balance. But I have a hard time feeling bad for the guy who happens to not be on the side of having it a little easier at the moment. Bad luck in birth timing. Many others had the same bad luck before him in the other direction. 

Now if the comedy quality is suffering, that's a different story, but I haven't seen anything that suggests that. Same, as always, we have some that are great and some that I don't see as that funny.

It took a LONG time for me to break this pattern. My husband noticed I was just kind of agreeing to everything, even if I didn‚Äôt seem happy. He was able to gently explain that it was hurting our relationship rather helping it, and I had to reevaluate my need to constantly make him happy. It changed a lot, and made things better for us and for myself. I know I haven‚Äôt completely changed, and that I am still a people pleaser, but I do advocate for myself and my needs more, even if it is uncomfortable.

(to be clear: i fuckin love stable diffusion, i'm just using this subreddit as an example.)

In the exact same vein, the ArtsitHate subreddit, which is about showcasing how artists are screwed over and showing solidarity with those artists (based on the subreddit description). Stevencasteel in effect said 'no' with no other context or justification. He's just inviting people to get angry with him.

(I have a feeling he'd be banned even if he had explained why he disagreed with the post - the subreddit's stated goal is to show opposition to artist hate, and he is working directly counter to that goal. But whether that would have been reasonable is a different discussion. Stevencasteel's actions I feel are a bit more cut-and-dry)",1685577614.0

"FinancialPlanning","t5_2qwze","Everyone is giving their advice but no one is factoring the child into the situation. What is the age of the child when you will absolutely need a 2 br?  

If it's less than 2 years, then I would keep your ""cheap"" rent (I say that as my mom and I put 75k down on a 4br/2ba home for her and have a cheaper mortgage than your rent in SC).  You might as well enjoy at least 1-2  years in the area you love and save a little more for your down payment.  Evaluate your options then. Don't count on the rates to do anything you think they are going to do.

Also, this is some side info here. I grew up in a 3br/2ba ranch home that was originally a 2BR. When I was 4, my parents built on a master bedroom on the end of the house. In order to get to their room, they had to walk through my 10'x10' room.  It stayed that way until my teens.  That lack of privacy and my own space shaped parts of my personality for the worse.

Boomers won't hire you if you have colored hair, visible piercings or tattoos and criticize work ethic based on appearance not output. This has been going away with gen x and more so with millennials. The work place is shifting to become more humane to human uniqueness and avoid judgemental or petty management such as strict restrictions on hair color or thinking people are lazy based on the outer appearance of something.

Some booms also don't fit the mold and have adjusted to current ideas. It's a choice to become stagnant and unfortunately boomers come from a generation of blind obedience to authority.

People learn from struggles. Those struggling will make a difference when placed in a managing role. I've had a boss who was 25 and fit the boomer work ethic and mentality along side a sneering racism and sexism.

 - Too little effort: only saying ‚ÄúDM me.‚Äù

 - Too little consent: introducing a new kink without asking, that the OP did not reference. Try to aim for what seems like is being asked for. With something like a humiliation flair, yes, misgendering or body-shaming can be part of humiliation, but you don‚Äôt want to assume if it‚Äôs not referenced by OP.

 - Here‚Äôs how to horny-comment just right: your comment should interact with the kink (post, title, flair) and person (user flair, profile). If you‚Äôd like to play in DMs, you may ask if they‚Äôd like to chat further, or go ahead and DM them if they don‚Äôt say not to in their post, pinned posts, or bio.

"blackladies","t5_2vk9t","My ex fianc√© did this. 
Note, ex. 

I felt so grossed out and degraded whenever he would rub one out next to me in bed because I said no to him and stuck to it. 

Do you feel pressured by him to have sex so he can ‚Äúrelease‚Äù? If so, that‚Äôs a huge red flag. And having sex when you‚Äôre not in the mood is a surefire way to make your drive dip even more and lose attraction to your partner because of resentment and trauma. 

There are men out there who can control themselves or at least take that shit to another room as to not be rude and disturb your sleep. If you haven‚Äôt, tell him he needs to have his little dates with his hand elsewhere. If he‚Äôs resistant then I say cut him loose bc it will likely get worse.",1685577616.0

My advice - since you are already having a baby with this man - is to block all of his family on your phone. All correspondence from his family goes through him, and only he deals with them. Similarly, all of your family‚Äôs correspondence comes through you. This boundary has been a game changer for us - it really opened my husbands eyes as to how exhausting his parents can be; hopefully it will work for your boyfriend, too.",1685577616.0

Use the fret inlays on the side of the fretboard if you have them (you should if you have them on the top)

Make sure the strap is at a comfortable height. Don't be a tool who plays his guitar so low that it interferes with your playing. IMO it's pretty easy to find a comfortable height that doesn't make you look like Steve Urkel. The more you get comfortable with it, the more you'll feel comfortable lowering it too.

"Scams","t5_2qrt0","AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). The advance-fee scam arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you will pay the scammer and receive nothing. It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments. If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should ignore the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again.

Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?‚Äù This they said, testing Him, that they might have something of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as though He did not hear. So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, ‚ÄúHe who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.‚Äù Then those who heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, ‚ÄúWoman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúNo one, Lord.‚Äù And Jesus said to her, ‚ÄúNeither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.‚Äù

"anime","t5_2qh22","**This is Uenoyama-kun. My boyfriend**

This OVA came bundled with a special edition of volume 7 of the manga, and it adapts the manga scenes that were omitted from the movie. And that means pretty much every Mafuyu/Ritsuka scene. Why couldn't they just put these scenes in the movie and fix one of the movie's issues (the length)? Some would blame COVID, some would say that adding these scenes would take focus away from the story that they wanted to tell, and others would blame greediness. Pick your favorite.

Personally, as someone who liked the Mafuyu/Ritsuka bits of these chapters more than the Haruki/Akihiko bits, I LOVE this OVA. It contains some of my favorite scenes (the kiss in the classroom, Ritsuka's hilarious gay panicking, Ritsuka comforting Mafuyu in his bedroom). But, because of the circumstances of the adaptation, the scenes don't flow together super well. I would go as far as to say that this OVA is just a collection of scenes put together in chronological order. But the scenes are really good!

Like the movie, the OVA got it's own ending. And it's where the OVA gets it's name from. /u/punching_spaghetti will probably link to it, but [I'll do it too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQx36UHWi10)! (sorry!)

Also, **post-credits scene alert!** It's a good one.

Some additional bits:

* This has been posted before in the rewatch, but the two kitties are Hiiragi and Ritsuka's stands. Like from Jojo's. Ritsuka and Mafuyu's were revealed in a volume 2 bonus comic, while Hiiragi and Shizusumi's were revealed in a volume 3 ""special thanks"" page. [Here they are.](https://imgur.com/a/XgyURX4)

So I'm on track for my original goal: at least one GWP trip per month over the 12 months.

Unfortunately, I slept through the summer advanced booking period. At the moment I have no additional GWP passes booked and will be attempting my second booked-the-day-before adventure next week.

I won't make the same mistake twice - I plan to spend all day tomorrow setting up at least 3 trips for Sept. / Oct. / early November.

I have also been preparing for success by doing the following: fully understanding the Frontier schedule of direct flights from my hometown, researching the cheapest near-the-airport hotel options in those 6 cities (for overnight layovers), marking up a calendar with out-of-town locations or events I would be interested in (concerts, Astros out-of-town games, seasonal festivals, nearby national parks and the like), submitting my passport renewal, buying a new personal bag that I am 100% sure with avoid the bag fees, etc. And posting / reading here :-)

I also jumped on the 20k offer.",1685577618.0

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Yes, Humans can be wrong for thousands of years. 

How? Because they didn't have the tools to discover the truth. They found an explanation that satisfied enough people at the time to the best of their knowledge. 

Let's look at the relationship between the earth, sun, and moon. For a long time, we ""knew"" the earth was the center of the universe. Most people with argue that it wasn't until Galileo was able to suggest gravity  around other objects, especially Jupiter's moons that we were able to conceptualize things rotating around something other than Earth. I think that goes even further with the math. I recall Aramaic recordings of the moon and stars, and they would be linear. They could predict something happening every so many days, but couldn't explain why. It was until Greek geometry that some of the celestial patterns could be explained, but not everything. 

In the West, the belief of the fae and changelings was part of a system to explain things going missing and children with disabilities. That would probably be a child with autism or down syndrome today,  but they didn't have the knowledge of genetics to explain that. 

Even something more in the middle. In 14th century Krakow, quicksilver could be considered a magical metal. I could tell you Mercury as an element is too heavy to maintain solid form kind of collapses into a liquid for stability. In a hundred years, somebody else could properly explain what's going on with the electrons and quantum states to explain how it has enough cohesion. We pick up pieces of the puzzle over time, and sometimes it takes longer to put the pieces of the puzzle together to understand why we were wrong before.",1685577619.0

"TheUltimatumNetflix","t5_5y8ivk","I highly doubt Mal just started saving in last few weeks. That would have meant she didn‚Äôt start saving until the show started. It was week 6 by that point.

There‚Äôs a huge difference between WANTING children, which Xander and Yoly have in common, and not being opposed to children. Xander **wants** kids, and is partially defined by it. That why she has been saving. Yoly also wants kids, but we‚Äôve heard no evidence of any saving on Yoly‚Äôs part. She was completely honest in this episode that she‚Äôd be dependent on her partner for that. 

My guess is Mal has been saving for at least a year. I have no evidence of this, obviously. But I can see not wanting to make a decision about that (on her end) until they‚Äôve been together a certain amount time to be sure it‚Äôs worth it. Especially since Mal correctly clocks that Yoly falls in love easily. Mail didn‚Äôt feel like she was a unique experience to Yoly. And ultimately she wasn‚Äôt. Yoly fell *in love* with someone 3 weeks after meeting them. They were probably in love earlier than that. Xander was open that she felt the love on her side by like week 1.",1685577620.0

üìù ‚îâ‚îâ‚îâ Video notes

How do you filter positive integers in a Python list comprehension, using a for loop style method? You use a list comprehension with for, in, and greater than to filter negative numbers out of an existing list, while simultaneously assigning a new list to a new variable (or overwrite the existing variable, if you wish).

üí° What is filtering with for in a list comprehension?

Filtering with `if` in a list comprehension allows you to selectively include or exclude elements from the resulting list based on a condition. It provides a concise way to filter elements without the need for an explicit `if` statement.

In a list comprehension, you can include an `if` clause after the iterable, which is evaluated for each element in the iterable. If the condition evaluates to `True`, the element is included in the resulting list; otherwise, it is skipped.

Here's a simple example to illustrate filtering with `if` in a list comprehension:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
```

In the above code, the list comprehension `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` filters the `numbers` list and only includes the elements that are even. The `if` condition `num % 2 == 0` checks if the number is divisible by 2 without a remainder, and if so, the element is included in the resulting list `even_numbers`.

This filtering capability allows you to create more focused and customized lists by selectively including or excluding elements based on specific conditions in a concise and readable manner.

üí° What is a Python list comprehension?

A Python list comprehension is a concise and powerful way to create lists based on existing lists or other iterable objects. It allows you to generate new lists by applying an expression or transformation to each element in the original list, while optionally filtering the elements based on certain conditions.

The general syntax of a list comprehension is as follows: new_list = [expression for element in iterable if condition]

Here's a breakdown of the components:
1. new_list: This is the resulting list that will be created by the list comprehension.
2. expression: It represents the operation or transformation that is applied to each element of the iterable to generate a new value.
3. element: It refers to the individual elements from the iterable that are being processed.
4. iterable: It is the source from which elements are extracted. It can be a list, tuple, string, or any other iterable object.
5. condition (optional): This is an optional component that allows you to specify a condition for filtering elements. Only the elements that satisfy the condition will be included in the resulting list.

üí° What is a Python iterable?

In Python, an iterable is any object that can be looped over using a loop construct like `for` or comprehensions. It represents a sequence of elements that can be iterated one by one.

The most common types of iterables in Python include:
1. Sequences: Lists, tuples, strings, and ranges are examples of sequences. They allow accessing elements by index and support iteration.
2. Containers: Data structures like sets and dictionaries are containers that hold a collection of elements. They can be iterated over to access each element.
3. Generators: These are functions or expressions that generate a sequence of values lazily as requested. They produce values one at a time instead of creating the entire sequence upfront.
4. Files: When reading or writing files in Python, they can be treated as iterables, allowing you to read or write data line by line.
5. Custom Iterables: You can create your own custom classes that implement the iterable protocol by defining the `__iter__()` method. This method should return an iterator object that defines the `__next__()` method to retrieve the next element.

Iterables are fundamental to many aspects of Python programming, enabling iteration, looping, and processing of data in a convenient and efficient way. They provide a consistent interface for working with different types of collections and sequences of data.

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq",">Older TE who performs at the top of his position year after year. 

It also has to do with how they play TE. Tony Gonzales is the exception that shows you can get a lot of elite production as a receiver -- but he was essentially a receiver first, like Kelce. Guys like Gronk were great but destroyed their bodies because they block with all their might and bang heads on every play. 

Kelce has said in interviews that he's learned how to block at different angles with his career longevity in mind. I think he may be closer to a Tony G than he is to a Gronk. 

The bolts don't fall off just because, I think play style has a lot do with it. Travis Henry  has bigger collisions than Kelce does. And even on plays where he's pass protecting.",1685577621.0

"Austin","t5_2qhn5","I really like my budget billing setup. The other comments are right re: some months being above your ‚Äúaveraged‚Äù $$ amount. But also, from what I understand, if it‚Äôs lower the next month, then that will cancel out the overage. 

Ex: 
$100/mo budget billing rate

Jan: Actual usage was $50, so your bill is $-50
February: Actual usage was $250, so your bill is $250-$50, $200.
And so on and so forth. I feel like it depends on your usage/consumption. Like, once the pandemic hit and I was working from home I knew I was going to increase my electricity consumption so I switched to budget billing. But also, I have a 600 sq ft, 1 bedroom condo; so unless I had a Griswold-level Christmas light setup on my porch, I feel like I‚Äôd be okay.

"gravesdisease","t5_2wrar","The bulging and eyelid retraction is the same. The pain has gradually decreased some over time, but there is still mild-moderate daily pain in my left eye. I use preservative free drops several times daily, eye gel drops in the evening, and eye lubricant at night. I use warm compresses sometimes to help with dry eye. Cold compresses can sometimes help with pain. Avoiding excessive screen time and always wearing these giant sunglasses while I‚Äôm driving (protect my eyes from the sun and keep some AC from irritating my eyes more) are also helpful! I have slight double vision in the left eye as well but it hasn‚Äôt worsened thankfully. 

Besides not smoking and keeping our thyroid levels balanced, it feels like there isn‚Äôt much in our control. 

I‚Äôve had a hard time getting diagnosis or treatment for TED since my symptoms are so mild‚Ä¶ I had a CT done after meeting with an ophthalmologist but he didn‚Äôt see any signs of TED so he said it must not be TED. I‚Äôve spoken with others with mild-severe TED symptoms who have struggled to get a diagnosis and also experienced lack of imaging showing proof for TED‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs such a rare disease and many doctors don‚Äôt really understand it. Even the ophthalmologist I saw was supposed to be a TED specialist and he said he has only seen a few cases! There‚Äôs an occuloplastic surgeon who specializes in TED in my state so I was going to try them next. It has been hard for me to build up the strength to start that process of advocating for myself with a new doctor. Diagnosis is difficult as many symptoms can mimic other issues, like chronic dry eye or allergies. 

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this. TED is a separate disease and requires different treatment and monitoring aside from Graves/thyroid issues. Some people have reported their TED symptoms improving after TT but this doesn‚Äôt seem to have much research support. 

A few weeks ago I also started taking selenium tablets as there are some studies showing that this helps with TED! also check out r/thyroideyedisease if you haven‚Äôt already!!",1685577621.0

"DevelEire","t5_37lrj","While I agree that someo people just get the right experience and are talented etc, there is no way someone can physically hit that level after just 2 years (most grad programs only last that!). There is simply not enough time to have worked aross the full lifecycle of a variety of systems/architectures/technologies/tools etc.

As per my reply below this one, ""*Traditionally, a Senior Software Engineer was someone with significant experience across a range of systems, architectures, technology and tooling that could use their experience to take ownership of technical designs for the team as well as manage small teams. Typically\* 10+ years experience required.*""

As per my post, there has been significant ""title inflation"" in recent years as hiring/retention went mad. And this is a perfect example. Even the fact that he confuses a ""scrum master"" role and a ""team leader"" role shows how little experience and depth of knowledge he has. That is not intended as an insult to him (he only knows what he has learned in his short career). But, once he has 10+ years working across a variety of scrum teams he will understand a lot more about the role of the scrum master than he does today.

Something to think about - if a software engineer reaches a ""senior"" position in 4-5 years (and sometimes as little as 2), where does their career go from there? What title would they have 5 years later? What about 10, 20, 30 years after becoming a ""senior"" (assuming they stay in a software engineering career path)?",1685577622.0

"StLouis","t5_2qpnm","So the drag story time is conditioning children that grown men acting like this is okay. Parading around with provocative clothing and sexually charged displays is not something for children to attend to. These LGBT agendas are destroying the fabric of this nation and there are many gay men who are against LGBT. They are a perverted organization and for you to equate a group based on sexual principles to religion its rather sickening; I do not spend any time in a church nor a house of any worship. So the real question is, who touched you in a religious place of worship?",1685577623.0

I can tell if I'm being threatened by a human male (beyond words, chest puffs up, voice gets deeper, eye contact increases, etc.). I also can tell whether something is food or something is a tool. It's millions upon millions of years of evolution that allow all species to pick up on behavioural _and_ physical cues. 

Sure, all of these can misfire but it is absolutely the case that its built into my biology, my instinct to recognise these things, including sex, because its so important to the survival of the species that we can do that. The same goes for every species on the planet. Do you think male stags get into rutting over a bunch of does but then they realise to their utter embarrassment that they were fighting over other male stags. No, they can ""magically"" tell the difference.

Transpeople can of course mean my recognition on this matter can be misplaced. But the point I was trying to defend was your rubbishing of the idea that we are biologically ""programmed"" to recognise male and female.",1685577623.0

"careerguidance","t5_2t9i0","I don‚Äôt know much about trade school so the only advice I can give is specific to college, assuming your interested in attending:
- Find a job at a company with a tuition reimbursement program (Apple, BestBuy, Chick Fil A, Chipotle, GAP, Home Depot, KFC, Publix, Starbucks, Taco Bell to name a few) and enroll in community college. 
- Look into CLEP exams and Modern States for cheap college credit. 
- If you had good or even just decent grades in high school, look at scholarships at state schools in the south, specifically schools in Alabama and Arkansas have very good automatic merit scholarships based on GPA/test scores. The only thing is that transfers are typically not eligible for as much money as freshman applications so that‚Äôs something to consider before enrolling in community college. 
- To get on track for a professional office job, reach out to temp agencies. I‚Äôve personally had good experiences with Robert Half. Sometimes temp positions can lead to permanent ones and even if it doesn‚Äôt, if you get on good with your supervisor that‚Äôs an opportunity to develop a good professional reference. 
- If I could go back and pick a different degree (I did a liberal arts major), I would probably go with accounting. You can make a good salary and accountants are needed all over the country.
- Apply for financial aid even if you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be eligible. You might be surprised. Also, the general rule of thumb with student loans is to not take out more than what you expect your annual salary to be after graduation. For most people, that‚Äôs probably around $40k but this will of course vary depending on what you plan on going into. 
- When you find a college and major you‚Äôre interested in pursuing, look at the Career Services office to see if you can find a document about student outcomes. Most schools have this, it‚Äôll say what companies hire from the school and what majors, as well as what salaries alumni make. This is self reported by the students so YMMV, but you might find this interesting.",1685577623.0

There's been a definite adjustment phase while this is implemented. Right now, daycares have to sign up to be part of the program. It does not apply to before/after care. It's also regulated so you can't just decide grandma is daycare and therefore the government will pay her on your behalf.

We do get child care rebates on our taxes. IMO, this is an awful way to go about it as it requires parents to have the money up front. When my kid was in daycare it was $1400/month for infants... Ideally, I wouldn't have had to fork over $1400 up front every month.",1685577625.0

"Pathfinder2e","t5_gkc60","I mean, with this logic we can get rid of all ""subraces"" (I know they are not called that in PF2e), including all the elves and merge them into one. But the point of them is to add more visual diversity on top of cultural. If I keep them as ""just elves but..."" then it's very limiting. Example: Let's say I want to make society of elves that isolated themselves from outside world for hundreds of years. When they come out of hiding it turns out they altered themselves with magic and look a lot different and their bodies function differently. Now we have a problem where we have lore stating that they are a lot different from elves we know but we only have standard elf statistics for them available. So no, ""just use elves"" is not a solution.

> Just use elves (that happen to be evil).

"DermatologyQuestions","t5_2ihy50","I am going to give you a suggestion. This is an option. You might want to try AcenZyme. This Emulsion is inexpensive and it goes on like warm butter so you don't need to use very much. I think you should seriously consider this approach. I hope this helps.

I have developed an Emulsion that will go deep into the Dermis, exfoliate the damaged skin cells and Moisturize and rejuvenate the healthy skin cells. It is called AcneZyme. There are no synthetic chemicals, no steroids and no topical anesthetics. It is 100 % natural, plant based Phytochemicals. It goes on like warm butter and spreads easily, so you only need a very small amount. Some on this board might try to dissuade you. This is just an option. It is your choice. There is a science behind how our skin barrier works. I will include this science. I hope this helps. Best to you.  
Here is the science behind the formulation: FACT CHECK: WHY DOES MY SKIN BARRIER ALLOW TOXINS TO ENTER AND CAUSE INFLAMMATION? This brief synopsis is technically challenging and uses complicated terminology, but it explains the Mechanism of Action how our Emulsions will help your skin. 1- PADI stands for Peptidyl Arginine Deiminase. (The Amino Acid Arginine contains a lot of Nitrogen or Ammonia) 2- PADI results in something called Citrullination. 3- Citrullination is the conversion of positively charged Arginine (an Amino Acid with Nitrogen) into neutral Citrulline. 4- Citrulline changes the Binding Specificity of Keratinocytes (Keratin in your skin). This allows the Keratin cells to tightly bind together forming a strong skin barrier. 5- Without Citrulline you will have openings in your skin barrier allowing toxins to get in. Thus, bacteria, viruses, fungus and other toxins get inside your skin creating an inflammatory skin disease. 6- Cytokines also cause inflammatory skin disease because it neutralizes PADI expression in differentiated human Keratinocytes (Keratin skin cells). (More on Cytokines later). 7- In healthy skin cells, PADI enables citrullination of Filaggrin and Keratin, which contribute to skin barrier function. Likewise, L-Histidine and Hyaluronic Acid help produce Filaggrin. We use Hyaluronic Acid in our Emulsions. (Note: Filaggrin is essential to forming a healthy skin barrier) 8- Acefylline is a PADI Activator. It enhances the enzymatic activity of Keratin, Ammonia (Arginine), Vitamin D-3 and STAT (Signal Transducer & Activator of Transcription & Vit D) 9- Vitamin D-3 and Acitretin can activate PADI (This is desirable). 10- Acitretin is a Retinoid (Vitamin A). However, Acetretin can cause hair loss and Liver damage. 11- Acitretin is similar to Accutane, which is often prescribed for Acne. 12- Patchouli Oil is also called Pogostemon Cablin and Guanguoxiang (in China). We use Patchouli Oil in our Emulsions. 13- Patchouli Oil contains a lot of Acefylline (see 8 above). 14- Acefylline is an Adenosine Receptor Antagonist. Think of Adenosine as ATP (our source of energy). So if the Adenosine Receptor is blocked, you cannot bind Adenosine and your energy levels are increased. This is how Caffeine works. Thus, you produce excitatory Neurotransmitters rather than Cortisol. Cortisol would form more Cytokines and destroy your levels of PADI. Without enough PADI,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶you don‚Äôt have enough Keratin‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and your skin barrier is compromised. 15- Without a working skin barrier, you allow bacteria, fungus, viruses and toxic chemicals inside your skin causing a rash or scaly itchy skin.",1685577626.0

Parents demanding everything and anything 

Look 90% of kids parents colleagues and admin are fine but the 10% absolutely wears you out 

Anyway like I said‚Ä¶just sort of fell into it

I taught personal finance for 10+ years and kids would ask why I became a teacher and that‚Äôs the story I told 

But if you wanna know I gave my all to my curriculum and the kids

My motto for teaching personal finance was I hope you remember 50% of what I teach you in the future because if you do then I did well",1685577627.0

"fountainpens","t5_2s0ew","I mentioned elsewhere about the semi-absurdity about fragility, and I think the main issue is another element: ink fascination.

Lever/button/etc fillers come from the days when these pens were *tools*, not fetish objects or collectable accumulations, and they were used to make written output using the few inks available at the time. The vast majority would have been inked up with the same ink over and over again, and likely only need servicing every few years, at most. Today, there is a mania for a zillion inks of all color and ingredients; this is not a bad thing at all, and a lot of fun. However, thoroughly cleaning out a sac pen takes longer and more patience if you go switching colors, and I believe it is this - along with absurd compulsion to completely tear-down a pen just to change inks - that leans people away from the old lever/etc - fill pens.

It's all good, we're in a new era and all that. I just feel badly for people who are missing out on experiencing some of the greatest pens ever made, which can often be purchased for less than a lot of junk pens being made today. My collection spans well over 100 years and I regularly buy new pens, but the last pens I'd ever get rid of are most of my vintage writers. YMMV.",1685577627.0

"study","t5_2rcbr","LOG - PHASE 2: DAY 4: AREA OF FOCUS NUMBER FOUR   
Friday, 11am-5pm  
Short story: Met the limits of ChatGPT today   
What I did:   
\-Asked GPT for citations   
\-For summaries of cases  
\-For summary of particular judge‚Äôs views within a judgement containing multiple judge‚Äôs statements   
What I learned about GPT:   
\-It creates bogus citations. Before I started this experiment, my brother gave me an explanation of the probabilistic model that underlies ChatGPT and the latter would explain this behaviour. Some of the citations it is capable of coming up with are highly controversial (eg. ‚ÄúThe prerogative powers of the Crown are now subject to judicial review by the courts."" - Lord Bingham). The AI at least backtracks quickly when probed about where the citation was sourced from (‚ÄúI apologize for the incorrect attribution in my previous response. Lord Bingham did not make the statement. It seems to be a misattribution or a paraphrase of Lord Bingham's views.‚Äù)   
\-It can create, on first glance, decent summaries of cases - I would expect only of those that are very well and frequently written about online. I asked ChatGPT to summarise the De Keyser case, for example. I am familiar with the case and there is lots of good information about it online, open source (including the case itself of course (all 22 pages of it (which seems short compared to other cases!)) on Bailii). In this case, it is easy for anyone to cross-reference things and spot any errors. Question is if I would spot errors for cases I am less familiar with. But again, being aware of the possibility for and hunting for errors is very active learning for me ;)   
\-Other things that didn‚Äôt work included asking the AI to give me a definition of a concept coming from a law book (vs a popular book, such as the book Generations, which the AI can do).   
What I learned about myself:   
\-Returned to my favourite general, intro-level question: ‚Äúwhat is the history of xyz?‚Äù   
\-Even if there are small errors, I get the gist and it gives me the background data I need to imagine the evolution of the practice from its origin to the present day.   
The reason that historical info helps is that it tells me what is likely to change (could change within my lifetime, let‚Äôs say), and what could change but only very very slowly (over many more generations).   
This is my goal, I find, when asking about the past‚Ä¶knowing the story enables me to map time (time it would take to build or change anything) onto the mental map of the structure that I am building ‚Ä¶ to understand what the big, solid, less moveable pillars are and which are the parts of the building that are more susceptible or amenable to renovation/see more rapid evolution.   
In the context of exam prep, it tells me what events/cases are more in the order of a constitutional crisis (they involve the main pillars that hold up the building), and which are the events/cases that are like ‚Äúbuilding work‚Äù or ‚Äúrenovation work‚Äù around the edges or sides of the main pillars in the building...",1685577627.0

Rippers, gaunts, hive guards, warriors. By the time of the ultramarine reinforcements it was only rehael left with a broken thunder hammer in one hand and the handle of a dagger in the other lying on top of a bile of biomass blood angle and tyranid alike. Being a survivor he was immediately granted title of chapter master. He brought a very different philosophy of warfare to the chapter as he used a very bike heavy approach with fast attacks similar to white scars. As a chapter they see the red thirst as more of a gift then a curse and partake in blood feasting of dead opponents.

The loss of The Moskva and several other vessels, landing ships in Berdyansk, patrol boats around Snake Island has proven this. 

Despite what ‚ÄúFallout‚Äù may claim, war changes. War changes all the time. Naval warfare is a completely different animal than it was even 10 years ago. This is especially true in environments like the Black Sea. Ranges are short, the theatre is quite confined. Ships‚Ä¶ as they are, become massive liabilities in areas like this.

"laptops","t5_2qoip","Well, this is either a) a spicy pillow (swelling battery) like some people are saying, or b) just the frame warping slightly. If it's the frame warping, no biggie, just maybe treat it a bit more delicately so it doesn't get any worse. 

If it is a swelling battery, that's a bit more serious, and should be dealt with immediately. If it is 'spicy', there should be some degradation in battery performance. If you've found it losing charge more quickly than usual, or the laptop feels hotter than it previously did, that's a pretty solid indicator that the battery is physically degrading and needs to be replaced as soon as possible.

You can check for yourself by opening the laptop and inspecting the battery - the swelling is generally easy to spot, check over on r/spicypillows to get an idea of what to look for. As it's a thinkpad, it should be pretty easy to open it up, they're known for being easily serviceable (or at least they used to be, if that's no longer the case, please correct me, anyone who knows better).

Make sure the laptop's turned off first, that you have the correct tools on hand, and you have somewhere to put all the screws you take out. If you look up, ""<your laptop model> disassembly guide"" you should find a guide for it easily enough. 

If you don;t feel confident doing this, find a repair shop close by to do it for you. I know this is a lot easier said than done, but try not to use the laptop as much as possible until you're sure there's a good battery in it. Li-ion batteries have a lot of power in them, and combust violently if they're compromised.

"HouseOfTheDragon","t5_27hnjr","I think it could have been avoided but one side would really have had to humble themselves and cozied up to the other. As Otto said to Alicent, she had two options, cling to Rhaenyra, (stay her friend, foster positive relationships between her children and Rhaenyra/Rhaenyra‚Äôs children) or prepare Aegon to rule (contribute to the discord between the children and antagonize rhaenyra for ten years). She chose the second one. If the two sides were on good terms it is unlikely anyone would rise up against anyone. Kinslaying is a pretty big deal and Aegon didn‚Äôt want the crown anyway, the only targtower who potentially would have caused problems was Aemond, and he could have turned out different if it weren‚Äôt for the eye incident, which may not have happened in this scenario. I also don‚Äôt really think any outside force is going to plot against Rhaenyra when she has a united family with tons of dragons. We also need to factor in that she very likely wouldn‚Äôt have married Daemon in this scenario, unless Laenor died of natural causes, because she married him specifically to arm herself against the greens once she realized the extent to which they were a threat. Thus, Daemon would have no incentive to hurt Alicent‚Äôs children. 

Now, there‚Äôs an argument that there could be conflict in future generations between Jace and Aegon‚Äôs kids, but if were in these characters shoes, I‚Äôd be much more concerned with avoiding war now than generations down the line. 

On Rhaenyra‚Äôs end, I think if she had renounced her claim early enough, she and her kids would have been fine, but I think once Viserys is dead it‚Äôs too late, half the realm will always see her as the legitimate heir and she and her kids would always be a threat to the greens unless they held her kids hostage, as they planned to do.",1685577629.0

Stretching is almost never the answer, not all on its own. When muscles are tight it's usually because they're trying to stabilize, so usually there needs to be strengthening elsewhere as well as stretching. A 2.5 hour routine is madness.

One advice I‚Äòd like to offer for your personal journey: 

**Let the prostate orgasms find you**, don‚Äòt chase them and first and foremost **get rid of any expectations**, how they should feel. 

To picture this, imagine the ‚ÄûTerminator‚Äú crumbled to drops of liquid metal, first slowly crawling towards each other, then faster and faster. The biggest wave consists of tiny drops. Let it grow until it pulls the sand out from under your feet and you might suddenly hover in a sea of bliss, a lot guys already have discovered on their journey. 

Another aspect is your subconsciousness, that likes to hold you back from anything that‚Äòs new and unknown. ‚ÄûI will do myself no harm.‚Äú had to become my mantra. It has been necessary to soothe my subconscious alert system and finally allow me to really let go and give up control. Only thus my prostate could take over and create the undreamed wonders of multiple full-body orgasms - so different from any other feeling I had experienced before, why no man will ever be able to imagine what at all he might be chasing for. 

Good luck and good vibes!",1685577630.0

"MechanicAdvice","t5_2tkvu","So, every single car manufacturer puts out a Service Manual written by the manufacturer with the correct way to diagnose the problem and the correct procedure (steps) to replace it (like they're supposed to follow at a dealership). I've always had Hondas, but first discovered a pdf version of the 1994 Honda Accord Service Manual (sometimes called the ""Shop"" or ""Repair"" manual) on a torrent tracker by accident when I had my first 1997 Accord (1994-1997 was that generation, so the 1994 Accord Service Manual pdf worked. I was able to rebuild the automatic transmission using that pdf after only doing basic things like brake pads by myself (without the help of my dad). There's a corresponding online service site with service bulletins, recalls, etc. Anyway, a bunch of the manufacturers have Helm Inc. handle the distribution of their official publications of owners manuals and service materials. I checked on helminc.com and the Toyota Corolla Repair Manual came in 5 pieces, each being roughly $200 new, so screw that. I'd first check torrent sites to find a pdf. Ebay has used service/repair manuals. I've paid for a 3-day pass to Honda's Service site so I could do a site-rip of all the information. Think of the service manual as the Bible to your car! You can watch YouTube videos, buy a Chilton/Haynes repair manual at Autozone, or read a how to on forums, but that's like getting your information from the word of a preacher when you can just study directly from the Bible itself on your own. I would only imagine that Toyota would also create a stellar service manual like Honda does, which contributes to their longevity. Service Manuals took me from a complete beginner to knowing a car like the back of my hand and how to do engine work like valve adjustments and bearings. Good luck to you! It's challenging at first but super rewarding to feel the fruits of your labor in how you drive to work or running errands (rather than being annoyed and anxious worrying about the problem). Suspension is the perfect place to start. Use a torque wrench from Harbor Freight to tighten bolts to their specific ft-lbs in the beginning (and always, really). I snapped SO many bolts by overtightening them in the beginning.",1685577631.0

Also as far as the breath is concerned, how are you explaining Cold and Lightning breath? Gas and liquid? How do you explain them recharging? Why would they need to recharge at all if they had a stock pile? Squid don't need to 'recharge' when they spew ink. What about the Gem Dragons Psychic breath? If one of those dragon breaths is magical, why aren't all of them? 

You'd have to put *way* too much though into convincing someone they're non-magical then just saying a wizard did it. It's too much work, and way easier to just say it's magic but magic that's built different so it isn't canceled by something like anti-magic field.

I want to hire someone who is a good culture fit and will enjoy the work, because they're more likely to produce good work and more likely to stick around.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","One thing that I've learned from League that I have applied IRL is the fact that people who speak the loudest usually are the most wrong. Most people who preach about being nice to their teammates, preach about communication and teamwork are usually the people who make wrong calls and be 200% passive aggressive about literally anything. This is because these guys put themselves on a pedestal thinking that they're all better than everyone and that they have risen above this toxicity when in reality they have not, and these players generally play utility champs (tanks, supports, etc.) so they overestimate the ""teamwork"" factor because they think their champions can't do anything by themselves. I would much rather have a 12 year old calling me a dog than have these players on my team because their ego causes them to maintain a ""nice"" facade and stops them from following any calls or behave predictably (so we can play around their predictable behaviors), leading to a real hard game because these guys care more about ""being nice"" to each other rather than winning.

The best players/people to have around are humble mfs who legit only type 3 things: gj, mb and gg, and everything else can be communicated through pings. These people, unlike the moral compass wannabe mfs, know that they are flawed and have experienced toxicity enough to realize that toxicity is innate and almost noone is above it, so the best they can do is to not contribute to it. League is not real life, every game we have the benefit of anonymity to be the most toxic pos and you can bet on human nature that people will love to start pointing fingers the moment things go wrong. Every time I play with low elo friends (like real low, like silver low) who preaches about how ""people should be nicer to each other in game"" they make the most subhuman asinine calls and be passive aggressive to the random on the team (if there is one) about why they aren't being ""cooperative"" and at this point I've given up on trying to change them because they fail to realize that they are imperfect just like everyone else.

If you're the 1% of people who are genuinely nice and enjoy conversing your (wrong) ideas to the people you play with (because let's face it, even Challenger players make mistakes, who are we to say that our calls are always correct), good on you, but you're still getting muted because I'd rather not be influenced by wrong calls. And even I have limits.

"stocks","t5_2qjfk","I choose PayPal too. My average cost per share $67.98, at the time of writing this. My intentions are to do a swing trade.

There are many concerns around PayPal. Growth has slowed, and there's lots of competitors. It's Pay Later business could become a BIG issue, but could also prove to be a worthwhile business endeavor. With that said, I believe PayPal is undervalued and due for a small pop. I feel it is transitioning from being a growth stock, to being a value stock.

I believe it's undervalued at $62. Forward P/E is excellent, sitting around 12. Still has some growth in the bag, not much with the current outlook, but growth is growth.

The online payment CAGR still stands at 10%. PayPal checkout is still very popular. I am European and personally use it all the time for eBay, and when buying things from most websites. I do not see it losing it's current success any time soon. Operating margins aren't terrible, but aren't as alluring as Visa or Mastercard.

They have other product offerings that could offer plenty of growth, albeit at lower operating margins, Venmo and Braintree. They are consistent with stock buybacks and still have an ongoing program which is rarely mentioned, enough to buy up a considerable percentage of the current shares outstanding. Their balance sheet will improve as the cost of layoffs clear up.

I think there is an argument to be had that PayPal is fair value at it's current price if you want 8-12% return in the coming years. I don't see it dipping hard below $60. My PT isn't too much higher than it's current price. I do not see it returning to $300 a share unless a miracle happens. It was so overvalued at $300 a share, I am surprised it managed to stay there so long. They already have like 400M active accounts, I don't know how they tricked shareholders into thinking they could maintain Covid growth.

And tbh, in the specific example of Spain, they actually should've coloured in Catalonia since its a major language (perhaps they avoided it if its not taught by the FSI) but again, the point is that those minority languages often found in European nations aren't nearly as widely spoken as Indian dialects.

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/fbi-plant-banned-by-mosque-ndash-because-he-was-too-extreme-2153057.html

>The spying game wasn't all it was cracked up to be for Craig Monteilh, a convicted criminal recruited by the FBI to investigate the march of radical Islam into Southern California. His endless talk of violent ""jihad"" so alarmed worshippers at the local mosque, that they took out a restraining order against him.

...

>The enthusiastic attempt to catch local Muslims discussing terror campaigns backfired, however, when community leaders went to the police with fears that the suddenly devout young man, who got up to pray at 4am, had become a radical in their midst.

>The terror case Monteilh had been helping build against Ahmadullah Niazi, the brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden's bodyguard, collapsed in September, when the bungling informant revealed that his FBI handlers had instructed him to entrap his potential target and told him that ""Islam is a threat to our national security"".

...

>.We started hearing that he was saying weird things,"" said Omar Kurdi, a Loyola Law School student who trained there. ""He would walk up to one of my friends and say, 'It's good that you guys are getting ready for the jihad'.""

>In May 2007, Monteilh recorded a conversation in which he suggested to Niazi and another young man that they blow up buildings. Niazi appeared to agree with the idea, and the tape was subsequently used as evidence in the terror case against him.

>However, it now seems that Niazi had simply been attempting to humour someone he regarded as a dangerous extremist. Indeed, he was so concerned by ""al-Aziz's"" attempts to plot an attack that he reported it to community leaders, who passed details to police and took out a restraining order to prevent him from entering the Islamic centre.

 So now you want to give Delhi control of partitioning people like British did to Punjab and Bengal. Literally Congress partitioned AP-TS. there were some local regionalists too who wanted the partition much like HM and ML were for Punjab and Bengal but they were not majority. I remember Parliament and Vidhan Sabha being active overnight during the AP-TS partition due to no majority concensus and a lot of unparliamentary activities took place so that Northie Congress could secure that partition for the then upcoming elections. Similar unparliamentary story happened with No-confidence motion around Indo-US nuclear deal with the merchants paying out several parties and party members to backstab and ignore what other ***representatives*** wanted but thats another story.

"SilverDegenClub","t5_7jkxvy","I think the problem we face currently as a group is communication.

The initial feedback we got from the redesign was good, but there was legibility issues that were not brought to mod's attention for almost a week that are now fixed, but that too could play a factor here. 

u/NCCI70I I remember you made a shitpost about the theme that it was too St. Patty's day and the ""Silver Pill"" looked like a band aid. I thought that was just a shitpost (as labeled), not actually feedback and it made me laugh, but now I read your comments here and you didn't even realize what it was for real. The next day, we changed the text color of the banner and background to the color Silver cause hindsight is 20/20, but it was a direct result of your post being inspiration to do so. 

Shortly after I reply with this, I'm gonna reset the upvote/downvote to its original format as it seems to be a legibility issue. The other reasons above could of also attributed to the lower view count of late. 

u/Ditch_the_DeepState On the topic of communication, Dmm and myself struggle to communicate with you outside of these random comments. Is there a way we can reach out and have a more direct line of communication?

"Tekken","t5_2s7yn","Well, to be fair, that's not the only weakness:

* he doesn't have a quick and safe CH move: b1+2 is the only <i13 thing that qualifies, and it's unsafe on block.
* no i12 low either.
* difficult on open stages due to range. His entire kit is designed to push the opponent to the wall to make df3 inescapable, and on an open stage it's much trickier to approach. Keep in mind that with the current tournament rules, an open stage will happen as soon as you win one game (because your opponent wants to win).
* lack of safe approach tools - not a weakness per se, but a limitation. Unlike a lot of characters, his only ""approach"" tool is his armour move, which is unsafe. No wavedashes, no crouchdashes, no FTTAWSBFTMA, not even a Tooth Fairy cancel (Asuka's f2) - he has to dashblock and dashjab a lot.
* he's a little chunky, so sidestepping isn't always easy.

That said, he is still very strong, and extremely underappreciated, but I wouldn't go as far as calling him overpowered: he is very much in line with the Season 2 DLC.

Honestly, I feel like he's a very well designed character: he has obvious weaknesses, and the rest of his kit that is build around them, and keeps him strong. Ganryu is designed to keep up the pressure with jabs, df1, and df3, and collect the payout with df2 and b1+2, but when things don't go his way, he doesn't have much of a comeback potential: even his Rage Drive doesn't compensate for his range weakness much. It is designed to be used from his one happy place: range 0!",1685577639.0

I recognize the context would be wildly different with a historically black fraternity and that many of these would just be extremely rude in general (interrupting performances and stepping into the routine?), but on the hand signals one specifically it is reminding me how one girl we knew in college was absolutely mortified that people would flash the kappa delta (I think, some white sorority) sign at her because she got drunk enough at some point to tell her non sorority friends ""hey this is the secret hand gesture that you shouldn't make because it's the Kappa Delta gesture""",1685577640.0

In EotW it starts when he kills the whitecloaks-- which doesn't translate well to TV. I love what they did with the Whitecloaks in the show-- they're actually a force to be reckoned with instead of a bunch of buffoons. But if Perrin kills two redshirt Whitecloaks in the show ... that's not going to show a modern TV audience something worth being torn up over for the entire course of the show.

I really appreciate the Vietnam-veteran perspective on violence-- killing people, even killing ""baddies"" is traumatizing and is going to hurt a person. Perrin has to deal with the fallout of killing people, and he reacts to it differently than how Rand does or Mat does. Thematically it's great.

But getting that point across in an ensemble fantasy show in 80 episodes is a really big ask. How do we solve the character arc problem of Perrin feeling deep conflict and pain and guilt and shame over his propensity to violence? If we're going to keep that as a core focus of his internal conflict, how do we do that in a succinct way that fits into runtime?",1685577641.0

In principle, this is a day 1 game for me, but I know better than to be excited for a CA game. Their track record has been decent if we set WH aside, but setting that aside is a big fucking ask. WH3 is probably my new favourite game by now, but I generally hardly play video games at this point in my life, so I'm not sure if that attests to how great it is, or simply indicates that I don't know any better.

I don't need it to be a game that I play on the daily for the rest of my life, but when I step away from it, I would like to do it out of contentment. That's how WH2 was for me, I'd take relatively long breaks from it every once in a while, no problem with that. With WH3, I tend take hiatuses out of sheer spite. There's so much that I still wanna do with it, but it rarely works out the way I expect it to.

"Smite","t5_2stl8","All the items off the top of my head that should be a must buy most assault games:

**Defensive:**

* Sentinel's Embrace
* War Banner
* Tainted Breastplate
* Prophetic Cloak
* Gauntlet of Thebes
* Sovereignty
* Heartward
* Stone of Binding
* Contagion/Pestilence
* Shogun's Kusari
* Talisman of Energy
* Relic Dagger
* Emperor's Armor
* Mail of Renewal
* Lono's Mask

**Offensive:**

* Leader's Cowl/Hunter's Cowl
* Brawler's Beatstick
* Pythag's
* Soul Gem
* Divine Ruin

**Healer:**

* Rod of Assclaps/Caduceus Club
* Lotus Sickle

**Situational:**

* Runefordged Hammer
* Erosion
* Spectral Armor
* Winged Blade
* Midgard Mail

Predominantly you need the Guardian and Warrior to build most of these, and usually the assassin can flex into a hybrid build to pick up Lono's.

Your entire team will be incredibly tanky, but still output great damage because of things like Pythag's, Warflag, Shogun's, Talisman, the Cowls, and situational procs from Runefordged/Beatstick. 

Your assassin can skip starter and pickup Lono's late game for the passive since with only a single additional defensive item they'll still get the passive when near your other tanks with their aura items adding 71 physical and 76 magical protections from Embrace, Prophetic, Thebes, Sov & Heartward, and then Lono's adding 35/35.

Relic Dagger is super underrated for the tanks since it's cheap and usually those benefit the whole team.

I could go on about more of these items, and I may be forgetting some, but the stat difference on a team that builds these vs one that doesn't is extremely impactful.",1685577641.0

The first pass effect is a phenomenon in which a drug gets metabolized at a specific location in the body that results in a reduced concentration of the active drug upon reaching its site of action or the systemic circulation. The first pass effect is often associated with the liver, as this is a major site of drug metabolism. However, the first pass effect can also occur in the lungs, vasculature, gastrointestinal tract, and other metabolically active tissues in the body. This effect can become augmented by various factors such as plasma protein concentrations, enzymatic activity, and gastrointestinal motility. The extent to which a patient may experience the first pass effect varies from patient to patient, and this must also be taken into consideration when determining appropriate dosing. If the first-pass effect is exceptionally prominent in a patient, the drug may require administration via a different route to bypass the first-pass effecr",1685577641.0

The size is a huge issue, so to speak. NASA's flame trench at 39A, for Saturn V & Shuttle, would extend from the OLM to the far end of the old suborbital tank farm.

"fidelityinvestments","t5_40w64h","The mega backdoor is a 401k thing, and 401k plans vary in support for this.  If Fidelity administers your 401k you'll want to call them to see if this is possible.  Your plan will need to offer the option for post-tax contributions (this is a different category than Roth), and allow in-service distributions to a Roth IRA or in-service conversions to Roth 401k.  If offered your administrator should be able to walk you through how it works and how to set it up, and what actions you'll need to take going forward.

ETA: Fidelity administers my company's plan and I elect post tax contributions and fund choices in the same screens I use for pre-tax.  My plan supports automatic in-plan conversion to Roth 401k, so it happens transparently every payday, and it was a one-time call to Fidelity to set this up.  Support may vary by plan.",1685577642.0

And, that wasn't even the first time a skirt has been worn by a male; Skirts have been worn by men since prehistoric times. They were the standard dressing for men and women in all ancient cultures in the Middle East. From around 2130 BC during the Old Kingdom of Egypt, men also wore wrap around skirts like kilts.

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","Just stop doing it. Simple.

When COVID began, I decided to stop partaking in take-out food because the last three times I had gotten sick (as in several days of respiratory difficulty, etc) were all immediately after eating restaurant food.

Over 3 years later, I'm still 100% off takeout. People ask me how I did and continue to do it, and for me it was as easy as just deciding it was no longer an option. And anyone who thinks that that's not an option for them is either lying or has a serious and crippling clinical behavioral addiction that needs immediate intervention. To give context on why I believe that to be true, recently one of my relatives (who is one of the people who thinks I'm absolutely insane for swearing off take-out) had to go in for a colonoscopy. In the ~24 hours before a colonoscopy, you can't eat solid foods and you have to take laxatives, etc, and they did it without any issue. My point is, almost everyone would listen to their doctor's orders and fast for 24 hours before a colonoscopy, which tells you that we pretty much all have the willpower to deny ourselves of almost anything.

If you want to use your phone less, don't make it an option for yourself to scroll your free time away. Draw up what you would rather accomplish with your time and what scrolling is costing you.

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","As someone who also has a special needs dog, prioritize your dog. My dog doesn't have mobility issues, but I have to closely monitor his diet and weight because he has a gastrointestinal disorder and becomes extremely underweight and poops and vomits blood if he eats something outside of his diet. Let me tell you, I freaked out when my dog disappeared for 24 hours and didn't come home for dinner. I don't let him run loose, but he had escaped the house while I was asleep. I was freaking out because someone could have taken him in and fed him the wrong food, and sure enough, when he came home the next day he was eating fine, but he started dropping weight again. I've now had to adjust his diet and increase his portions to get him back up to a healthy weight. 

I have called into work multiple times for my dogs (when the time warrants) so please prioritize your dog's needs. Having a dog love you and be your companion for 10 years is much better than pleasing fake friends who only care about you when you do things for them. You can't afford to go to a wedding you already went to, and it is your friend's responsibility to make sure their parents get there, not yours. Either they can be understanding and genuinely apologize, or they can lose you as a friend. Dogs are irreplaceable, and they're a part of the family.

I think players give developers (Not only Fatshark) a lot of leniency, and too much of it. We need to give developers more negative feedback for actions like this. We need to stop giving them benefit of the doubt. 


And it is better for subreddits and other community places to burn - if it makes a potential buyers to turn away (Be it due to the state of the game, or community) - so be it.

 Yep. I said as much in my previous comment. I'm sorry if reading comprehension is too complicated for you. I play for Warhammer, not for Total War. 

&#x200B;

>The Wood Elves used to do actual continent invasions. I guess you didn't play back then? They didn't get part of the Southern Empire and a mountain range that's right next to his settlement - they got the entire Empire and Bretonnia and Southern Realms region and were expanding in every direction.

I did play back then, and that was pretty much what was in progress in my game. They were attacking me as far as Galbaraz and Ekrund (unprovoked, I might add..super defensive behaviour, right?). They were moving on the northern parts of the empire. I and my Chaos/Norsca allies stopped them. They were attempting a continent invasion. Am I only allowed to call it that if they succeeded in capturing every last settlement on the continent? Neither World War involved the whole world, you know.   


Aside from that, some continents in this game literally are ""two screens away"" in size. And the state of their strength years ago is pretty irrelevant now. They may not dominate every game as badly as they did back then, but that doesn't mean they can't be problematic *now*. Hey mate, I put out half of your house-fire, you'll be right. It's not as bad as it *was* so stop complaining*.*

>Your experience isn't, your description of it is nonsensical. You're saying ""OMG MY CAR GOT TOTALLED!"" and when we see your car, someone broke a couple of windows and stole your stereo.

I don't see how. I factually laid out who controlled what and exactly what happened, and you're imagining any emotional reaction because there was none. I still rolled over them easily, because I controlled half the world and Chaos Dwarfs are strong. 

&#x200B;

Dude, how much more ""from the beginning"" do you want than **literally the first comment**?

Face it, you misunderstood my comment and the whole rest of this conversation has been you whacking away at a straw man and me trying to understand why you keep slinging accusations that don't make any sense.


> > If you agree with those, you agree that Hansen's prediction is out of alignment with the predictions of the rest of the literature.  
>  
> Absolutely not! And it seems that Zeke Hausfather, IPCC author, agrees that it is not out of alignment

Wait, so let me get this straight:  

 * (1)  You do agree that his **result** is unrealistic.  
 * (2)  You do not agree that his **prediction** is unrealistic.  

Do you not understand that the **result** we've been talking about *this entire time* was his 10C warming **prediction**?  The one I [helpfully clarified for you]( https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/13r7zke/hansen_et_al_2022_global_warming_in_the_pipeline/jlu45y9/) and then [reminded you of](https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/13r7zke/hansen_et_al_2022_global_warming_in_the_pipeline/jm0t0fz/)?

I don't know if you're just trolling, if you truly have difficulty understanding my comments, or if you're too just too hidebound to let go of your initial misunderstanding of what I've been saying regardless of how much I try to clarify it for you, but regardless of which problem you have, you've made it pretty clear that it's not a good use of my time to continue trying to help you understand what I've been trying to say this whole time.",1685577645.0

If he doesn't sleep so well one night, I'd be pretty liberal with letting him catch up during the day.

"Chefit","t5_2s1da","The identity crisis. The restaurant that once had an identity ends up becoming a jack of all trades, master of none. We have burgers and fries. We also try to sell expensive bottles of wine and liquor. Family friendly atmosphere! Kids eat free on Tuesdays! But we're also a perfect place for a romantic date or a corporate business meeting. We'll have the superbowl playing on a flat screen TV while classy jazz music plays on the speakers.  

Management starts becoming really anal about the cost of everything. If you accidentally scrape a fork into the trashcan, the manager will glove up just to dig it out even if it fell to the bottom underneath a bunch of other shit. Towels get locked up in the office and are only doled out after a bunch of questioning and scrutiny. Why are there two lemon slices for that iced tea? Did someone actually *ask* for two slices? 

Less staff are scheduled. No host or dishwasher during non-peak hours. No more bussers. No more food runners. Management takes a condescending tone when telling you that you don't need all the support staff, you just all need to work together as a team to get the work done. Less servers on the floor and section sizes become enormous. Which, wouldn't be a problem if management hadn't also cut all of the support staff.... Business suffers but management doesn't care about the big picture of poor service further killing business, they just know that labor costs are down and that is good. 

Brunch. Fucking brunch. It's rarely ever done correctly. Usually just haphazardly slapped on the menu without considering the logistics of making it work. 

Coupons. So many restaurants have this ideal vision of a couple rounds of coupons bringing in lots of new business that will turn into repeat customers once they get in and see how great the place is. Nope. Never works. It brings in the cheapskate clientele who won't return unless there's another round of coupons.",1685577646.0

I answered that in another comment. IMO, they don't really talk much about the episode. It's very rushed and they gloss over important moments. As I mentioned, I don't expect anything analytical or in depth, but I feel like between the ads (and yes, I understand people need to get paid), plugs for MR's other podcast and socials, tangents, and the naming of patrons, we really don't get that much before getting to the outro. We maybe get 25 minutes of content about the show that isn't related to ratings, questions, and Ryan's favorite scene.

The other rewatch podcasts that I've listened to seem to be more insightful, which is I think why I have a higher standard.

Did you miss the part where he said Riot doesn‚Äôt need LCS not because NA has no talent or because players are lazy or even because the teams suck. 

No Riot doesn‚Äôt need the LCS because it was never intended to be competitive from his perspective. That was literally said in this video. If you expect it to not be competitive then that‚Äôs the result. Obviously he can‚Äôt really speak for Riot to really say that definitively however as a former CEO I‚Äôd imagine he would have a better read than most others on whether or not Riot has legitimate plausible deniability.",1685577648.0

I‚Äôm certainly not going to blame the animal that was very clearly giving out plentiful and obvious warning signals and was provoked anyway.  

People need to respect animals when they are clearly experiencing stress, overstimulation, or some other unwanted activity.  

In this case she was looking straight at a cat whose ears were fully back and with tail swishing rapidly.  She was imposing her will on this cat, and the cat was NOT HAVING IT.

Hopefully she learned a valuable lesson about respecting a cat‚Äôs boundaries.  

This is NOT the cat‚Äôs fault.  This person was NOT a five year old child that doesn‚Äôt know any better.  She provoked the cat, fucked around, and found out.  Lesson:  If a cat is telling you to back off, leave it alone.  Let trained vets with appropriate safety gear handle this.",1685577649.0

"Postpartum_Depression","t5_31ndt","I struggle with what I would call moderate anxiety and have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and social anxiety. I first want to empathize with you and acknowledge that you are dealing with a difficult thing.

Some things that have helped me over the years is making time for myself to exercise. Cardio works best, but strength training does help put that nervous energy into something healthy and productive. I have less circular thinking and gnawing/nausea in my stomach when I work out. 

Journaling is also a good way to put those anxieties down. I view it as me confronting them in a physical form. It made them seem smaller and helped me complete the thought rather than focusing on one step over and over. 

I don't know how much you rely on caffeine, but cutting it back or out of your diet completely does help with anxiety. I'm a stubborn son of a gun so I have cut back to two cups maximum a day.

Lastly, think of all the things that you are juggling and you have on your plate. Most likely you are doing it all and that keeps people like us wound tight and on edge. I would seriously look at your to-do list and see what things can you do less often to give yourself some breathing room.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Ehhhhh, I don't think that's what the commenter was trying to say at all. I also think it's important to call attention to the ways in which the stigma experienced by men when they seek support is unique. Needing mental health support is seen as a weakness, and being weak means you're less of a man. This isn't really a stigma that exists for women in a universal way where the concept of femininity is explicitly linked to not needing mental health support. 

I mean, I know this is TwoX. But I think this was an overreaction to what he said, and I think it helps us as women to acknowledge the differences. The poster wasn't being like ""but what about men's problems""‚ÄîI interpreted it as ""this is why addressing men's problems is so important, because if I'd had this education growing up I could have been better to women."" 

It was solutions-oriented, and not said in a way that took anything away from women's problems. Am I making sense?",1685577650.0

"deloitte","t5_2sjf5","I've had a long career in industry. I've been with Deloitte for a year-ish. Parts of Deloitte knock it out of the park. Other parts fall under ""jobs are here to earn us money""

For the most part everyone I've met has been smart, willing to dig in and work, and are kind and easy to work with. In fact a few weeks ago I was involved in a conversation where someone was talking about gender differences in the workplace with regards to 'what is polite' etc... My only response was that compared to my prior workplaces everyone was incredibly polite and inclusive. Does that mean I haven't encountered some people who were not polite or friendly? Nope - assholes have been found. But on a proportional basis? VERY low count. 

The main downside for me? In a firm this big, it can be hard to feel like you are a contributor to the success of the company. My prior career was mostly filled with making quick impact that was noticeable if not through a whole company, at least the whole division within a few months. At a year in, I feel like I'm starting to make an impact that might be noticed by a dozen people... It has been tough on the ego ;) 

Do somethings about working in a partnership vs a company baffle me? absolutely. I would kil for an org chart some days

Am I planning to retire from here? Possibly but not likely but retirement is 20+ years away so only time will tell

When we start out, I do start to dissociate more and more until we switch. I dont know what parts switch out, but I know there are at least two. 

It can vary, but usually I have some awareness of what's going on, just very detached from it. We can be right in the middle of it, the body keeps going and acting on its own, and I'm just watching it occur and thinking about something totally different. Then I'll lose time and come back again to present, but still, the body keeps going. It's less like we all want a turn and more like I'm forced out.  Has a more negative or triggering feeling.

Should also note that we vary from asexual and cringing away from any touch, to sex being the only important thing.  Its either hyper-sexual or hypo-sexual. Never a middle ground. Still working out who likes what and what causes this.",1685577651.0

They have sold out two years straight of shows in the US at places that range from 5-12k people capacity.

Just had a major Europe tour for the last couple months.

It's kinda hard to use selling 20k+ stadiums for a band that has been around 30 years, to a band not even half that old with much more variety to their music.

Check them out - I highly recommend them to anyone who likes rock music.

Edit: I say generic with no intention of that being a slight to FF. King Gizzard is in my top three bands right next to FF and Avenged Sevenfold. I put them in the same class of mastering the broad ""rock"" genre.",1685577652.0

So yeah, you've got all of the pilots on shift at once maneuvering evening into place, but you've got all the acft mx crew chiefs marshalling them all out (and waiting to marshall them back when it's done), munitions troops that probably spent a few hours building all those bombs (most of which were probably already built, but I'm sure they had to do an extra build to have everything available), putting them on trailers, and towing them out to the flight line at 15 mph.

Then the weapons troops had to actually put all this stuff on the jets, which takes about 5-10 minutes per jet, depending on the crew. 15 if they run into problems.

I'd be willing to bet not all of these jets are fit to fly right now, or at least I'd say a couple or 5 of them are having maintenance deferred on them while the mx crews stand by waiting to continue work. Paint barn, fuel cell, avionics, egress-those are all separate career fields, and I'd say at least half of them are just waiting for their jets to come back to continue work.

And when you work on aircraft they are supposed to take munitions off of them. So ammo and weapons are also standing by waiting to unload/restore a lot of those bombs/missiles.

"cybersecurity","t5_2u559","Maybe you should be thankful that I took the time to give you some guidance instead of being soft and sensitive. It rubbed you the wrong way because it was true. I see identical posts on LinkedIn everyday. People complaining that no one will give them a chance. I click on their page and they don't have one cert. They're just gonna hit easy apply and be flooded with offers right? No networking, just a degree (or worse a 3 month boot camp). 

That means you didn't do any research on what it takes to get a first job in this field. You mean to tell me you applied for 150+ jobs and didn't notice that any of them required a sec + or vendor cert?

Did you speak with any pros in the field? Did you ever read any posts here? Sir, that's a low level of effort. Good news is, instead of giving up, you can increase your level of effort and start seeing some success.

Nothing I said was false. You're not competing near the necessary level to be noticed compared to your peers (me). I'm trying to save you from wasting years trying the same low effort attempt thinking it will work in another field. All medicine doesn't taste good going down. I'm thankful for the people who gave it to me straight when it hurts.

My husband, despite having the same title as me, essentially WAS management at this point, which is partly why he was working so hard. The bad management issue was exacerbated when a tragic incident left us with no official manager, and instead there was an absentee interim manager and a completely clueless assistant manager, both of whom ‚Äúdid not work weekends‚Äù. I contacted both of them numerous times as well when this incident was happening.

My husband fell sick the Sunday of a long 3 day weekend, both the interim manager and assistant manager were out of town. Normally he would call in sick to them. I didn‚Äôt go into further detail bc of post limit (which was very frustrating, I feel like there‚Äôs a lot of background detail I had to leave out, resulting in me saying the same things over and over again) but a more detailed version of what happened was on Sunday night I offered to cover for him, he said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see how I feel tomorrow morning, if I‚Äôm feeling better by 1 I‚Äôll go in‚Äù and then he was still asleep at 1, so I went in.",1685577653.0

I don't even look at her or talk to her, I just get up, she runs into the living room and I close the door behind her, and then she gets to be bored on her own for 3 hours until we get up. Doesn't sound like fun to me. 

We've tried just not getting up when she wakes us and pretending to sleep, but it's impossible unfortunately. If we ignore her when she meows and jumps on us, she'll move on to biting or scratching at our faces, which obviously we can't just let her do. So yeah, recently we have taken to just shutting her in a different room at night, which means we get a good night's sleep but it is a big shame because we both really love sleeping with her. I just wish there was a way of getting her to sleep longer :(

And yes, we play and interact with her a lot during the day. She has 10 minutes of petting and loving first thing before breakfast (she won't eat until she's had her morning cuddles!), then 10 minutes of high energy play just before work. If I'm working from home, I play with her for 15 minutes on my lunch break. Then after work, she gets 30 minutes of cuddles and playtime before dinner, another 20 minute play session after dinner, then a final 20 minutes of high energy play followed by supper last thing before bedtime. I always make sure to really tire her out before bed. She goes to sleep when we do and stays asleep for several hours but she gets us up at dawn no matter what",1685577653.0

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

>Ôº∏ What is the difference between „ÅÆ and „Åå ?

>‚óØ I saw a book called Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÁü•„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑÊó•Êú¨Ë™û , why is „ÅÆ used there instead of „Åå ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

>Ôº∏ What does this mean?

>‚óØ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

>Ôº∏ What's the difference between ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè?

>‚óØ Jisho says ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does ÂÖ®„ÅèÂêåÊÑü„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between „ÅØ and „Åå ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

"40kLore","t5_2zdqr","The majority of DAoT equipment is fairly mundane. Just about all non-Cawl imperial tech is from the DAoT, and this is even more true for the LoV.

For context on STC guns, the big invention that allowed humans to beat the men of Iron was volkite. Volkite weapons are very impressive of course, but they are wholly incomparable to pulse weapons, gauss weapons, adrathic weapons etc.

It's not 100% the scenario you described, but there is a world named Amenophis IV that has a lot of DAoT tech, a robust but not full STC, and is ruled by an evil AI mastermind from the DAoT. The Tau encountered it, reached a stalemate when they fought it militarily, then decided to blockade/quarantine it using their orbital supremacy. Their concern was that the AI would spread to nearby human worlds and give them a huge technological boost/eliminate the Tau's technological superiority over humanity.

I know for me storing my tools in the work van, leaving it over night, stress of a new site, eventually getting over dealing with angry construction workers or overly curious homeowners-at a certain point it gets to be too much. A change of pace is nothing wrong, you mention spending too much time with significant other and I can understand what it‚Äôs like working for them directly as that can be an issue in itself. However a break from anything can be a good thing and it‚Äôs not wrong to explore new options especially when it comes to something you do every day. Honestly I wish you the best in whatever choice you make and hope that you and your family prosper in the utmost. Time apart is good, don‚Äôt make it an exclusive thing and try to include parts where you enjoy things together even when it coincides with your personal time because spending time together that you both enjoy is probably the most important part of a drastic change to the regular schedule. Worst case you go back to your trade, even considering another option usually means you are not satisfied in what you are doing currently.

I also use ancient dragon and fortissax but imo those are trash in 1v1, very telegraphed and easy to dodge, they are only good in chaotic situations like invasions or 2v2 3v3s. So u can use those 2 slots for something else maybe.

Forgot about catch flame which is incredibly good.
Wrath of gold is very good aswell specially for invasions and also giant flame take theee.
Placi is good for finishing someone (cheap af imo) but costs 3 slots, i personally don't use it very much

"disability","t5_2qhe8","Ambulatory wheelchair users are a whole legitimate group of people!

It sounds like the cane alone isn't doing the job for you right now.  It's perfectly valid to use a wheelchair for pain.  I have EDS and have never tried a wheelchair myself (in part because my upper extremities are worse than my lowers on the hypermobility front and I'd get a repetitive use injury in a heartbeat with a manual wheelchair!), but it's sure an option.  If you haven't tried a rolling walker with a seat, that's another thing to consider.  Cheaper and you'll get it faster.  I bop around between occasionally doing things without an aid, my cane, and my European style rollator.  Anything is better for back/leg pain for me than hands-free walking.  But sometimes I'm okay over short distances or I really need both of my hands for work or something.  

Short answer: Whatever mobility aids work best for you are the best aids for you.  Don't feel stuck with just one.  You can have several and use what the situation/your body requires at any given time.",1685577656.0

I'm a fan of nice cheeses, but tbh I think going to a deli and buying some nice cheeses is better value than these jars. Sure I might pay $30-40 a kilo for a nice cheese at the deli, but that is probably still cheaper than the jar, because the jar is not all cheese!",1685577656.0
"Warframe","t5_2urg0","I just hate the grinding they introduced and the pointless day and night cycle restrictions.

Like I dont want to, fish, mine etc. forever to play the game and build the weapons and frames. In addition to the RNG rare mats you need to farm for and the ammount of RNG is involved to farm for specific materials its just ass.

I dont mind farming standing for level up but having to farm standing for purchasing stuff is just ass let me use the infinite ammount of credits for it.

Mining sucks, fishing sucks, animal hunting sucks etc. I just dont like it as this game is just not made for it, its clunky and annoying especially when you constantly get interrupted by enemies

Zariman with the Holdfast faction probably did it best missions with room to explore and do something diffrent. You get mats by just playing missions and dont need to farm fish, minerals, animals etc. to get frames, weapons or other things.

Other than that I dont mind the open world its a nice cut between the tight hallways but I just hate the timegating that still exists for returning or new players, they need so much time to catch up.

Best would be if they would just increase the standing cap over time and make it more friendly to people who catch up or are new to the game.",1685577656.0
"WeMo","t5_2y7fo","I think IoT isn't really ready for Prime Time.  Basically, *none* of the IoT platforms (not just Wemo, but also Kasa, Caseta, Meross, Govee, etc.) work the way they should, at least not in their as-delivered states.

For me, setting up AutomationManager was much ***much*** easier to implement than the only other option, which would've been to run cables through walls and foundations, and then to program and install sensors and a Raspberry Pi to control it all.  At least Wemo's local API is sufficiently diverse to allow sophisticated (read: *useful*) control of a smart-device environment.  As far as I can tell, none of the other platforms come even close to offering the type of flexibility that AutomationaManager exploits in the Wemo local API.

There's also the other problem with cloud-based IoT, and that is security.  The idea of opening my LAN up to a server 24/7 that is located in God-knows-where, and over which I have no control, does not give me a ""warm feeling.""",1685577656.0

There's an option mentioned that is a ""fresh air option."" My basic understanding is that an external intake is installed with a damper that can open and close. So the system can adjust how much air comes from inside and outside.

Great in summer afternoons when you get home and it's hotter inside than out. 

Also fresh air is good for you? 

Our intake is in a space of the house where I can open a window to achieve this. While it would be nice to do this with a tap of the finger on your phone from anywhere.

I don‚Äôt recall him saying either way, though in fairness he fears enough to keep Jon secret. In any case, this hypothetical is a lame equivocation to what Cersei did.

The analogy just doesn‚Äôt work at all. The equivalent to Mace and Olenna here is Aerys, who murdered Ned‚Äôs father and brother and demanded his and Robert‚Äôs execution without basis.

I agree with the doctor ‚Äî the stigma of HSV is worse than the disease itself in most cases. This article goes into some detail: https://like-antennas-to-heaven.medium.com/i-thought-i-had-herpes-for-seven-months-the-overstigmatized-public-health-clusterfuck-that-is-eb5c9da7926b

It‚Äôs also considered publicly acceptable to not know your HSV status. By asking your partners to test, you‚Äôre putting them at risk of a highly stigmatizing diagnosis, which could last much longer your relationship.

At the same time, it‚Äôs lucky and rare that you don‚Äôt have it, as new research is implicating HSV in dementia: https://twitter.com/PGeldsetzer1/status/1661776663074738176

And of course, you have the right to ask for whatever you would like. 

My advice: your desire for multiple lifetime partners and your desire to not contract HSV are at odds, and will result in stigmatizing diagnoses for some of your partners for minimal benefit to you. I wouldn‚Äôt ask someone else to get tested for HSV unless they also felt the same way as you about it.",1685577658.0

"Spiritfarer","t5_12tdil","I've played through the game twice and the first time I completely agreed with you. I loved Astrid and I felt for her, dealing with this bum who didn't appreciate how much she had chased him and loved him. Watching her hurt was hard.

The second time though, I found some nuance in it. Giovanni is a tragedy to others and to himself. He so committed himself to the idea of burning bright that he goes fast, and burns everyone around him on the way. I think he really does love Astrid, as much as he's able; I also think he hurts her. I think he genuinely adores Stella, and maybe the reason we only ever get a glimpse of the darkness and trauma lurking underneath his persona is because he's attempting to hide it from her, and that's love for him.

I think, especially in online spaces, we very easily draw lines and define people and things as good and evil. Cheating = evil, therefore cheaters = evil. And like, to be frank with you? I find it really hard to shake that conception even as I'm arguing against it. I think cheating is cruel and morally reprehensible and I would think less of anyone I knew to have done it. 

And yet. I really struggle to define Giovanni that way. I don't condone his actions and I don't like that he hurts Astrid. But I can understand why he is the way he is, and I think he isn't lying when he say he loves Astrid or Stella. I think him and Astrid are unhealthy for each other, and I think there's good reason they gravitate to each other. It feels like a disservice to their complexity to say ""Astrid is a victim and Giovanni's just a cheating jerk"". 

At the end of the day, you don't have to like him. But I appreciate that the game made me empathise with someone who at first glance, seems to be a self-absorbed jerk. I still think he's a self-absorbed jerk at the end of the day, but I also think that's just one element of him.",1685577658

My direct answer to your question: Many people in Ireland would wish the gardai spend their time dealing with anti-social behaviour that makes people feel unsafe in cities such as Dublin, rather than pursuing individuals who are in possession of a natural plant. 

People who consume cannabis are not violent, not anti-social, not a menace to other people or society in any way or manner whatsoever, and basically just want to be left alone to enjoy their life. If we're thinking of the effects on humanity, cannabis should be legal and alcohol illegal, but due to vested interests it's arse-ways-up in Ireland and many other places. Thankfully, this is beginning to change in developed countries, though Ireland is well behind the curve.",1685577659.0

At least Pacino's kids can see his movies from over the years and sort of grow up with the movies he did as he grew too. People are insanely pessimistic, good lord.",1685577659.0

I always make a point to remind people that labor isn't a charity - it's a transaction. Nobody owes this company their labor if they don't feel the wage is worth their time/effort, and that quitting is absolutely 100% valid in a ""free market"" of labor.

Theres no actual evidence that the increase in cognitive capacity is due to random genetic mutations.  In fact, we know that people with higher IQs tend to have LESS children, meaning that the probability of passing on genetic mutations for higher IQ is actually less favorable towards reproductive success. 

We also know that IQ capacity is genetically coded for. 

Yet, we see across the board, IQ is increasing.  Since genetic mutations cannot be relied upon to explain this phenomenon, i challenge you to provide an alternative theory. 

Of you cannot, then you arent really qualified to speak on the matter.  Not that it would stop you since we know youll make claims (without evidence) that research scientists are wrong because...""trust me bro.""

My husband (31M) and I (26F) will often spend time on the couch together after work, especially on weekdays. We might watch an hour or two of a television show or movie. Often, my husband will stretch out on the couch and rest his head in my lap or on my shoulder. It's sweet and a nice way to spend time together. We chat while watching the show too which is enjoyable.  

Recently, he has gotten into the habit of falling asleep during the process. I'm talking zonking out for the whole period of time we are meant to be watching the show. I can either poke him every five minutes to half wake him up and try to finish the show or just abandon the whole process. Watching a show might be the only time I get to spend with him on busy days. 

I understand if he is tired after a busy day at work and needs a nap on occasion and needs to take a rain check. Sleep is important for health and some days are just so busy that there might not be room for social time. What frustrates me is the fact he will do this nearly every night and often after his 1-2 nap, stay up well past what would be a reasonable time to go to sleep so he can play videogames knowing he needs to go to work in the morning. This nap during what is meant to be quality time has become a habit for the past several weeks, with the video game time after midnight seemingly getting longer and longer. 

After work, I want to spend time with my husband but he can't seem to be bothered to keep his eyes open. Yet he has time for hours of videogames. It's... Disheartening and frustrating. I don't think he is doing it on purpose.

The truth is we don't know how progressive this is and we will be finding out soon if the rumors that this is a long term death sentence.

Something like neurological hiv - closest definition of what it appears to be.

If the dark web is correct most people have a decade or less to live.

Plus many will die from sudden heart attacks and strokes due to vaccine related injuries.

The pandemic is far from over and another big wave of the bioweapon might be upon us if things in China mirror what will happen when this new strain arrives.

Each strain just increases the viral load in the brain and then deposites inactive? Viral fragments in a organ which seems the vary with strains.

God help us if it is what I think it is, the world will definitely go to war with China eventually and this will definitely be part of the reason.

Follow the links in the comments in the story above for supporting proof.

The thing is this is a fragment of the original leak it's all I could find, what I read originally was far more disturbing and the thing is I watched for months leaked videos coming out if Wuhan some of the worst faces of death type videos of what was happening behind the iron curtin as they closed the world off from Wuhan.

Needless to say the article came out before covid hit the usa hard and spelled out it was neurological in nature but made to appear as the flu, the trick is a virus doesn't have to kill the host immediately to be effective especially if you want to get everyone.

So they put a timer in the genetic code of a secondary virus that is deeply embedded in the rna of the Coronavirus which they chose because of their very controversial experiments on gain function research and the Corona viruses unusual size being much larger than most viruses, allowed the p-4 lab of virology to splice in other dangerous viruses.   It's designed to continue to evolve until it reaches a peak lethality over the span of a decade at which point the strain will wipe people out in hours to days like what happened with the original strain that wiped most of Wuhan out and then to beat the counter measures of the quarantine the virus split itself into two lesser more aggressively contagious, which is what has been passed around and is still changing ever working its way back to the super deadly version.

It's one of the reason our military did drills, they're planning for when the mutant strains the deadly ones that will begin to pop up in the next few years to extinguish them quickly. 

Hopefully second and third generation vaccines that are less harmful and more protection will offer some relief.

Many of the vaccines currently available have a strong long term risk vectors.

So definitely do your homework,  I went with Kbp-201 and JJ vaccine a week later.

Combing those vaccines probably almost killed me but I ran cycle therapy and boosted all my bodies functions with state of the art rx - supplemented and more.

That being said if you want to increase your chances of not dying first in a few years from pesissilence.

Mask - kn95 higher
Social distance
Take antivirals- several rx are really good Ambol(russian) valacyclovir, Acyclovir,famciclovir to name a fee.
Supplements - chaga mushrooms, turkey tail, ashwangda, zinc, meylthelene Blue, benadryl + lactafarrin, cbd, echinacea, nac, nacet, selank, peptides like Thymosin Alpha-1 (TA-1) etc black seed current oil and many many more.

This is what is coming, hopefully I'm wrong - but the evidence is shaping up to be the sum of all fears.

Keeping healthy is also keen.

Everyone has long covid its just the majority - it hasn't bloomed yet inside them. 

Most the virus is sleeping still then out of no where they'll think they caught covid again as they'll become postive again without infection and stay sick and chronically like the current long haulers begin to break down and eventually they'll just stop functioning like being able to care for themselves and others or they'll go crazy with rage and kill everything around them.

Good luck, and I hope you make it.

"ApplyingToCollege","t5_2y2r8","On the commonapplication, where you apply to schools. you have 10 slots for activities and 5 slots for awards.

what determines an EC, is the actual activity, where and went, your role, time spent, and a description of what you did throughout that activity.

If you get an award(s) in that EC, you can use a slot in the awards section to describe that award(s). if you win multiple awards in one ACTIVITY, you can use one slot in the awards section.

\---

lets say you are selected to partake in a research program or camp. The award is being selected to participate, but the activity is the actual participation/what you did at that camp.

an internship would be an EC. however, if it was a competitive internship through a selective program you had to apply for, you can also say that being selected was an award.

any awards you win in clubs or competitions are not ECs and you can NOT list them in your activity description. 

\---

examples from your post that are awards not ecs:

* **Scioly 1st place medals** @ States + top 3 placements at Yale Invitational
* **3rd place** at State Science Fair
* **4th place state team in MAO**
* **Qualifed to states** as a Rookie FTC Team

People being critical about the game is okay; the game sold incredibly well and that gives the developers the chance to take that criticism and improve upon the solid foundation that is hogwarts legacy. People tend to hone in on the negatives and that can absolutely be frustrating, but it doesn't mean people didn't enjoy the game.",1685577664.0

No, I care about a just world where people get to keep the fruits of their labor instead of having it stolen by landlords and shareholders who provide nothing except having been born rich or stolen enough to qualify.

‚Ä¢What - It‚Äôs a 12 part course with exercises and tests to help you obtain a foundation & or a new driving style.

‚Ä¢Who - This is for inexperienced players having a hard time accomplishing drift zones or people who want to try a new driving style.

‚Ä¢Why - Many people have a difficult time with Forza drifting so I put this together so people without direction or a foundation can have some guidance. Use this foundation to build off of. After you pass the school, I recommend mastering manual shifting & or rwd drifting.

‚Ä¢When - I strongly recommend only moving on to the next level when you score a B or higher, otherwise you‚Äôll have issues completing the next level. Early levels should be aced!

‚Ä¢How - The intro will explain how to set up your car & settings but if you want to try vehicles already set up, try the 3 tunes below. You‚Äôll still need to turn off traction control though. These multipurpose setups/cars can often be used in drift zones, speed zones/traps, danger signs & Trail Blazers.

If you have any questions, just ask. Good luck!

You said you don't know how the experiment ended? That also sounds like something you need to think harder on. Maybe I am wrong and it was something else entirely. Something happened that started this, and you need to find out what in order to address it. Are you paying attention in your marriage? Can't remember what happened to start this, can't remember how the experiment ended, don't have any idea why your husband resents you, etc.  And I hope you can come up with a reason, or simply ask him and get an answer, because if you can't find a reason, then the outlook is not good.

I found nothing wrong with the UK hostings efforts.  It's hosts were great, the presentation was done properly, efficiently, sometimes a bit quick.  The only thing I do have a bit of a gripe with is how there wasn't that much flair to its personality for it; I guess because it's a joint production with Ukraine that it didn't want to shine a complete light on what the UK is and tourism etc.  


The ones that bring to my mind great hosting efforts are Germany 2011, Denmark 2014, Austria 2015 and Sweden 2016.  I'm not talking about the songs, but just the overall Eurovision hosting of the country and its themes and production value, effort and feel.  That said, there are pros and cons!  2016 does have a great party aesthetic but could tone it down on the glow effect on the whole thing.  2015 is very rigid with its (understandable) homage to orchestral works; and 2014 has a crazy concept of a stage where some acts just couldn't live up to its potential.",1685577666.0

With that said i'm currently trying to decide on an actual color accurate monitor that isn't super expensive, like in benq pd or Asus proart. I'm not a professional, just a hobbyist. I have a day job, but it sucks to mismatch colors after hours of trying to make it perfect.

Btw I don't know what panel this uses and stuff, but it's probably similar to the ktc panels MSI is using, based on similar wording such as quantum dot and the general consensus of oversaturation. It's not Wacom pro, but it's also not 2200$.",1685577666.0

Meditation really helps me with this and just deeply contemplating the fact that I don‚Äôt need to hoard food or eat it right now. I can have more later. I can get the recipe and make it another day. I can just have a taste and it‚Äôs good enough. I‚Äôm not going to miss out on anything by skipping special foods sometimes.

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

"stupidpol","t5_hitz3","The British Thatcher government was pulling back from overseas participation both militarily and politically for cost saving measures (Tories do what they do). The literal fascist government of Argentina at the time wanted to gain public approval after years of systemic oppression so they manufactured a war over the Falklands, claiming them as integral territory.

However the Falklands/Las Malvinas were never part of Argentina at any point in history. They had been claimed by Spain in the 19th century and then colonized by settlers from the British Isles, mainly welsh and Scottish. The inhabitants did not want to be Argentine, and still vote against it these days.

The Argentine government was warned by the United States (who had been helping to prop up the regime) about fighting the United Kingdom, warning that the British military was professional and capable, and still a world power, even if weakened.

Innocent, kind men with families died as a result of this war. The silver lining was that the inevitable British victory was the catalyst for the other throwing of the Junta that had been harming its people for so long.

Leftists at the time in the United Kingdom opposed intervention, out of ideology, and still talk about renegotiation to patriate the Falklands to Argentina, in spite of the democratic wishes of the Islanders. 

Orwell wasn‚Äôt wrong when he spoke about the disdain of the left for their own country, and they will continue to struggle against the working classes in spite of themselves, even when they have have many policies that would actually help the country.

Florida just cut off a huge amount of their labor workforce with the immigration laws, agriculture, service and construction industry is coming to a halt. Not to mention the every increasing home and auto insurance rates based on the few insurance companies left in FL and now housing is going to go further thru the roof due to new construction coming to a snails pace. Tons of ppl moving here and hurricanes wiping out entire communities makes everyone pressed to find housing - rent and house prices go up further. We are at risk of losing more business everyday with Disney who funds a very big portion of the states economy not to mention the travel warnings due to discrimination bills being signed into law that will kill our tourism money... Those are just a few ways Florida is not such a great place to live or even visit now.

It's beautiful here for sure but it's a sinking ship my friend.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Forgive me, but I don‚Äôt think I can accept your viewpoint. When someone is starving, their stomach shrinks, and it becomes incredibly difficult for them to accept food without feeling sick. The solution is not to continue to let them starve. The solution is to start with liquids, or soft foods that they can digest in small portions, and build up until the person is able to eat normally. 

In the same way, I can‚Äôt accept that there is such a thing as not being ‚Äúin a place‚Äù to accept care, because the bottom line is, **you need care.** Whether it‚Äôs received in small doses, such as a hug, a kiss on the cheek, an ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù an, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll help you clean your room,‚Äù or in another form is completely dependent on the individual.

"fountainpens","t5_2s0ew","Before getting my Pilot 823, I had a TWSBI Vac 700R. The Pilot feels better in the hand, writes nicer (subjective!) and feels like even better quality.
Would the TWSBI be enough? Yes. 
Is the Pilot 823 better and nicer? Yes.
Is it 3x better? No.
Is a fountain pen for 20 bucks (e.g. Lamy Safari) good enough? Yes.
Do I enjoy writing with a Lamy Safari or my TWSBI as much as with my Pilot 823? No. 

tl;dr This is really subjective. A more expensive pen will probably feel nicer and be better made. This doesn't mean that expensive things are always better quality though. Do your research for each product and decide yourself it it's worth it.
For example I also have a Pilot 743. The nib is as nice as the 823 obviously, but the body feels lighter and cheaper in a somehow lower quality way, because of the different construction (converter vs vacuum filler). This doesn't mean it is objectively lower quality, but.it feels that way. Writing is a very haptic thing after all. I wouldn't buy it again and get another 823 instead.",1685577669.0

They've been really great for so long now that people forget how insanely mediocre they were for decades, from 1989-2007 they made the playoffs twice, didn't actually win a playoff series til 2008, lost the NLCS in 08 and 09, then another 3 year drought before the current owners bought the team in 2012.

Second, minor gods are (most of the time) specialized, which helps in achieving very specific goals. I use a ranking system similar to Goetia, for example.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","That‚Äôs anxiety getting to you sprinkled with a possible dose or two of reality. 

*Dose(s) of reality:*

Generally speaking, nobody likes to be stared at. If you find that you‚Äôre staring without any verbal exchange, that may potentially be unsettling. Striking up small talk helps, or at least being mindful of how long you‚Äôre looking at someone. Occasional glances are usually harmless, despite feeling awkward when you lock eyes during them. You have consider women‚Äôs perspective. Anyone could be a potential predator or sexual threat among the many other things they keep in mind while traversing about. Those worries are certainly understandable, so I‚Äôd not take anything personal in that arena. 

*Anxiety getting to you:* 

Although body language and physical activity can signal things, you don‚Äôt necessarily know precisely what someone‚Äôs thinking unless they verbalize it. You‚Äôre probably a bit too harsh on yourself if you assume personal responsibility for a stranger deciding to leave instead of waiting at the bus stop with you. Take a bit of neutral view. Zoom out. Subtract gender here also. You‚Äôre strangers. Not common or usual to be totally comfortable around folks you don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs not on you at all. Totally benign. Normal. Often. I don‚Äôt really like being in close proximity to strangers for extended periods of time, regardless of their appearance/gender/etc. This is usually because I don‚Äôt like lines anyway. The act of waiting can drum up some anxiety because the unknown variables mount up with time. More people arrive, more unknowns. Would be much simpler if it was just me here doing this, but others need to as well. In example, long lines at checkout in a store. 

Glances are also not a sign of being creepy. Just be mindful of how often they occur. If you‚Äôve not spoken to this person or introduced yourself, you‚Äôre still a stranger HOWEVER remember the neutral view. Have you asked yourself why she might be looking at you? Maybe she‚Äôs simply noticing your presence and wondering about you, if you‚Äôve never spoken with each other. Familiarity builds comfort. Unfamiliarity builds curiosity, hesitation, etc. 

Anytime you find yourself spiraling into a mental label of yourself as creepy, keep in mind there‚Äôs a slim chance you‚Äôre accurate when trying to guess someone‚Äôs thoughts. The girl at the bus stop may have forgotten something and went to get it, hoping to make it back in time or catch a ride with a friend. The girl in class may find herself looking around when her mind wanders and it just so happen that you‚Äôre in her looking path, causing the occasional intersection of glances. She might not be thinking about you at all, possibly pondering subject matter in her mind or planning out her weekend, reliving a distant memory, etc. you don‚Äôt know.

"SaturnStormCube","t5_46kulq","I mentioned in the past about  the positioning of the Saturn during WW1, WW2 and 2001. Saturn was either entering, in or leaving the Aries constellation. Aries is considered the God of War. 

Aries briefly entered Aries during the 60s but didn't stay there so there wasn't huge tension for a world War. 

Then it entered Aries again in like 2000 which we had that 10-20 year War in Iraq. 

Saturn is entering Aries on 2027 so something big is cooking with this Agenda 2030. 

There's also the alignment of Jupiter and Saturn to look out for too. It happens every 20 years. There was an alignment in 2000/2001 near 9/11 and the previous one which happened in 2020 when Covid hit. Next alignment is around 2040.

There's also some E.T. information pertaining to 2027 date. Theres this pleadian channeler that was talking about the Anunnaki moving us through a phase they call the changeover. To them, its a week because they live millions of year but for us its 2013-2027. We are already seeing the changes happening. 2012 was the Mayans date for ending of an age and entering a new age, not the apocalypse. According the Indigenous peoples, we are moving from the Age of the Animal to the Age of the Human. Age of Animal, we were to learn everything about animals i.e. scientists say the dog helped evolve man. The age of the Human is when we either become intergalactic or we reset ourselves again.",1685577669.0

I would already consider myself qualified for such a position. I currently work as a cabinet maker. I'm 27. I've spent the last seven years basically obsessing over side projects and constantly teaching myself new skills and abilities. I'm fascinated with welding and machining, I've purchased for myself Tig, and mig machines,  a lathe, and basically have my own small shop. I've built welders from scratch before (I specifically am obsessed with electricity). I've built trailers and roof racks and my milling machine. I've restored motorcycles and chopped frames. I've built wind turbine generators from scratch, stator and all. I've created rc cars from scratch and I'm also very good at 3d modelling. All this to say I would consider myself competent in such a role.

My friends are all starting to do these programs sponsored by their employers, for example one friend got his CDL and drives trucks through his employer, another friend is doing the EMT program to become a firefighter, etc. How do I get involved in a program like this where im basically locked in to a career? I don't have the time or the patience or really the money to just play around at a community college for four years just to get a bullshit piece of paper that doesn't even guarantee anything. I've tried researching this stuff and seeking help from career advisors but I'm always just lead back in a circle to paying an institution to teach me things I already know. 

In the past I went through a program called BICSI which is basically an electrician but specifically for data cabling, but I only did that because my grandmother actually taught the course and showed me how to enroll. I was paid for doing this program, but was cut short due to covid. We were working at the Facebook data center here and they cut all the interns. I was ok with this honestly because i found the subject incredibly boring. 

I'm honestly getting so frustrated seeing my peers continue to grow and advance their incomes and lives while I'm stuck in this stranglehold the economy has me in and frankly I'm starting to feel very hopeless and depressed and I would just really appreciate some advice. I honestly wish I just had someone to tell me what to do at this point.",1685577670.0

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Thanks for your submission /u/Trying2Understand69, but it has been removed for the following reason:

Disallowed question area: **Rant or loaded question** 

NoStupidQuestions is a place to ask any question as long as *it's asked in good faith*. Our users routinely report questions that they feel violate this rule to us. Want to avoid your question being seen as a bad faith question? Common mistakes include (but are not limited to): 

* Rants: Could your question be answered with *'That's awful'* or *'What an asshole'*? Then it's probably a rant rather than a genuine question. Looking for a place to vent on Reddit? Try /r/TrueOffMyChest or /r/Rant instead.

* Loaded questions: Could your question be answered with *'You're right'*? Answering the question yourself, explaining your reasoning for your opinion, or making sweeping assumptions about the question itself all signals that you may not be keeping an open mind. Want to know why people have a different opinion than you? Try /r/ExplainBothSides instead!

* Arguments: Arguing or [sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lioning) with people giving you answers tells everyone that you have an answer in mind already. Want a good debate? Try /r/ChangeMyView instead!

* Pot Stirring: Did you bring up unnecessary topics in your question? Especially when a topic has to do with already controversial issues like politics, race, gender or sex, this can be seen as trying to score points against the Other Side - and that makes people defensive, which leads to arguments. Questions like *""If _____ is allowed, why isn't _____?""* don't need to have that comparison - just ask *'why isn't ____ allowed?'*.

* Complaining about moderation: If you disagree with how the sub is run or a decision the mods have made, that's fine! But please share your thoughts with us in modmail rather than as a public post. 

Disagree with the mods? If you believe you asked your question in good faith, try rewording it or message the mods to see if there's a way you could ask more neutrally. Thanks for your understanding!

"RDTTR","t5_6kzdru","Kesinlikle katƒ±lƒ±yorum. Ne yazƒ±k ki √ºlkenin kendini ""halk""tan √ºst√ºn g√∂ren muhalif kesiminin √∂nemli bir b√∂l√ºm√º de ideolojik pek bir derinliƒüe sahip deƒüil. G√∂rd√ºƒü√ºm kadarƒ±yla bir√ßoƒüu Kemalist √∂ƒüretinin kendilerine dayattƒ±klarƒ±nƒ±n dƒ±≈üƒ±na √ßƒ±kmƒ±yor.

Kendisini pek sevmediƒüim Sevan Ni≈üanyan'ƒ±n hi√ß sevmediƒüim Kadir Mƒ±sƒ±roƒülu'yla alakalƒ± s√∂ylediƒüi ≈üu c√ºmle √ßok √∂nemli bence:
> Cumhuriyet'in ahmaklƒ±k duvarƒ±nƒ± delmeye te≈üebb√ºs etmi≈ü olmasƒ± takdire ≈üayandƒ±r.

Ben a√ßƒ±k√ßasƒ± hi√ßbir T√ºrk evladƒ±nƒ±n Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk ve T√ºrk Devrimi putunu yƒ±kmadan, bu konularƒ± saƒülam bir ≈üekilde ele≈ütirel olarak ele almadan fikri ve vicdanƒ± h√ºr birer birey olabileceƒüine inanmƒ±yorum. K√ºrtler ba≈ütan beri bu devrimi T√ºrklere nispeten √ßok daha az benimsedikleri i√ßin onlarƒ± hari√ß tutuyorum. Sosyolojilerine hakim deƒüilim, eminim onlarƒ±n da yƒ±kmalarƒ± gereken putlar vardƒ±r (belki √ñcalan olabilir) ama bunu kendilerine dayatan bir resmi ideoloji olmadƒ±ƒüƒ± i√ßin T√ºrklerdeki kadar ideolojik bataklƒ±ƒüa saplƒ± olmadƒ±klarƒ±nƒ± d√º≈ü√ºn√ºyorum.

Bence bu √ºlkenin ba≈üƒ±na gelmi≈ü en k√∂t√º ≈üey halkƒ±n zihniyetinin derinliklerine n√ºfuz etmi≈ü Red Scare (√ßevirisini bilen varsa ve bana s√∂ylerse √ßok memnun olurum). Bunun sebeplerine girmeyeceƒüim √ß√ºnk√º hem √ßok hakim olduƒüum bir konu deƒüil hem de baba tarafƒ±m √úlk√ºc√º gelenekten geldiƒüi i√ßin bu konuya √ßok tarafsƒ±z yakla≈üamam. Ama Tokatlƒ± annemin Kazova'da yer alan k√∂y√ºnde ge√ßirdiƒüim g√ºnler sanƒ±rƒ±m Sol ideolojiye yakla≈ümamda en b√ºy√ºk etkenlerden biridir. S√ºnni olan k√∂y√ºm√ºz√ºn ana ge√ßim kaynaƒüƒ± tarƒ±m. Biz de karde≈ülerimle yazƒ±n dedemlere tarlada yardƒ±mcƒ± olurduk. Sabahtan ak≈üama kadar envai√ße≈üit meyve sebze toplayƒ±p onlardan halci, kabzƒ±mal kadar para kazanamamak insana √ßok koyuyor a√ßƒ±k√ßasƒ±. K√∂yl√º de bundan ≈üikayet√ßi. Ama vaktiyle nasƒ±l korkutulmu≈ülarsa sosyalizm ve sol kavramlarƒ± onlar i√ßin dinsizlik ve -onlarƒ±n g√∂z√ºnde dinsizlikten pek de farkƒ± olmayan- Alevilikle e≈ü anlamlƒ±. Hepsi sosyal yardƒ±ma muhta√ß olmalarƒ±na raƒümen kendilerini sosyal yardƒ±ma muhta√ß eden saƒü iktidarlar k√∂yden silme oy topluyor.

Bu konuda Tƒ∞P'in ger√ßekten bir ≈üeyleri deƒüi≈ütirebileceƒüinden umudum var benim. Babam Cumhurba≈ükanlƒ±ƒüƒ± Referandumuna kadar MHP'ye oy veriyordu, ondan sonra ba≈üta ƒ∞Yƒ∞'ye, sonrasƒ±nda da CHP'ye yakla≈ütƒ±. Annemse √ßok uzun s√ºre BBP se√ßmeniydi. Ba≈ü√∂rt√ºl√º bir kadƒ±n olarak 28 ≈ûubat travmasƒ±ndan dolayƒ± hala CHP'ye mesafeli hissediyor. Benimse kafam olduk√ßa karƒ±≈üƒ±k. Etnonasyonalizm ve Demokratik Sosyalizm (√∂l√ºmc√ºl ikili üôÉ) arasƒ±nda bir kesintisiz salƒ±nƒ±m (discrete oscillation) i√ßinde olarak tanƒ±mlƒ±yorum kendimi. Bunda galiba teori okumamƒ±≈ü olmamƒ±n ve duru≈üumu tepkisel olarak belirliyor olmamƒ±n etkisi var. 14 Mayƒ±s se√ßimlerinde √ße≈üitli sebeplerden √∂t√ºr√º memleketimiz Samsun'da oy kullandƒ±k, o y√ºzden CHP'ye verdik ama normal ikametimiz olan ƒ∞stanbul 3.b√∂lgede oy kullansaydƒ±k hem kendim Tƒ∞P ve Erkan Ba≈ü'a oy verecektim hem de anne-babamƒ± ve karde≈üimi ikna etmi≈ütim.

Bunda en b√ºy√ºk etkenin Tƒ∞P'in 4 milletvekilinin mecliste Millet ƒ∞ttifakƒ± unsurlarƒ±nƒ±n hepsinin toplamƒ±ndan daha saƒülam muhalefet yapmasƒ± olduƒüunu d√º≈ü√ºn√ºyorum. Ayrƒ±ca √ºlkenin i√ßinde bulunduƒüu ekonomik krizde neoliberal ekonomik politikalarƒ±n da etkili olmasƒ± kapitalizme olan ≈ü√ºpheciliƒüi arttƒ±rƒ±yor. ƒ∞lla bir d√∂n√ºm noktasƒ± belirlemem gerekirse de Erkan Ba≈ü'ƒ±n 13 Mart 2023'te Habert√ºrk'te katƒ±ldƒ±ƒüƒ± Teke Tek programƒ±nƒ± g√∂sterebilirim. Ak≈üam yemeƒüinde sofra kurulana kadar biraz bakayƒ±m dediƒüim programƒ± normalde kapatacaktƒ±m. √á√ºnk√º annem, babamla evde s√ºrekli politika konu≈ümamƒ±zdan rahatsƒ±z normalde. Ama televizyonu kapatmama bizzat annem engel oldu. Ve o 1 saatlik programda Erkan Ba≈ü ailemizin en muhafazakar √ºyesi annemi bile ikna etti. Kendim partiye √ºye olmayƒ± d√º≈ü√ºnd√ºm ama M√ºhendislik Fak√ºltesi-Savunma Sanayi Pipeline'ƒ±nƒ±n potansiyel bir √ºyesi olarak sol bir partiye √ºye olmak kariyer a√ßƒ±sƒ±ndan beni sƒ±kƒ±ntƒ±ya sokacaƒüƒ±ndan bu fikrimden √ßoƒüunlukla vazge√ßtim.

Biraz uzattƒ±m kusura bakmayƒ±n. Bence Tƒ∞P √ºstten bakmacƒ± olmayan, halkƒ±n sƒ±kƒ±ntƒ±larƒ±nƒ± g√ºndemde tutan ve herkesin hukukuna sahip √ßƒ±kan (Sera Kadƒ±gil'in Sinan Ate≈ü cinayetine tepkisi en azƒ±ndan yakƒ±n √ßevremden sempati kazanmasƒ±nƒ± saƒüladƒ±) √ºslubu bence T√ºrkiye'de Sosyalizmi normalle≈ütirmek i√ßin √ßok √∂nemli ve deƒüerli bir fƒ±rsat. Evet, devrimin pek lafƒ±nƒ± etmiyorlar ve belki sol devrime √∂ncelik edecek parti deƒüiller ama ben zaten T√ºrk milletinin hen√ºz b√∂yle bir devrime hazƒ±r olduƒüunu d√º≈ü√ºnm√ºyorum.",1685577671.0

Where was the crew? 

Why were they still not back at Nassau, especially given the lightening / bad weather? 

Where was the captain? And/or why was the captain not seeing this go down (or this guy taking his clothes off getting ready to jump in)  because they are at the front of ""the ship"" (look up the photos of the Black Bear Pirate Ship Tour) and the captains deck is directly above them. Is there a required amount of crew members in the Bahamas? Are there any laws about having tourists out at night on a boat with poor weather with alcohol? 

The story keeps changing as to whether it was ""a dare"" or if ""the boy just jumped"" (which would be a convenient excuse for the company and/or anyone of witness). I understand that he was young, under peer pressure, and accountable for his own actions, but he was over served. I don't know what the laws are there, but it seems like so many variables (weather, time, alcohol, age group, # of crew, where is the crew? they are still anchored surrounded by sharks in the dark on the Athol Island way after sunset, etc).

Learn to love yourself and once you do, you'll be like a magnet for men.  If you need some help in building self confidence, don't hesitate to talk to social workers or go see a therapist.  It might be super useful for you.

He can also order his minions to do any of these.  It's definitely something he or his minions would need to spend an attack or an action on, which makes it a potentially useful tool for action denial, depending on luck and how many attacks the BBEG can do per action, but if a DM lets their BBEG end up in the Astral Plane from it then they did so intentionally or got profoundly unlucky.

I also don't consider Silvery Barbs broken, though I wouldn't mention Counterspell in my explanation, and nor do I consider Aaracokra broken.

And the point is not that a raven could not be argued to be able to speak, it's that the raven could be argued to not be able to speak.  Which means it's highly DM-dependent on whether this ""brokenness"" actually matters.  If I were to consider that broken it'd be completely irrelevant because the level 1 Genie Warlock toting his infinite free wishes would've broken everything so much more, so much earlier.  But the saving grace of both is that they they need DM fiat to work, rather than DM fiat to not work.

This massive weapon could benefit her organization, even finding it would give her undeniable clout- but it was her job to establish order and make the tough decisions. And if it meant sinking some long dead civilization, so be it.*

To begin, Electra will hop back into the cart directly behind her, hopping in from the ‚Äúrear‚Äù. This cart will be referred to as Cart A. Using a vine from her face, she‚Äôll slick up the back of Cart A and spawn a vine there. Both vines will work to quickly fill the inside of Cart A with ink. 

After Cart A‚Äôs inside is sufficiently covered, Electra will drive forward to the cart in front of her (referred to as Cart B), using the vine from her face to tag the back of Cart B with ink. Another vine will spawn from the splotch of ink, beginning to fill Cart B with ink as Electra drives up to its side. 

Electra will look inside Cart B to spawn a vine inside of it, with this vine being used to drive Cart B while Electra drives Cart A. Cart B will drive up the wall and onto the ceiling. From here, both carts will drive forward, with the vines on their backs trailing ink behind them. A combination of gravity and the vine moving will also send ink droplets directly below Cart B, with the goal being to pour ink into as many carts as possible. This setup reveals Electra‚Äôs intentions- to coat most of the tunnel in shadow. This gives Electra lots of room to work with, but the erratic nature of the painted tendril and its drippings will make sure she doesn't accidentally trigger her own nyctophobia.

Another cart will be commandeered, with Electra using the vine at the end of Cart A to ‚Äútow‚Äù the nearest available cart, now called Cart C. [This is the path Electra follows.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1108894706215161907/1113473281664753747/IMG_4456.png) Cart C will absorb any blows coming from directly behind Electra‚Äôs cart, whether it‚Äôs from 2095 or the more likely option of orbs flying towards her from behind. 

Electra will be driving counterclockwise throughout the match, giving her ample time to see what‚Äôs up ahead of her and a small window of time to look behind her at any incoming orbs. Like any good driver, Electra‚Äôs mostly going to be keeping her eyes on the road, in order to avoid attacks from 2095. 

Electra will use the Crab Mode on the cart in short bursts to move erratically as well as to paint in a winding pattern. The erratic movement keeps 2095 from predicting where Electra will move. If she‚Äôs in a tight situation where 2095 gets too close, Electra can [drift](https://youtu.be/pS5d77DQHOI) until her carts are sideways and use the Crab to quickly lurch forward a few meters away- minding the stamina meter, of course. If 2095 gets too close and the Crab is on cooldown, Electra can try and pull her off of her own cart and destabilize her using a vine from her face, keeping her at arm‚Äôs length- or rather, at vine‚Äôs length- until her stamina recharges and she‚Äôs able to boost away once more.

During her erratic Crab Mode maneuvers, Electra will be keeping her eyes peeled for light orbs flying past her ride. Once she gets a sense for their trajectories and pathing, she will swing wildly with Crab Mode into these orbs, activating spiders as she does so, to catch as many as she can muster. From there, the collected orbs will be pooled in Cart C, where two vines will prepare to launch volleys clockwise along their circumference after 4 seconds of prep time. With their high precision, these vines can accurately target encroaching light orbs, blasting them to pieces before they get close enough to become a threat to Electra. This erratic SpiderCrab technique will allow Electra to generate a steady stream of light orbs from her surroundings, and give her the ammunition to fight back while her kart is out of juice. Orb collection will be done early on, when Electra doesn't have to worry about 2095. Once Electra has collected enough orbs to half-fill Cart C, Electra will switch from using Spider Mode to Turtle Mode instead, setting to automatic and focusing the vines she has in that cart towards making sure inert orbs don't fall out of the cart as it moves.

Whenever the Turtle‚Äôs shield has been popped or the Spider Mode is used, Electra will go into **Lockdown Mode.** When in Lockdown Mode, Cart B will stop, its vine curling up into the cart so it doesn't get clipped, and Electra will put all focus into maneuvering her own cart to keep herself out of grave danger. Once the cooldown on these has ended, Lockdown Mode will end and Electra will continue on as normal.",1685577674.0

Or rather ‚Äî you can because you can say anything on the web. But people will laugh.

Socioeconomic class is a material condition with crushing power that often goes underrated and underdiscussed, drowned out by feverish hype around ideas & cultural concerns. That doesn‚Äôt mean everything else is a floating identity totally unmoored from the material. I think there are leftists who come from a place of genuine principle and say: there‚Äôs too much focus on who‚Äôs in which movies; let‚Äôs talk about housing, unions, health insurance, industry lobbying.

It appears that this may be a post regarding a medical concern, due to the sensitive nature of medical advice the mod team manually screens health posts for approval. r/dogs mods may comment and lock or remove a post if it is clear that the only appropriate answer is to seek emergency care or the question cannot adequately be answered here, otherwise there may be a slight delay in approval. In an emergency situation, the most important thing to do is to remain calm and work to get your pet help. If your primary care veterinarian cannot see an emergency, the best way to find a nearby emergency facility is to do a web search for ""[your location] emergency vet"", ""[your location] animal hospital"", or ""[your location] animal emergency"". Whenever possible, calling ahead may help a facility to better prepare for your arrival. Additional online resources can be found here- https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/wiki/healthresources .Thank you for making it through to the tail end. We hope you and your pet can get the help they need and everyone is feeling better soon!

If there's a choke point, secure the choke point and expand from there. Focus around migration hot areas since zed will naturally repopulate that area and you can deal with them in thinner numbers as they do so. 

Start by just clearing what's visible, then expand to yells to pull any stragglers, then expand to horns/sirens. 

For buildings, always take sight lines first - peek in windows, know what you are fighting into. Draw out what you can with sound - try and empty them through the front door and fight them outside. 

If you don't have vision consider sledging out a wall. Zed congregate around pathing so they'll tend to be near doors and windows and not in the middle of some solid wall. For taller buildings, build exterior staircases up rather than trying to fight up interior staircases where you have no vision. Always have a safe exit path.",1685577676.0

Two, I am not sure how far away in timing, college is for you but you might want to wait on getting an official diagnosis academically because there may be limitations and restrictions on your accommodations granted.   


For example, for our two homeschooled teens, their academic testing for accommodations was recommended to be done as close to the year going to college (or obtaining a GED) because their accommodations would only be good for 3 years from the test date so they will have to do testing again before finishing school to ""renew"" or something like that\*. The good part of it was the testing did cover academic and medical diagnosis. Insurance did not cover the testing, which may be another reason to wait until accommodations are needed and can be used. If that makes sense? Their accommodations did include longer test taking time, quiet rooms, assistance with note taking, receiving notes ahead of time, and other things like that.  (and I am sure testing/accommodations vary by state).  


I also did my testing (adult AFAB) and received some accommodations in case I wanted to go back to school or get a part time job (since I am finished homeschooling our teens) and it was my second diagnosis. My first was ten years ago, as Asperger's and now I am  diagnosed as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 1 (with some of the extra things that come from living a life with Autism undiagnosed - CPTSD, anxiety, etc).  


\*It's a weird thing to have to ""renew"" a diagnosis and sort of makes me laugh, like do we get a card to carry or a prize bag each time?! :)

EDIT: This is not about SoO..read above and below. SoO is used as an example...ease up fam üôÇ

State of Origin - It's not for everyone but it's a big enough deal that divides states and opinions. It promotes friendly competition but can end a relationship (I.e. friend, family etc.).

Would it be silly to propose a ban on noise restrictions or seek to extend them, to midnight for example? My suburb was boisterous during the game tonight but then quietened down as soon as it hit 10pm (are they duds or just being compliant? I don't know, I really don't).

Like Xmas, we may not all subscribe but could we consider some flexibility within reason? Or is that asking for the can opener for the ol' can of worms?

I've seen that claim so many times but have never had someone provide strong evidence to that effect (and believe me when I say I've looked)

Even if you're right about that, as questionable as pederasty is to our modern sensibilities it wasn't exactly the same as a modern day child predator. The relationships they had were long term caring relationships with post-pubescent boys, who they saw as young men not children (as much as we see it differently today it's important to understand their frame of mind as well). There was a heavy emphasis on the relationship *not* being primarily sexual in nature, and anal penetration was completely unacceptable to them, limiting themselves instead to intercrural sex (rubbing between closed thighs). I'm not saying that it was a good thing and I'm certainly not arguing that we should still practice it, but it isn't particularly accurate to compare it to child molestation

Also monogamous homosexual relationships were not unknown to the Greeks at all. In the Spartan army your shield mate was often also a lover during your time as a soldier, which was encouraged because it made you more motivated to protect them in combat. When they retired they would then take wives and start families, but that doesn't invalidate their long term gay relationships. There were many other homosexual traditions throughout the ancient world so a consensual adult gay relationship would not have been an unknown concept to Paul, Jesus, or even the ancient Hebrew writers

Regarding Romans 1:26 it doesn't say anywhere that he's talking about orgies, he's just talking about homosexual sex. Also even if it's true that he was speaking against orgies that's also stupid because consenting adults can do what they want and group sex is only ""sinful"" because it doesn't fit neatly into the nuclear family they wanted (and still want) people to be in

Even if you discount what Paul said the Old Testament is still very clear and Jesus said that the old law would still be in effect until the end of the world, so even though he didn't call out queerness specifically he endorsed a set of rules that would have us stoned to death

Like you said even if this interpretation of the Bible was right it still describes a monstrously evil and capricious god that wouldn't be worth worshiping even if he did exist. However this is still important because Christianity gets a pass in a lot of queer circles because of the ""Jesus just said to love each other!"" apologetics that white wash the Bible. They then use this white washed bible to bring people in and then indoctrinate them with all of the other nonsense that they still believed all along",1685577677.0

Who is crewing the ship as you sail it back to port? Crew costs are the limiting factor for piracy, not vessel availability. If you have enough crew to crew two ships, then a lot of that gold will be going to pay them. If you try to force the defeated crew to sail it for you, what's in it for them?

Looking back now I have a whole list of things that should have made me realize I wasn‚Äôt attracted to men.

#Section 2 - [Lap 2](https://youtu.be/yc-Wtig1xTU)

*After setting up another zone, Electra turned to try and look at her opponent. She realized, with a sinking feeling, that she wasn't relishing this battle. Rather, she considered it a necessary evil. It was kind of a shame to Electra, too. They could have been friends‚Ä¶*

##Attacking 2095 (And Yours Truly)

Once the map has been covered, there‚Äôs nothing left to do but get to the point- fighting 2095. Ideally, Electra wants to keep constant pressure on 2095- she‚Äôs not going down without a fight, and keeping her distracted already means that she can get hit by the orbs while trying to battle against Electra. However, the coverage granted by the setup means Electra has a lot of options.

Electra‚Äôs previous setup means that the carts that have not been manned by 2095 right after the initial setup have ink inside of them. This means they can be used to sprout vines from them if needed, yanking or pushing 2095 out of the cart if she decides to get inside. To properly spawn the vines, Electra would have to look inside of them, therefore driving onto the ceiling. This is still beneficial- being up on the ceiling makes it harder for her to be hit by 2095 as well as the orbs.

Cart B is one of the best ways Electra can attack 2095. Cart B will always be within Electra‚Äôs 40m range, driving around however Electra needs to be supported. This includes attacking 20 if she tries to get close to Electra, whether that be on foot or by cart. The vine in Cart B can also use its height advantage to attack YT from above, using sneak attacks to damage its main body, which therefore causes damage to 2095 as well. Attacking in ways that YT can‚Äôt see is vital- incoming attacks from VFT can be dodged by YT due to its superior speed. But a good hit to its weak crest can amount for a lot. 

The orbs that were collected by Electra before will also be used here. With Cart C full of orbs, Electra will reach into its controls and send it hurtling towards either YT or 2095 using Crab Mode. From there, a vine will trigger the Turtle Mode of the cart as a flytrap head as big as the kart‚Äôs carriage bursts from the inside, carrying the inert orbs upwards in its maw. These orbs will be jettisoned towards the target at A PRE, their spectacular light show assaulting 2095 with a nonstop barrage of explosive ammunition while the vines themselves remain protected from the splash damage thanks to the shielding. With Cart C now having expended its usefulness, the vines inside it will retract as Cart B will move in to replace it. Cart B will come down from the ceiling track and serve as a shield like Cart C once did. 

 After that assault, Electra can rely on the vines in Cart B to activate Spider Mode for her once again, but this time instead of building up a large stockpile of orbs to use in a single strike, Electra will double down her ranged offenses, sprouting an inky flytrap (a ‚ÄúSunvine‚Äù) to act as a cannon, having it loaded with inert orbs that it will use to bombard our foe at range, as well as provide interception fire with it‚Äôs A Precision to shoot down any incoming orbs from our opponent. 

##Defending Against 2095 (And Yours Truly)

2095‚Äôs stats are nothing to sneeze at- she boasts a 5 in every physical stat, and needless to say it would be extremely bad for Electra to get within her range. Therefore, Electra will be keeping her distance from 2095 while also minding YT. She‚Äôs already focused on using Crab Mode to swerve her cart every which way to dodge her opponent‚Äôs assaults, and by hanging out along the ceiling she can make it that much harder for her opponent to reach her position without a cart of her own. It‚Äôs a good thing, then, that Electra planted inky droplets inside the carts as she rode along. When her target attempts to get within range inside one of these tainted carts, Electra can erupt the vine out from under 2095‚Äôs feet, throwing her out into the open as the kart swerves away helplessly.

To do serious damage to Electra, 2095 has to get up close and personal with her. Electra still has the option of VFT at her arsenal, however- a vine that can take a free hit or put in some attacks while Electra focuses on getting 2095 away from her, like using the Crab to jerk violently in unpredictable patterns to shake 2095 off like a [bucking bull](https://youtu.be/x465HrhrYkM). In the worst case scenario, she can use a vine from VFT to wrap around Electra‚Äôs waist, before activating Crab Mode on her own cart to send it hurtling off in some random direction with 2095 still in it. With this, Electra would be able to safely make distance from her target, and she can regain the lost minecart the next time she passes by an empty one. During that time, she can use the other modes of the cart to buy time for any damaged vines to respawn and become available to her once again, and if 2095 remained inside her original cart she can have an entire mass of vines erupt from underfoot, once again leveling the playing field with her opponent.

YT can be used as a ranged attacker. While weak, it‚Äôs another way Electra can be hurt easily. However, once Electra establishes the Sunvine as an interceptor cannon, she can safely shoot down incoming projectile attacks via rewound carts or rewound orbs. If she would become overwhelmed by ranged attacks, she could even use Spider Mode to re-catch the light orbs thrown by the enemy.

YT‚Äôs stand ability and tentacles are also dicey, but are also weak and susceptible to hits from both the orbs as well as VFT. If YT is close or preparing for a rewind attack in front of Electra, she can use the Sunvine to gun them down as needed. The shots will be aimed at the tentacles, but close to where the tentacles meet the main body- to not only destroy the tentacle but do added damage as well.  If YT aims to rewind Cart C to forcefully jerk Electra back and catch her, leaving her vulnerable to 2095‚Äôs blows, Electra will detach Cart C and use it as a bundle of explosives, both hitting it and using Crab Mode to boost quickly away from it as it‚Äôs exploding. The result is a large attack on YT, at the expense of a vine.",1685577679.0

"politics","t5_2cneq","I think the 14th amendment school of thought is sort of silly. It's a complete roll of the dice hoping they accept this and uphold it. If you were the President and needed to do the best by the American people that you could why would you take such a risk? Meanwhile everyone would be waiting for the courts to decide which could take awhile, and the economy is free falling. Americans' retirement savings are quickly being depleted and people are getting angry. Most voters do so with their wallets. 

It's easy to be some guy on Reddit and say that, but when it's actually your responsibility and you'll be remembered in the history books for it then it becomes way different. If I were President I'd have to ask myself. Are the cuts the Republicans are asking for here worse than a default or an economic crisis due to invoking the 14th amendment? 

The answer to that one is really obvious. Biden actually did pretty well in these negotiations compared to Obama in 2011 who agreed to cut $2.1 trillion between discretionary, non-discretionary, defense, justice, education, a 2% cut to Medicare payments and more. 

I don't think Biden really conceded anything here that will severely hurt his chances in 2024 either. Whereas, Obama absolutely did and was beaten over the head with the defense cuts, environmental protection cuts and Medicare stuff. Sure the work requirements were raised to 54, but they also now have an exemption for veterans, homeless, and people ages 18 to 24 who were in foster care when they turned 18.

I think this is also something that reflects the distinct ""‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±ã‡∞°‡±Å"" way of thinking from say, a Bengali. We Bengalis are straight up 'intellectuals' and at times deliberately offensive at the society; and we still are that way. OTOH, ‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±ã‡∞°‡±Å doesn't engage in displays of intellectual-ness (i.e. in a traditional left intellectuals sense) and always uses humor as a stick to beat the society; and by and large, I think Telugu society is still that way.

I don't think there is a parallel to Ni_Bondha sub in any other Indian state subs. Just like Apparao garu's critique, this sub behave just like him i.e. lot of Apparao s.

"relacionamentos","t5_vp2cd","Eu j√° estive em situa√ß√µes de ser muito ""requisitado"" (que palavra estranha tu escolheu, mas enfim) e fiquei com a mina mais fora do padr√£o e rejeitada.

Mas h√° alguns fatores a serem considerados:

1. Ela tomou a iniciativa, me pediu em namoro e tudo mais. Eu n√£o teria tomado (e aos 27 anos nunca tomei), mas tamb√©m n√£o quer dizer que aceitei s√≥ por ela ter pedido. E essa iniciativa foi da forma correta, depois de me conhecer por bastante tempo, depois de passarmos bastante tempo juntos, n√£o simplesmente ""Ei, te achei um gato, vamos ficar?""
2. Eu me dava muito bem com todas as outras, flertava de brincadeirinha e tals, mas n√£o ficaria com nenhuma delas de forma alguma.
3. Eu sou um cara pouco visual, n√£o acredito que seja m√©rito meu, pois n√£o √© um esfor√ßo, mas apar√™ncia n√£o √© levada muito em considera√ß√£o por mim, n√£o da mesma forma que √© para os outros.
4. Ela tinha um perfil muito mais pr√°tico, n√£o usava maquiagem, usava uns jeans surrados com all-star velho, n√£o era frescurenta esse tipo de coisa, e eu valorizo muito quem n√£o cede as press√µes sociais e ao inv√©s disso, faz o que bem entende, se veste e age como prefere (e vamos combinar, a maioria das mulheres n√£o se monta porque gosta).
5. Eu sou um cara meio chato e ranzinza, mesmo se eu desse esse valor todo pra apar√™ncia, se  eu por tal raz√£o escolhesse meus relacionamentos, eles n√£o durariam uma semana. Para mim √© fundamental a pessoa ser admir√°vel, do meu ponto de vista, √≥bvio.

E tem outra, j√° aconteceu bastante de ficarem interessadas em mim mal me conhecendo. Se a pessoa se interessa por algu√©m que mal conhece, quer dizer que ou se interessa por qualquer um ou est√° se interessando em mim s√≥ por apar√™ncia, motivos estes que j√° v√£o me fazer descartar a tal pessoa instantaneamente.

Mas tudo isso em considera√ß√£o, eu acho que meus padr√µes s√£o muito mais restritivos que a maioria dos caras (digo isso pois √© uma reclama√ß√£o constante de um g√™nero ao outro o fato de a r√©gua estar l√° em cima), a √∫nica diferen√ßa que a minha r√©gua n√£o est√° medindo beleza, mas ainda assim a quantidade de mulheres que me interessa √© esmagadoramente menor do que √© pra maioria.

Ent√£o, se relacionamento fosse um processo seletivo, acho que a maioria ia preferir tentar passar pelo crivo de qualquer outro cara do que o meu, o que quer dizer que o meu m√©todo √© pior ainda do que essa escolha de ""mulher padr√£o"", imagino eu, do ponto de vista feminino.",1685577680.0

"thesims","t5_2rbdu","Yes this is all great. Sims 4 has been a cash grab and I‚Äôve said it for forever, Simmers have given more money to this company and game franchise than I think a LOT of other game companies have been able to convince their long time fans to do. There are very few that come to mind and I think we all know that EA positioned The Sims to be one of these games. Look at things like The Sims Store for the Sims 3 and just do the damn math in how much the AVERAGE simmer spends on this game! It‚Äôs insane that they have gotten us to pay for things that were a part of big EPs or even the base game of previous versions in the franchise. It‚Äôs embarrassing really. 

I just said in another comment that I literally waited about 2 years where I just spent money in the Sims 4 WITHOUT EVEN PLAYING because the game wasn‚Äôt as fleshed out as Sims 3 was from base game. Which of course is my own fault but it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve had hope that things will get better.

I have also been saying this since they first started the new project Rene and all this other revamp of The Sims 4, they are absolutely worried about Humble‚Äôs Life By You and Paralives taking away Simmers that have been playing for over 10 years because they know we have had 10 years with this being the only real option for this type of game and they have failed us. They‚Äôre scrambling now. 

As a Simmer of over 20 years, I am really holding out for Life By You and if it meets my expectations (which I really doubt they will disappoint) it‚Äôs quite likely that I will be leaving The Sims in the dust. Which makes me very sad because I feel like it‚Äôs been a part of my life for so long, but they have to do better for those of us who have literally spent thousands over the years

"giftcardexchange","t5_2s989","Hello, by trading here you agree that your post follows all of the [**GCX Rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules). If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

Sadly, just love is never enough. Work, on yourselves and the relationship is also necessary. Time will make things clearer.

"Meditation","t5_2qnc9","I'm not an expert on Buddhism, as I mainly stick to meditation guide books. The Buddha was a smart guy. I don't think he got it all right, but he was spot on for compassion and lovingkindness to all beings. To quote Dr. Kabot-Zinn: if the Buddha could resume all his teachings in one phrase, it would be: ""do not cling tightly""

Two good books on how-to meditate are *The Mind Illuminated* by Culadasa and *Right Concentration* by Leigh Brasington. But for the science on what meditation does to the brain, you may want *Altered Traits* by Goleman and Davidson. Reading about what meditation did to the brain really motivated me in my practice. Their biggest finding (to me) was that expert meditators have near constant delta waves in the brain, which is what we see when we bite into apples or solve math problems. I wanted to have that depth of existence. Also, meditation really boosts happiness, which is great too

It can help to think of meditation as something you do not just for yourself, but for others too: by becoming more kind and relaxed, you help out when you do interact with others",1685577683.0

Sure it can. Academics do this all the time -- the english language only has so many words, so for a specialized term, you take a common word and then modify or extend the common definition.

As I said to someone else, in this case you could just imagine it being like an implied adjective, unless you also think modifying words through the use of adjectives is postmodernist cultural constructivism.",1685577683.0

I make about 75% of our income, work far more hours than she does, take care of our yard, help with housework, clean up the kitchen after she cooks, help with her plant/flower garden or keep her company while she is out there, and do a number of small things daily to show her I love her.  On the flip side she does as much in different ways for me.  Point being, we both contribute equally, each show in our own way that we love each other, have an open, honest line of communication, and are both very happy.  Despite all of this she has no drive.  Some women just do not have it and sometimes it‚Äôs no one‚Äôs fault.  Sometimes, it‚Äôs factors like medication, age, exhaustion, anxiety, depression, medication or a combination of things.  My wife loves me and shows me she loves me in every other way possible and we do have a sexual relationship, but I am pretty much always the one who has to initiate it.  She enjoys it and does climax when we do, but then it‚Äôs just over for her.  The euphoria I experience afterward is something she just doesn‚Äôt experience.  It completely relaxes me, I usually get my best sleep after, and it puts me in an amazing mood the next day.  I have a very high sex drive and yes it is sometimes hard, but when it is I just try to focus on all the other amazing aspects of our relationship and that helps me find peace.  Maybe start focusing on and truly appreciating all the positive aspects of your relationship instead of harping on this one negative(and I get that it‚Äôs a big negative) and do everything you can to show her you love her without the expectation of getting sex in return and maybe she will start doing the same and be more willing. There are times in the past where this was really a point of contention,  but I‚Äôm glad we worked through it and are where we are today. I wish you the best of luck and hope you can find the same peace and happiness I have.",1685577683.0

To get your foot in the door you need to secure an OIT position, paid or unpaid. Chances of getting an unpaid OIT spot are higher at smaller/rural plants, large plants typically do paid OIT positions but they‚Äôre highly competitive. The plant I did my OIT hours at has to cut off their applications at 1000 because so many are trying to get in. Your education background can help you stand out in an interview but ultimately doesn‚Äôt mean anything if you never make it to that stage. I could count on one hand the operators I‚Äôve worked with that had a biology or Chem degree.

Look for jobs on CWEA‚Äôs website, look specifically for trainee positions or jobs where they don‚Äôt require a grade 1 or higher license. If they are looking for grade 1 or higher that means it‚Äôs not open for trainees.

You need 1800 hours as a trainee before you can become licensed. After that it‚Äôs a combination of education and experience, along with passing the required state exams, to reach the higher grade levels. Your first goal is to get those OIT hours any way you can. Once you have those hours then you want to get to a grade 3 ASAP as that‚Äôs what most plants consider a ‚Äújourneyman‚Äù operator and opens up doors pretty much anywhere in the state.",1685577684.0

Knuckles turns green and gains the ability to do literally anything, so he literally nothing else until he literally dies. He comes back thankfully.

In a specific story arc, Sally almost got taken out by a bad plot device that makes no sense, and Robotnik is actually killed (though in a pretty cool fashion as he fights Sonic) by his own nephew, Snively. Under a different writer Robotnik would come back (albeit from a different universe, and also as a robot.

Near the end of his run, Sally almost gets married to Antoine, which has Sonic literally crying for her not to do that, despite him hooking up with a girl named Fiona Fox (**IN THE SAME ISSUE TOO**) Also Tails had a crush on Fiona and Sonic knew of this, but he justified it by thinking Tails would just get over it. (He did NOT just over it, but that was covered in Ian Flynn's run.) 

The Source of All was indirectly mentioned in another comment that talked about the Sally pool issue (Sonic Super Special #11 by the way) but its essentially a pool that decides one's fate. I think it was destroyed via *nuclear explosion* under another writer.

-give yourself a soft and hard cutoff time for studying every day

-soak up sunshine/fresh air to break up study blocks. Even if it's just poking your head outside for a couple minutes. 

-at the risk of sounding preachy, try to take pressure off yourself. Your inherent self worth is not at risk here, and it never was. Your life will still be fulfilling no matter what happens because of the way you live it, make others smile, etc. Again, at the risk of sounding preachy, see if you can shift to a perspective of gratitude.

All posts, threads, and comments suggesting songs, albums, EPs, and compilations should fall under, within, or a mixture of genres that relate to goth, including, in some cases, post-punk. Most genres below have their own subreddits. **A descriptive list of accepted genres can be viewed in our sidebar.**

 * any form of metal, including Gothic metal (please see the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/goth/wiki/faq)) or hard rock
 * metalcore, deathcore, or any other unrelated -core genres
 * neo/classical or ambient music, including neoclassical darkwave
 * dark cabaret, psychobilly or Steampunk
 * experimental/avant-garde 
 * electronic, dance, Italo disco 
 * witch house
 * new wave/synth-pop
 * GothBoiClique/Soundcloud or mumble rap/hip hop/trap
 * punk rock or hardcore punk, including horror punk

We understand that **industrial** is commonly played alongside goth in goth/alternative clubs, however, Rivethead/industrial and the goth subculture are still two separate scenes. All industrial music must be posted in an appropriate subreddit such as r/industrialmusic. 

General or **post-punk** that isn't dark may also be referred to r/postpunk. We have to draw a line somewhere, and we understand that not all post-punk is goth, but all goth is post-punk. 

If it is something that can bring people to a dance floor and is something you might find in a goth club, please consider posting in r/gothclub.

For any generally dark music, please consider posting in r/DarklyInclined.

I kind of like that Awakened Zero isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúcanon‚Äù ending. Zero conquered the virus in X5 by choosing his Hunter life and friendship with X over the destiny his father desired, and that‚Äôs fine by me. Despite throwing enough virus at him to kill a planet, Dr. Wily and Sigma failed to turn Zero to their side. That‚Äôs cool. We got to see what would happen if they did, and even then he chooses X in the end. That story is told. It‚Äôs not all that necessary to tell it again.

I would like to see another version of Awakened Zero‚Äôs super saiyan powers, but one where Zero retains (what X would consider) his true self. Perhaps as a short burst power up, or dramatic cutscene. Some enemy plotting to use a virus to awaken Zero, only to get a ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that, you expected me to join your side?

I like that you mention a random completely unrelated factoid at the end the passengers inertial frame. Well done. Also - the tea they are drinking is made from water that boils at 100‚ÄôC - interesting eh?!

Also your speed calcs, whilst correct also have no bearing on my hypothesis. You appear to have not understood my claim. I am not talking about airspeed.
I am saying that the fast wind speeds would cause the plane to lose its initial inertial frame of the ground speed. Obviously if the plane is sped up / slowed down by 250mph, it no longer has the initial 1000mph ground speed that you claim gives it an inertial frame cemented to the earths rotational speed.
Another fact that makes your inertial frame claim absurd is that the inertial acceleration an object. has at takeoff is HORIZONTAL so it would cause a hovering helicopter for example to lift higher and higher off the earth! After 6 minutes of hovering a helicopter would be 6,667 feet higher than it started!",1685577687.0

It takes a much bigger person to suffer this bs and still have the love, and boldness to offer forgiveness and a second chance. I know for me I don't take saying the words ""I Love you"" lightly and never did. I knew what I wanted, committed to it, and for me, I must see it through for my own satisfaction. Love is anything but perfect or easy more times than not, I fear people who tend to give up too quickly, have yet to even love on a deep level. Then again I have never broken up with a girl, I always ended up hurt lol. 

You shouldn't feel less than anyone OP, it took a lot of careful planning for your WP to do what they did and they had huge advantages.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","> My logic here is just as I said, people who have everything done for them will not know how to do anything. Including how to handle a debt load.

My parents paid for my undergrad. The deal was that they wouldn't pay for anything they didn't approve of. That involved some extra curriculars and housing. I got a job to pay for those.

I am now in my 30's with a mortgage I'm paying off because I calculated I can afford it. A car I'm paying off because I can afford it. And I still have money going into my IRA, 401k, ESPP, and index funds. Loans are not an inherently bad thing. They can be very wise decisions.

I don't know why you keep thinking it's all or nothing here. You don't have to subsidize her ideal lifestyle. You can take a bunch of the burden off while still having her learn responsibility.

Maybe the stick up my ass is too rigid but what's really annoying me is how cost ineffective your life lesson is. You could loan her the money at 7% and keep that money in the family using it for either yourself or her. You could loan that money interest free with a detailed contract ensuring repayment and there isn't any money lost.

But you're literally asking her to throw money away because you think careless spending is a character booster. No. It's not. You're encouraging wasting money.

From your comments, I get what you're saying. I don't wholly agree but I see the argument. And I understand you're trying to instill a lesson. But the way you're going about it is so...wasteful. It's throwing away money for no reason other than you threw away money.",1685577688.0

Disallowed question area: **Rant or loaded question** 

NoStupidQuestions is a place to ask any question as long as *it's asked in good faith*. Our users routinely report questions that they feel violate this rule to us. Want to avoid your question being seen as a bad faith question? Common mistakes include (but are not limited to): 

* Rants: Could your question be answered with *'That's awful'* or *'What an asshole'*? Then it's probably a rant rather than a genuine question. Looking for a place to vent on Reddit? Try /r/TrueOffMyChest or /r/Rant instead.

* Loaded questions: Could your question be answered with *'You're right'*? Answering the question yourself, explaining your reasoning for your opinion, or making sweeping assumptions about the question itself all signals that you may not be keeping an open mind. Want to know why people have a different opinion than you? Try /r/ExplainBothSides instead!

* Arguments: Arguing or [sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lioning) with people giving you answers tells everyone that you have an answer in mind already. Want a good debate? Try /r/ChangeMyView instead!

* Pot Stirring: Did you bring up unnecessary topics in your question? Especially when a topic has to do with already controversial issues like politics, race, gender or sex, this can be seen as trying to score points against the Other Side - and that makes people defensive, which leads to arguments. Questions like *""If _____ is allowed, why isn't _____?""* don't need to have that comparison - just ask *'why isn't ____ allowed?'*.

* Complaining about moderation: If you disagree with how the sub is run or a decision the mods have made, that's fine! But please share your thoughts with us in modmail rather than as a public post. 

Disagree with the mods? If you believe you asked your question in good faith, try rewording it or message the mods to see if there's a way you could ask more neutrally. Thanks for your understanding!

"HousingUK","t5_3ntes",">Originally it was female only. Is this legal? What can she do?

Sweet FA. Previously it was female only by happenstance, not by contract. 

Under the Equality Act 2010, it is illegal for a landlord to advertise for Female only or Male only, unless they are getting a lodger rather than a tenant - a lodger being someone who lives in a property that the landlord also occupies.

If they have multiple applicants, then presumably they're allowed to choose between them, and good landlords will give their current tenant(s) in the other room(s) a say in who will soon be living with them, but it is not required.

This is especially true for HMO properties, which a flat being rented to students probably is.

Lucky for her, the Uni term will soon be ending (if it hasn't already) giving her a lot more freedom to either move home for the summer or find a new place.

Also, living with a dude isn't that bad.

And as I said, it's illegal to discriminate against prospective tenants based on their gender, so the only way to guarantee to have all female roommates is to either join a flat which already has all female roommates, or get a flat as a group of all girls.",1685577689.0
"ScaramoucheMains","t5_3j37wj","It really depends on whether or not you have Bennett. ATK buffs are more common than Crit or Dmg buffs, but Skyward is very good since it gives you lots of ATK and an unconditional damage bonus without the Widsith‚Äôs RNG/downtime. I used Eye of Perception with Scara before switching him over to a Widsith build.

You should also consider if another catalyst user would benefit more from the Widsith (such as Yae, Lisa, Yanfei, or Heizou).

"GodEater","t5_2tbo2","Ultimately I think Ashborne Aragami Devour Attacks are a good thing. Previous GE entries never really promoted the Just Guard, so if a player wanted to become better it'd usually be because of self-control over one's offense rather than perfecting defense, especially since blocking in previous games was more difficult. There was much more risk in learning how to JG in older games imo.

GE3's increased accessibility to blocking on top of a new mechanic in Dive that also acts as a Guard made me rethink the way I played, and it feels so amazing when I finally learned how to block Anubis even if I'm not successful all the time.

Note: Ash Aragami =/= Ashborn Aragami. Iirc it's stated in-game that everything from previous GE games that could survive the Ash are called Ash Aragami. This is why Amy always says ""Ashborn Aragami inbound"", not ""Ash Aragami inbound"".",1685577690.0

Your post was removed from /r/OhioHookups because the title does not follow the proper format.
&nbsp; 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] #CITY - DESCRIPTION*

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


1. Use **M, F, TM, TF, R, NB** for tagging gender.

2. Use [ ] around the R4R tag, so it looks like **[R4R]**. Don't use ( ), { }, or anything else.

3. For *multiple ages*; separate with a **COMMA** then **SPACE**, so it looks like *21, 25 [MF4R].*

4. Your **AGE** must be included before your *[R4R].*

5. You must include a **HASHTAG** for your *#CITY.* 

6. You must include a **DASH** after your *#CITY* with proper spacing.

7. **YOU MUST HAVE PROPER SPACING**; age**SPACE**[r4r]**SPACE**#city**SPACE**dash**SPACE**.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


*28 [M4F] #Columbus - Looking for someone to talk to*

*23, 29 [TMF4M/F/MF] #Cleveland - Anyone have an interest in chatting with us?*

*36 [NB4R] #Akron - Just curious*

&nbsp;

If your title does not look like any of the 3 examples above ***INCLUDING PROPER SPACING*** your post will be removed.

"Whatisthis","t5_2qtwp","So the higher you go into the atmosphere, the colder it gets, which is why clouds form due to water vapor condensing on dust particles that provide nucleation sites. Then due to how cold the atmosphere becomes the higher you go, this then turns into ice crystals, which when formed at just the right time during the day. Can cause sunlight to refract through the crystals to form a sundog. The moon can do this as well, although it typically doesn't make a rainbow but a halo around the moon on very cold nights. 

As for the cold part that is true, however all clouds are typically a mixture of water droplets and ice crystals due to the cold upper atmosphere. Which is why when it's warm instead of getting ice or snow from the clouds, it melts when it falls, and only stays frozen when the temperature is at or below freezing between the cloud and the ground.",1685577692.0

"neopets","t5_2r64t","Yeah it's a bit hard, here is some tips though:

Normal, Snow, Robot and Fire Yooyus: Position yourself just below the center of the AC logo in the middle of the arena (below the fire spike coming out of the right side of the logo), start walking towards the goal and release a full charge shot without getting too close. It's not really consistent but that's how I make most of my goals

Faerie Yooyu: Free goal, shoot a fully charged shot from the middle of the arena, it will go right in. You might need to play a bit with the position to get it right, but faerie is the most consistent ball imo

The Justice Department would correctly conclude his supporters would wage a domestic terror campaign of an OKC Bombing-like event every week until he was freed, and that would scare them enough to claim it was an AI program that made the video and hacked his social media accounts. It was the fear of that exact type of domestic terror campaign that lead the Justice Department to not acting on the late-90s FBI report of a nationwide, multi-organizational collaborative effort to install White Nationalists in every law enforcement agency & political office at the local, State, and Federal levels, *and* why they didn't push back against the Brooks Brothers Riot aka the successful predecessor to the failed Jan 6 coup attempt. So now we have actual White Nationalist *gangs* operating withing law enforcement agencies across the country, and very clearly White Nationalist politicians in office at every level of government across the country.

Storytellers have been copying ideas from other folks and retelling them in their own ways since the dawn of storytelling. Shakespeare is one of the most famous English storywrites and his works are genuinely really good but most of them are based on the ideas of folks long before here. Romeo and Juliette is basically just Pyrrahmus and Thisbe with a more interesting set up.

I don't want to, like, completley dismiss your fears and the fears of folks like you but I really do feel like it's a stifling concern to have.

Another good excuse is ‚Äúalright it‚Äôs time to feed the baby but good seeing you guys‚Äù and then hopefully hubs can have them gone by the time you‚Äôre done.

"Adulting","t5_394gd","They charge that much because as long as parent #2 can make more than 32k a year, it's worth it. And that's really not that hard to do. That's also assuming parent 1 already does, because otherwise you can't afford 2 kids in the first place.

I'm pretty close to 6 figures, but I am unmarried and have no children. It's very easy to get by on my salary under these conditions, even in a high COL state.

If I had kids, it would be entirely different and I would struggle unless my partner also had decent earning potential.

Location does factor in too, but I think not as much as whether you have kids. And if you have 2 wage earners and no kids, you can either live large or just get easy jobs that don't pay as much and still get by as long as you're not in a high COL area. Being able to share living space, and all the items that fill it, cuts a lot of costs.",1685577693.0

"TeslaModelY","t5_3egmz","**Hello everyone, I am Mata, a MY car owner in China,**  
About 24 days ago, I shared on this subreddit that I installed an 11kw charging station in the underground public parking garage of my apartment.  
Recently I explored some features of my charging station, trying to share my charging station with other neighbors who need to use it. Because I think it is very interesting, I will continue to update and share today. This article does not involve any marketing, but only to share my experience.  
  
**Let me talk about the background environment first:**  
1. Chinese communities are generally in the form of apartment buildings. Because people live in cities concentratedly, public parking lots are used for parking in apartment buildings. Parking spaces need to be purchased as private property rights before they are allowed to install charging stations.  
2. The parking space downstairs in my community is very tight. I was lucky to buy my parking space and spent a total of $700 to get my 11kw home charging station. But there are many other neighbors whose EVs don't have this condition yet, and may need to drive to a public charging station near the apartment, and the price is also very expensive.  
3. Based on the needs of my neighbors, and hoping to help me meet more friends, I researched and used the shared charging station function, so that neighbors only need to follow my prompts and complete the self-booked charging service. This service is also currently helping me earn a little income, although it is difficult to help me recover my investment cost, but I think it is an interesting experience.  
4. As shown in the picture, I designed and customized the sign myself. In order to let other neighbors know that I am willing to share the charging station, I left my WeChat QR code so that they can contact me. I also posted it outside the protective box self-service guide. Eventually I got everything done, and a lot of neighbors started making reservations to use my home charging station.  
5. I heard that people in the US are generally not willing to open their private territories to strangers. It may be due to security reasons, so I sent a subreddit today, hoping to update some of your views.  
  
**Hope to hear your opinion too.**",1685577694.0

"sabres","t5_2raob","By that logic Power is more valuable than Dahlin?

Age can be a factor for sure, but anyone who would be putting a value on Tage would see a guy that has an incredible contract through the prime years of his career. 

So in this scenario, whether a player is 26 or 23 isn‚Äôt really meaningful. 

What is meaningful, however, is the contract. Tage is locked up for 7 years. Most importantly, there aren‚Äôt any insane clauses in his deal (only a 5 team no trade). 

By contrast, Dahlin is not locked up to anything. He has 1 year left before becoming an RFA, with a QO of over $7m which gives him leverage in negotiating his next deal. 

So a team that is trading for Dahlin is also dealing with the very real possibility that he is only in town for two years. Not only that, but it‚Äôs hard to imagine that Dahlin‚Äôs next contract is team-friendly, especially if he is traded.

Also, while Dahlin is dynamite with the puck, and he showed considerable growth in the d-zone, he‚Äôs still weak without the puck. So while Tage has his flaws, Dahlin is far from perfect.",1685577695.0

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","Yeah. That's a common problem. The problems we're facing world-wide are structural and global in scope. Cost of living prices are high because 8 billion of us are fighting for resources that would be lucky to serve 6 billion people. There's not enough wood and concrete for all our homes, enough metal and silicon for all our gadgets, enough food and water to fill our bellies, and not enough political will anywhere to fix any of this. And because there are so many of us clamouring for limited resources,  our impact on the world is pushing the world towards more extreme weather. And when extreme weather floods your house or burns it down or knocks it down or whatever, now you're in line for yet more wood, metal, concrete, sand, and so on, and bam, things are even more expensive. Oh yeah, and when people blow people's homes up, that makes shit even MORE strained.

Politicians can't do jack shit about this, whether they are Labour, National, Greens, ACT, NZ First, or the Democrats and Republicans on my side of the insane asylum. Sure. They'll promise you the sun, moon, and stars to get your vote, but you'll be lucky if they piss on you if you're on fire after they have your vote.

The funding rate on leveraged Bitcoin futures positions on OKX has jumped to its highest level since May 6th, indicating that speculators are net bullish. The positive funding rates are surprising given Bitcoin's near-5% drop from Monday's highs, but the OKX BTC long/short ratio has also jumped, with long positions now close to double short positions. However, some analysts warn that the risks of a long-position liquidation fuelled price drop have risen.

Ponaris oil can be irritating because of the different essential oils in it.  It stung my nose. Try to just use sesame oil. 

Also my ent said to be careful with using Kleenex or qtips in the nose. Our mucousa is very delicate and the Kleenex can cause irritation and small cuts as you mentioned. 

Be careful about putting fingers in the nose. 
It usually takes a few weeks for the nose bleed injury to heal. 

My ent said it can take a few months for the mucousa area to heal and get nice and plump again. 

I hope this helps. If it keeps rupturing it may need  cauterization of that blood vessel that‚Äôs probably very close to the surface. 
I just absolutely hate nosebleeds and have anxiety about them.  So sorry you‚Äôve had trouble.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","I would aim somewhere between, closer to the OP, don't start out with all having 4 superiority dice, have the baseline be something like 1 every 6 levels (2nd die at lvl 7, 3rd at 13), so you get your 4th at lvl 19, they can even stay at d8 the whole time, and give just a handful of maneuvers over time.   


Then you can have the battlemaster, who gets extra dice, the dice get bigger, gets extra maneuvers, ways to recharge dice, and so on. So if someone Really likes maneuvers, they can go big on them, but if they don't, they have a small handful and can just keep them for things like ""Precise strike, so I can fix my misses"" or whatever, while taking a different subclass.",1685577697.0

I'm freaking out and terrified this is now permanent and it was already very bad. It destroys sleep quality by keeping the brain in a slightly aroused state so that you never get the needed deep sleep. 

Somewhere I read that aldosterone can help but I don't know if I can persuade a doctor to let me try that. I'm very upset and I wish I had not gotten the endoscopy done at all.  It seems that I have become more and more sensitive to drugs as I am getting older. I'm 52.

I have other side effects from the propofol, too. Flushing of face, neck and chest. Nightmares. Heart pounding. High blood pressure. Feeling sick overall like I have a virus. What I call crunchiness in my neck (feels like tiny crystals are in the soft tissues, like sand grinding when I turn my head).  I expect these side effects to wear off as the drug leaves my system.

In the next 3 moves all attacks will count (if u wanna escape the frenzy) except passive moves (which can increase ur accuracy or which provides boost like roar), so in simple if ur pokemon knows a move which can increase accuracy,  then u r in luck, or u gotta use an item which helps u remove the 3 shot limitation and replaces it with a meter. U gotta kill ur opponents b4 the bar fills up or u r completely frenzied again ( the bar continues to fill the more time u waste while choosing options, slows down while playing attack animations).

In case of successful 3 shots, u get out of frenzy with a buff which will increase ur attack power drastically to the point where ur ""not so effective"" attacks will be ""effective"" against em and ""effective "" attacks will be ""super effective "", with 5% heal.",1685577699.0

"askastronomy","t5_2vang","I would go take a look at astropy which is a python module that does these sorts of coordinate transforms.

These are some overview links about coordinate transforms in astropy

[https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/transforming.html](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/transforming.html)

[https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/solarsystem.html#astropy-coordinates-solarsystem](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/solarsystem.html#astropy-coordinates-solarsystem)

These are the specific coordinate classes you probably want to use within astropy:

[https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.coordinates.ICRS.html#astropy.coordinates.ICRS](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.coordinates.ICRS.html#astropy.coordinates.ICRS)

[https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.coordinates.WGS84GeodeticRepresentation.html#](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.coordinates.WGS84GeodeticRepresentation.html#)

If you don't have a functional python environment, go log in to google collab and make a copy of this notebook, it just installs astropy and imports coordinate classes, so you can get started from the sample code in the above links

You can upload your file to collab and read it in with python, and write out your new coordinates:

"QuestPro","t5_519h2a","So I have always been pretty bullish on the Quest Pro still being the superior device for most usecases, at least for me, so wasn't that interested in the Quest 3.

That has changed a bit however since the leak revealing the Quest 3 has a depth sensor and much higher resolution, less laggy passthrough.

I love my Quest Pro, but the passthrough is absolutely one of the most useless elements and I never use it. It's not that I am uninterested in mixed reality, it's just the current implentation is crap.

Having to manually map out walls and furniture, then having the whole thing reset if I disable the guardian, which I always do for VR just means that MR is too much work for too little joy. My only use for it is playing Puzzling Places and watching TV (more accurately podcasts on Youtube and Spotify) at the same time.

Now we know that the Quest 3 will have much better passthrough, and that mixed reality, or Meta Reality 2.0 as they are calling it is the central focus for Meta right now, means I have to buy a Quest 3 to experience the best that Meta has to offer in tech right now.

That kind of sucks. I knew the Pro had an old, underpowered chip, but when I bought it, it was in the understanding they were bringing out the Quest 3 around October 2023 and a Quest Pro 2 towards the end of 2024.  I would, in that case have ignored Quest 3 and waited for Quest Pro 2.

Now they have canned that, it's back to the ugly look, bargain bucket materials of the budget Quest line, or just not get to experience the next gen of mixed reality with the depth sensor and XR2 Gen 2.

So I now have to buy a Quest 3, and weirdly, I find myself kind of hoping it's not too good, to justify my ¬£1500 investment in the Quest Pro.

I mean logically, the better the Quest 3 is the better for all of us. But as humans are more loss averse than reward seeking, it's a natural instinct to feel let down if the Quest 3 is a real beast and my Quest Pro is just left to gather dust.

Guess we will find out soon enough.",1685577700.0

It was seasonal but during that time we had 5.5 - 6.5 hour shifts with a team of 5-6 loading 6 trucks, 4 conveyer lines and you usually work through your break unless you have to use the restroom but you get a 30m lunch. Every night, someone went home or to the hospital because of an injury, either they broke something, got a deep cut, or fainted. They cram 8 hours of work into that 5hr shift. Literally everyone is drenched in sweat, climbing from conveyer to conveyer breaking up buildups of packages so the loader have nonstop flow of loading.

Shit happens all the time, and one time one truck was dispatched to the wrong destination because of so much shit going on and cost nearly $10k just to reroute that truck. For the location it was paying $17.50/hr, and you get benefits also college tuition is covered so that‚Äôs one thing they have going for it.

These are very real problems, including to national security. 

>A good example someone pointed out is imagining if Microsoft and Apple told congress in the 80s that GUIs were too dangerous and could enable terrorists and racists to be way too productive.

Not so sure this is a great example. For one, the US government did in fact take those threats very seriously from an early point, and secondly the threats from AI vs GUIs are quite different as the infrastructure to do harm is already there for AI so it can move rapidly, whereas the GUI was at a time when tech developed much slower.

"velvethippos","t5_v051u","The one I use when I'm traveling is by a brand called Nidra.

The reason I love it is because of the concave shape...it doesn't press down on your eyes, so it's vastly more comfortable to wear. Supposedly it allows the eyes to roam during REM sleep, allowing you to fall asleep more readily and stay asleep.

"Incestconfessions","t5_2958ax","Ok kiddo it‚Äôs important remember that they are your parents first and foremost, it is their responsibility to guide you through your journey of life. I wholeheartedly recommend you tell them how you are feeling and ask them for help. 

When it comes to relationships and your life apart from your mom and dad. It‚Äôs important to distinguish the two as separate as oil and water, make it very clear to yourself. 

Yes u can not tell anyone about your home life however that unequivocally does not mean you should not have a relationship with a man or woman of your choosing. 

Thinking of your new relationship with your parents as a bonus to your previous relationship with them is important to acknowledge. In other words the things you did and places you went should not change whatsoever. 
 MEANING 
Sleeping in your own room once in awhile. 
Going out with friends. 
MEETING NEW PEOPLE and remaining open to new experiences. 
Those are just a few examples that make for a balanced life. 

As for the excessive hygiene habits. 
Relax babe if you feel like you‚Äôre not doing anything wrong then you shouldn‚Äôt obsess over it. 
Your decisions on what you do with your life, body and time are no one‚Äôs business. 
I agree people would flip out if they new however one day you might find someone u can tell but for now patience is the name of the game and this is a safe space for you to vent and ask for advice. 

If the only thing you take away from this is talk to your parents about your feelings. I‚Äôm happy with that.   Good luck",1685577701.0

I also tried cocaine around that age.   


I'd say I'm less depressed these days, but I still have depression and a generally depressive mindstate. I'm not really suicidal other than passively (hence why I continue to use hard drugs) though, just really focused on living day by day.

Especially when Bethesda and ER world design is really different. First and foremost, ER world is not levelled, which makes the ""open"" in ""open world"" really questionable. When one-shotting mosters block your path, is the world really open?

In Bethesda games, the focus is on the world itself and the mosaic that is created by the small stories of people living there. In ER the focus is on the bosses and fights. The dungeons are nice, but the overworld lacks depth. At least with Bethesda worlds it shares the sense that there's a history behind it. But where Bethesda worlds feel natural, ER world feels theme-parky, with all the landmarks and glorious monuments everywhere. It's more about style than about substance.

Bethesda are masters of the open-world genre, while FromSoft are newbies in this genre. So it's no wonder that their first open world design is mediocre... It is no shame to not excell on the first try. But it is ridiculous that Bethesda would get inspired by the worldbuilding of ER in any way. Gameplay? Sure, there's a room to improve. World? No way.",1685577702.0

Some stories to consider that might fill these gaps:

Legends of the Dark Knight - Batman: Shaman - Details his time in Canada tracking a killer

Batman: Zero Year. One of the #0 issues, I forget if Batman or Detective Comics, details his college time and early admission into the FBI.

Batman: Blind Justice - the very end of the story details Bruce's time working with Henri Ducard, a bounty hunter/assassin

Batman: Haunted Knight - one of the short stories inside shows Bruce's time in France tracking down Burglars

Batman and Son, The Resurrection of Ra's Al Ghul, RIP - alludes to Bruce's time in Nanda Parbat undergoing the Thogal ritual, undergoing a meditative, simulated death

Batman: Zero Year - Scott Snyder alludes to Bruce's time in Africa learning meditative practices, but otherwise, the back up stories by James IV Tynion details his time in Egypt with an inventor, his time in Rio De Janeiro learning extreme driving skills, and high speed pursuits, his time in Norway learning crowd fighting tactics, etc 

Batman: The Knight - I haven't read this yet myself. But I've come to understand it shows some of his time in Europe?",1685577703.0

"FastLED","t5_3a9xo","You can use two frame buffers and do linear interpolation. One frame buffer you write your patterns into. Then when you are done you write to your output buffer. But the trick here is that your output buffer has a max increment and decrement that each component can increase per frame.

Something like:

    CRGB input[NUM_LEDS] = {0};
    CRGB output[NUM_LEDS] = {0};

    void setup() {
       // stuff
       FastLED.addLeds<...>(output);
    }
       
 
    void loop() {
      do_visualizer(&input[0], NUM_LEDS);
      for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; ++i) {
        const CRGB& in = input[I];
        CRGB& out = output[I];
        int diff_r = int(in.r) - out.r;
        int diff_g = int(in.g) - out.g;
        int diff_b = int(in.b) - out.b;
        diff_r = clamp<int>(diff_r, -8, 8);
        diff_g = clamp<int>(diff_g, -8, 8);
        diff_b = clamp<int>(diff_b, -8, 8);
        out.r = static_cast<uint8_t>(clamp(out.r + diff_r, 0, 255));
        out.g = static_cast<uint8_t>(clamp(out.g + diff_g, 0, 255));
        out.b = static_cast<uint8_t>(clamp(out.b + diff_b, 0, 255));
      }
      FastLED.show();
    }

As long as your colors aren't changing that fast, this will work extremely well. If your colors are changing extremely fast and you want a smoother gradient that handles both fast and slow interpolation then you can upgrade to use exponential interpolation using std::exp.",1685577703.0

Not doing so makes mistakes more common, checking for mistakes harder, and overall makes operations really hard to follow. Just keep x, and then replace it at the end, it'll be 10 times better.

Also you've probably made a mistake at some point cause that doesn't look right. Again hard to check, because of all the numbers and decimals everywhere.",1685577704.0

You just don't really get the one major difference between LRTs and streetcars aka trams cause of a weird Metrolinx hate fetish. Like I got my qualms with Metrolinx, but you're just wildin based on not understanding shit.

No, Thorncliffe Park and Flemingdon Park have three stops. Thorncliffe Park Station, Flemingdon Park Station and what is now Science Centre station but the name might change in the future. Someone who can't look at the Ontario Line plans and count three stations probably shouldn't take about transit planning.

Elevated trains run into the same issues as elevated highways, which is why their popularity and the amount constructed cratered just like elevated highways. They make sense for portions, such as the Ontario Line over up into Thorncliffe Park but for an entire line they complicate construction, tedious to maintain, expensive to maintain especially over longer periods of time and often end up as blights.

Wanting elevated trains and then acting as if they're somehow quicker to build than LRTs and surface+underground metros. Wild.",1685577704.0

not other stuff like over spending  on imports, not treating your academy team seriously etc.. and the worst part is that those are things that are hard to get data on, so you really can't blame riot for that.

in a relegations world, teams can still do all that, but you don't have to worry about bailing them out, because if they destroy themselves financially you have someone ready to take their spot when they fail.


also because you basically purposely courtes VC money when creating franchising you forced an inflation on the league, so reckless spending was always happening.

again in a relegations world you had for example immortals that was spending a lot and doing well, but other teams weren't necessarily super pressured into that type of spending (probably did inflate salaries but not everyone was doing it so it was okay)

it would also correct itself eventually, but since everyone basically had to divest to get into lcs everyone suddenly had VC money and well here we are",1685577704.0

At the time we had only been dating about 6 months and I was like hey we should go check out the atmosphere. We wound up scoring tickets and fell in love with each other and the dead right then and there and we left wanting so much more. When dead and co started we saw it as a a perfect opportunity to keep taking advantage of seeing this great music. Now we have been married for four years and we have two badass little boys. I understand why people may not be down because of mayer, or the slow tempo, or just the overall difference from the actual Grateful Dead, but at the end of the day, they are not the Grateful Dead. They are their own different bad that just play it differently while still playing it beautifully.

A few reminders:

1. NO FAKES, ZERO TOLERANCE. If you are caught selling/trading fakes **OF ANY KIND** (sneakers or not), you will be permanently banned **without warning**.

2. Please ensure that you have your items tagged **AND** priced. If not, your post will be removed **without warning**.

3. Only verified users can user their confirmation emails/photos. If you are not verified, please delete your post or a moderator will.

 **No posts of/about WOMEN /  SHE-MALES / TRANS and SISSIES. This is strictly due to the fact that this subreddit is for male gays only. We have received multiple complaints about the content of women being spammed. Therefore this rule was created.**

 **No harassment of any kind towards users.**
 
 **No spamming of any kind. Please limit yourself to two posts within 24 hours.**
 
 **If you find anything offensive on this subreddit, please do not hesitate to contact us. You can always report a post or user.**

 That's all,

Pothos take next to no maintenance if you put it in some water and make sure it doesn't go empty. It does great on bookshelves or other places out of pets reach as well.

(""After all, he comes from a long-lived family on his mother's side."") From the context of the conversation, he apparently thought or wanted to believe it was a lesser ring. And as he said, he didn't ""know"" what it was until he tested it. At that time he wasn't particularly well-versed or interested in rings, not yet knowing he was in a story called ""The Lord of the Rings.""

As for the other Great Rings having proper gems, they could have been lost in the intervening millennia, or there could have been more Great Rings that didn't make it into the poem and lacked gems. Imagine there were nineteen horses in the world and one zebra; all the horses are on a ranch, and the experts tell you the zebra is extinct. You hear hoof beats. You're probably going to think it's a previously unknown 20th horse.",1685577706.0

"hsp","t5_2sf60","I used to have an extremely mean inner voice. Honestly, it just took a lot of mindfulness and years of practice to change it. The first step is awareness. So anytime you notice negative self talk, take a moment and acknowledge ""woah, that was some negative self talk."" 

Once you feel comfortable acknowledging it regularly, try investigating it. ""Why do I feel that way? Why did I think that? Where did that thought come from?"" Most of the time, it's coming from a voice outside yourself (parents, society, friends, partners). I personally had this really big issue where I felt like if I was too ""soft"" on myself, I'd be lazy and never get anything done. It took a loooong time in therapy working on how that viewpoint was coming from my parents and the reality was that I was being so mean to myself, I was constantly paralyzed with anxiety. I realized I might actually get more done if I was nice to myself instead. I got to a place where I was willing to try it.

Finally, begin challenging the thoughts. Now everytime you notice that you're being mean to yourself, acknowledge it, notice where it's coming from, and counter with something that feels at least somewhat true. Example on one I'm currently struggling with: ""ugh you haven't cleaned in months. You could literally be on hoarders. What kind of adult are you? You don't even have basic life skills. No one will ever love you because you're an embarrassment.""

""Wow, that was a judgemental thought. Seems pretty unhelpful to think that way. That has to be coming from my conservative upbringing. I was told it was a woman's job to do the housekeeping and since I struggle with it, I feel less than. When I think that way, it makes me feel ashamed and even less motivated to do anything. I'll make sure to keep addressing this point as these thoughts come up, because they're counterproductive."" On this issue, I'm not able to directly counter the thoughts yet because it still feels true to me that I'm an embarrassment and lack basic life skills and yadayada. But it also feels true to me that thinking that way is unhelpful, so pointing that out is a good first step.",1685577706.0

While Americans accumulated $2.3 trillion in savings in 2020-summer 2021 ([Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/excess-savings-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-20221021.html)), we also spent 1/4 of those excess savings in the period from late 2021 through October 2022. The savings rate has also dropped below prepandemic levels (same source) and miscellanneous sources of COVID-era aid (PPP, rent relief, federal student loan freezes, etc.) have dried up. 

And inflation peaked at 9% in June 2022 ([S&P](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/fed-tightens-money-supply-as-us-inflation-falls-from-2022-peak-73547811)). 

While I respect and appreciate your counterpoint - and I think Reddit can always, always use a lesson in being critical of their sources - and I *definitely* agree with your later point that the media tends to butcher statistics and mislead the public (often maliciously)...

"Firearms","t5_2ryez","Wow, I heard them say that they strongly opposed smart guns and I was hoping they would do this. Thought it was a pipe dream, but here we are. This is a very smart move. If we are being honest with ourselves, electronic guns are the future. They have the potential to be simpler, more reliable, easier to shoot, cheaper, and more feature-rich than purely mechanical firearms. We aren‚Äôt there yet, but given enough demand, we will be eventually. If they start selling in NJ to chase this short-term cash, it‚Äôll cause resentment throughout the entire firearms community and likely poison the idea of electronic firearms forever. Then, their sales would be limited to how many states they can lobby to implement similar legislation. However, by refusing to sell in any states that require smart guns, they get major respect from the community and a clear shot to penetrate the market. 

And for those of you who say ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never trust my life to a computer‚Äù, if you‚Äôve ever been in a car made in the last ten years, you already have. The fact of the matter is that in software development, your requirements shape your product. For something like a smartphone, it‚Äôs all about features. As long as it is stable enough to not be super annoying, that‚Äôs fine. The occasional crash is not an issue. But, the code that runs in a pacemaker or an F35 has different requirements. All of a sudden, reliability and security is the number one concern. This influences the software design decisions and leads to a very reliable and secure device.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","""Because I'm told God loves me""

What told you God loves you?

The bible.

You are also told by the bible that Christ is the way, the truth, amd the light. No one comes to the Father except through him.

If you do not know Christ you will not find the father because you will be damned for your sin before you find him. God loves you, but you've done fucked up things that require Christ's forgiveness, as have we all. We need Christ to bring us to the Father. You will be lost without him.

Your argument seems to be ""I exist so I deserve heaven"" scripture does not support this.

Hell is only eternal torment for Satan and his ilk. Unsaved humans will experience the 2nd death. Annihilation. The fires burn for eternity, that doesn't mean humans will be tortured for eternity there is no scripture that says this.",1685577708.0

"nursing","t5_2ra72","When I was in the hospital at the end of 2020, with bilateral pneumonia from COVID 19. I literally thought I was going to die, my O¬≤ sats were down in the low 80's when i would sleep, the Dr's were extremely reluctant to put in an ET tube because of it being contraindicated because of my weight, as well as esophageal and tracheal scarring from tracheal reflux. 

I was scared, and my whole family was at home nearly as ill as me. So I couldn't call them up or Skype with them often. 

The brief < 3 minute interactions with nurses that I had during my hospital stay helped keep me sane. 

The hospital was terribly understaffed and overwhelmed with covid patients, most with ET tubes. 

The nurses were exhausted, and I know it took everything in them to just show up to work. 

Bedside manner is important, but during a pandemic, it's understandable to be extremely brief with your patients. Even now, I don't expect more than standard care. 

If a nurse blows a vein and doesn't apologize or makes another mistake/error like slamming meds that need to be pushed over time, I get unhappy. 

But negligence of duties  aside, I've never had an issue with nurses being brief. 

(Even if you blow my vein, or have to stick me 6 times to get the right angle, or accidentally push a med too quickly, it doesn't make you a bad nurse, you're just having a bad day. It happens to everyone. Don't let people drag you down.) 

I just wanna say thanks to all the nurses, aides, techs, and other underappreciated medical professionals who see this comment.

#Section 3 - [Lap 3](https://youtu.be/F6Dh0PH9FmE)

By now, 2095 will have taken quite a beating. The frequency of the orbs by this point will have only gotten greater, providing more chances for both Electra and 2095 to be hit. As a result, Electra will take on a more defensive position, resembling a ‚Äúcup in ball‚Äù trick. Using the shadows in previous carts that were inked before in Lap 1 (as well as the carts Electra‚Äôs already controlling) Electra will use VFT to drive these carts. She will slick herself in pure black and then have the carts weave around each other, shuffling Electra‚Äôs place amongst the carts and effectively hiding her. Here, Electra‚Äôs hidden in plain sight. By covering herself in ink, her cart looks just like the others. She will flatten herself on the inside of the cart, taking extra care to not have anything peek out other than what‚Äôs needed- her eyes. This minimizes the damage that Electra can take to her own body via the orbs, as well as making her a smaller and inconspicuous target that both 2095 and YT has to touch. During this shell game, random carts will activate their Spider Mode and collect orbs.

By constantly shuffling around the carts, she can make it impossible for her target to figure out exactly which cart Electra has hidden herself within. If 2095 tries to brute force the solution to this game of musical chairs, Electra can force the cart vine to careen into one of the numerous light orbs flying by, catching 2095 off balance and off guard. Small Sunvines can then spawn in from the surrounding carts and use the stored ammunition created to blast away 2095 for yet more damage. While that happens, the remaining carts can circle within the track, going over the ceiling and scoping out for new carts to add into the shuffle.  

During this cart shuffle, it is inevitable that some carts wind up lagging behind or being discarded as new carts are brought into the fold. With the ever-increasing number of explosive orbs, it‚Äôll be pretty easy to believe that a cart or two got its vine hit and thus became inert. To 2095, naive and unable to detect deception, these carts are no longer anything to worry about, as her main target is assuredly among the still active carts racing ahead of her. However, unbeknownst to her prey, Electra will take one of these explosions as her cue to pull back on her own cart, letting 2095 continue past her ‚Äúdiscarded‚Äù cart, before once again driving after 2095. Now, with the formation being ‚Äúdummy carts < 2095 < Electra‚Äù, Electra can safely trail behind her intended target and plan out the moves and positions of her cart shuffle with the absolute safety, her subterfuge having given her the slip from her opponent‚Äôs sights. 

The longer this fight goes on, the more numerous the orbs of light streaking through the battlefield will become. To combat the explosive force from them hitting the minecarts, we can use *our own ammunition as a shield here*. Since these orbs have A durability and won‚Äôt be detonated in a chain reaction, they should be capable of blocking a large amount of damage and keep the vines driving these vehicles relatively safe. The Sunvines can continue to take from these pools of light orbs, as by the time we hit this late in the game the carts should be able to restock their stores of orbs faster than they can be shot out. Electra can go one step further, once her kart is out of 2095‚Äôs sights.

 After using Spider Mode on her own cart, Electra can take as many light orbs that were produced and shove them into her clothing to create a sort of rudimentary body armor. With her jacket full of these light orbs, Electra is ready to ride the unstoppable wave of orbs in relative safety. It also gives her an emergency attack option, in case 2095 catches onto Electra's trick and attacks her directly. By hurling the jacket towards 2095, the light orbs inside it will become active once more, and they will fly through the jacket at A power towards 2095‚Äôs approaching body, slamming them outta the way.

All of these options can be used defensively to force 2095 into wasting time, putting more pressure, and sticking her neck out more, both figuratively and literally. With the onslaught of orbs from every direction, and the carts that could act as her safe haven having been compromised, it will only be a matter of time before 2095 is rendered unable to stay standing. 
#Contingencies - [Results](https://youtu.be/Vtmo5ZwWb6c)

* **What happens if the vine in Cart B is destroyed?** Early on, Electra isn't pushing the cap on her vine usage. As such, she can deal with the vine piloting Cart B getting destroyed, as she can simply create another one to replace it swiftly. Since the cart is flying above her head for the majority of its tenure, it is a simple matter of just looking up at it. If the cart itself manages to get destroyed or severely knocked out of position before she could re-right it, Electra can shift her position back to the ceiling and use the previous setup from before to call upon a new cart on the track to take Cart B‚Äôs place. 

* **What happens if Electra is thrown out of a cart?** If Electra is pulled out of a cart, it makes her extremely vulnerable to both attacks and hits from orbs. The majority of our plans involve having control of multiple carts, though, so even with a single cart lost Electra should have a fallback somewhere on the course she can commandeer. In addition, Electra can preempt getting thrown out of her vehicle by utilizing a seatbelt or tether wire made out of VFT vines. By using these vines to keep her in place, she can prevent getting knocked out in the event another cart slams into her own, or a light orb explodes in just the wrong way. Even while mid-flight, if the explosion destroyed her seatbelt, Electra can fire a vine from her own face to re-grab the cart and drag herself back to it.",1685577711.0

Idk if you‚Äôre that in the know on this, but the consensus on the ending for tlou2 hater sub is that Joel didn‚Äôt safe Ellie because he didn‚Äôt want to lose another daughter. He saved her because he thought the cure was a joke and wouldn‚Äôt work. Literally nothing in the game supports this, and everything supports Joel saving Ellie because of the connection they built and him not wanting to lose another daughter. So yea, I guess not everyone understands such an easy to understand story. It‚Äôs their ‚Äúinterpretation‚Äù because they want to paint Joel into the best light they can. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt Save the girl because of his loss in the past, it‚Äôs because he saw past the bullshit of the fireflies and knew a cure wasn‚Äôt possible!‚Äù


I wish the discussion was centered around questions like these. Was Ellie‚Äôs life worth it? Would Joel ever make a different choice? Would things have gone differently if he got to say goodbye? Would Ellie say yes if asked by Marlene? Was the vaccine really the only way Ellie‚Äôs life would have mattered?

"churning","t5_2vrf0","Do you have any advice regarding limiting the impact on my credit score? How many cards I should get, what % utilization I should stay under, how long before applying for a mortgage I should pay them all off? The goal is to put as much on them as possible while the 0% apr period is active so I can stick that money in a HYSA or t-notes. So I'm trying to find the happy medium between number of cards, credit utilization, and at what point I should stop what I'm doing and pay them off. 

Obviously there's going to be some credit hit if I'm going to get a mortgage in the next 2 years, and I can always refinance later down the road, so this isn't a massive concern, but would be good to know how much of a hit I can expect and how to limit it.

On the one hand, I get it. It is hard to help people who have been mean and hurtful. **BUT** if you are going to be a doctor, you need to get over that. You are not judge, juror, and executioner- you have a duty to provide the best health care possible, or to turn the case over to someone else. Technically, you aren't yet a doctor, but this would have been good practice for the future. But if you were in a hospital, you can't just say ""nope, I don't help bigots""- if there is some reason why you can't provide the care yourself, you have to find another doctor to switch out with.

"Vermintide","t5_36d6l","Except most of those examples are either situational in a way the player has no control over, or straight up don't work with the level 30 talent for wider walls.

""You can stop a storm"" : very situationally, yes.

""you can build a tent"" : enemies swinging through the wall anyways say hello. Due to the limited size this really isn't viable in any situation where you couldn't just get the ally up anyways. in order to actually enclose them with how pitiful the width is the walls have to be rather close. Close enough for a single rat deciding to overhead to completely undo that tactic. :: This was addressed by my suggestion to make the wall be made up of more brambles, but form a slightly curved placement, allowing it to take up about the same/slightly more horizontal space but actually be applicable in this kind of situation vis-a-vis covering more ground when encircling a point while covering relatively the same ground while holding a line. This is also addressed by making the wall delete enemy swings trying to go through it, making it actually viable as a clutch revive tool right out of the box. (Deleting the hurtbox off of swings passing through being a cheaty method to do so assuming it would be easier than making bouncing enemy swings off of it consistently functional)

""you can wall wider sections"" : not with any particular functionality. If there's any level of unevenness in the ground making sure the walls actually intersect properly is more nuisance than skill. :: Again, addressed by the curve, making intersecting two quickly cast walls more art than painstakingly finicky science on some maps.

You are listing theoretical tactics that don't apply in practicality due to jank and flaws in how the skill actually works out in game: that being the very thing I'm pointing out and criticizing. The walls lacks the means to actually *do* any of that before the level 30 wall.

I'm not criticizing the idea that a wall as an ability isn't useful, just that the sub-30 wall lacks critical functionality to achieve those ideals in a way that isn't *making do with a design that is sub-par*.

FK's charge still bowls enemies sub-30. Unchained bomb still vents overcharge sub-30. GK sword still chews CW's sub 30. But Thornwake, the *wall*, being *viable as a wall* is locked behind Ironbark thicket, a level 30 talent. And even *then* there's still jank that warrants fixing.

Other abilities get *bonuses* at level 30. Thornwake gets to *start working as the sole thing it was supposed to be the whole time*.

Your worst case is A: indicative of how useless it is that it's most consistent use is *two crits*. And B: Not the worst case.

The worst case is a sister casting sub-30 thornwake directly on top of you, completely removing your ability to do any attack other than push while enemies can freely wail on your movement-impaired butt cheeks because on top of instantly eating most any attacks you try to make, it slows you as well. And most suggestions are around specifically fixing *that*. Like making attacks eaten by the wall stagger enemies around it with the stagger value of the eaten attack; very specifically only useful at making sure that wall a sister tried casting to help doesn't cancel the stagger you were relying on for the mauler about to, well, maul you.

You have two casts, but it still doesn't practically add up to mattering. You either use both to make a wall wide enough to actually help, but that doesn't last long enough, or use both to make a wall last long enough but be too weedy to actually matter.

&#x200B;

But I should say, yeah, there *are* situations where using it *isn't* detrimental. But when your ability being *unconditionally helpful* feels like an *exception of it's design*, something is seriously *whack*.

There are situations where it helps, but not in a square peg - square hole kind of way. The situations where wall is good is like using Bomb Balm and spamming Unchained bomb to generate THP.

Sure that's a *thing*, but if that's *all* you consider it useful for then I'm gonna go ahead and consider it a weak ability. (I don't consider bomb weak, btw, just an example of how Thornwakes *strengths* are more ancillary effects that wind up happening than the ability's core function being, well, *functional*)",1685577713.0

"Albuquerque","t5_2qxoe","It's pretty rare that someone would continue driving a freeway speeds with smoke and later flames pouring off a trailer they are hauling.  But that's what someone was doing yesterday. And continuing to drive with a failed wheel bearing absolutely can cause enough friction to heat the metal enough to cause the bearing grease or the tire to catch fire. Even a pretty brief online search comes up with plenty of descriptions of it happening when someone ignored the signs of  a problem and just kept driving.

Here's an article that lists wheel bearing fires as one of the seven most common causes of RV fires [https://www.mortonsonthemove.com/rv-fire/](https://www.mortonsonthemove.com/rv-fire/)

Or here, some statistics on vehicle fires

>In his 2016 report on truck, trailer, and bus fires, Peter Hart  
>  
>identified five potential causes of truck trailer and bus fires:  
>  
>electrical, turbocharger and exhaust systems, hot brakes and wheel bearings, tires, and road debris.14 He noted that flat or underinflated

>truck tires can catch fire, as can tires that rub against hard surfaces.

>Brake and wheel bearing failures can also cause tire ignitions. Tires

Here's one about wheel fires on semi-trucks, listing failing wheel bearings as a cause [https://www.fleetmaintenance.com/equipment/brakes-tire-and-wheel/article/21273180/how-wheelend-monitoring-helps-avoid-costly-thermal-events](https://www.fleetmaintenance.com/equipment/brakes-tire-and-wheel/article/21273180/how-wheelend-monitoring-helps-avoid-costly-thermal-events)

Here's what looks to be a legal document about vehicle fires  that lists wheel bearing failures as a cause of the fires. [https://hartwood.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Why-Trucks-Catch-Fire.pdf](https://hartwood.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Why-Trucks-Catch-Fire.pdf)

"oxforduni","t5_2s4rg","A couple of points. Riz uses they/them pronouns; please correct your post. Also, this is, in the least confrontational way, quite badly written. Are you new to academic writing? I'd recommend cutting down on the number of unnecessary synonyms. Make your sentences shorter. Getting your point across concisely and accessibly is a useful skill. I would worry that your post in its current form comes across as a bit pretentious and self-important. I'm sure that's not what you meant, but it might be contributing to the hostile reception you're getting.

As for your argument's substance, I think there are some other issues. You seem to give a very strong weighting to 'scientific facts' without really questioning what this means. A lot of the questions in the debate around trans rights are normative or social. A central claim in modern gender theory is that gender is a social construct. You briefly acknowledge this at the beginning of your post. As a result, it's almost impossible to stick wholly to 'scientific facts' and still treat both sides fairly. In any case, with something like gender, it's very hard to draw the line with what is and isn't a ""scientific fact"".

It's not clear how familiar you are with the existing literature on this. As others have pointed out, you incorrectly assert that trans identities and ideas are 'new and emerging'. A basic familiarity with scholarship on this question should have corrected this (unless you're taking a *very* radical historicist line, but I don't think you are). I appreciate your enthusiasm to write on this, but I think you would be well served to take your own advice. Debate should be based on a strong understanding of the scholarship, and you haven't really shown that.

You don't ever actually *argue* that your ideal mode of 'factual and scientific debate' is good. You just say it is, and then take it as given. It's not clear what you mean by this, either. You say that debate should be to 'comprehend and delve into the essence of' trans identity. You explicitly say that it should 'not be to marginalize or discriminate'. Surely, though, non-trans people have no insights of their own on trans identity. They may derive conclusions from what trans people say about trans identity, but they don't know anything about it without asking. If you understand the ""debate"" as just asking trans people questions about their lives, I don't think you'd find many people who object. But that's not what Dr Stock's talk was about. That was a non-trans person giving her opinion on trans issues, an opinion widely considered discriminatory by trans people. Surely that's as 'baseless' as the protests against her, going by what you've said. 

I'd also question how cleanly we can apply your standards for transphobia. What counts as 'prejudiced' and 'biased'? I think most trans people would accuse Stock of being prejudiced and biased towards them. She, equally, would likely accuse some of them of the same towards her. What makes an opinion 'groundless'? Many people have noted that Stock doesn't specialize in gender philosophy, and doesn't seem to know the existing scholarship well. Are her opinions thus 'groundless'? There are lots of ways to interpret your definition of transphobia, and they range from allowing virtually any opinions as long as they can claim to be based in ""facts"" (even if this is done in bad faith or ignorance) to allowing basically no opinions other than those of trans rights activists.

Basically, I don't think your post argues anything coherent. You don't argue your own points enough. You mostly just state them. You end up making points that are so vague they could be interpreted in an incredibly wide range of ways. I'm happy to help talk through some of the ideas you're trying to get across, if you like.",1685577713.0

Train goes in the opposite direction **on the opposite bound track.**

The Powerplant has only the southbound track.

On Freeroam, the train only spawns running in a specific direction dictated by the track, but in areas where opposite bound tracks run parallel, the train can spawn running in either direction.

During the nightclub sale that OP was attempting, the train will never, ever spawn running southbound.

"WattsFree4All","t5_6b1bd0","‚Ä¶..and notice that they waited til the very end to actually arrest him.  After he completely spilled his guts.  Miranda does not have to be given until the suspect is arrested and in custody.  In reality, Tammy and Coder did nothing wrong.  They lied and manipulated Chris.  They parsed their words but, that is what detectives are trained to do‚Ä¶..get a confession using any method you can.  Personally, I don‚Äôt agree that it is legal for law enforcement to lie to a suspect, or anyone else that is being looked at in a criminal case.  I think Chris Watts was the bottom 1/1000 of the people that know absolutely nothing about our CJ system‚Ä¶..his dad as well.  One episode of Law in Order and that would have greatly increased their knowledge!!  Chris and Ronnie are honest, forthright men.  They don‚Äôt intentionally lie so, I am sure that they thought that no one at the level of detective/agent of the CBI and FBI would *ever* lie to him or anyone.  Law enforcement are the good guys, in Chris‚Äô mind, they have a reputation to uphold, they would never be dishonest and manipulative.  He had the wrong impression of law enforcement and was like putty in their hands as he was used to being lied to and manipulated.  Shannan had trained him to just roll over and accept it‚Ä¶.do what you are told, say what others want to hear, make everyone happy at all costs even if you have to sacrifice your own happiness and goal.

English club at my school is student run and has very low commitment. Even the JTE heading the club shows up every other week just to get progress report or see what they‚Äôre doing. I usually do an activity with them every other Tuesday that will push my to stay until 4:30. Other than that, during club time they write their own school newspaper in English and publish it every month. It‚Äôs not really much for me to do besides. I‚Äôll pop in every now and then to see the progress and make any corrections.

So what do I do? Go home at 4 everyday usually. I live 5 minutes away by bike, so I‚Äôm usually home by 4:05 or 4:20 if I decide to stop by the conbini after work. I‚Äôm currently 8 months pregnant so I really look forward to getting home, showering and laying on my bed until I fall asleep lol. Sometimes if I have a burst of sudden energy, I‚Äôll go for a walk or bike ride around my neighborhood. But usually it‚Äôs get home by 4:05-4:30, shower, lay down for a bit, do housework, do schoolwork (I‚Äôm in grad school), eat dinner, watch YouTube or browse Reddit, fall asleep around 9-11pm depending how tired I am.

"Seattle","t5_2qhad","Curious about some of these observations - as a local who grew up here, I think Seattle is currently very similar to most other high cost of living cities in terms of culture, drugs, crime, etc. That being said, grass is always greener, etc etc. 

Not to say that it's at all high-crime or unsafe by any means, but if you really spend anytime in Downtown, Ballard, Capitol Hill, or on public transportation, you'll see folks smoking/shooting up pretty regularly (it's not pot!). I literally see folks injecting/smoking on a daily basis (and minding their own business). Violent crime is pretty low but not significantly different than Portland, the Bay, etc. and property crime is higher than LA and NYC. I'm not sure that politically ""we get shit done"" or that we're hyper-progressive, but that depends on what you're comparing us to...LA does sound like a mess in that regard! However, the ""Seattle process"" is often invoked for a reason, and there are many people really suffering here, and the high cost of living/housing is a big reason why, as is our state being not that great in terms of mental health resources.

Also lastly, while I have quibbles with some of your other descriptions of friendliness, etc. the biggest disagreement is around the music scene being thriving and happening. This is so dead wrong - working musicians/artists cannot afford to live in Seattle - period. If you're looking for where they actually are - try Portland, Tacoma, Olympia, Everett... heck, even LA. I could go on about this, and while some people make it work, it's very very hard to be a musician or working artist in Seattle, even if you have some relative success. There are lots of venues sure, but not anymore or less than any similar sized city, and they generally pay bands shit money. 

Seattle will always be home to me and there is a lot of natural beauty here, but honest recommendation if I was looking to move to the PNW as a younger, single person who cares about outdoors, music, and affordability, I'd be looking at Tacoma or Portland. 

Seattle is continuing it's trajectory of just being a few years behind the Bay Area in terms of culture, politics, income/wealth disparities, etc. and honestly even our food is getting worse (fuck even the eastside has better and more affordable food) and living is becoming more and more unaffordable.

extending the three point line means we might need a bigger court. and that would greatly affect international and college play, but it would weed out some factors. luckily hardwood differs between stadium, but it would be crazy to have diverse nba courts like major league baseball.

"AskRedditAfterDark","t5_2vh2s","Not really . The way it works no matter how many people join as creators they aren‚Äôt competing against other creators . It‚Äôs an individualistic thing . Most subscribers only subscribe to that one person and they do so because they like that person and either want to support the content monetarily or want that interactive component or customs etc . A 20 year old brunette isn‚Äôt going to steal another 20 year old brunettes fans . They are their own niche .  The mistake some creators make is trying to emulate what they think sells and it‚Äôs not that type of business. 

If there are 10,000 creators and monthly OF income generated is say 100,000 (these are all way small) , creators 10001, 10002 and 10003 aren‚Äôt carving out that 100,000 dollars . They‚Äôre bringing in their own unique fans for the most part 

It does help if you have built in socials already but a vast majority of people who are doing it and successful started from scratch and grind it out . My husband and I helped a ton of people follow the right path and they eventually got to where they needed on their own 

And the great thing is content creators are making a lot more this year than last year and last year was already ahead of 2021 . In 2021 5000 a month would get someone in the top 2.1- 2.4%  last year that same 5000 had them at 2.5-2.7 area and this year 5000 a month is closer to 2.8- 3%  .

"DeepRockGalactic","t5_3iufz","Like the other guy, I run the same Cyro and Colette build sometimes. Like, exactly the same, mod for mod.

However, something I struggle with while using this setup is being able to deal with praetorians, wardens and menaces by myself, since the Colette basically tickles enemies that aren't frozen. That's why I run Ice Spear in my main build instead. You freeze enemies a little slower, but in exchange you get a degree of being able to deal with these problem enemies. Also, popping frozen praetorians feels good.

If you really want to spec into turning your enemies into popsicles, I would use 31222 Snowball. It eats through ammo like nothing else, but in exchange, you get a portable freeze ray/cyro grenade hybrid. If you want a little more flexibility at, well, the cost of freezing power, I would use 21232 instead.

Which was a lie, Beerus didn't even get a scratch for the whole duration of the fight and he actually barely used 30% of his power (personnaly I think he also lied to Whis there and actually only used 10% at best but that's my headcanon so I digress).

Please post with a title that fits one of these 3 options depending on your question:

**1. For identifying a song/artist/album** - please include at least one of these details in your title:

`Era/Year | Genre | Style | Artist type (or name if you know) | Music video information | Source name`  
`Language/Country | Lyrics/Content | Cover art | Description | Possible (or known) song name`

* Note that the safest way to make sure your post is accepted is to include at least one of the relevant keywords with a colon (Lyrics:, Source name:, Music video:, etc.).
* If you know many of the details *don't overload the title* - only include the most important/unique details, and put the rest inside the post.

`Examples of descriptive titles:`

  - 90's song by an alternative rock band (male singer/s)
  - Ballad by a female singer, sounds like it's from the 80's
  - Music video where a guy is walking in the street towards the camera {=Bittersweet Symphony btw}
  - Upbeat Latin song
  - Meme video of a cat bobbing its head to a fast beat
  - Calm piano instrumental
  - Source name: [the name of a film/show/YouTuber/etc. Please don't put a url as the detail here]
  - Lyrics: [the lyrics you remember]
  - Content: Song was about people on a road trip

`When relevant you can also use:`

  - I only remember the melody that I recreated here
  - I only have this recording, don't know any details

`Titles that aren't descriptive enough:`

  - What's the background music in this video?
  - I forgot the name of this popular song

**2. For identifying a genre** you should use a format like:

  - What's the genre of the song ... by ...? [add the actual details]
  - What's the sub-genre of this electronic background music?

**3. For locating an already identified song/album in a legal way** you should use a format like:

  - Help locate ... by ... [add the actual details]
  - Where can I buy/stream ... by ...?

Thank you and good luck :)

"seculartalk","t5_314b6","We're getting into the weeds and explaining my thought process on this will take some time, but if you're interested, I'm game, so here goes.

Let's start with U.S. with registry. Government implements strict gun control amounting to mandatory surrender of all guns (extreme for sake of illustration. Using registry, they know where a significant number of guns in the U.S. reside (let's say 60%, ~250mil). So, when those individuals don't willingly surrender guns, federal agents begin to go door-to-door, collecting. Some may manage to hide one or 2. Some resist, are killed. At the end of the confiscation, only a few million people (who were not previously criminals) still have any guns, and the number of guns in the hands of otherwise non-criminals is in the neighborhood of 50mil.

Now, U.S. with no registry. Government implements mandatory surrender. In order to enforce, they have to rely on records kept by various gun suppliers (receipts, credit card records, etc.) However, due to there not being a necessity to report private sale of any guns, there's plausible deniability of possession for those individuals, not to mention cash sales, stores that have gone out of business or lost records, etc. Now, due to the difficulty of enforcing confiscation, we may be talking 200+mil guns in the hands of 10s of millions of non-criminals.

In the second scenario, the potential resistance to that tyrannical government is significantly more potent. It's a crude illustration with completely arbitrary numbers, but hopefully it at least serves to illustrate my logic.",1685577718.0

That's all you need to do right now, and also keep checking up on your friend's mental health, they might not show it but I'm sure they greatly appreciate that. Good luck.

Oh and also, about how you feel, again, acknowledge your emotions but don't let them get the better of you, just stay strong and keep doing what you're doing, sounds like you're doing a fine job, don't let the past stop you from the greatness you're clearly going to achieve.",1685577718.0

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","I have to say the doctor is good. 

Bad/evil characters tend to be one of three things:

1) They believe they're doing what is good, despite going against established morality. This is your Lex Luthors and Thanos types.

2) They know they're bad, and they embrace it or continue regardless. This is The Master, who admits to being crazy and evil and with no intention to change, even if they may occasionally do something half decent.

3) They're just flat crazy and don't care if what they do is good or bad, if they even recognize good vs bad at all.

The Doctor doesn't fit into those. I taught my kids that everyone does both good and bad things, has both good and bad thoughts. We can't help that. Doing something mean or bad doesn't make us bad people. What makes bad people is when we purposely continue that way, or don't regret or learn from it. If we strive to make the good choices, that is what makes good people...even when we mess up along the way. This is The Doctor.

The Doctor sees when he messes up, isn't good enough, and didn't uphold his title. He wants to fix and change it, to be better. When he puts companions in more danger than usual, he often pulls away from people for a while. When a choice shouldn't be his to make, he steps back. The few times he doesn't, he regrets it and changes his course again. He's always changing to try being better, and that's what makes a good man.",1685577718.0

The confession thing comes from the apostles having the authority on behalf of God to forgive sins (John 20:21-23) and this being passed on by the apostles to others in the church (2 Cor 2:10). James 5 also talks about the presbyters having responsibility to maintain the spiritual health of people in the church and specifically James 5: 16 to confess our sins to one another. 

The priests have authority from God to forgive because the apostles did and that continues to be passed down through the laying on of hands (Lk 4:40, acts 8:14-19, 1 Tim 5:22 etc)",1685577719.0

"Atlanta","t5_2qiq9","Have you looked at the comps they used to come up with that value?

Mine's gone up each year except for the last few years, but they always show me the house sale ""comps"" that it's averaged on. Each year I think ""bullshit"" and then compare the comps and lo and behold, it's in the middle of the pack of the closest comps, (and the comps are usually closest to my house both by distance, by size in sq ft, by bedroom/bathrooms, and by lot size).

If yours goes up again by that much, you may want to protest, and there are some people who protest it all the time. I think it does freeze increases for a couple years if you protest. 2 for my county, I think.

I've never protested mine because I know I got a hella deal, and they haven't increased my assessment for a couple of years now. Honestly, it's below market value by a fair amount (and always had been except for one year it was pretty close to market, but again, they did a good assessment). And my house is on a cul-de-sac, which always commands a premium with sales,  but is never factored unto for comps, so I'm fine with how Cobb assesses things.

They're required by law to have FMV be done in a relatively fair manner. So if you can find other comps to make your case for a different value, then go ahead and protest. For me, I was never interested in all that because I agree with their assessments and the comps they're using -- it's East Cobb, so it's a highly desirable area for many families. And for me, it's a sign I made a good investment if values are always going up and the county has to keep up with the assessments. Taxes are generally low for me anyways, especially for what my house is valued at now, and that I'm in a super safe area, so the services are great. And I'm always hustling to land a higher salary, so I sort of stay ahead of increases that way, too.",1685577721.0

She has new neighbors who absolutely know all of her embarrassing business (b/c SHE put it out there). 
I NEVER hope that PM tries to throw her out of the hospital or A's family yells at her at family events. Those sort of things ONLY result in upsetting everyone.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","This is why Sony's Kevin Butler ads ended, actually.

The famous ad campaign for the PS3 in the early New Tens was widely popular among gamers and fans of the Sony brand, due to having a memorable character played by the actor Jerry Lambert. But then Lambert took a role for an ad by Bridgestone Tires which was basically the exact same character... and Bridgestone was using it as a deal with Nintendo to sell Nintendo Wiis; he even appeared in-character playing Mario Kart.

Having the face of the company directly shilling for a direct competitor was severely damaging for the brand, right after Sony had spent a lot of money setting up a new year of planned advertising featuring the character which they were forced to scrap. Given the timing of the Bridgestone fiasco, it's likely that Kevin Butler was meant to be involved in the PS4 ad campaign as well. Naturally, this led to Lambert being sued for breach of contract but it was settled out of court.

It's also why Wendy's dropped the original actress from their ""Where's the beef?"" ad campaign after only a single year; she appeared in an ad for Prego spaghetti sauce where she said she finally found the beef in the sauce.",1685577722.0

"GunAccessoriesForSale","t5_h4uwp","Paypal offers two different services.  Paypal Friends and Family (F&F) has zero fees, but offer no protections and makes the buyer vulnerable to scammers.  Paypal Goods and Services (G&S) charges an additional ~3% of the item price (actually 3.49% and $0.49 as of 2021), but provides the buyer insurance in case the seller dissapears without providing the item.  Paypal does prohibit [some specific items](https://web.archive.org/web/20180409201310/https://www.paypal.com/us/selfhelp/article/what-is-paypal%E2%80%99s-policy-on-transactions-that-involve-firearms-faq585) but has a ""catch all comment"" that may apply to others, so NO NOTES IN PAYPAL. As a general guideline, if a buyer wants to use Paypal G&S rather than F&F with an **established GAFS member**, it is expected that they will absorb the +3% fee for the increased protections that it provides them. [Here is a easy fee calculator](https://thefeecalculator.com/). If a seller specifies a F&F price, assume that is his ""to his pocket"" cost. However these terms are up for negotiation between the buyer and seller. It is recommended to pay via G&S and absorb the fee. If the seller mandates F&F, be wary of a scam and use a [Scam prevention method](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy).  Additionally, Paypal has deleted the account of several members due to using F&F for purchases.  Paypal considers this theft from them (you're stealing their fees), and a violation of their [ToS](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full). DO NOT put notes in F&F payments as it is evidence you may be violating PP ToS.

The ally was the Vistani child and I have a group that is all martials. No full caster and with the way I run games they have custom weapons. I really liked the idea of making my roll work. I enjoy that aspect as a DM I suppose, the creativity in making the world your own. 

So I had an interesting challenge of getting them the Tome early! But as luck would have it, I was losing a player to military commitment and decided to send them there super early and have the players fuck up and lose someone. And fuck up they did. So in the trial by combat to end a player, I nudged the player to grab the tome and throw it to their somberly leaving allies out the big broken window. Was a super climactic encounter considering the Wyrms just handed them their asses.

The child is at the lake and my players have been in Vallaki for 2 days. All is going to plan and they love Holtz lmao. I also convinced a player outside of the game to ally with Strahd making it sound like it would benefit him lolol he liked the challenge in the idea and decided to give it a shot the little rogue edgelord. That aside letting my nephew play the ally in a big lake encounter so he gets a taste for DND. The ally then leaves to do things to help the pcs goals and comes back when it's opportune. 

I will let you know how the others play out when we get there. If anyone shows curiosity. I'm not super worried about the Sunsword as I have other plans for that. Possibly even involving Sergei.

Your [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/13x2jay/my_22m_girlfriend_22f_looks_cute_irl_but_looks/) was removed for the following reason(s):

&nbsp;

> **It appears to ask for moral judgment or judgment on your actions.**

&nbsp;

Per our [moral judgment rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ivahe5/meta_autoremoving_moral_judgment_threads_also/), any requests for moral judgment (generally any yes/no questions) will result in the removal of your post even if you ask for specific advice as well.

&nbsp;

Your post is a moral judgement if it contains any of the following:

* Is it normal?

* Is it right/wrong?

* Am I right/wrong?

* Any variation of ‚ÄúAm I The Asshole?‚Äù, including AITA

* Who is morally good here?

* Does anybody else...?

* Should I have done this‚Ä¶?

* Am I justified‚Ä¶?

* Would I be right to do...?

* Am I overreacting?

* Is this a big deal?

* Is this reasonable?

&nbsp;

Please remove any questions that ask for judgment of a situation and instead request specific advice that could not possibly result in a yes/no answer. Any variation of ""Am I The Asshole?"", including AITA, also falls under this rule.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I think it comes down to talent pool and culture. KR/LCK more so than LPL (because they have more teams in their top tier league, 17 in LPL to 10 in LCK) has so much talent looking to play pro they can't fit all their players so many of their players go to different regions, a lot of top minor region teams have KR players, in fact most of them do, as well as of course coming to NA and EU, they also have a great pipeline of veteran players to coaching staff that doesn't happen in the west as often. For this reason, if we're using a soccer analogy, their CL looks more like national team youth set-ups like U-16 teams, all young players developing together to see who has potential to make it to the tier 1, 17 LCK CL players were promoted vs. 18 Academy players in NA in 2021 spring, so the narrative is skewed somewhat. Similarly a lot of KR players are signed or committed to an org when they're as early as 13 years old. Which is better? I think they're both important, but a healthy tier 2 is much better suited for NA which already has a talent pool issue. If you're asking why do they not need mentorship, I would guess its because they have hands and learn more advanced concepts of macro through superior solo Q in KR which some high level games can be compared to scrim quality in NA. They're also, if you look at young players like Berserker, not exactly god like in terms of macro understanding, Zven is often saying he has to be Berserker's brain, so that mentorship is still needed, and Berserker was a top prospect with T1, nipping at Gumayusi's heels. This is also maybe stop-gapped by better coaching in KR, but I don't think their tier 2 is perfect and could maybe even use a more mixed system with more veterans involved. LDL actually does have some 22 and 21 year olds, Xing, Keaiduo, and Garvey for example, which isn't far from the ""veterans"" Zeyzal and Fakegod, who are both 23.",1685577724.0

I‚Äôm 155 now, started from 195, and the lowest I‚Äôve been in a long time was 145 (aged 17-20). 

I want to make it to 135, But I can‚Äôt shake this feeling of disbelief that I‚Äôll ever get there. 

From ages 20-24ish I was 155, struggling to get back to 145, or maybe the dreamed 135. But I never could. Now, I didn‚Äôt know about CICO back then. Eventually I got so burned out from over exercising (while overeating) and not seeing any progress, and I stopped trying. From age 24-27 I ballooned up to 195.

Now I‚Äôm 27,  and I‚Äôm back to 155, and I just feel like I‚Äôm doomed. Somewhere deep down I know that rationally, I CAN do this. I‚Äôm taking all the steps. I understand the processes now. I have a plan, goals, and steps to achieve it. 

Yet I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôll never see the 140s again. Why is my brain deciding I‚Äôm defeated?",1685577725.0

Do you think Mitch McConnell or Kevin McCarthy are going to stand for a major increase in IRS funding come September funding package time?


>But clawing back appropriations that are due to be spent 8-10 years from now is meaningless.

Weak enemies have more actions, true, but lower odds of hitting, and lower damage when they do hit. Concentration spells are the main disadvantage they actually bring to the fight. 

Waves of enemies come in, well, waves... They don't tip the action economy because they come after other waves die. 

I've done a fair amount of DMing for people who are inconsistent with their damage output and playstyle, and waves work great. 

Basic etiquette doesn't dictate matching the efficiency of your teammates, nor does it demand the use of your own resources on others in battle. Even putting yourself in danger of death to pick up a fallen teammate is outside of basic etiquette.

Basic etiquette is playing a character who wants to adventure and taking your turns in a reasonable amount of time.",1685577728.0

"niceguys","t5_2rvxp","My high school was a very high-achieving high school that literally did not give a shit about what we did as long as we excelled at *everything*, except the focus was on everything but athletics. We had a state champion thespian troupe (that I was in), two out of four debate team members were nationally ranked (that I was the captain of), our model UN was in the North American invitationals (I was Brazil).  We were ALL nerds- my dad (accurately) describes my school as ‚Äúthe place they send all the kids who would get shoved into trash cans at real schools). There were only 102 of us, and there wasn‚Äôt really the traditional cliques‚Ä¶ like, the captain of the soccer team was the other nationally ranked debater, the forward of our basketball team was the lead in the musical our thespian troupe sent to state‚Ä¶ so we were *all* doing drugs and dumb shit. Together. As a unit. (Our math teacher let us put up a scoreboard for ‚Äòseniors v. juniors‚Äô ‚Äúpep points,‚Äù but actually it was a long-running beer pong tournament where we would take boats out to a little uninhabited island and play beer pong by the  light of the tiki torches we lit. Even I- who had literally been declared by one of my classmates ‚Äúthe queen of the nerds‚Äù literally had a pass to carry around a bottle of Vicodin‚Ä¶ and I used it *liberally*.

Moshe has no special desire to be the ancestor of a great nation- he wants to be a good leader to the current one- so he took that message as a code to start pleading for clemency for the nation. (It's also a lesson in leadership about sticking up for your team even when failing).",1685577730.0

"internetparents","t5_31jj6","I've had a similar type of anxiety and here are some things that help.
- therapy. Find someone you like and schedule out appointments during the time while your parents will be away. Sounds like yours might not be the best fit. You can look online for a therapist, or find one through your insurance (in the US, most have online searches or you can just call the number on your card).
- with the therapy, work on lowering your baseline anxiety. Exercise, Meditate, get the right medications / supplements / food / sleep balance to feel as best as you can.
- distract yourself. Fill up your time and your days deliberately and ahead of time so you don't find yourself sitting around worrying. Sign up for a community Ed class, make plans with friends or family. Start a garden or a hobby.
- careful with this one, it might be best to work through with a therapist, but let yourself explore the worst case scenario briefly and identify some solutions. If your parent gets worse while abroad, they could change their plans and fly home. Or they could find care where they're traveling and you could come to them. Knowing that the thing you're afraid of can have solutions could help.

Also know that this gets easier as time goes on. Good luck!",1685577732.0

"shittytattoos","t5_2tbk2","I don't like the word woke being thrown around at every perceived social grievance, as has become a trend lately. Any use of it that isn't blatantly ironic rubs me the wrong way typically. Like if someone is banning books like a piece of shit authoritarian, and you mention said behavior is shitty, the (American) right will foam at that mouth and call that WoKe, and it's not, it's scary and shitty and authoritarian, youre not woke for saying so, youre normal. So it just gets tossed around for everything. I have a very similar grievance with internet leftists like our buddy here calling every remotely right leaning behavior fascist or Nazi, or telling someone with an Odin tattoo they are, or if someone mentions having touched a firearm before, ect. That's all. I wasn't trying to shit on your choice of words though, just trying to reach that seemingly 14 year old reactionary on their level to calm them down. Cause ya, they looked fucking dumb with that shit; but I too, hate Nazis, and we need to learn to recognize the actual Nazis from the guys who like vikings (and have bad tattoo artists lol). 

I saw another comment in another tattoo sub where people were saying a bind rune was a white supremacist symbol and I had to jump in on that too. People think cause Hitler used a rune or two all Norse and Celtic stuff is a red flag, and I for one, as an antifascist, am not going to let that fuckhead ruin an entire culture that predates freakin Jesus. These things have nuance and require context, and that sort of critical thinking is severely lacking in modern society if I can throw out my opinion. Sorry to rant, that kid should learn to take their lumps and have a discussion rather than coming back with that juvenile ""no you"" bullshit.

Russia made that case. When Ukraine formally revoked the Minsk Accords Russia recognized the LPR and DPR statelets as countries. Ukraine and the west **lied for years** about Minsk in order to rearm Ukraine and attack militarily. Russia then acted on a ""pre-emptive war"" basis, launching their ""special military operation"" to prevent the LPR and DPR from being overrun by Ukraine and NATO.

That's certainly more ""moral"" and fact-based than the US war-of-lies-and-propaganda attack on Iraq!

> The fact that Putin didn't exhaust all diplomatic avenues

Russia proposed a treaty with the US. But our ""diplomacy is back"" president Biden rejected Russia's position before diplomats even met.

Russia talking with Ukraine would be useless. The aggressor here is the US, not Ukraine. It's the US that has funded Ukraine's Nazis *ever since WWII* and which is using Ukraine as a pawn, first installing a puppet gov't in a US-funded coup overthrowing an elected gov't, and then using Ukraine as a proxy to wage war on Russia.",1685577732.0

They are emotionally and verbally abusing you already, they will treat you even worse after marriage. And if they're anything like the first hand experince I have your dear MIL and GIL will threaten you about taking your child away at the slightest hint of you not parenting how they want (though it seems like they already have).
Do yourself a favor and cut them off, and if after a lengthy conversation your boyfriend can't understand how abusive they have been to you, cut him off too. You and your baby deserve better than consistent emotional abuse.",1685577733.0

While uncapped my computer would try to run at absolute maximum to render 4x the frames, which means if there's a sudden spike in activity there is no extra power left to take the brunt of it. Sure it makes alt-tabbing take a second or 2 but I don't know why I'd be alt-tabbing enough for that to be meaningful, especially when this game is actually changing from fullscreen and it takes longer to change that than it does to change framerate.

And no, because what you're saying makes zero sense.

Matsson has NOTHING to do with that.

Have you been paying any attention? Shiv's behaviour also made total sense ‚Äì she has played both sides of every situation for the entire run. People are only pissed off now because it involved killing their favourite boy Kendall.

"thelongdark","t5_2ygr3","Last I had heard the rough ETA was late 2023/early 2024 on episode 5, they said that sometime around the Episode 4 release I believe, so I‚Äôm not sure why anyone would be shocked if it wasn‚Äôt this year? After how long Episode 4 took (and how rich with content it was) how could anyone have expected another full episode that is BOUND to be the biggest one of all to be out faster than ALL of the others? 

Each episode (besides 2 which launched with 1) has taken about 25 months. We‚Äôve got 5/6 months before we should even begin to expect it. I‚Äôve never understood  all the doom and gloom about Wintermute. Hinterland didn‚Äôt come this far just to say ‚Äúnah, we‚Äôre actually not gonna wrap up the story that was the initially intended entire scope of the game after all.‚Äù Might it be late? Sure. But that‚Äôs nothing new to the gaming industry, or indie titles, or Hinterland. 

And the only thing not ‚Äúaccording to plan‚Äù with the DLC so far is the updates coming out a bit behind in the schedule they had initially set out. Everything else ‚Äúoff plan‚Äù was imagined by people who didn‚Äôt see/read the roadmap and dev diaries about Tales and assumed everything would be released at once.

I've got a feeling when and if it finally goes to trial, they're gonna reveal the evidence we haven't seen yet, and I think will be open/shut case. With state and feds helping in the beginning, and from the very first press conference after the arrest, they answered numerous times that they were 100% sure they have the guy. Just my hunch tho. And I would never want to see a innocent person found guilty, but if you just step back and look and just what we do know, it doesn't look good for the guy. I've followed true crime for a while now, and no, not media companies making documentaries or reporters just wanting to have the latest break.

Since this employee entrusted you with such information, you might ask them how they feel about transitioning out of the role and enjoying their remaining time.

When your sexual attraction is tied to a very specific body feature needing to be a specific way, you're in fetish and objectification territory. You may still value them as a human being and not see them as JUST an object, but your sexual attraction to them is shallow and there are deeper underlying reasons why someone may be that way. Typically people that are at that point are objectifying themselves and it's being projected on their partners. The more I see myself as whole and beautiful for things beyond my appearance, the more I am able to perceive that in others.

I have a similar background (parents are very religious, and I'm the first in the family to be raised in the West - that too in a very liberal area). It sounds like much of the enmity between you and your parents revolves around a stark political divide that you're potentially amplifying. Since you seem to have had a shift in political perspective, don't you think you're projecting here? That you're creating this artificial divide between you and them as a kind of internal pushback against the ideals they indoctrinated you into? 

I would encourage you not to take these few trivial quarrels between you and them to heart. My parents disagree with some of my life choices, but that doesn't mean you both can't maintain a strong relationship. You mention that you feel like your parents don't respect you as an adult - talk to them about it. And if that doesn't work, you need to compromise on having that external approval if you want to maintain a relationship (and a paternal relationship is one worth cultivating). I'd also try to challenge the assumptions you've cast upon your parents. It seems like you're falling into a trap where you're extrapolating their political views into insights on their morality (they believe in things so differently than I, and thus must not be moral/intelligent/good human beings worth having a relationship with).",1685577737.0

Also, alocasias don't like a lot of extra space around their roots. That pot may even be too big, depending on how extensive/ healthy the root system is! 

If you want, you can take it out of the pot and give the roots a peek. If the root system is small, I'd go down a pot size, and if it's not, you can put it back in this pot (or one the same size). You can also replace the soil mix if it isn't draining well.

Some folks like to let a plant acclimate to their home first, but I like to check the roots right away, especially if it's from a big box store. I'm not really sure which way is better, or which plant experts recommend",1685577738.0

# Sexting Sessions:

Sexting sessions will be performed on Kik, Telegram or my Free Snapchat! Video Heavy sessions will be extra!

To see what perks come with a Snapchat Premium purchase, please check out that section of my services! All sexting sessions are 20 minutes in length and $1 per minute. If you would like a fetish implemented into the session, they are $2 per minute! üíú If you believe you will need more/less time than the initial 20 minutes, please let me know! We can work out a deal. ;) This is the closest service I offer to a Live Video Session, as I do not offer them.

# Disclaimers:

* I assume you have read my disclaimer before contacting me.
* All services are done online. I do not meetup.
* I do **\*NOT\*** deliver the content or start sessions before the payment is completed.
* Often, I will not respond if you don't state: What service you'd like to¬†purchase and your payment method in the first message. (details can be ironed out after!)
* Custom Pictures and Videos are done within a 48 hour time frame. I have a four year old, so it gets a bit hectic sometimes! More times than not, customs are done in only an hour or two!
* If for some reason you purchase a Girlfriend Experience or a Snapchat Session and have to bail out before hand, I am pretty lenient on rescheduling a session / experience. Only if it is VERY early on in the session or before!
* If¬† you get rude, start to push boundaries or urge me to perform in a way we have not discussed prior to the session during the session, I will¬†stop the service without issuing a refund.",1685577739.0

In terms of constellations, she isn't a unit that requires cons to perform well, like how C3 is a massive boost for Raiden or C1 a QOL for Hu Tao. Yoimiya feels pretty complete out of the gate, although if you really wanna go cons route, C2 is a perfect stopping point for f2p/low spenders.

You are also correct that the engines have gotten better and the trucks have gotten safer (for the people in the truck). 

I would counter that the increase in size is well beyond what is needed for the new safety features and the increase in danger to whatever the truck hits fully offsets (if not more than offsets) the increased safety of truck occupants.

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","I tend to read and log a bunch of stuff, then rearrange my card at least a dozen times before I finish my last few books.  Right now, I have read or am really looking forward to the following:

[Second Spear](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49929085-second-spear).  This is a sequel and also a Title with a Title.  The first book ([The Border Keeper](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42403547-the-border-keeper)) was a little confusing for me at first but it wasn't a difficult read and it was also very enjoyable.  The Border Keeper would also qualify for Title with a Title.

&#x200B;

[Into the Broken Lands](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59590403-into-the-broken-lands).  This one I've got marked for Queernorm, though I'm a little iffy on that.  This book dragged me through it even though one of the POV characters drove me crazy.  I actually carried my Kindle with me for several days just because I wanted so badly to know what was going to happen.  

&#x200B;

[Minor Mage](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56043372-minor-mage).  I've got this one down for Title with a Title, YA, Self Pub, and Novella.  I'm a huge fan of T. Kingfisher anyway, but her YA titles are great for anyone who wants something light and doesn't want any romance.

&#x200B;

[An Unnatural Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247432-an-unnatural-life).  This one is checked Mundane Jobs, Novella, and Featuring Robots.  I got this book in a set of three when tor was doing the book club and I picked it up blind recently on a whim.  The mix of robots and creating legal precedence was fascinating.

&#x200B;

[Lost in the Moment and Found](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60093869-lost-in-the-moment-and-found).  This is checked for Young Adult, Published in 2023, Multiverse, Novella, and Sequel.  DO NOT READ THIS ONE FIRST.  I have loved almost every Wayward Children book.  They're short and very interesting.  If you want to start them though, you really need to go with [Every Heart a Doorway](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25526296-every-heart-a-doorway) which hits YA, Multiverse, and Novella.  Some of the other books in the series qualify for other squares, but you really do need to read the first one first.  I highly recommend the whole series.

&#x200B;

[The Tombs of Atuan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17214743-the-tombs-of-atuan).  Another sequel, this one also hits YA.  I don't think you really need to read [A Wizard of Earthsea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13642.A_Wizard_of_Earthsea) first as Tombs is pretty standalone, but I'd recommend Wizard anyway because it's great.  Wizard also hits Costal/Island setting and I think Elemental Magic and/or Mythical Beasts but it's been awhile since I read that one.

&#x200B;

[The Jasmine Throne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55034066-the-jasmine-throne) is YA, Self Pub, and Set in the Middle East.  I'm partway through the audiobook and enjoying it quite a bit so far.

&#x200B;

[Inkspice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48565792-inkspice) is a sequel that is high on my list for ""Bottom of the TBR"" because I've been dragging through it for a LONG time.  The first book is called [Windswept](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41373578-windswept) and it was absolutely fantastic. I don't know why I'm dragging through the second book because I really enjoy it while I'm reading it but I just keep setting it back down.  Both books would probably also qualify as YA.

&#x200B;

[The Gilded Ones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53028775-the-gilded-ones) I have barely scratched the surface of so I have no judgement yet.

&#x200B;

[The Girl in the Tower](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34731459-the-girl-in-the-tower) is another sequel that's in the running for Bottom of the TBR because the first book ([The Bear and the Nightingale](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489134-the-bear-and-the-nightingale)) fascinated me but the second book is taking me forever.

Basically, don‚Äôt overdo it on the conditioner; your hair looks like it‚Äôs fine like mine. Squish the conditioner into your hair in the shower, rinse it out by squishing.

"tiedye","t5_2tlqa","You may be able to get sharper stripes by using thickened dye and some type of [resist](https://www.dharmatrading.com/resists/resists-from-dharma-trading-co.html) however there will still be some risk of dye bleeding just because of the way the dye interacts with the fibers. Various types of resists include washable glues, wax, and various other chemicals. Which option works best can vary depending on the project. If you go with a glue make sure to get a glue that can be washed out of the fabric instead of a fabric glue that is safe to wash. Washable fabric glue is typically glue that is safe to wash which means it **won't** come out when you wash the fabric. 

Striped fabric is generally made by dyeing the threads before weaving/knitting the fabric and switching colors at the appropriate spots while making the fabric. That is how it has such sharp edges. Some companies may print the stripes to save costs but if you look closely there will often be some feathering at the edges of the stripes when it's printed.",1685577741.0

* Death penalty for the offence of ""aggravated homosexuality"" - which includes transmitting terminal illnesses like HIV/AIDS through gay sex and having same-sex relations with a person with a disability.

* Life imprisonment for certain offences involving same-sex intercourse, 20-year sentence for ""promotion of homosexuality"" and up to 10 years for attempting to commit same-sex acts.

* Prohibits any form of sexual relations between persons of the same sex and the promotion or recognition of sexual relations between persons of the same sex.

* Bans same-sex marriages.

* A child convicted of an offence involving same-sex relations can be imprisoned for a period not exceeding three years.

* Any legal entities such as media and non-governmental organisations that ""knowingly"" promote homosexuality will incur a fine and a potential suspension.

* False or misleading allegations of homosexuality to carry a sentence of one year in prison.

Archbishop Stephen Kaziimba's only criticism is that his church is against the death penalty, thus ""aggravated homosexulaity"" is '[recommended to be life imprisonment](https://churchofuganda.org/blog/2023/05/29/church-of-uganda-grateful-for-anti-homosexuality-act-2023/)' instead. 

Because that's something the Anglican Church of Uganda can agree with.

I don't want to look like I'm generalizing that jurisdiction. But I'm not sure I could look at Archbishop Kaziimba in the eye and call him a brother, if he feels that this is what he, as an Archbishop and leader of his province, feels is the Christian thing to do.",1685577741.0

Mine definitely still needs some setup work.  I adjusted the truss rod but the action still needs to come down.  I don‚Äôt feel confident enough to mess with that bridge, so I‚Äôll probably have a pro do that.

I put LaBella flats on mine.  I play flats on all my basses but hasn‚Äôt tried LaBella before.  I‚Äôm pretty happy, but interested to see how it all sounds after the strings settle in and bridge gets adjusted.

AI software emulates our brains because we use what we know to model our designs.

Just because the AI we have designed doesn‚Äôt fit our definition of consciousness doesn‚Äôt mean that we understand all types of beings and can claim we are unique. Call me when you have cataloged and understood all life on this planet and others. 

We used to say women were dumber because of brain size. We make a lot of hilarious ‚Äúrules‚Äù around what makes something valid‚Ä¶and then we change them when we learn more or someone proves our theory wrong. How‚Äôs that flat earth at the center of the universe treating you?

I think a lot of it has to do with people being thirsty over Ozzy route, and that he seems to not be as into Grace as Noah was about Hope. But Grace has been really sweet and lovely imo, and ofc she's gonna have her feelings if she's into Ozzy.

"CharruaDevs","t5_4ada72","Depende mucho de que tan importante son esos datos, firestore (que dios me perdone) es ideal para cosas que reci√©n arrancas y la capa gratis es bastante buena, ahora no es bueno si tenes mucha concurrencia o queres mantener cierto esquema/migraciones/control sobre los datos. Lo bueno de firebase adem√°s es que podes ir directo de js cosa que comparte con su primo mongodb. La verdad yo bases de datos como mongo/firebase no me gustan tanto capaz que es donde cai, pero las migraciones y otras cosas que est√°n re resueltas en el mundo SQL no eran tan triviales. Tambi√©n tenes algo que esta buenisimo que es la posibilidad de hacer live refreshes sobre la data. La unica contra para mi es que con el tiempo del proyecto se degrada porque la gente no es ordenada y al final quedan a veces datos que no levantan en la app porque nadie los actualizo como se necestaba en su momento. MongoDB es muy superior a Firebase, pero no se si tiene capa gratis.

Lo bueno de firebase adem√°s es que tiene ya un paquete de autenticacion que medio te hace el Oauth solo, que si bien no es el mejor sistema de autenticacion del mundo funciona para la gran mayor√≠a de los proyectos (que podes usar independiente de la base de datos que prefieras). Si te digo, las funcions (parte serverless de firebase) no funcionan bien, el cold start era punitivo (tipo la primera vez que se ejecutaba demoraba segundos), despues en caliente todo bien, pero si se enfria devuelta lo mismo.

Despues si queres algo un poco m√°s serio, yo recomiendo Gcp (creo que es un poco mas barato que aws, y menos confuso en AWS siempre tenes 3 opciones para hacer ""lo mismo"") y el cloud sql esta muy bien armado, con alguna base de datos SQL (esto es porque a mi por lo menos me hicieron convertirme a esa religion)), y despues te podes hacer un backend en un lenguaje de tu preferencia (yo prefiero lenguajes tipados, pero al ser freelance lo que te sientas mas comodo y vayas mas rapido), y gcp tiene CloudRun/CloudBuild que a partir de una configuracion de docker si mal no recuerdo te anda de 10. Porque queres algo de ese estilo, porque es un embole configurar un servidor virtual/ec2/compute instance, docker es pones lo que queres en la vm y queda ah√≠ estatico, anda muy bien la verdad y es gratis o cerca de lo gratis. No lo prob√© con lenguajes como java, pero con node a mi por lo menos me anduvo re bien.

Sino podes ir por instancias, que tambien si no tenes mucho requerimiento podes caer en el free tier. Si no te recomiendo mucho los hosting compartidos, yo por lo menos no tuve buena experiencia (fue hace a√±ares) pero imaginate que no podes instalar nada, y tocar cosas minimas lo cual te hace ir mas lento.",1685577742.0

Most offsites like conferences, or team-building, have team dinners or cocktail hours, or some other evening entertainment meant for the team.... but business trips where I'm going to meet a client are usually solo evenings.

(Anger, by the way, is the worst feeling to carry when you're so sensible.) I figured you'd be super tired very often, cause it demands A LOT of energy from you. I understand and validate your anxiety, really do. My suggestion is try not to fight it. Let it come and let it pass, don't hold it, you know? I say try, because it isn't easy.

Most small hospital have CT and have the appropriate capabilities to be labeled as a ‚ÄúPrimary Stroke Center‚Äù, which means they can identify at least hemorrhagic vs ischemic and if ischemic start antifibrinolytic medications such as TNK or TPA.

The general public has no idea what delays can be encountered by going to the wrong hospital due to red tape and regulations that can simply be avoided by waiting a few minutes for a paramedic to get there.


Here‚Äôs a tale of two patients. My area is super rural. We have one critical access hospital that is about 15 minutes away from this patient, the closest cardiac cath lab is 65 miles away. This patient has a heart attack. They call 911. They hear that the ambulance is 10 minutes away, and figure, fuck that I can be at the hospital in 15.

Patient 1 has somebody drive them to the closer hospital. It then takes 10 more minutes to get them checked in, get an IV started, and get an EKG. Yep, no shit heart attack. The patient gets some nitro, and the nurses start working in a heparin drip, and the patient *finally* gets some relief. Now that hospital is required *BY LAW* to call ahead to another hospital with the cardiac cath lab. The cardiologist is paged and in the phone within another 5 minutes. The consult progresses and the cardiologist wants the EKG faxed over for review.  Assuming that is *instant* (which it is not), the cardiologist accepts that patient. Now the house supervisor has to get involved to make sure that there is a bed available to put that patient into. A few more minutes there. Meanwhile, they‚Äôre paging another ambulance to pick up this patient who has to make sure that they have coverage and respond‚Ä¶ 10-20 minute delay again. Then the patient is transported to the appropriate hospital.

***AND THATS ASSUMING EVERYTHING GOES PERFECTLY***

Patient 2 instead waits for a paramedic ambulance. Immediately upon arrival the 12 lead is performed. Takes a few minutes to set up. Yep, no shit heart attack. Paramedic starts an IV, transmits the 12 lead to the receiving hospital. Medications are initiated immediately, and transport is started to the cath lab, *bypassing* that closer hospital immediately. No calling to check for beds, no consults, no checking in before care, no red tape, just go. 

The hospital has *zero* chance of saying no we won‚Äôt take that patient.  EMTALA doesn‚Äôt apply to EMS. Scream and whine that you‚Äôre on diversion all you want‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm still bringing this patient to whatever hospital I deem as the most appropriate.

Patient 2 saved a significant amount of time by *waiting* for that ambulance.",1685577745.0

This isn‚Äôt new in the industry, after all a lot of things get rebranded and repackaged under a different name. I‚Äôm saying this in a general sense and not specifically anyone. 

It‚Äôs a rabbit hole and a lot to unpack but a good bit of it is sleuthing. Safelife admitted their IIIA+ is made in China made with non-US materials. They also admitted via Facebook comment reply that their FRAS is made in Germany, of course that‚Äôs lost to time since Facebook is a poor platform to look up old comments.

Just a all around good taste and size to me. I'll double them up on a single club cracker with some Louisiana sauce or avocado. All this is just my opinion on things.

"law","t5_2qh9k","You're correct that the guidance does not quite amount to a ""rule"", as most people would understand it, but this action certainly breaks the *spirit* of the assurances and promises the Roberts and SCOTUS have made to Congress and to the public in recent weeks. 

> Speaking at the American Law Institute's annual dinner Tuesday evening where he accepted an award, Roberts said that he is ""committed to making certain that we as a court adhere to the highest standards of conduct.""

Obviously, if SCOTUS is not following ethical rules that bind lower courts, it's impossible to claim they are adhering to the ""highest"" ethical standards. 

Roberts also, in a bid to head off talk of having ethical standards imposed by Congress, sent Congress a letter and statement:

> Without addressing Durbin‚Äôs specific concerns over ethics Roberts simply attached a ‚ÄúStatement on Ethics Principles and Practices‚Äù to which he said, ‚ÄúAll of the current Members of the Supreme Court subscribe.‚Äù

[PDF of the statement and letter](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20Chairman%20Durbin%2004.25.2023.pdf)

So it would have been more accurate to say that ""It Took Alito Barely A Month to Break the Supreme Court's New Promises About Ethics""

This is a law sub, and it's good to be precise with language about rules vs guidelines, laws vs promises, etc. And you are correct that this is some sloppy journalism. 

Alito's contempt for ethical standards is flagrant. As is the hypocrisy of his and Roberts's sanctimonious lectures to Congress and the American people about their unwavering commitment to embodying their status as robed deities with superhuman wisdom, integrity, and ethics. But you are correct that he didn't actually break a rule that applied to him. He only broke a rule that applies to all the other judges in America, that SCOTUS has chosen to exempt themselves from.",1685577747.0
"buildapc","t5_2rnve","It‚Äôs complicated. But the TLDR version is for gamers, no.

DRAM is important for faster write speeds on slower flash drives. They don‚Äôt affect read speeds which is what is the big concern for gaming. And many higher end drives don‚Äôt have DRAM either, like the Samsung 980. Instead they‚Äôll uses fast SLC flash which is just as fast as DRAM. The problem is for very inexpensive SSDs that use only very slow and cheap flash and no DRAM or SLC cache.

But when it comes to gaming, an old mid range PCIe Gen 3 SSD will work just as well, and in some cases load games faster than recent Gen 4 or Gen 5 drives.",1685577747.0

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","We have public funding in the catholic system because of minority rights.  

What people don't realize is that it hasn't been that long since the public system had a very significant protestant leaning and aspect.  I said the protestant version of the Lord's prayer every day until high school.  And I had a religion class in grade 8 at one board. FWIW I was still in high school when the full funding came in to effect.  

We continue to keep catholic systems because of inertia and because there's a lot of non-catholic families that want to send their kids to a high school with an uniform and what is seen to be stricter discipline.  The two sets of systems (there are four sets of boards generally in any region) compete against each other.  When you have issues like what happened/is happening at York Memorial, the person in Oakville with the prosthetics and other examples, parents vote with their feet.  

I'll add that my kids went through the public system and had a good go of it. The amount of religion by the time you get to high school is pretty much nil.",1685577747.0

"HunterXHunter","t5_2spu5","I've seen several threads about theories, one was posted recently too, but for me Pariston and Beyond orchestrating the entire Chimera Ant arc is simply true. It makes way too much sense for it not to be true.   


Even if it wasn't the two of them, Pariston absolutely knew in advance about the Queen and her location and thus made sure that Netero could get as little help as possible in dealing with the situation, not to mention he intentionally send weak Hunters to face against the Squadron Leaders that were creating havoc across and around the Balsa Islands.   


Pariston clearly had something to gain from the whole crisis, but he expressed remorse because Netero had to die in that mission, and Pariston hates someone he ""cares"" about dying just as much as any other person with morals.   


Despite this, he decided to make a stage play out of the 13th Election and simply make a dash towards the Dark Continent with Beyond's crew. If his goal was to simply remove Netero so he can run the Hunter Association freely without anyone being able to take actions against him, then he wouldn't simply transfer the entire authority to Cheadle.",1685577748

"calculus","t5_2qxm5","For these particular problems I'm mostly thinking algebraic simplification, followed by substitution. (It helps to know some basic hyperbolic trig identities, such as cosh^(2)(x) - sinh^(2)(x) = 1, sinh(x) = (e^(x) - e^(-x))/2, etc.).

(4), cosh(z) - sinh(z) = e^(-z), so we have int[dz] (e^(z) tanh^(2)(e^(z))).
Simple u-sub with u = e^(z) lands you with int[du] (tanh^(2)(u)), which shouldn't be too hard if you use an appropriate identity.

(5), sinh(x) tanh(x) = sinh^(2)(x)/cosh(x) = (cosh^(2)(x) - 1)/cosh(x) = cosh(x) - sech(x). So we have int[dx] (sinh(x) tanh(x)) = sinh(x) - int[dx] (sech(x)), which shouldn't be too bad.

(6), I = int[dx] (sech^(2)(x)/sqrt(1-tanh^(2)(x))), but sqrt(1-tanh^(2)(x)) ~ sech(x), so we can take I = int[dx] (sech(x)). So, if J is the answer to (5), then the answer here is I = sinh(x) - J.

That's just how I would do these -- not sure what the merits to other approaches would be though.",1685577749.0

"anime","t5_2qh22","**Rewatcher.**

For a simingly ""wholesome and gentle"" content this OVA has compared to the movie, important character development still happened.

Minor miscomunications are common even for the healthiest couples. But I'm glad Ritsuka mangaged to control his temper and confront Mafuyu, only to realize he accidentaly triggered Mafuyu's trauma. And everything ended with Mafuyu once again taing the lead. D'aww! *""Give me a break""*

Nice to see Hiiragi giving Mafuyu music-related advice. And something tells me he won't get along with Ritsuka. Or will he? *""Be careful that I don't break your index finger"" ""He's not as stuck up as you, so it's fine""*

And Mafuyu wants to get praised by Ritsuka, but only got a soft critique. God, I love sassy and unhinged Mafuyu. Wish the TV series leaned a bit more on that aspect of him. He may be a traumatized boy, but he's also a gremlin.

Thanks to Yayoi, Ritsuka never fantasied about girls in a sexual way([source from the manga](https://imgur.com/2AQAWAg)). So his sudden urge to do something with Mafuyu comes as a genuine surprise. But things don't go as planned because Mafuyu's trauma is activated once again. Thankfully he gets a strong hug from his boyfriend and it's implied they hugged for a long while. This is the most important scene from the OVA, hands down!

And the group dynamic is back! Sort of. You know what happened in the movie, so it feels like Haruki and Akihiro continue band meetups for the sake of their children bandmates. *""I want everyone to see Mafuyu's possibilities""* Hooray! That's the spirit, Ritsuka!

I also enjoyed how Ritsuka decides to hold Mafuyu's hand while he sings, sensing Mafuyu is still thinking about Yuki. This was both bittersweet and adorable. Ritsuka may be the only guy in the band with no dating experience, but he's clearly a boyfriend material.

I already mentioned my confusion about the rehashed scene yesterday, I still prefer the movie version of it.

And we end the OVA on a cute hand-holding moment D'AWWW!

Well, the only thing to look forward to is Movie 2, which will probably adapt Hiiragi's arc but I honestly wish they'd focus on the two couples. Akihiro and Haruki would especially benefit from showing their scenes happen alongside Mafuyu's and Ritsuka's. And I'd love to see the movie ending with \[Given manga\]>!Mafuyu confessing he wants to make music with Ritsuka for the rest of their lives!<. But that'll probably won't happen.",1685577750.0

"suboxone","t5_2t4ye","With respect, they're absolutely not worse than heroin or fentanyl.

I've been a drug addict most of my life. I've withdrawn cold turkey from suboxone, and ya, it sucked. Definitely wasn't a fun experience. But in no way was it even remotely comparable to when I cold turkeyed from methadone, or from heroin, or fentanyl, or oxycodone, or oxymorphone... 

They're just not on the same level. And that's backed up by hard data which unquestionably demonstrates buprenorphine is a partial agonist on the mu opiate receptor, and antagonist on several others. 

When I came off subs, I was fatigued, runny nose, diarrhea, mild hot/cold flashes, all that. But when I came off methadone, and heroin, and every other full agonist? I genuinely contemplated suicide. It was like being tortured in hellfire. So sick I couldn't even move, couldn't even lift a single arm. I could be drowning in my own slobber and wouldn't have the energy to roll on my side to breathe.

I think people forget just how bad full agonist WD really is, or they become conditioned to believe suboxone is worse than it is due to so many others telling them it is.",1685577750.0

transitional housing programs (ime) are almost always underfunded and the workers are worked to the bone.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","Unless you game is streaming or being played in public, the only people who really need to have an opinion on this are the people at your table. It may also not be something your DM wants to explore or that other people at the table have their own concerns or history with, or even potentially no matter how much sensitivity you may have, they may not share that.

My issue with these kinds of questions is ""how much actual real world research into these specific 'disorders' are you going to do and are your PC stats going to try and accurately reflect the specific mental or physical challenges of a person with that 'disorder' goes through?"". I also don't especially like the use of the word ""disorder"" in this context.

I also get the correlation you're making with the advice given to people who want to play queer characters, however, given that queer people have been viewed as ""mentally ill"" or as having a ""disorder"" for a lot of recent history, it's perhaps not the best analogy you could have made.

Generally speaking, making a character with a real world disability or condition is a double edged sword. Because if you don't do it then you're just leaning into the trope that people like that don't exist in D&D/fantasy stories. And if you do, people are going to either assume you're making light of those same people or parodying them or otherwise being insensitive or problematic. It also leads into a whole raft of pop culture tropes around people with disabilities.

Also, we don't know you. We don't know how you'll handle and approach this character, we don't know what you've done before, how sensitively and respectful you are with your characters. Maybe you'll do a great job and this will be a character that this group remembers fondly for years to come. Maybe you'll make everyone feel slightly uncomfortable for the entire campaign and nobody will every say anything directly, because, again, it's a double edged sword.

But if any member of your group, including the DM, expresses a desire that you NOT do this thing, you shouldn't do this thing.",1685577751.0

"DermatologyQuestions","t5_2ihy50","  
I am going to give you a suggestion. This is an option. You might want to try AcenZyme. This Emulsion is inexpensive and it goes on like warm butter so you don't need to use very much. I think you should seriously consider this approach. I hope this helps.  
I have developed an Emulsion that will go deep into the Dermis, exfoliate the damaged skin cells and Moisturize and rejuvenate the healthy skin cells. It is called AcneZyme. There are no synthetic chemicals, no steroids and no topical anesthetics. It is 100 % natural, plant based Phytochemicals. It goes on like warm butter and spreads easily, so you only need a very small amount. Some on this board might try to dissuade you. This is just an option. It is your choice. There is a science behind how our skin barrier works. I will include this science. I hope this helps. Best to you.  
Here is the science behind the formulation: FACT CHECK: WHY DOES MY SKIN BARRIER ALLOW TOXINS TO ENTER AND CAUSE INFLAMMATION? This brief synopsis is technically challenging and uses complicated terminology, but it explains the Mechanism of Action how our Emulsions will help your skin. 1- PADI stands for Peptidyl Arginine Deiminase. (The Amino Acid Arginine contains a lot of Nitrogen or Ammonia) 2- PADI results in something called Citrullination. 3- Citrullination is the conversion of positively charged Arginine (an Amino Acid with Nitrogen) into neutral Citrulline. 4- Citrulline changes the Binding Specificity of Keratinocytes (Keratin in your skin). This allows the Keratin cells to tightly bind together forming a strong skin barrier. 5- Without Citrulline you will have openings in your skin barrier allowing toxins to get in. Thus, bacteria, viruses, fungus and other toxins get inside your skin creating an inflammatory skin disease. 6- Cytokines also cause inflammatory skin disease because it neutralizes PADI expression in differentiated human Keratinocytes (Keratin skin cells). (More on Cytokines later). 7- In healthy skin cells, PADI enables citrullination of Filaggrin and Keratin, which contribute to skin barrier function. Likewise, L-Histidine and Hyaluronic Acid help produce Filaggrin. We use Hyaluronic Acid in our Emulsions. (Note: Filaggrin is essential to forming a healthy skin barrier) 8- Acefylline is a PADI Activator. It enhances the enzymatic activity of Keratin, Ammonia (Arginine), Vitamin D-3 and STAT (Signal Transducer & Activator of Transcription & Vit D) 9- Vitamin D-3 and Acitretin can activate PADI (This is desirable). 10- Acitretin is a Retinoid (Vitamin A). However, Acetretin can cause hair loss and Liver damage. 11- Acitretin is similar to Accutane, which is often prescribed for Acne. 12- Patchouli Oil is also called Pogostemon Cablin and Guanguoxiang (in China). We use Patchouli Oil in our Emulsions. 13- Patchouli Oil contains a lot of Acefylline (see 8 above). 14- Acefylline is an Adenosine Receptor Antagonist. Think of Adenosine as ATP (our source of energy). So if the Adenosine Receptor is blocked, you cannot bind Adenosine and your energy levels are increased. This is how Caffeine works. Thus, you produce excitatory Neurotransmitters rather than Cortisol. Cortisol would form more Cytokines and destroy your levels of PADI. Without enough PADI,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶you don‚Äôt have enough Keratin‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and your skin barrier is compromised. 15- Without a working skin barrier, you allow bacteria, fungus, viruses and toxic chemicals inside your skin causing a rash or scaly itchy skin.",1685577754.0

It's also likely they'd argue that the officer believed him to have got the officers gun, or that the officer did not have a confirmation of the threat being subsided, and simply reacted based on a reasonable belief.

Those combined I would think that it'd be hard for a prosecution to make a case. Considering a trial would come at the cost of not insignificant public resources, it may not make sense to push for it.

Of course we also have hindsight to know that it was not necessary.

I think an investigation would be in order, because ultimately, any chance, even though small the suspect had to stand trial was definitely removed when he was killed at the end.",1685577754.0

A couple of physical game possibilities might be

\- \*\*Cartographers\*\* is a flip and write game that has a small box and no pieces other than the pad of paper, pen or pencil, and the cards. It has a very small table presence and the only components you flip over are the cards. (There's also a very good app version of it too, if you go with the app thing above.)

\- \*\*Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective\*\* is a set of mystery books and some maps. All that's involved is reading and flipping pages, no loose components and it's pretty much a solo game. (Technically you can play with a group ""and solve the mystery together"" but it's mainly solo.)

\- \*\*That's Pretty Clever\*\* is a fun soloable Yahtzee style roll and write dice game. Just roll the dice in the box top and you should be good I think. 

\- The various \*\*Exit\*\* escape room style puzzle games are small box, portable, and I don't think they tend to have very many components other than the main puzzle book or two in the box. (I've only played a couple though so maybe double check the components?)

\- \*\*Awkward Guests\*\* is a soloable card game with its app similar to Clue where you're trying to solve a murder by gathering clue cards. It has a lot of cards but the box has a divided insert you can use to hold them relatively in place on your tray while you play.",1685577754.0

And that any relatability needs to explained or you‚Äôre similar enough to them and their problems of which makes any judgement on *you* as a person comparable. Hence the ratio I kept mentioning between 1:1 or 1:3. Or fuck it maybe like 1:8 or something. Point is it‚Äôs hard for me not to conclude what you‚Äôre saying is well a comparison of sorts. Like the plot and extremities of these traits are consistent across all things. Real life and The show. 

And even though you‚Äôre not saying it and think I‚Äôm exaggerating, okay cool, then how is it not an embodiment you‚Äôre thinking of when you say that it‚Äôs impossible to relate to these characters without you‚Äôre judgement being of that person as being a red flag of any kind. Forget morals and ethics even just instability. You‚Äôd have to make a direct comparison of a sort with the character which is not what relatability is strictly contained by.

"sandiego","t5_2qq2q","Lots of people benefit from proximity, but taxes don't consider ""proximity"" in regard to who pays who. People in SoCal, all people, not just La Jolla, benefit from the geographic position, for sure, but you are saying that that is considered when they pay their taxes or in regard to their rights to use local government to their benefit. That is not correct. Riverside benefits from being close to L.A. and O.C. counties, but they don't pay them taxes and are separate entities.

This has nothing to do with ""secession"" and I am not a libertarian. This is just that American citizens have the right to use local government to enact self-governance if the larger local government is failing them. I live in a town that voted out it's police department because it did not feel it was serving them. I don't agree with it, but they did it.

The truth is that you are trying to argue that La Jolla somehow owes the rest of San Diego it's tax revenue, even if they removed all the burden they place on SD in exchange. That tax revenue is given to the city to pay for services and infrastructure. If La Jolla pays for all its own infrastructure, which it surely can, they have to responsibility to pay SD...that is if they are able to get this passed.

You are working off the assumption that because La Jolla is near SD, even if it pays all its own bills, it some should be required to continue to pay SD. The problem is that it doesn't sound like La Jolla feels as if it's needs are being met by the larger city and disagree with the political direction it is going in. As a result, La Jolla wants to govern itself, which it has the right and ability to do.

The reference to the failed ""sanctuary city"" laws is well placed. Your argument that La Jolla is some sort of burden on the city, so must be required to remain a part of it and continue to support SD, is exactly how people feel about illegal immigration. The largest difference being is that La Jolla is overwhelmingly comprised of American citizens who contribute huge amounts of money to the community both willing and through taxation.

I get it, you know SD needs La Jolla's tax revenue to continue to implement its failing policies simply because they aren't fiscally sound. La Jolla leaving to govern itself, as is its right, would only quicken the endgame socialist failure of the city policy of ""take from one to give to another"". That doesn't really work though. At the end of the day if La Jolla can pass the vote to form its own city, then that is withing their legal rights to demand. And unfortunately, what you consider ""good for the area"" isn't really relevant, what matters is what La Jolla thinks is good for itself in the local government.

Just saying you ""need their money, so that means they cannot self-govern."" doesn't really fly with the American system.

I really hope they are able to do it. It would be good for La Jolla and in the long run good for SD, as the city will be forced to reign in their spending and take a long hard look at the policies that forced La Jolla to leave.

It really just sound like you have a problem a with freedom and democracy when it doesn't go the way you want it. What do you care if they want to leave, and do so...oh yah...you need their money?",1685577757.0

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","YTA, OP. You had four mouths to announce your marriage to your lovely husband and gush about how amazing the ceremony or honeymoon was to your family and mother. That‚Äôs over a hundred days to share exciting news with relatives without stealing the spotlight!

 Yet you waited until exactly two weeks before your sister‚Äôs wedding to email a sizable portion of the guests about your wonderful elopement. Frankly, I find it hard to believe that your intentions were never to distract from the fact that your sibling was celebrating an important event in less than a month and shift attention to you.

Your sister was reasonably upset at you for ruining her moment during the rehearsal dinner and having a lengthy conversation about your fantastic life updates during a meal that was supposed to be about congratulating the soon to be bride and groom on their marriage! 

I don‚Äôt think that your behavior was mainly to inform close family member and friends regarding your quality of life, but more so a fairly obvious cry for attention.   


If you truly meant no harm and wanted to find a solution, you would have agreed to not wear your wedding band to the ceremony out of respect and sympathy for your sister and given a sincere apology for your actions instead of yet again making it about yourself. 

The best case scenario is that you were oblivious to the affects that your behavior would have on your sister and more focused on your own experiences than hers and made an honest mistake.   


For your sake, I want to believe that this is the case, but I find it highly improbable. I recommend that you try to mend your relationship with your sibling and offer a token of your forgiveness or a meaningful apology admitting your role in compromising her wedding celebration.",1685577757.0

"Thritis","t5_2sc0a","Hey I'm 32M and have had a form of inflammatory arthritis since I was 19. I had to have two hips replaced and one of shoulders is on its way out. Been on a bunch of meds but my current biologic has been pretty successful for the last 6 years or so, but not without flares and pain still. I have felt exactly how you are feeling now and will most definitely feel that way again. I thought I'd never work, never love, never have sex, never have wild experiences, never travel, never have friends, never be able to take care of myself, etc.

Guess what? Ive been in relationships, I graduated with my degree, I have started a career (not one I like but it pays well enough), I have traveled, I have some of the best friends a person can ask for, and I am living out of my house and doing decent enough.

But I have also laid in bed for days in pure agony. I have cried myself to sleep more times than I can count. I have been unable to complete even the simplest task because of how bad my joint inflammation is. I have wished it all ended and that I'd die in my sleep so I wouldn't have to keep suffering.

Ngl it's terrifying thinking of the future even still. Even though it's fairly controlled atm I feel like my current meds are slowly losing effect. My rheumatologist says we might have to start considering switching to a new medication so I have that impending stress looming over me.

All that to say is, in moments when the future looked bleak, I pushed on and have still found times to enjoy life even with this shit condition. Sure I know the future holds God knows what when it comes to my health, but I'm also optimistic that there are more good moments up ahead. Sure this condition makes my life cruelly more difficult but I am glad I have persisted, even when I thought I didn't have any persistence left in me.

I hope you find medication that works long term and are able to experience everything you want and more. All the best!",1685577757.0

"mypartneristrans","t5_2t187","It has been a huge challenge to talk about anything that might be taken as negative about his transition. He just says sorry and shuts down. This will sound more negative and blunt than it actually is, but this is his number one focus, and everything else is on the back burner now. 

Our therapist recommended the acronym DEAR MAN to help set up discussions. By using it, you can write down your thoughts ahead of time.
DESCRIBE (the facts of the situation), EXPRESS (your feelings), ASSERT (a specific ask related to the facts and your feelings), REINFORCE (why they should say yes), MINDFULLY (ask only for what can be given and only one thing at a time), ASSERTIVELY (use eye contact and stay on topic), NEGOTIATE. 

I've tried it with mixed but more positive than negative results on other issues, but never any luck with anything related to his transition.

IMO, which I realize is not worth much, there were two issues.  One was the poor pilot training of the era (the B-26 being another example of that).  The other was the heavy 8th Airforce bias in the history/reporting from the war.  The second comes, I think, from the Bomber Mafia being based in England. 

The P-38 was the only fighter in production at both the start and the end of the war.  And at the end of the war a second production facility was being spun up, so clearly it was held in high regard at the time.",1685577758.0

Can someone explain to me why anyone would care what another religion they don't believe in does? I mean, I almost get it, don't do that for my family, but ... you don't believe in what they're doing anyway, so ultimately who cares? Seems like suing is a lot of work over something like that.

I dunno, I've been mormon since I was 6 or something. I have been less active for the past 20 years, more or less, and I think I still believe, most of the time ...

"quake","t5_2qzfl","you are flippant here, but maybe not intentionally. I've completed this level, and can provide you a demo with all my ""fuck this fucking level"" in the meantime as a voiceover, but that would change nothing, since you're missing the most obvious point here.

""You just need to know where they are"" implies memorizing the level. That's exactly opposite of both ""fun"", ""entertaining"" and ""good level design"". A good level will be fun on the first time, even with no memory of it, and can be easily-ish completed by an experienced player without having to learn it like Bible. It might be tough, but it will still be fun, and it won't be tedious. Memorizing enemy locations just to be able to have smooth sailing is basically a definition of level design done wrong.

What you wrote before (""It may be that my observations are sort of relative"") sums it up very well - there's basically nothing you can tell about a game if you actually ""play this game on a continuous loop where I run through all four episodes on nightmare about once a week. A long time ago, I was probably doing it once a day. I've been doing this for a very long time.""... To be able to do that kind of statements at least semi-objectively, you'd have to play thousands of games, and not a single game a thousand times. Otherwise you're only proving you are an expert in a game, and not that the game itself (or a part of it) is good.",1685577761.0

Yes it would sound like a support for ""carbon tax"", but it can easily be interpreted differently if need be. By merely putting out a resolution they could have demonstrated that O'Toole, who had also proposed some sort of cartoon pricing at the same, did have some significant backing from the conservatives. They couldn't do that. You can't expect O'Toole to swing votes when his own party was reluctant to stand behind him.

And yes I know O'Toole didn't champion it. And of course he said it was a distraction. What else was he supposed to say? ""Yea it's too bad my party didn't support my stance but please vote for us anyway""?",1685577761.0

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

---

Related to collapse because it's a long-form interview with astrophysicist T.W. Murphy that talks about fundamental aspects of sustainability and civilization's breach of planetary limits, and how this will inevitably lead to civilizational collapse. And also how 'Green New Deal' or 'Have your cake and eat it too' thinking will not save us.

>My original point and the research still stands. Energy in - energy out is what gets stored as fat. If you want to lose weight, then it has to be negative.

Have I claimed anything to the contrary?


>Also, 300 calories is just 2 chocolate chip cookies or a iced mocha from Starbucks. It is very easy to add on excess calories that requires hours of exercise to get rid of it.

An iced mocha and cookies is a pretty awful food choice. If you think that's a suitable diet snack it shows how little you know.

I'm gonna completely disagree with this. Lots of fiction mirrors shit in the real world, not because we like it, but because it's shit that gives us anxiety and changing the setting can make it easier to look at in broader terms disassociated from any personal emotional baggage you have with it.

"blackstonegriddle","t5_3i530","You don't want the surface to get too cold or not at all before you are ready to clean.

If so...warm up the grill to standing heat - not cooking heat and start the process with an abrasive mesh screen for this purpose.

While you do it place the the wet hand towel over the mesh and use your body weight to clean in broad strokes up and down. Use a fair amount of water whilst doing so.

note the heat should be hot enough to steam the water.

Don't know the build quality on that unit, but hopefully it can take a bit of your upper body weight...

People buy these things not expecting the work for upkeep. Looks like you let it blacken too much.

If you want to see how a griddle should really look like don't go to Denny's...go to your local Hibachi or Benny Hanna...Watch how the hibachi chefs clean their table if you get lucky.",1685577763.0

The semi hollow body has wonderful sustain and sounds very, very pretty when playing slower, soulful songs. I mean it really sounds great with songs by the Eagles, CCR, or even jazzy type selections. But the humbuckers they paired up for the guitar can certainly wail if you push a bit of gain into them and roll up the volume. Pinch harmonics are a snap with this thing, so it gives you the best of both worlds. Slow and sexy plus vicious rock and roll. I‚Äôm enjoying getting used to it.  The only advice I would give anyone is to get a strap ASAP because the lacquer job on this guitar makes it very slippery. It‚Äôs like trying to hold onto a greased eel!üòÇ",1685577763.0

"ram_trucks","t5_2yejx","I bought a duraliner bed liner for my 2020 ram and it's been working fine for me. Only thing that sucks is like ppl mentioned it gets dirt caught up under it. So every now and then I have to take the rubber mat out and clean it up. Not a big hassle but can be annoying.  Cost me about 400 dollar back then. 

Pros
Include the rubber mat for good grip on items
Fading is minimal imo
Protects the bed good
Easy to install yourself

Cons
Stuff gets under the mat
Rubs paint if underneath slowly but still does.

Overall give it 4/5..

If you go with bed liner, make sure to get a good installer. I didn't have anyone I trusted near me and the reason I went with the drop in.",1685577763.0

*2095 grimaced. Electra‚Äôs hostility toward these ruins bothered the android much deeper than she initially thought. It was strange feeling a sense of kinship from the inanimate machinery, but they were both entities long outside of their own times that very few seem to understand. Her thoughts drifted back to the painful memories of her original life; Lynne not only found a place in her own time, but compassion and happiness. Would she be able to find that herself, or is she too doomed to be a forgotten, misunderstood relic?*
#[Assessing Circumstances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYvvKyYIc5s)

* YT = Yours Truly, VFT = Venus Fly Trap
* Quick YT Tech Recap: **Rewinds** move objects backward along their total displacement at up to 3x the original speed at the cost of a tentacle. **Remixes** are a Rewind of a Rewind at the cost of a tentacle apiece, but are capped at 3x speed of the original. **Turn To Stone (T2S)** is using the hardened properties of primed tentacles as a ‚Äòsuit‚Äô to allow for replaceable layers of armor and for 2095‚Äôs attacks to affect stands.
* By judge ruling, the carts and orbs are both able to be rewound and remixed as normal.
* Inert orbs caught by the cart‚Äôs Spider ability become active once thrown and will explode on impact
* The growth of orb spawns is much more dangerous than it reads. After the first five minutes at the absolute most, both Electra and 2095 will effectively be dodging rain and won‚Äôt have the capacity to focus on much else. There is no way the match is going anywhere near the 10 minute mark, we will both be retired by orbs long before then.
** All else equal, lategame state is more punishing for Electra than 2095, though we won‚Äôt rely on that alone of course.
* The orbs flying around the arena are sources of light themselves, meaning that as they grow in number, the amount of shadows cast in the arena shrink dramatically. After the first minute or two, there will be so many traveling sources of light that all angles of the arena will be lit at all times, limiting VFT to its own ink for activation.
* Unless otherwise stated, YT‚Äôs main body will be hugging 2095 at all times **against the flow of orbs,** either on her chest or back depending on the direction she is facing.

#[Opening - Orb Collection and Ink Denial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMdGSTE4-Zk)

*As orbs began to appear and glow in place, 2095‚Äô‚Äôs eyes shimmered as her processors wondered what this giant machine‚Äôs purpose was. She frowned, it was most likely lost with time as her own was. If what Electra proposes is correct, and it can be put to destructive use by those who wish to manipulate it, what‚Äôs stopping the same from happening to her? Lynne had an identity, something to hold on to, but what does she have?*

Without wasting a beat, 2095 dashes straight to the cart next to her, kneeling down and slamming the throttle to max while YT primes three Rewinds on the cart itself inside the bucket. Two of these will be used in tandem with the Crab ability as described later, while one will be purposefully left dormant for now. YT also primes three Rewinds on 2095 herself as she begins swaying and ducking in the cart to facilitate micro-dodging if necessary to avoid oncoming orbs; these dodges will have to only be active for an instant as any longer will have her launched out of the cart as she is Rewound backward.

Note that we mentioned ‚Äòoncoming orbs‚Äô, as instead of traveling with the flow to better avoid collision, 2095 will charge headlong *against the flow* in a corkscrew trajectory, spiraling along the inside tube of the ring while threading herself through inactive carts. This is for three main reasons: 

First, going against the flow in the opening minute while orb density is low is the safest time to do so and allows 2095 to collect orbs using the Spider cart ability without putting herself in too much danger. With close to five orbs passing every second at a standstill, going into them will increase that number a fair degree, allowing her to collect at least 3 or 4 per activation every six seconds. This means that at the end of the first minute, she should have a healthy collection of inert orbs inside her cart, which will be put to good use immediately.

Second, the corkscrew trajectory allows her to abuse the 15m diameter of the ring to put herself out of VFT‚Äôs effective range where necessary. In the opening minute or two, shadows are going to be a concern since there aren‚Äôt enough orbs active to keep the entire arena lit from all angles. The constantly changing elevation and position relative to the base position of the inactive carts also give 2095 high and side angles to clearly launch inactive orbs at pools of ink and even Electra herself if given an opening. Combined with her computer-calculated accuracy and natural throwing ability, landing hits on even oddly positioned pools and their tentacles should be relatively easy as long as ammo holds, which as mentioned will be collected off-cooldown with the Spider ability in this opening minute or so. These first two reasons are the primary focus of the first minute or so of the match, collecting projectiles and denying the spread of ink. 


*In all honesty, the android couldn‚Äôt refute her opponent‚Äôs logic; she knows all too well the nefarious powers that are active in the Mediterranean and what they could accomplish with something of this scale. But then why was she so adamantly against the idea of destroying it? Is being remembered important enough to jeopardize so much?*

Third, the direction is not the obvious one. This can allow 2095 to take Electra by surprise very early if she goes the safe direction and allow her to transition into late-game direct combat before VFT can start scaling and potentially end things very quickly. If Electra also elects (heh) to drive upstream for optimum orb farming with Spider, it will keep us opposite from her and effectively safe from directly thrown orbs while we farm and focus on denying ink. This direction also opens up a very deadly piece of tech for YT, the **R-Mine.** While orbs spawn in, they are motionless for a few seconds which gives the jellyfish plenty of time to prime a Rewind on the projectile before it starts its loop. Any time Electra is lined up with this particular orb, the Rewind can be triggered for a sudden change of direction at 3x A Speed, making it a nearly guaranteed hit as long as the positioning is right. Keeping track of where this orb is during its orbit will be difficult even for the android and her computer brain, meaning that she will only have one active at a time and will only utilize it during this first minute or so of low orb density. A powerful hit this early, however, would be crippling for the rest of the match.

**What if Electra opts to cut through traffic instead of circling it one way or another?** This is‚Ä¶ Not ideal for her, but maybe she has some all-or-nothing rushdown strategy out the gate, hoping to use the unconventional approach to hurt us, recognizing that, for once, the long game is **not** beneficial to her. Regardless, anticipating a move like this would make it quite easy to punish. 2095 has no problem switching gears on the fly and going on the offensive, in fact a close-range engagement is where she has to be in order to be a real threat to VFT. With whatever orbs she can collect in the few seconds before the two meet, and a **T2S: Full Cowl** making her own attacks affect VFT directly, she can clear heads and vines between her and Electra as she answers her rushdown in turn. Cart-based CQC will play out mostly the same as outlined in the **Pincer Assault** section below, albeit much cooler looking.

**What if Electra relies on cart abilities to counter the harassment from thrown orbs?**
Thrown orbs are not being aimed at her directly for the most part, they are being shot at ink to keep it from spreading. Any direct aggression with thrown orbs at this point in the game is opportunistic at best and is simply to keep her on her toes. That being said, 2095 can abuse the cooldown of Turtle/Spider since Electra will be likely relying on them in between respawns of vines, and if she sees it being used will use this window of weakness to get a quick shot in.",1685577764.0

"UofT","t5_2rbaq","I think some of the reasons that math and physical science does not get talked about as much is because of its practicality. Social science and life science make sense for higher education in law and med school respectively. Rotman is the business major, and I don't there theres any more specifics to add there. CS and Eng have very good outlook in terms of jobs and etc. that math, physics, stats and etc lack in comparison to, and any higher paying jobs in those areas require Masters and PhDs. 

Another point I think can be made is the difficulty. To be more specific, the math courses are significantly more workload for me than the cs courses I have taken. A lot of my friends are done with math strictly because they have realized that it isn't worth it for them to put in a lot of extra effort. Some of my other friends are purely burnt out from the theory and abstraction from courses like MAT257. A lot of people who enjoy math in high school see abstract and rigorous math and get deterred. Pure math is a challenging subject and it is not for everyone, and I think a similar case can be made for physics. Statistics is a special case just because the stats department at uoft is not very good.

With the exception of stats, all the math and physics programs are open enrolment, so once you finish 4 credits in your first year you can enroll into any of the open enrolment programs. Stats will require a certain grade, I do not know that grade, but im sure the grade cut off has been talked about in this subreddit.  

Social Science is not a program of study, it is an admission category that contains a wide variety of different programs. As long as you take the required courses to make a PoST and do well in them, you can enroll in any PoST.",1685577765.0

"WildlifeRehab","t5_37tws","This may be a situation where you have to earn your license with the old school people and then go your own way once you've earned the full license. 

As an industry wildlife rehab is still new enough that many of the first/early ""class"" are still in and very active, and often as not are still practicing the first generation practices and procedures they started with, especially if they are in a strong leadership position in the org (or independent) and less likely to have cross pollination with people/orgs who have been working on improving diets and procedures. 

It is up to you and us newer generations to onboard updated SOPs and to keep updating them, but unfortunately the way licensing is set up we have to earn under the old regime first. And very often, this also means dealing with the fact the the old school mindset will often have a wide network in the public realm who may be difficult to win over as is the case in any close knit community. But it can be done! It just takes a lot of work, often much more than you anticipate. 

I guess where I'm going with this is that wildlife work is far more PR than it is hard skills, and you can't ignore either of you are going to pull it off.",1685577765.0

I'm very social on reddit, I post a lot. People like it or hate it but I try and converse with people. When I log into a video game, I'm doing it to play a game, not talk to people and definitely not to organize a team (one of my job responsibilities is managing a project).

One of the biggest reasons I don't do any kind of group bossing is because you have to commit time to organizing a team and then you need to ""put your all in"". I can't do that after working 8 or 12 hours that day. Runescape isn't my job, and people in organized play expect it to be.

Good example is I recently completed log for Raksha. It took me a little under 1000 kc. I do 4 minute kills (my PB is ~3:20) and may die 2-3 times an hour. I don't take those deaths personally and I'm not working at a sweaty pace. If I were playing with others, those  numbers (and the way I play) would likely be totally unacceptable.",1685577766.0

While there's an exception to every rule, just know that generally, app developers are not interested in partnering up in exchange for profit share.
You'd be expected to pay either a fixed price or an hourly rate, depending on what you agreed to with your developer(s).
Factors that will influence the price:

  1. How much preparation have you done already?  Ideally, you will hand over a wireframe or storyboard of your app.  ""On screen 1, the user will enter their username/password.  Clicking login will go to Screen 2""
  2. You will need to back this up with wireframe documentation.  Detail what the type of every field (is it a label) is.  Text/Numeric/Alphanumeric input?  Is a button greyed out until data is entered?
  3. Is there a backend?  In other words, would the app work just fine in aeroplane mode or does it require connectivity?  Think Facebook vs a Tetris app.
  4. Are you going to organise the backend (getting the server set up (Database, web server)?  Who's writing the code for the API
  5. Does your app need to pull data from any other sources other than your server?
  6. Who is organising the graphics?
  7. Who is designing the UI (User Interface)?

Best of luck. My apologies if I misunderstood and this comment has no relevance.

**Buyers and sellers, use the link above to verify where to redeem codes to ensure 4K codes redeem properly.**

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a transaction has been completed, one user (buyer or seller) must create a comment (can be in-line with the deal discussion) tagging both `DCSbot` and the user they transacted with, for example  u\/cripple1.
 * The u/ is required, and the username for the bot ***MUST BE TYPED NOT COPY/PASTED*** to work properly.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential transaction must be made via comments. Exchange codes/payment via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted buyers and sellers.  **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

 * If you believe you have been scammed, please [fill out this form](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/digitalcodesell&subject=I%20Think%20I%20Have%20Been%20Scammed&message=*%20Username%20of%20the%20person%20scamming%20me:%20%0D%0A%0D%0A*%20Link%20to%20the%20thread%20where%20the%20transaction%20originated:%20%0D%0A%0D%0A*%20Link%20to%20screenshots%20uploaded%20to%20imgur%20of%20my%20conversations%20with%20the%20scammer:%20%0D%0A%0D%0A*%20An%20explanation%20of%20the%20situation:%20).

But then again, I hate Nolan's Batman on the whole. Terrifically made films - until Reeves' I might even have said that TDK was the best Batman movie - very well made. But I feel like almost every creative choice they made on those films misses the mark (for me).

White-washing both Ra's and Bane while also making their characters less interesting, ans bringing back the league of shadows for DKR seemed so forced and pointless after them being almost absent from the 2nd one. Having Batman quit being Batman like 3 times (cause that's what I think of when I think of Batman - hanging up the cowl). His awful, awkward fighting style they paid some MMA guys to ""invent"" for the first movie (It's hard to see in the movies, but looks truly ridiculous in BTS stuff). Ledger's performance as Joker was great but I dont like any Joker who corrects people for calling him crazy (not to mention the scarred Joker is becoming the norm for live action adaptations - I loved it on Ledger, but I'd like a different take now, please).

Why do you have to go in and out of menus? Same with Zonai dispensers. Why is selecting items done in a horizontal menu with such poor ability to organise or customise it? Why are all 4 spirits set to the same button instead of being a face button each? Why doesn‚Äôt a weapon breaking arm you with another weapon? Why is skip sometimes X, sometimes + and sometimes press X so you can press +? Everything in this game feels needlessly clunky from that perspective, like everything you do is like 3 button presses longer than it needs to be.

There are loads of little things like that which I feel like are such genuinely bad design and it feels so at odds with how thoughtfully designed and carefully planned everything else is about the game. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre things you barely interact with either, like the games is constantly encouraging you to combine items from your inventory and switch things up mid-encounter etc. it‚Äôs like a bunch of systems designed by people who don‚Äôt actually play games",1685577767.0

You were sitting in your house on your computer staring at the screen. You recently sent out an advertisements online. You weren‚Äôt lonely, living by yourself was fine, but you also were really hoping to meet someone new. It has been awhile since you had seen anyone. You had never really gotten close to people. Just as you start to trail of in thought, you get a new notification on your computer. Someone had responded to the ad. They were‚Ä¶ strange‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt really say much about themselves. They did offer to do the cooking and cleaning, which was a positive. A few days later, they showed up at your front door with bags in hand as they wear an oversized hoodie, sweatpants, and‚Ä¶ a collar?

Hi hi~, good morning/evening. I am looking for someone to be the lovely person who takes me in and discovers my secret. This rp is mainly wholesome, and will mainly be plot.

"heat","t5_2s8tk","Probably because we haven‚Äôt beaten Denver in 3 years. I honestly don‚Äôt know what the path to beating them looks like since we haven‚Äôt been able to do it in such a long time. 

But man, even I‚Äôm mystified by some of the takes. I‚Äôve been listening to a few podcasts and we‚Äôre being looked at as being heavily outmatched. Some people think Aaron Gordon can guard Butler? No one is talking about Jamal Murray being the defensive liability that he is. The Heat just went through 3 defensive juggernauts in the East and now we‚Äôre not supposed to be able to score against the Nuggets? 

The Lakers were not a good offensive team and they hung around against the Nuggets. The only reason why the Lakers couldn‚Äôt win a game was because they fizzled out late in every game mostly because Lebron literally ran out of gas and took shitty 3‚Äôs. The execution was horrific. 

Sure, we probably won‚Äôt stop Jokic. But no one else on that team is ethereal. Jamal can shoot them out of games and when Jokic is on the bench, the team sputters. 

The Heat can do something. They‚Äôre not going to fold or get dominated.",1685577768.0

"CombatFootage","t5_2v0c6","You need only see the kind of rapid innovation taking place in Ukraine at the moment, I forget the name of the initiative but they have a military program where innovators can submit proof of concept devices, and they can be selected for further development and funding. This is different to a more typical bidding for a capability the military asks for - instead, the innovators come up with the concept entirely (although I imagine they ask soldiers what they would like, what could help save friendly lives and/or destroy the enemy) - although they do of course have the traditional bidding process too! In this way, things can be invented that the military admin overseeing procurement didn‚Äôt think of :) .

The most recent thing to come out of this program was, iirc, a kind of FPV drone ‚Äúmothership‚Äù with fixed wings, that takes an FPV drone to a much further away location for a strike, starting it up and then releasing it upon command, with the mothership acting as a signal relay. It returns home once the strike has been performed to be re-used.

This prevents the common signal breakup as they near the surface, as it‚Äôs being transmitted from above the target rather than along the ground, unavoidably through clutter, and it also massively extends the strike range, both physically and electronically.

So yeah to return to the original point, I imagine this sort of innovation will be taking place all throughout the West (and probably elsewhere too‚Ä¶ particularly China) currently, but with more funding and easier access to high end parts and without the risk of being exploded by a cruise missile during dev work :/ !",1685577768.0

Incidentally, I will sort by newest daily, looking for posts like that. I'm sorry yours got buried by the algorithm. 


I think to prove my point, it would be helpful to open up my post history, ignore those ancient posts in r/AskReddit and look at some of my most upvoted comments in this sub.

* [8 years NC with Nfamily. Ndad emails to tell me nmum has stage 4 ovarian cancer and that I need pray for her and ask her for forgiveness before her passing](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/11kugdv/8_years_nc_with_nfamily_ndad_emails_to_tell_me/jb9azua/)

Here we have a thread where OP is in pain because the person who abused her is now dying and so family members are nagging them to go and see her abuser, beg a literal child abuser to forgive their victim for... Being abused I guess, and pretend that everything was always okay because a child abuser is dying and child abusers need to be cared for. OP is angry. OP wants to shoot back with a sharp reply. OP wants to tell everyone exactly what they think of them because for all that time, none of them cared when her health was on the line. 


Now look at the comments section. All of the top comments are advocating not replying at all. They're advocating maintaining the peace that OP worked hard to earn. There's also not a lot of detail that OP went into about what their nparents actually did. People are advocating that OP *not* express their outrage, and instead focus on the most healthy path forward.

* [people who went non contact, what would you say to someone wanting to do the same?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/13t34aj/people_who_went_non_contact_what_would_you_say_to/)

This is another post with very little detail, and no explanation at all about what OP's parents even did to them. I'd like you to scroll down to the comments again. People are there supporting OP. I offer a parable I like to share explaining why NC is necessary for healing the damage done by toxic people in your life. Scrolling down you find a lot of positive replies to my comment, and more comments supporting the OP.

* [My nmom is making me sign a contract](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/12sd5va/my_nmom_is_making_me_sign_a_contract/)

Here OP finds themselves in a very awkward situation. They are 19, don't know what is happening, and are asking for help with that situation. Their parents are trying to get them to sign a contract which would inevitably result in OP having to pay an outrageous amount of money in rent. They post looking for help from people with more experience. And those of us who aren't emotionally kneecapped by being right in the middle of what OP is going through are able to break it down for OP.

* [My son broke a statue today](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/13mlqdu/my_son_broke_a_statue_today/)

This is a different kind of post. OP is a parent with their own child, who accidentally broke something. There is no outrage. Instead, the focus is on uplifting and praising OP for breaking the cycle and realizing that it is okay to feel sad for the broken item and still recognize that the kid is just a toddler, and isn't responsible for the accident.

* [I'm divorcing. My father just *informed* me I would be moving in with my birth family again and gave me his bank account details so I could direct deposit my salary to his account](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/x0b5bb/im_divorcing_my_father_just_informed_me_i_would/)


Here, OP is having a major crisis where they are going through a medical divorce and their abusive parent had demanded that not only OP move in with them, but that OP deposit all of OP's income into the nfather's bank account which OP will have no access to without his permission. OP is hurting, they're going through a lot. They're looking for help and support. I think OP already knows they need to say ""No"" to these absurd demands, but a lot of threads like this I find that OP just needs to hear someone else tell say they should do the thing they already intend to do. And that's okay. It's okay to need to hear that validation if that is what will help you find the strength you need to feel confidant in your decisions. Many of the comments focus on reassuring OP and insisting OP can do this.

The idea here was just to make it so that house choice options and courtship dialogue would fire more reliably. So no, this won't allow both a KWF spouse and a vanilla spouse -- they're still tied into the base game's marriage system, and you can only get married once.

And also to, over time, get to see you and to meet you, and to hear from you and understand what this show has been for you, and what is possible when we open our hearts. 

Something I believe so deeply about people‚Äîand something that was kinda challenged by the pandemic, and that doing this show meant that I had to stay in sight of, and I had to sort of be THAT girl, if only for a few hours a week‚Äîis the belief that people want to connect. They want to love each other. We want to be caring and protect each other and be vulnerable with each other, and the fact that we cause so much destruction is not because anyone would prefer that to love and connection, but because we‚Äôre very easily damaged. We‚Äôre sometimes not handled with care. 

And that‚Äôs one of the biggest things I have learned from these memos and everything that you have said and from doing this show‚Äîis that connection is what we all need, whether we know it or not, and that the power of one voice‚Ä¶ one voice can do so much. It can offer so many people solace, it can bring so many people together. 

I am a very imperfect person, but within that swamp of my humanity I have found comfort and love and felt seen and understood by you. I hope this encourages you to do whatever projects you are thinking about, if you are doubting the power of your own voice, your own soul, your own vulnerability, I hope that this shows you how much can happen if you simply offer people a space to feel like they can witness themselves and accept themselves, and not simply continue punishing themselves, as we‚Äôre so often taught to do. Thank you for being here, for continuing to be here, and I am so excited for everything we‚Äôre going to do together.‚Äù üíï‚ú®",1685577771.0

"Bushcraft","t5_2qnfs","Years ago I spent so much time researching this subject.  If you are talking a survival knife...it's not really a thing.  It's just a bunch of compromises that will make the the blade not very good at anything but better than having nothing at all.  So it would have to be small enough that you would always have it in the event a survival situation arises.  However a knife small enough to edc carry won't be well suited to a variety of survival tasks.  Even the Mora is probably 9 inches long or so.  Can't exactly put that in a pocket and if you wore it on your belt as an edc, it would be a hassle.  If you want something to keep in your car, I wouldn't just have a survival knife.  You would be better served by having a Mora, a machete and a small axe or at least a Mora and small axe.  Ray Mears knows what the heck he's doing.  Also the Nessmuk trio is a thing.  These are guys that have spent significant stretches in the field and were able to do more than just survive.  Moras' are great for fine tasks.  I have an ESEE Izula and I like it but not nearly as nice for delicate work.  I use it as my EDC cause I had a Mini Barrage that was sweet but it started to get some play in it just from use at work...cutting cardboard...stuff like that.  The Izula is about as big a knife that will fit comfortably in a pocket.  The only benefit that I can think of having a 6 over a 4 would be being able to baton larger things but in a real world situation I think it would be negligible.  Chopping with a 4 inch blade or a 6 inch blade would be borderline futile.  My 2  cents.",1685577771.0

"ValueInvesting","t5_2rndg","I would do as much investigation as possible to make sure it is not a fraud and make sure there is some plan to return capital to shareholders. Companies in China are just learning the concepts of using excess FCF for buybacks.

I was in a net net called Baioo Family Interactive (2100.HK) in 2016. They had some video games and I was able to visit China at the time and spoke to some college kids who had actually heard of one of their games. I also visited one of the physical stores for children‚Äôs toys they had. I emailed with IR and management. They were able to communicate in English fairly well and had a plan to return excess cash. Ultimately they announced a big buyback and the stock doubled and I got out. However I dunno if I‚Äôd do it again, it‚Äôs becoming a lot harder to travel to China to investigate these ideas. Interestingly the stock has collapsed in recent years and it‚Äôs back to net-net status. 

Could also just buy a broad basket of net net ideas and on average would likely work out. 

Seems like Many Idea Cloud sells ad space at sporting events in China so took a hit during COVID and tried to come public during a weak market in 2022. Since they just raised the cash seems like they probably actually have it. Might work out but hard to find anything in English on them.",1685577771.0

‚ÄúThe new AMD Radeon PRO W7000 Series are the most powerful graphics cards AMD has built to date, providing professionals, creators and artists with exceptional performance and value to drive the most demanding professional design and creative applications.‚Äù said Scott Herkelman, senior vice president and general manager, Graphics Business Unit at AMD. ""The AMD Radeon PRO W7900 and W7800 Series graphics cards are built to deliver incredible performance and reliability in professional applications, while providing color¬≠ critical accuracy and an incredible visual experience.‚Äù

- AMD RDNA 3 Architecture ‚Äì The compute units share resources between rendering, AI, and raytracing, offering more raytracing performance per compute unit than the previous generation.

- **Dedicated AI Acceleration and Second-Generation Raytracing ‚Äì New AI instructions and increased AI throughput deliver over 2X more performance than the previous AMD RDNA 2 architecture. In comparison, second-generation raytracing technology delivers higher performance than the previous generation.**

- Up To 48 GDDR6 Memory ‚Äì Allows professionals and creators to work with large 3D models and environments, edit and layer complex timelines using the latest digital cinema camera formats and render photorealistic, raytraced images.

- AMD Radiance Display Engine with 
DisplayPort 2.1 Support ‚Äì Provides high resolutions, over 68 billion colors, and high refresh rates‚Äîwith outputs supporting next-generation displays and multi-monitor configurations options, creating an immersive visual environment.

- Certified for Leading Professional Applications ‚Äì AMD works with leading software application vendors to build AMD Radeon PRO graphics cards to optimize integration.

We have a neighbor who cuts our lawn because we live in a rental home and my mother doesn‚Äôt want to buy a lawn mower just to have no use for it in a few years. 

He‚Äôs currently mowing the lawn and my mother just asked if I could pay him when he knocks at the door. 

I would have no problem doing this, but she is in the living room, next to the front door, and I‚Äôm in my bedroom, in my bed, at the backside of the house. So I asked her why she couldn‚Äôt just do it and her response was ‚ÄúYou really can‚Äôt just do this for your mother?‚Äù to which I responded ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt guilt trip me‚Äù. She got very upset and immediately denied that she was guilt tripping me. 

Now I don‚Äôt know if she was guilt tripping me or not. Situations like these happen somewhat often and I don‚Äôt know how to get others opinions on it because I‚Äôm not that great at explaining it. So, AITA?

and honestly? it's why his ""redemption arc"" is actually interesting to me, because norman KNOWS that nothing he does will make up for the terrible things he did.  


hell, in the last issue of his solo series, he KILLS someone to save peter's life, and all he can do is break down and ask peter ""i had to do it... didn't i?"" He is asking peter if what he did was okay, because in his eyes peter knows right from wrong better than he does. and peter... doesn't answer.

I understand that the goal of the game was to introduce western players to the saga series (and they succeeded with me) but everyone on this sub has seen the difference in revenue when it comes to jp and global. 

It doesn‚Äôt help that the game got some much needed QOL updates that should‚Äôve been there since launch (ex. auto repeat). The game is also extremely grindy, which is a turn off for a lot of people. Fortunately, the grind has been toned down over the years but it‚Äôs still pretty grindy.

Despite it‚Äôs low revenue, I doubt square would axe this game. I think they would‚Äôve done it a long time ago if they wanted to do it. Unless jp dies (which given it‚Äôs revenue, it won‚Äôt for a long time) global will probably stay up and running. 

I still consider this game to be the best gacha game I‚Äôve ever played and also one of the most generous. Global is about to enter it‚Äôs 3rd anniversary this week so if anyone is interested in playing, now would be a good time to start.",1685577773.0

I would drop her off at the end of the night and I would have a headache and feel nauseated. My mental health started to suffer. When it came to reciprocating the friendship, I received nothing.

Now, you're all playing together on the same thing: Joe is driving a sight seeing boat, Bob is pointing stuff out to Fred, Fred is the only customer, and Mike is fishing off the back. How many different things can happen that would look like running around aimlessly, screaming, and shoving smaller kids into the ground, if you didn't pay attention to what they were doing?

One possible example: Mike gets a big fish and needs help bringing it in (generic screaming from the pov of an uninterested observer). The other 3 friends run over to help and all grab hold of the imaginary fishing pole (more screaming, possibly shoving smaller kids out of the way due to clumsiness, getting excited, and not paying attention). They bring the big fish in, but now nobody is driving the boat! They rock back and forth as Joe tries to grab the wheel, but when he does he falls and they all get tossed overboard (screaming, running aimlessly, and possibly shoving smaller kids).

In that example, those kids were making stuff up, practicing teamwork, and getting exercise. Someone who wasn't paying attention would have seen what you described, but the creativity was there too. If you watch young children playing together, like 5-10 years old, they'll often come up with games like that.",1685577774.0

I get it though, it does immediately show his hesitations about his size/strength. It will help contextualize his later Faile problem. And they may have different plans and we don't get the Two Rivers Faile/Perrin interactions like we did in the book. That's a possibility too. So overall I thought it was fine. Didn't immediately love it, but it's fine.

I don't like the love triangle aspect to it because right now, I'm not sure what it's doing for the story. It was already introduced, and if the only payoff was the quarrel at Fal Dara, then it's a miss for me.

I am earning now around 4K a month for what I was earning the equivalent of around 8/9k a month in Denmark.

not understanding logs is gonna fuck you up in science. Allot of rates of change, allot of heat transfer equations and excel graphs make more sense in the logarithmic form.

Uhm, NO, this statement is incorrect.  The \_testing\_ distribution of Debian Linux is precisely that, a testing  distribution.  It is, in effect, a release candidate, especially in the last, few months before the release of a new, stable distribution.

I have such a big family, when my cousin gave birth to her 3rd child, her mum drove down an hour from where she lived to pick up the older two kids and take them back to her house for a few days, just so my cousin and her partner could rest a little and get settled in. 

She isn't asking to not parent  his fiance's child ever again for crying out loud, her fiance's child has been a part of their family from the beginning and she has been great with it, and will continue to be a part of the family, she is just asking for a little time with her newborn and him for a few days, possibly a week. 

If you have the family to do it, it's not completely out of the ordinary to have someone from the family look after your other kids while you settle in with a newborn for a little bit.

And if the inflammation and pain has been prolonged for more than a few weeks then it‚Äôs another 1-2 points. Lastly you may be seronegative now but it could change in the future. I started very similar to you, wrists and thumbs, symmetrical both hands. If I recall correctly you‚Äôve passed the threshold of RA diagnosis. I started directly with MTX and now on my 3rd month of MTX I‚Äôm doing much better.

Die Sache w√§re halt, was ""spielen"" bedeutet. Wenn der Hund die ganze Zeit direkt neben dir ist (oder sogar angeleint) und dir der Typ dann droht auf deinen Hund zu schie√üen, droht er in deine Richtung zu schie√üen und sollte m√∂glichst schnell von jegliche Berechtigung mit Waffen zu hantieren, verlieren.

L√§uft der Hund beim Spielen aber st√§ndig weit von dir weg und z.b. in B√ºsche oder den Wald oder so, sieht die Sache unter Umst√§nden anders aus. Wenn dein Hund tats√§chlich Wild jagt oder aufscheucht, sowieso. Unter Umst√§nden h√§tte er dann tats√§chlich das Recht, den Hund zu schie√üen. 


Ganz unabh√§ngig von der Rechtslage sitzt da scheinbar irgendwo n Typ mit ner Waffe, der n Problem mit deinem Hund hat. Wenn er den Hund schiesst, ist es halt egal, ob er das Recht dazu hatte.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I asked ChatGPT:

If the range of the strong nuclear force was suddenly reduced by 15%, the stability of atomic nuclei would be profoundly affected. The strong nuclear force is what holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus. If its range were reduced, it would not be able to effectively hold larger nuclei together.

This reduction would likely make larger atomic nuclei unstable and cause them to undergo radioactive decay more rapidly. The most immediate and drastic effect would be that elements with larger atomic numbers (those toward the end of the periodic table) may not be stable anymore. 

This would have severe impacts on the nature of matter and the functioning of the universe as we know it. It would affect stellar nucleosynthesis (the creation of new atomic nuclei by stars), which in turn would alter the types of elements produced by stars and stellar events.

Moreover, since nuclear reactions power stars, this alteration might disrupt stellar evolution, potentially causing many stars to die prematurely. It could even affect the fundamental aspects of life, as life as we know it is based on certain kinds of chemical reactions and the specific biochemistry of the elements. 

However, this is speculative, as the laws of physics are interconnected in complex ways that we don't fully understand, and changing one fundamental aspect could have unforeseen consequences.",1685577778.0

I am currently working on methods to improve their personal development. That is honestly at the forefront of my mind. I have worked previous jobs where I felt I was completely overlooked with zero room for progression. It ruined me. I do not want that for anyone who works with me. I am doing everything I can to provide them with a good learning environment and time to work on/ go on upcoming courses.
In terms of quality, that would either be staff not cleaning, or feedback from customers of a bad experience. How would you implement a quality control method? I've just assumed as it's early days, I'll just be able to walk out and face check it. If it's not done, I'll raise a question. Hopefully my personal skills will get me through that one!

I'll hop in these modes to grab whatever new gear there may be but otherwise stick to the rotators, or even Trials ffs. There's no amount of mental gymnastics they can expect me to do to rationalize a casual 6v6 playlist being endgame level content on a daily basis (normal control--fine if you want to amp it for IB weeks). I was top echelon diamond or platinum in every single season in control/IB before they turned SBMM back on. Now I am BOTTOM SIX PERCENT in Control and BOTTOM 40% in IB.

The farmer is named Jake, and he has a mutated tomato plant whose fruit can be used to create an antidote to radiation poisoning. The Iron First, a powerful group of raiders with several suits of power armor, and  led my a man simply known as ""Hammer"" have heard of this, and want the recipe for their own. They figure they can exploit it to become a major player in the region. Jake knows they're coming, and has asked the player, a legendary wanderer, for help. 

(And for further motivation, Jake blames himself for his wife's death, he didn't perfect the antidote in time, and so he's dedicated to ensuring the medicine is available for all)

That's condensed. It gave me several pages of backstory for Jake, Hammer, and the Iron Fists.

Of course the Iron Fists aren't a real Fallout faction...but do the raider groups even get names? Who's to say it's not one of them?  

And, with vector store plugins, you can give these tools a lot of memory, and the ability to request additional context from that memory. 

Now right now a model like GPT3.5 is far too big to run on a home GPU. Could work with a cloud service generating quests for the players, though. 

Vicuna 7B tells me that it's likely procedural and doesn't have a backstory. I asked it to speculate, it said they're probably after other resources that don't have a corresponding in-game item, or perhaps they are simply on a rampage and want to kill as many people as possible. 

The smaller LLM are surprisingly good at dialogue, at least if you're OK regenerating responses and manually pruning out incoherent answers.

#[Midgame - Dodging Orbs and Approaching the Enemy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv1yYDzvFtQ)

*The Pieduron legacy‚Ä¶ Both Dedalo and her fellow Bastard Ninian seem enraptured with remembering and honoring the memory of such a grand civilization. 2095 paused, did Lynne leave a legacy? She doesn‚Äôt even exist yet, nor does a timeline that could carry such memories with them. She herself was the sole exception, but is that enough? How many would remember her legacy once this damned cycle repeats again and sends her to another timeline?*

Even in the opening minutes where orb density is forgiving, 2095 would be foolish to assume that she can keep safe from the A Speed bullets simply by paying attention. She is no stranger to using her ability to dodge incoming attacks, and will apply much of the same concepts here. Constantly moving herself inside the cart will allow her to use instantaneous Rewinds for micro-dodging if necessary, using the reversed momentum for ducking under the safety of the short bucket or to the left and right to swerve around incoming orbs. The Spider ability will grant a second‚Äôs breathing space while also collecting orbs, allowing for a tentacle to regrow in complete safety to keep up with demand. As an added benefit, as inert orbs are collected, active orbs decrease; they only respawn once detonated. The more orbs are collected, the less 2095 has to worry about dodging. 

Speaking of inert orbs, attention needs to be given to any coming from Electra. Ideally, she herself will be hidden by the middle of the ring for most of this early game, meaning that any incoming thrown orbs will be coming from planted vines. This is where the additional rewinds primed on the cart itself come into play, as while VFT has very impressive precision, it still needs to account for the odd curvature of the arena and is susceptible to sudden changes in direction. Crabs and **R-Crabs** can be used to dodge from a distance, while a timely use of auto-Turtle can keep the android safe up close.

2095‚Äôs positioning while she spirals along the ring can also minimize the amount of dodging necessary. Heading directly at a VFT vine or head means sandwiching it between her own approach and oncoming orbs, splitting its attention and using it as a meat shield. This either makes the approach easy with VFT focused on dodging orbs, or simply defeats the offending stand before it becomes a threat as an orb collides with it and detonates safely ahead of 2095‚Äôs path. 

Rewinds on the cart itself will be used sparingly, as the abrupt change in direction can throw 2095 out of the vehicle without proper bracing beforehand, but when combined with the Crab ability allows for some serious schmoovement. The **R-Crab** can be used to effectively cheat out extra time from a Crab activation while the stamina bar recovers, albeit in a reverse direction. This can quickly put 2095 back on course after an abrupt dodge, or simply keep her movement unpredictable from incoming attacks from Electra. Remixing the Crab can add another layer to the unpredictability and can double as a terrifying attack if given the opportunity, which is exactly what 2095 has been aiming for. 

*Fusing bodies with Ninian, thwarting the efforts of [Aerials], making friends with aliens‚Ä¶ In her short time here, the android had met many people and accomplished quite a bit. She had always done her best to better the lives she had encountered, and in turn had learned as much as she could from them as she did. She felt the stonework of the cart in her grip, this machinery surely has experienced more than she had, maybe that in itself is worthy of respect.*

The carts the two opponents ride in this ring both travel at the same speed, meaning that approaching one that is actively avoiding the other would be physically impossible as long as they are paying at least some attention. This is a problem, as 2095‚Äôs real strength comes from point-blank range where Electra has no reason to engage. Luckily, the android has been preparing something to solve not only this problem, but keep herself completely safe from orbs when they are just beginning to spawn in dangerous numbers. 

At any point 2095 feels comfortable with the ink levels in the ring, or if 3 or more VFT vines have been forced on cooldown, or if the density of orbs is simply beginning to get too much to handle easily, the android will initiate the offensive by bracing herself in the tiny cart and activating the very first Rewind stored on it. This will catapult her back *into the flow* of orbs at a greatly increased speed, faster than the orbs themselves are traveling and allowing her to close the distance with Electra (even assuming she adjusts course to run away) in mere seconds. This technique offers multiple advantages: it forces Electra to either come to us rapidly or travel *against the flow herself* to avoid us which puts her in greater danger from orbs, it makes dodging orbs as easy as changing lanes in traffic since we are not only traveling the same direction but at greater speed, and it frees 2095‚Äôs attention away from dodging to focus completely on dealing with VFT on approach. The only catch is that this **R-Reverse** can only be used the one time as it requires significant time spent traveling against the flow which is too dangerous to do after the first minute or two, and it will only last as long as a third of that time spent traveling. 

These two weaknesses are easily manageable, as 2095 only needs to become parallel with Electra‚Äôs cart at any point along the spiral path through the ring once to launch the attack. Once parallel, she initiates a Crab aiming directly at the enemy cart while simultaneously activating the automatic function of the Turtle ability, making the rapid collision course safe from any orbs thrown in retaliation. In turn, 2095 will throw her own orbs directly at Electra, forcing the remaining vines of VFT to defend its user as the carts collide at full speed. The aim here is to throw **both parties** from the carts and onto the ring itself, forcing a point-blank standoff between the two. For good measure, the Crab will be Remixed into the **X-Crab** for an instantaneous, harder follow-up hit to ensure the two are thrown from the chariots and into the arena proper. Electra is in for a painful spill while the android both braces for impact and rolls with the dismount, minimizing damage as much as possible. This approach can be re-attempted as often as necessary for the duration of the **R-Reverse**, using different angles of approach and orbs thrown ahead of time to corral the target into a favorable position and increase chances of success.
#[Finish - Pincer Assault and Direct Combat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAy3nlATLkk)

*Suddenly, the all-important concept of purpose was foreign to the android. Lynne had found a place for herself in her own time without being concerned with fulfilling a purpose or defining her meaning in the world, she simply pursued happiness and found it. 2095 chuckled to herself, the thing she had been chasing so desperately since waking up here suddenly felt so insignificant. Why obsess over the reason for things when meaning can be found through what one does?*

With the pair now without vehicles, and time marching on with greater density of orbs appearing every moment, both parties are in great danger of being overwhelmed. 2095, however, has engineered things to be much more dangerous for her opponent than it is for her. Firstly, her positioning after the crash will put Electra *upstream* from the orbs and keep her there, meaning any incoming will impact her and VFT first before becoming a danger to the android. Second, all available tentacles will be put to a **T2S: Full Cowl**, completely covering her body in disposable, replaceable armor plating that doubles as being stand-affecting gauntlets and greaves. Thirdly, being on foot means she can finally take full advantage of **R-Dodging** by dancing back and forth, rapidly reversing her movement by burning ‚Äòplates‚Äô of T2S to get out of the way of incoming VFT vines as well as orbs that somehow wrap around her enemy and become a danger. 

Electra‚Äôs attention is split between the ever-increasing volume of orbs hurtling toward her from one direction and the advance of a very upset, fully-armored android from the other. Vines and heads will have to play a desperate game of balancing defense against projectiles, likely being forced into respawn while doing so, and attacking their opponent, which also may lead to a respawn with her now-stand-affecting Remixed punches and kicks retaliating to any aggression. Priority will be given to avoiding vines and heads as their power exceeds that of orb explosions, and a grapple from the former could very easily put the android in a rough position. 

At this point it becomes a survival game, one that the android has a significant advantage in given her superior positioning downstream from the orbs. 2095‚Äôs significantly higher durability owing to both her own robotic endurance and the replaceable armor plating of T2S coupled with YT‚Äôs ability to dodge at a speed high enough to avoid orbs even on foot means that it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the orbs do in her opponent before they to the same to her, even if she intends to not throw a single punch herself. When all the vines are inevitably put on cooldown from the pincer-assault, 2095 will finally end this bullet hell by chasing Electra down and grappling her into submission.",1685577779

"drones","t5_2rudk","Respectfully, I DO get your point. When they're operating correctly the average idiot can pick up and fly a modern high end drone out of the box and they probably won't crash it. 

They definitely won't crash mine, because I wouldn't let someone that doesn't understand how and why a drone does what it does fly a drone of mine, and I especially wouldn't let them fly an aerial photography drone without learning to fly LOS first. There's a reason it's the law that you fly line of sight, and I would wager that the majority of users who learn on a DJI are flying by the camera almost exclusively. It's unsafe and they will never be as precise or as comfortable as they could be if they learned properly. It will also result in the loss of the drone if their cellphone craps out or they crab into a tree that was outside the field of view of the camera. 

You're talking ¬£50 to learn for a ¬£500 investment. That lovely altitude hold feature you're thinking means you don't need to learn means you'll have no altitude hold low over the water or with a GPS loss and a fun YouTube video will result. 

The only thing you've said that I do agree with is that you can mostly learn FPV in a simulation. Still, once you decide to go real steel you probably should be flying something like a BNF Whoop before you go slamming a ¬£1000 DJI FPV drone into someone's house yes? üôÇ Also if you want to do that learning to hover the drone without altitude hold actually will transfer a bit, whereas flying a DJI will actually hold you back I think. 

You do you- there will probably not be a catastrophe from you learning with your Mini. I stand by my statement however and firmly believe learning without the hand holding is the way to learn.",1685577780.0

"diablo4","t5_2rzx9",">Weak Auras provide an absolutely massive advantage over someone not using it.

It's simply more information. It (as far as I know) doesn't do stuff like automatically cast spells for you, it simply tells you when spells/abilities are off cool down or about to expire. This is information your default UI already shows you. All WA does is bundle it all together in one location to make it easier to access this info.

But what about PvP? Surely having a plethora of information over your opponent would be an unfair advantage, right? Technically speaking yes, yes it would. However, Blizz themselves have stated that PvP is not something that they or anyone should take remotely seriously.

Even a good PC player with weak auras could lose to a console player with more talent and a deeper understanding of the game mechanics.

I'm not going to disagree on the DPS meter point. But it's still not an unfair advantage to have that information.",1685577781.0

"Residency","t5_2t8qv","In addition to the things others have listed, one important trait is to be willing to listen to feedback not only from your superiors but all members of the team. I had one senior this year who kept randomly switching which patients the interns were assigned to throughout the week. When we would point this out and ask to switch back so we could maintain some consistency for our patients, we were basically told, ""This is how it is, so suck it up."" We ended up having to escalate to the attending because it was causing a lot of extra stress on the interns and frustration/confusion on the part of the patients and their families.

Ultimately, I view the role of the senior as not only leading the time but also making it as positive of an experience as possible for all team members. If you are getting feedback from multiple team members that something in your management style isn't working, even if they are ""beneath"" you, then you need to be flexible enough to do so for the betterment of your team.",1685577782.0

"MushroomGrowers","t5_37713","I've never had any yield problems fruiting in the same location. However, depending on species some oyster will fruit from anywhere on the bag where there is a tiny gap between the plastic. Some will abort, others will keep growing which causes a lot of headaches. I imagine multiple fruit sites could lead to this happening. Usually every flush goes down about 50%, however there are times when I have a bad first flush and the second will be better. So if you have 500g first flush, 250g is reasonable for second and 125g for third, which is still worthwhile to me. After that if you can throw your blocks outdoors in piles separated by type you can get a lot more off them.

"piercing","t5_2qolb","For me, it hurt about as much as a lobe piercing, it just took longer. So...tolerable pain, for a longer duration, as the piercing has to go slowly to hit the dots.  


Kissing...probably hold off until it's fully healed to be honest. For me, that was about four months. Tips for eating and drinking: straws are your friend! Holding off on eating solid foods for the first couple of days helps, but otherwise you'll want to cut up food into bite-sized pieces. Biting down on foods, such as sandwiches, will put pressure on the top bead. Not only does that hurt, but it will cause irritation that can lead to bumps.  


Other than that, get a good nights sleep and have a decent meal an hour or two before going in so you don't get light-headed. Not much to be anxious about: it only lasts for a few seconds and will match nicely with your other piercings. :)",1685577783.0

The number 1 issue I think Incels have is they are so hyper fixated on either getting a girlfriend or in some cases having sex. But what they should be hyper fixated on is things they can control to make themselves more content and happy. This will make you more likeable and confident. Everything else will follow.

So yes, become healthy. Have good relationships with friends and families. Have hobbies that get you out of the house. Become educated. Have a good quality of life. You will find someone at that point.",1685577783.0

Scientists receive death threats for attempting to do work on things that protect people. I know, I was one of them. The people that make those threats have received plenty of mercy too. Even encouragement.

"agile","t5_2qhp0","Educating a Product Owner about their role and responsibilities in Scrum can be done through a combination of communication, coaching, and providing resources. Here are some steps to help you educate a Product Owner about not directly assigning work to team members:  
  
**Explain the Scrum framework**: Start by providing an overview of the Scrum framework, emphasizing the roles and responsibilities of each team member, including the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.  
  
**Highlight self-organization**: Explain the concept of self-organization in Scrum, emphasizing that the Development Team is responsible for deciding how to complete the work in the sprint backlog. This autonomy allows the team to be more efficient, innovative, and adaptable.  
  
**Clarify the Product Owner‚Äôs role**: Clearly outline the Product Owner‚Äôs responsibilities, which include defining and prioritizing the product backlog, collaborating with the team to clarify requirements, and ensuring that the product delivers value to customers. Emphasize that their role is to provide direction and priorities, not to assign tasks directly.  
  
**Share examples and best practices**: Provide examples of successful Scrum teams that follow the principle of self-organization and explain how this approach has led to better results. Share best practices from other organizations or industry experts to reinforce your points.  
  
**Offer coaching and support**: Offer to coach the Product Owner on their role and responsibilities within Scrum. This can include attending Scrum events together, discussing challenges, and providing guidance on how to effectively collaborate with the team without micromanaging.  
  
**Provide resources**: Recommend books, articles, or training courses that can help the Product Owner deepen their understanding of Scrum and their role within it.  
  
**Encourage collaboration**: Encourage the Product Owner to build strong relationships with the Development Team and involve them in backlog refinement and prioritization. This collaboration can help ensure that the team understands the priorities and can make informed decisions about how to complete the work.  
  
By taking these steps, you can help educate the Product Owner about their role in Scrum and the importance of allowing the Development Team to self-organize and manage their work.

I did buy a couple luxury items because I could never afford them before lol around $20k and a $50k car.

Hustle for a couple years and then take time off as I'm feeling majorly burnt out and will probably take the next 6 months off due to low paying contracts anyways.

* 100k in cash... plan on using as a down payment and need to put this in some high interest account if anyone can suggest any they use with free transfer per month

Though that being said, some ultimatums might be/seem to be reasonable; such as the decision to either break up or be monogamous, after many long serious discussions about the issues and finally coming to the breaking point where you know the current situation must change.  
But really that's not an ultimatum, because one person shouldn't be presenting it to the other, both of them should be involved with the problem solving.  


And if your partner is refusing to address an issue, there's no need for an ultimatum because when you reach that breaking point the solution will be clear: throw the whole man away.",1685577784.0

And in the case of Poland being such a big order, Koreans even let the Pole cut in line so to speak because the early K2 and K9 delivered so far were being produced for the Korean Army but they swapped the production slots so that Poles can get replacements quickly for the tanks/howitzers they sent to Ukraine.",1685577784.0

It's the first place I wobbled up on a surfboard, and sunburned and fresh-faced I beheld my first crush. It's the place we would drive along sipping chocolate milkshakes, while my border collie sniffed the breeze, while sticking her nose outside the window of the station wagon. It's where we gathered for surf contests - circles of kids hanging around on frayed beach towels and sharing bags of chips because no one could afford a whole bag. It's the place we hunkered down when dark, menacing storms would roll in over the emerald water.

I watch this video and wonder what the hell has become of our culture. We live in paradise, what could be paradise, and we act like a bunch of savages completely blind to what's around us. With every rude word, missing shirt, stupid act of bravado, we are tearing it down.

"onednd","t5_6utznd","Of the listed spells, I only find Ploy and Conjure animals insanely problematic. The rest of them are high level spells doing what high level spells should do, and are mostly criticized by DMs that can‚Äôt deal with them when outs absolutely exist.

Shield is and always has been fine. You can target saves and bait reactions. It also competes with Absorb Elements and Silvery Barbs, and you literally can‚Äôt use all three at once.

Web is also fine. It‚Äôs AoE control in spell class lists that have a long line of AoE control effects, but with more glaring weaknesses.

Real offenders imo are low level spells that do way more than they should, namely: 

Pass Without Trace and Spike Growth for obvious reasons for both.

Guidance paired with Subtle Spell is probably the most broken thing in the entire game (EDIT: hyperbole, obviously) and almost single-handedly invalidates the concept of a ‚Äúskill character.‚Äù Guidance has been buffed whenever it has come up in the playtest.

Misty Step is very powerful for its level, especially when it comes stock on a few racial abilities. 

Levitate should probably loose it‚Äôs ability to be used as a save-or-suck. 

Maximilian‚Äôs Earthen Grasp desperately needs a range nerf. 90ft is almost an entire physical battle map, which is crazy for such a strong effect.

Bear with me, I might not be using the proper terminology, but I'll try my best to explain what I did. I had to get it to manually recognize the port. All of this is from pure memory of about a month ago, so sorry if the port labels and everything isn't exactly precise. 

I had I think four options when you press ""?"" for available ports to autoconfigure, they were something like imw0, re0, re1, and LAN. But then there was a longer identifier with the re0 and re1 ports with a label of something like lladdr that I got to display somehow. Then I selected the lladdr option to configure and manually typed in the whole identifier, such as re0: lladdr ""some numbers"". I don't know how, but that worked, only for IPV4 though. Then after the sets were installed and I rebooted, then ran syspatch, then tried to update the firmware, no firmware was updated or installed. However, it fully recognizes the ethernet port without any issues after that manual troubleshooting, even though it said I was missing firmware for the port and it would not autoconfigure. I did not run a dmesg though, so I don't know the exact status of the port in question.",1685577786.0

They are exactly the right temperature to cool your whole body down while still being less cold than ice which can be too cold. They neck holder thing is great- no choking sensation around your neck. The only complaints are the plastic feeling on my skin which can start to feel slimy after they start to defrost and the seam in the plastic chafes a little bit. I sewed a little tube out of a soft piece off cotton. I get this wet so it conducts the coolness and slip it over the thermonecks and both problems are solved. I bought some for my mom (we both have lupus but still love to garden) and she loves them as much as I do. 

I would also recommend a cooling vest but I don‚Äôt even use mine anymore- it was heavy and drippy and warm+wet is yuck. Cooling vests are about the same price as thermonecks iirc (around $100) and I find the thermonecks to be easier and better.",1685577787.0

Just because I have a mustache doesn‚Äôt mean that my fear of sexual assault, domestic violence, violence at the hands of medical providers, the state, etc. isn‚Äôt any more real as a cis or trans woman.

Patriarchy- women are objectified and are constantly stripped of autonomy and agency. Their sexual identity and gender identity are always evaluated in relationship to men. I think we are invisibilized because we aren‚Äôt taken seriously as AFAB people.

Also we are less able to be sold as a spectacle because masculinity is affirmed in our society. The way that trans masc folk look post medical transition will not entice the cis gaze in the same way.

As people socialized as women of color  we are told to shut up and step back. We transition and are now called men that take up too much space and again are told to shut up and step back.

The reality is the most popular modes in football games are online pvp. And right now that mode is pretty enjoyable for eFootball. There's a lot of room for it to improve but pretending it's unplayable is just being divorced from reality.

As a free player, I just ignore the Big Time packs, and as long as the game stays fairly balanced between cards you can get for free and the BT cards I couldn't care less what the new shiny card is, I'm just looking forward to making the whales cry with my base Balotelli :)",1685577788.0

We have a policy of not saying anything critical- even constructive criticism-  directed towards the scene or anybody in the scene for about 48 hours unless it‚Äôs an ‚Äúurgent issue‚Äù that needed addressed. But mostly it‚Äôs just positivity, praise, connection, and canoodling in the short term following. Only good things right after because sometimes things get spun up in our heads post-scene that after a few days of calming down and adjusting to ‚Äúnormalcy‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt even be a topic/comment on our radar. We like to come down before analyzing anything. 

1. sub-drop for me typically looks similar to physical exhaustion/emotional tenderness. I‚Äôm tired, I‚Äôm thirsty, I‚Äôm just kind of coping in the real world more than what is typical. 

2. trial and error. We play, we try new things, we drop, we try new things. We have lengthy conversations and careful introspections in between scenes.",1685577788.0

This game has that with RYU be guess what. He was replaced by Luke who's name in itself if so lacking. The new characters in this game CAN and will attract people regardless but I don't think they would perform as well as a character like Yugi where even if you don't watch his show or play his game you still know about him and his name. 

Dnf duel does this perfectly because literally every character had people hyped to play the entire roster because they looked great and some of the characters played this iconic role very well. That's one of the reasons the game was so hype at launch. SF is just doing what that game didn't and has all these other mods and the game is more popular because of its history.",1685577789.0

"scifiwriting","t5_2vj04","Just to add, if I could give advice to any person starting out writing it's this:

""Just write.""

It doesn't matter what you write. Your first work won't be your best. It doesn't matter whether it's good. It doesn't matter who the audience is. It doesn't matter how long or short it is. It can be anything. Just the act of writing is practice, and practice will improve your skill. If you don't know how to incorporate your ideas into a story, write a story that incorporates your idea - which sounds dumb and unhelpful, but it really isn't, because as soon as you start with ""One day there was a person who was doing X, and \[idea\] happened..."" you've already crossed that barrier and you're on your way to writing your idea. Don't start with your dream story if you're not prepared to accept less than perfection, because you're setting yourself an impossible goal.

And this seems to be the thing people most often need to hear. They're so paralyzed worrying about whether their idea is good that they can't start writing their story.",1685577789.0

Second of all with only one slot warlocks need 3 short rests before having more slots than a wizard, and 2 before having more slots than every other cast. They don‚Äôt really have more slots until level 2. 

Third of all hexblades are bad at level 1 due to having a poor level 1 spell list (shield isn‚Äôt nearly as good when you only have 1 slot). Archfey is better due to access to the sleep spell at level 1. 

Warlocks only start getting good at level 2 when they get invocations (agonizing blast especially) and 2 short rest slots. At level 1 they are very bad.

Together, 2,222,000 tonnes, or 2,222,000,000 kilograms of meat.

3,500,000,000 pounds in subsidies divided by 2,222,000,000 kg, equals to around 1.57 ¬£/kg. That's assuming animal farmers are taking in ALL of the subsidies for themselves (they do not), and not counting veal, turkey and other types of meat produced as well as eggs and milk.

>Do it yourself if want to prove your point.

You're the one claiming that price of meat would increase substantially but have done no math to be basis this claim on anything but hearsay.

¬£1.57 per kilogram is, as we say in UK, fuckall. A joint of beef in the supermarket costs ¬£10-15 a kilo, another 1.57 on top would not even be noticeable especially with the current rates of inflation. And that 1.57 is assuming the best case scenario for your argument - in reality, it will be under ¬£1.",1685577791.0

Everything I've looked up on this basically says that for the symptoms of STPD (which is associated with depression, perhaps because it lends towards isolation) you should seek treatment immediately. This can involve medication, it can involve therapy. But it isn't too late.

"reddevils","t5_2rxse","Alright I had to have a think about this one because at first it was a head scratcher but now that I've had a moment, here is why I think this could be a good signing:

\- Home grown quota: we need this. If Scott, Harry, AWB, Heaton, Butler are all off, we need an English player in. A key reason for the price being high.  


\- Eriksen/De Jong replacement: Eriksen lasts about 60 minutes a game and FdJ isn't leaving Barcelona.  


\- Age: he's 24. We're getting him before his prime and this is another reason why the price is on the high side, his potential is high. Mason is young enough and intelligent enough to be molded into the type of player EtH needs; a number 8 that can transition the ball from back to front but also capable of playing elsewhere in midfield.  


\- A winner: another key aspect to EtH's signings have been mentality and bringing in winners. Antony, Casemiro, Martinez, Eriksen are all winners of titles and cups. Mason has won things and has the right mentality to continue that at OT.  


\- Upgrade: he's a clear upgrade on Scott, Fred, Sabitzer (who won't stay). A midfield of Bruno, Case and Mason could be elite.

The money is an issue, but when you take into account what we're getting, the potential he has, the problems he fixes, it could turn out to be an astute signing.  Let's hope that we don't overpay. In any situation, if we're getting him in first at a price of around ¬£50m, then that clearly means we have money to spend this summer, upwards of ¬£150m. EtH wouldn't sanction it unless he knows who that striker is and what kind of money it would take to buy him.",1685577792.0

ET used to be the biggest counter, but since nullifier goes through bkb now - its really not anymore. by the time he gets aghs and becomes unkiteable, you can comfortably get nullifier and make him a large melee creep.

MY answer is that I don't believe the military and the police serve the same purpose. ACAB because the purpose of the police is only oppression. I believe that a military can serve other purposes.
