(Or Hawaii.)

Did it so long that we graduated from Coors Light to craft beers and mead. (And kind of moved back to CL.) The amount of beer, and time, we drank definitely lessened over the years. Towards the end, it even got difficult to make it through the final games. I think once we even gave up as the pac-12 after dark was just kicking off.

Hello readers, welcome to OCpoetry. This subreddit is a writing workshop community -- a place where poets of all skill levels can share, enjoy, and talk about each other's poetry. Every person who's shared, including the OP above, has given some feedback (those are the links in the post) and hopes to receive some in return (from you, the readers).

If you really enjoyed this poem and just want to drop a quick comment, to show some appreciation or give kudos, things like ""great job!"" or ""made me cry"", or ""loved it"" or ""so relateable"", please do. Everyone loves a compliment. Thanks for taking the time to read and enjoy.

If you want to share your own poem, you'll need to give this writer some detailed feedback. Good feedback explains from your point of view what it was like to read the poem, and then tries to explain how the poem made you feel like that. If you're not sure what that means, check out our [feedback guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/ocpoetry/wiki/feedbackcritiques), or look through the comment sections of any other post here, or click the links to the author's feedback above. If you're not sure whether your comments are feedback, or you have any other questions, please [send us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FocPoetry).

**If you're hoping to submit your poem to a literary magazine** and/or wish to participate in a more serious workshopping environment, please consider posting to our private sister subreddit r/ThePoetryWorkshop instead. The best way to join TPW is to leave a detailed, thoughtful comment here on OCPoetry engaging seriously with a peer's poem. (Consider our [feedback guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/ocpoetry/wiki/feedbackcritiques) for tips on what that could entail; this level of engagement would probably be most welcome here on submissions tagged as ""Workshop."") Then [ask to join TPW by messaging that subreddit's mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FThePoetryWorkshop), including a link to the detailed feedback you left here.

"ChristianUniversalism","t5_2spxl","It is true that all who come to Christ are saved, but we need to understand that it is God alone who makes this happen:

>‚ÄúNo one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day.‚Äù

(John 6:44 ESV)

When God does this, then He gives that person the gift of faith in the Word of God (Jesus Christ), and this too is done completely independent of what the person receiving it wants or does:

>‚ÄúFor by grace you have been saved through faith. And **this is not your own doing**; it is the gift of God, **not a result of works, so that no one may boast**. For **we are his workmanship**, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.‚Äù

(Ephesians 2:8-10 ESV) (emphasis mine)

The saving work is done entirely by God, apart from anything we do.

If we are able to accept this, then the question we need answered is; Is it the intention of God to eventually bring everyone to Jesus Christ? The answer to that question is found here:

>‚Äúmaking known to us the mystery of **his will**, according to **his purpose**, which **he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.**‚Äù

(Ephesians 1:9-10 ESV) (emphasis mine)

God sent His Word, Jesus, into the world to accomplish the plan for which He sent Him:

>‚Äúso shall **my word** be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it **shall accomplish that which I purpose, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.**‚Äù

(Isaiah 55:11 ESV)  (emphasis mine)

>‚Äúdeclaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, ‚ÄòMy counsel shall stand, and **I will accomplish all my purpose**,‚Äô‚Äù

(Isaiah 46:10 ESV) (emphasis mine)

God will succeed in accomplishing His purpose to unite everyone in Jesus Christ, but God determines the timing. Some God has chosen, or elected, to save in this age, before the day of judgment, and all others will be saved after the day of judgment.",1719792001.0

Context:   
  
After days of torture in the Glass Keep of House Sa'ea, Kalaam of House Trexxan swore to his tormenter the truth would come out even if he were to die in the dungeon. A former soldier of the Holy Scytherian Empire, Kalaam tried to report House Sa'ea to the Inquisition for its involvement in the occult but learned the hard way the Inquisition is not interested in prosecuting those from the high houses.

The absolute last thing that the ALP needs to do is go for another big roll of the dice, especially when Dutton has stuck his neck out on an exceptionally stupid nuclear policy.

* Use a random number generator to get a value between 0 and 1. 

If you only want to use the segment from a random point to the endpoint and don't care about looping back to the start: 

* Use the Polyline segmentAlongLine() method to declare a polyline object starting at your random percentage and ending at 1.

* Use arcpy.management.GeneratePointsAlongLines tool to create your series of points using that polyline object as the input feature.

If you want to loop back around, you'll need to rearrange the vertices in an array and make a new line:

* Declare an empty list.

* Create an array of vertices using the Polyline getPart() method.

* use a for loop and the measureAlongLine() method to get the percentage of each vertex.

* If the percentage is less than your random number, add it. If it's greater, subtract it. Add each percentage and vertex to the list as tuples, percent first so you can sort them easier.

* Use the Polyline positionAlongLine() method to create a point at your random percentage along the line. Add it to the list with a percentage value of zero. This is your new starting point.

* use the sorted() method to sort the list by percentage.

* for each tuple in the list, get the item at index 1. Use the centroid property to change it from a PointGeometry object to a Point. Add it to a list.

* arcpy.Polyline() on your point array.",1719792003.0

> Also unlike first round picks, teams do not receive a salary cap exception specifically for their second round picks. These players must be signed using cap room or an available exception (see question number 25), such as the Minimum Player Salary exception or the Mid-Level exception. It is most common for a second round pick to receive the minimum salary and be signed using the Minimum Player Salary exception.

The problem with 2nd round picks under the minimum salary exception is you were limited to 2 year contracts, so if you wanted to sign them for longer you needed to dip into the MLE or available cap space. 

The new CBA allows 3 and 4 year contracts for second round players (hence the 2nd round exception), but as you see from Marks' tweet, the base salary is still the minimum. So they are still treated as minimum salary players for the purposes of aggregation.",1719792003.0

Kali Linux is a popular, live OS for pentesting. It's used by amateurs, professionals, and TV shows.  Kali is meant to be used ""live"" meaning it is to be put on a CD/USB stick and not keep it's changes logged. It is not meant to be a platform for daily use, i.e. to run steam or browse social media.
If you are looking for help for your drivers, head on over to [Kali Forums](https://forums.kali.org/) or their [IRC](https://www.kali.org/docs/community/kali-linux-irc-channel/). It's recommended to search their forums first!

If you are looking to use Kali as your main distro the answer is [**don't.**](https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux/) Head on over to r/findmeadistro to find something that more fits your needs.

If this thread was actually something about Kali that wasn't a support request or someone looking to switch to it, i.e. a news item, please message the mods and we'll approve it.

He is already involved in their life and is not an asshole for not wanting to be involved in the same capacity as he was while raising his siblings.

Because it was them who keeps pushing and them who are the parents. Also, gaslighting, really? You are making assumptions, he literally state:

>I told her it mightve been fun for her but I was doing what needed to be done to keep them happy but it's okay if they remember it differently because they were so young.

At no point did he ask his siblings to lie but sure.

Stating that you sympathise with someone and then immediately downplay their situation counterproductive. Also:

>he‚Äôs pretty much behaving the same way his mom did to them;

The difference here being she was the parent who were supposed to take care of her kids and raise the, something OP did for her, while he is an uncle - it is not the same.

>don‚Äôt expect a gold medal for it for being ‚Äúpresent‚Äù and helping out once a blue moon then be shock when you true colors come out and think it‚Äôs going to stay the same.

Doesn't sound like he expects a ""gold medal"", but just being able to attend family gatherings - like other family members. By the same logic neither Nan nor the mother should be invited to family gatherings - the mom clearly did not take care of her kids, OP did, and Nan cared so little about her grandchildren that she left them in a situations where they clearly were being neglected.

"Sololender","t5_7gmvui","Seriously I would get out before you get too deep. That is where I am - too deep and just trying to make back the money I have lost. In about 5 months of lending I have funded 107 loans with 68 completed on time or late for about a $2,000 profit. However of the 39 still outstanding I have 6 that total $2,178.25 dollars that are 68-89 days late which I am sure none of those people are coming back to SoLo after the botched 3.0 system upgrade. Scores for these borrowers at the time were 81($267.50), 67 ($100), 92($567), 62($53.50), 97($575), 90($615.25). I have another small batch of 3 late loans that hopefully they will eventually pay but given SoLo stupid policies I will lose money on them. Those scores are 92($342.40), 92($321), 99($321). So another $984.40 that is at risk. So even if all 3 of the current late ones do repay, not counting the other 30 outstanding loans, for the past 5 months I will have funded 77 loans for a loss of around $200-400. Yeah, being a SoLo lender is great \[smh\]",1719792006.0

"distractible","t5_4fxx08","Spotify experience sucks for me. I downloaded it on my laptop tablet when the website gave me problems, but the app has the same problems. It's touchscreen. I touch the screen to scroll. Spotify apparently thinks this is right clicking on my laptop. I'm not tapping and holding, I'm swiping. It'll create multiple right click menus and I have to angrily figure out where it decided is the correct area to click to make them go away. It's also a laptop with no external mouse. There isn't a full length scroll along the side. Gotta click on the little bar and then gently roll my finger 0.01mm to see each video as I scroll. Terrible. I'd certainly appreciate a way to make it not suck.


Op I actually popped onto the sub because the channel I watch on YouTube changed the name to ""DistractiGo!"" where the videos are mixed weirdly with GMFST videos and I'm confused. YouTube presence has been kinda all over the place since Google podcast went down but I thought I'd found the right channel to watch, something like ""not distractible revived"" or whatever. It's not there anymore though. I really wouldn't mind Spotify if it wasn't bad and I'm not watching the podcast on my phone because I'm doing other stuff on it.¬†

Thank you for posting to r/pokemon! We're glad to have you here, but unfortunately we've had to remove this post per our rule on [Objective Questions](/r/pokemon/wiki/rules#wiki_3._follow_text_and_poll_post_restrictions). This rule is in place per feedback we've received from the community because objective questions tend to fill the topic listing and often leave little room for further discussion once the question has been answered.

We do have a [Weekly Questions Thread](https://rpkmn.center/questions) dedicated to seeking answers for questions like yours, though! A lot of knowledgeable Pok√©mon fans frequent that thread, so please consider posting your question there if you're still looking for an answer, and you may get a detailed answer even faster than you would have here! You also don't need to worry about a minimum word count in that thread.

As far as ""sebaciel"" I used to think think the same way you do. And while I do think there's a bit of that I've come to realize the whole theme is about centered around love and abuse.. To me there's too many clues for me not to be honest about it. The opening scene of the very first episode Ciel was introduced to us naked. It could mean innocence and/or the loss of innocence, and him making a deal with the demon is like a representation of defilement or soul tie. Ciel's whole past about him being abused is the backbone of the story, and the author always find opportunities and ways to put Ciel in girls clothing or questionable situations, even ones that are played as a joke (famous corset scene) Ciel and Sebastian get intimately close, physically, which imo far crossed the boundaries of master/servant or father/son. The gazing in each others eyes with fireworks in the background, or Ciel falling with Sebastian in the sky as they gaze upon each other in the outro of season 4, or When Sebastian was going to eat ciel's soul, it had too much of a romantic atmosphere coupled with the music, and Sebastian softly removing his eye patch and touching him. Kind of reminded me of of the Twilight movies where eating/sucking someone's blood was like a euphemism ""romance"". This just my opinion btw. There's also too many accounts of grown men blushing or complimenting ciel's beauty (Lizzie's father, the viscount, the baron and author from the book of murder) just like the cultists did when they mentioned the boys will bring in a bigger profit because of it.

In season 2, even though non canon, was obviously, to me,  a love triangle of obsession and jealousy. With both Sebastian and Claude fighting over Ciel, or his soul, but Claude clearly exceeded ciel's boundaries when he made the gesture of kissing ciel's feet. If it's all about the soul then the physical is far too involved with the expression of desiring something not tangible. There is a lot more I picked up on, but although I don't care for it, there were too many instances I couldn't ignore, but it's still arguable that it's interpretation. Plus, I am aware that Yana created NSFW shota boylove manga in the past.  Which doesn't mean black butler is one but they share the same tones with black butler.

I am the daughter, granddaughter and great granddaughter of military veterans. My father and grandfather died from service related injuries.   
Pat Tillman is a hero. Prince Harry is not. He spent his 2 tours in Afghanistan playing video games while being kept safe by SAS military members. He made racist remarks about and to some of his fellow soldiers. He bragged about his questionable 'kills' in his autobiography.   
He did not start the Invictus games, this organization copied the US warrior games and was created for him. It has now become the Harry and Meghan show, with little attention given to the disabled veterans that it is supposed to help. Charity money has been funneled away from the veterans and has gone to funding Meghan's wardrobe and their high class, expensive accommodations.   
**Their fans, the 'Sussex squad' are now attacking Mary Tillman for voicing her opinion about Harry being given this award. And make no mistake, they are vile, known for harrassing and doxxing those that dare criticize Harry and Meghan. Harry and Meghan know about what they do and have thanked them for their support several times.**

She was fairly bad in the beginning alright, because she wasn't eating properly before she went to hospital, and I think she was depressed and drinking and had lost a lot of weight, so for maybe the first year or so we didn't think she was fit to look after herself anyway, which is why we didn't push it too much.

It's an important lesson that these two adults have now learned - actions have consequences and their actions made the twins feel unloved and unsupported, which in turn is making the twins remind their parents they behaved poorly.

"DynastyFF","t5_2umu4","Yes those rookies and their depth charts are very well known.... I'm not dissing 3rd round rbs as a whole especiallywith how the nfl is viewing them, I'm saying we all talk about how short the lifespan of a rb is, and for a mid round pick there are only so many chances to get a chance to shine. Typically we want to see more out of a rookie than 1 game of decent rushing and 1 game with over 2 catches. Showing a true three down skillset typically means showing something more than 2 games in a rookie year.

The pros you brought up are absolutely true and why I can understand people wanting to buy or hold. His rookie year was a wash but he was still an awesome prospect, showed a lot in college, is able to catch, has a path to getting playing time, and the saints not drafting a rb is huge to show they still believe in him.

All I'm saying is I'd rather reroll the dice on some of the rookies you named who didn't have an entire year where they showed next to nothing in 9 games. If the best I can get is a 3rd I'd keep him. But if I can sell for a 2nd next year (team depending) I'd probably take it. Rb is mostly dart throws anyway lol",1719792009.0

Due to the unfortunate possibility that posters may receive unwelcome chat requests and/or direct messages after making a submission, we want users to be be aware that they have the option to temporarily disable chat and DMs should it become a problem. Chat and messaging permissions can be found in the safety section of your account settings. We have a strict no DMs policy and encourage users to message the mod team to report any users that violate that policy - they will be permanently banned from the sub. To help keep the community safe, please also report any applicable messages to Reddit using the report function and make sure to block them. This should go without saying, but messaging minors is also not okay. It will result in a report to the admins, which will likely lead to the loss of your account. DO NOT MESSAGE ANY POSTERS FROM OUR COMMUNITY. That is not what they are posting for, and this is not a dating service. All you are doing is making the world a little bit worse.

A few notes - If you post or comment in this subreddit and have an OnlyFans account, or if you have posted links to OnlyFans elsewhere on Reddit, our automatic moderation bot will flag your account and you will be banned. We are a SFW sub that keeps content PG-13 and due to the incessant spamming by literally hundreds of people before you, we've been forced to moderate this way. This also includes accounts that post explicit content anywhere else on Reddit. If you wish to participate, please contact modmail to receive instructions on how to use an alternate SFW account.


Please do not SPAM the group with reposts. This means reposting when you've recently posted or deleting your old post and reposting a day or two later, especially if you haven't interacted with commenters on the first post (aka karma farming). We do notice, and it will result in a temporary or permanent ban, depending on the number of posts and the time frame in which they were posted.


Please REPORT comments on your post that are creepy, insulting, harassing, comment on your appearance (positive or negative) or otherwise inappropriate. We do take them seriously and will ban people who behave like this, with no exceptions.


We will delete any posts that we suspect are posting someone else's photo in an attempt to impersonate that individual. You will be banned and asked to verify your identity in order to have the ban removed. Exceptions to this are users that are posting on behalf of their partner/friend/family member and have obtained consent prior to posting. We ask that those users reveal that information in the title of the post.


Do not engage with trolls - two wrongs do not make a right. Also, refrain from making accusations about the authenticity of a post in the comments section - report or contact modmail. We do take action when comments/posts are reported...give us the time to review, we're not here 24/7.


Any other questions? You can always send your mod team a mail message.

"CargoBike","t5_2wh2y","I'm electrifying a Yuba Sweet Curry at the moment - same layout with 26"" wheel up front and 20"" wheel at rear. I'm using a GMAC (which I already had, or I probably would have used a Grin All Axle v3 rear for the built-in torque sensor) + Phaserunner + eRider T17 torque sensing bottom bracket. I chose the hub motor with regen because it results in a super low maintenance bike - hub motor doesn't add wear to the chain/gears, and regen covers 95% of braking needs so brake pad wear is hugely reduced. These factors are extra nice on cargo bikes where a mid drive hauling heavy loads would wear your drivetrain even more than a standard bike, and the brakes will get a workout without regen. The main downside to hub motors is that up a sufficiently steep/long/heavily loaded hill climb, they'll overheat. Whereas you can always just change down gears on a mid drive and ride 5km/h up some ludicrously steep hills with very heavy loads (as long as your bike has low enough gears of course!).

A hub motor in that 20"" wheel will get you up some surprisingly steep hills without any overheating risk though. E.g. a GMAC 10T laced in a 20"" wheel, with a total system weight of 200kg/440lb (including bike+rider+cargo) and rider putting in a bit of effort pedalling, could go up a 12% incline for about 1.5km before overheating: [https://ebikes.ca/tools/simulator.html?motor=GMAC10T&grade=12&cont=PR&hp=250&batt=B5220\_GA&wheel=20i&autothrot=true&throt=47.10815636140597&mass=200](https://ebikes.ca/tools/simulator.html?motor=GMAC10T&grade=12&cont=PR&hp=250&batt=B5220_GA&wheel=20i&autothrot=true&throt=47.10815636140597&mass=200) . A 12% hill is very steep. Efficiency in that scenario would be \~76% - quite good really. Pretty similar results for a Grin All Axle - efficiency would be a bit worse but it has much better cooling via Statorade so time to overheat is similar to the GMAC. Much steeper or heavier or longer than that though and overheating will become a problem - you'd need a mid drive in that case. The worst hill climb in my town peaks at 13% for \~0.2km, but it's more like 10% for most of the climb (about 1.5km total) - 10% is much much easier than 13% so that climb is no problem at all for my Sweet Curry with GMAC. I don't even ride up that particular hill for anything other than ebike hill climb performance testing, so the GMAC is easily capable of every hill I might actually need to take it up.

So the question is, what's the longest/steepest hill climb you need to go up? If it's too steep/long for a hub motor, the choice will be made for you - you'll need a mid drive. If a hub motor is capable of the steepest/longest hill you need to go up, personally I'd go with the hub motor.

10 miles range is easy btw. And you've got plenty of room in that frame triangle for a battery (unlike my Sweet Curry where I had to put the battery in the rear rack).",1719792010.0

"CharacterRant","t5_35frv","I feel like for that to work at all, you need an audience that's at least vaguely familiar with what the focal culture is *right now*, before the apocalypse. A show about a zombie apocalypse in Kenya will feel like dark fantasy to someone with no knowledge of what Kenya is like already.

But even for the people who can appreciate the cultural significance of Tibetian sky burials, one the main appeals of post-apocalyptic stories would be lost. Part of the reason people find even the fairly repetitive zombie formula enjoyable is because of how close to home it hits. How easy it is to imagine yourself surviving in this dark world, because the world is just a wrecked version of what the audience is already familiar with. Because the setting is not that different from your home town, and you can easily imagine your very house getting overwhelmed with zombies. It can serve as a source of horror, it can serve as a power fantasy, but it always serves as something, and that vibe would be lost in a show about a post-apo Kenya watched by people in America. So it's a trade-off, at the very least.

And while you may argue some people are better left ignored... Not everyone was happy when Resident Evil moved to Africa for its fifth installment. Not everyone is mature enough to see a non-western society descend into chaos, and people who appreciate that culture already‚Äîagain, probably your target audience in such a project‚Äîmight not particularly care for such a vision.",1719792010.0

"DecidingToBeBetter","t5_2tand","Is it actually bad to enjoy true crime? It reminds me of that [murder show SNL skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4RdcE6H4Gs). Is the guilt bothering you more than the content itself is?

I don't personally engage with that type of content--I have this weird thing where basically obsession with crime is upsetting to me because I experienced police brutality as a teen, and stuff that focuses on the evils of criminals tends to cast police as the heroes and romanticize them--even though this isn't always true exactly, and even if the police situationally *are* the heroes in some of these narratives, as a traumatized teen this was just too emotionally difficult for me and I avoided the whole crime genre, both true and fictional crime. But that's just kind of a me thing, it holds no appeal for me so I don't want to see it, I don't seek it out, and I feel fine about that. But I know my gf enjoys true crime, and as long as I don't have to engage with it directly, I don't care, I don't think it's morally wrong to like the content just because I personally am uncomfortable with it.

There's plenty of other disturbing types of content I enjoy that some people don't like to engage with (and that's completely their prerogative to have their own preferences and avoid it!) that I don't feel guilty for liking.

I think it's about making sure you aren't crossing any lines into real-world harm. Some true crime fans do cross that line, for example by harassing victims or their families, romanticizing criminals, even becoming ""groupies"" for serial killers, that shit is gross. Even stuff like trading in graphic content that wasn't supposed to be released to the public, like photos of dead bodies that the family doesn't want out there, that's disturbing. But just listening to podcasts or whatever? Nah, you're fine.

Where are you making the leap from TC content into doom scrolling? Do you perhaps seek out the TC content to self-soothe when you're *already* feeling low?",1719792011.0

"speedrun","t5_2sf9e","Like others have said, some of it comes down to just general event fatigue. GDQ's initial success was not only drawing new viewers to speedrunning, but showcasing a wide variety of them as well to help folks maybe find some new games or runners to watch. Most of us have long settled into our runners/games we mainly enjoy seeing these days, and with how Twitch has changed over the years, it's not really up front and center for new viewers to just stumble upon.

Another reason is GDQ is just getting old. Covid made things kind of shaky, and then delaying a return to live version kept things from arguably getting more settled. Pure streaming had its positives, but a live event has a certain bit of energy to it that simply isn't captured online. It's been rocky since that disruption, further hindered by the sheer chaos in the world these days. Some folks just don't have the time, and definitely don't have the money, to contribute.

Lastly, in my opinion, and this is the one that usually gets people downvoted or blasted (which I am expecting), GDQ has gone full tilt 'to the left' as some people would state. It's fantastic to be respectful and mindful of **all people at all times no matter who they are or what their beliefs are**, however GDQ have an extremely narrow focus on trans rights, probably drawn from the fact that the speed running scene is one of the umbrellas that has drawn a high amount of individuals who identify as such. But, even as someone who believes that these folks deserve the same respect as people as anyone else does, it gets so tiresome hearing it every minute of each event, constantly shoved into our faces as if it is the **only** view that matters in the world. It's their prerogative to do so, but I have found myself having to frequently mute or just close out the stream window and find something that I actually want to watch, as a lot of gdq runs are kind of just put on as noise or background, outside of the half dozen or dozen runs that each viewer sees as a must watch. Myself included, there are about six runs I feel I need to watch live, the rest of it? Well, I can support them by being a viewer, but I won't if it's going to be something obnoxious. And they frequently stray in that direction by sheer repetition of views that really don't contribute to the runs or event now.

There's also the speed running fatigue, which you might have seen if you watch speed running in general for a long time. Speedruns lose interest, and people pick up challenge style ones, or do other things eventually, or just fade away. Same fatigue applies to viewers. I really don't watch much speed running these days, whereas six, seven years ago I watched almost exclusively speedruns.

GDQ isn't going away anytime soon, definitely not in the next few years, but I don't think it'll see anymore explosive growth like it enjoyed 2014-2019 or so in comparison.

And no one would have thought she would have assaulted you. So lets get this strait, you absolutely get this recorded. If it was recent enough you have marks, get it recorded. Shes just shown you where her priorities lay, and they are not with you or the family. Shes protecting the AP. 

Get on the phone to the C wife and inform her that hes cheating on her with your wife. Do this. Its not revenge, it is the right thing to do. Poor lady isnt going to see it coming and he will cary on with both, hes wrecked your life and he shouldnt get away with it.

As far as your concerned, get you backside to a lawyer as fast as you can. You have to ignore the emotion and the love you have for your wife and start looking at things logically. You need to listen to good, sound logical advice. I am not going to say get a divorce, although honestly. After the gaslighting and physical attack and her willingness to choose him over you with no remorce, its dead in the water.

Her assaulting you, you need this documented and fast. I guarentee you she will come at you while your wondering what the hell is going on. SO act facst and act decisisve and make sure you tell everyone exactly what went on. Dont sugar coat it to you kids. She will absolutely gaslight everyone and spin it that your the bad person here. Do not let that narrative get out there from her. Be honest and transparrent with everyone. Your not the chump, your the blindsided victim of a cheater. A violent oneat that. If you had hit her, think about what the ramifications of that would be? So treat her the same. Protect yourself. Not just your person, but your honor. Because how people percieve you will effect your mental wellbeing more than you know.",1719792012.0

Like yes Biden is old, possibly senile (if that sickness excuse is to be believed), but I'll still vote for him regardless of how the debate went.

That said - I still remember when my best friend and I threw a party when her parents went out of town. We thought we were so smooth - a week went by and no one said anything. Then one Sunday her Dad calls my phone line (yep) and asks us to be ready for church in 30 minutes.  We sleepily get our shit together and head downstairs - where the four of our parents are, and our boyfriends and their four parents. We all got grounded together.  That to me sums up parenting in the 80s - the entire village was committed to ratting you out and making sure you turned out a responsible human being.

Those same people also brought you dinner when your goldfish died, fixed your car with your Dad,knew your middle name and had full authority to use it if you were acting like an asshole.",1719792013.0

"CoDCompetitive","t5_2tvg8","Welcome to competitive cod! :)

Others have explained how the bracket works, so I thought I'd add in a bit more info about comp cod as you get started.

We have a 12 team, franchised league. Teams play 4-5 majors a year leading into a final $1M Championship coming up in a few weeks. There are four top teams this year: Optic, Faze, Ultra, and Subliners. In terms of EU representation, Subliners has Hydra (France) and Ultra has Cleanx (Denmark) and Insight (England). 

One of the most special parts of comp cod is how well-engaged pros are with the community. If you find teams/players that you like, several players stream and make youtube content and many team produce their own team content (e.g. event documentaries), too.

Hope you enjoy grand finals today!",1719792015.0
"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","We did similar move with glasses. Optometrist order was $1,100 after insurance for 2 pair of prescription glasses for her (1 reg, 1 sunglasses). We got to Costco for a grocery run after leaving the optometrist and ended up ordering 5 pairs of glasses for both us for a total of around $700, due partially to their typical discount on every pair after the first pair at full price. Btw, the full price at Costco for a single pair before the discount was around 25% of what the optometrist was charging for 1 pair. Canceled the optometrist order immediately.

"AITAH","t5_446kys","I‚Äôd look for somewhere else to live, have your current house listed for sale, sell it, and move to a place for just you and the kids, including SS. You are the parental figure he needs. In fact, I‚Äôd be keeping records of everything, all bills, costs insurances etc, so you can prove what you‚Äôve paid. And the percentages. Sell the house out from under them, and move somewhere with all the kids. MIL and Husband can go get f***ed. You‚Äôre doing it all on your own anyway, imagine how much easier your life would be without the added stress of them. 
Go see a lawyer, see what his paternal rights are, and get that little boys parental responsibility signed over to you, (his bio mum and dad clearly give no shits). 
You are a wonderful human to have put up with all this for so long. And based on whatever equity is in the house, have a percentage worked out based on n husbands contributions worked out by an accountant and then ask the court to put any of the possible equity from his contributions aside in trust for your children‚Äôs college funds (all of them equally), as he can‚Äôt be trusted to not be bullied by his mamma into missing it. And have his wages garnished for child support. He can‚Äôt object to protecting his kids futures especially after allowing a toxic environment at home. 
MIL behaviour is just disgusting and controlling. 2 of my 3 kids have ADHD, it‚Äôs a long diagnosis process in the UK, so we mostly control it with diet. Yes they are allowed noodles and nuggets and whatever, but not every day. Fruit and veg they have every day. Some foods are blended into pasta sauces, because it‚Äôs not the flavour they object to, it‚Äôs the texture. (There may be some Au/dhd crossover going on there, but we‚Äôre still waiting to find out). 
The long and short of it is, you have more control and leverage than you think, you have options, you are a boss! The fact that they‚Äôve worn you down to the point and you can‚Äôt see this is heartbreaking. Be the bad b***h you are. Make your home the safe place you want it to be. 
Maybe your husband will want to date you, go to therapy, work to keep you together, in which case a post nup about these people sides should still be negotiated. You and your kids need the security. He may also want to  work on his relationship with you in a more meaningful way without his mother around.
You have options. Investigate them, choose one, and moved forward, because there is nothing worse than feeling unwelcome in your own home, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening here. 
Don‚Äôt let your kids grow up thinking it‚Äôs okay for their potential partners and their families to treat them as door mats, or be treated as such in return.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","> Maybe, but there's a road there, and roads are pretty expensive to maintain, too. It's true that it wouldn't work if there's literally no one using it, but there's a lot of rail through a lot of empty places in the US.

The rails are there for freight, which is critical to the economy in the US. Speed is not such an issue there. One problem with trains vs driving is that it takes several hundred people who wish to travel at the same time to make a train viable. With a car, it takes one person to make it viable. When you get less dense population, trains are less viable.

Also, driving in the US is much cheaper than in Europe. Fuel is roughly half the cost. Besides being cheaper, it's much easier and faster, especially when you get out West which is what we're talking about here.",1719792015.0

It's important to remember that the powered liftgate is not designed to be manual only, and by manually controlling it by hand all the time you might cause wear and tear on it that causes problems sooner than normal. If you really want it to be permanently manual it would be better to switch the liftgate struts out with the normal gas ones.

* Why don't you get to see bowlers or other batsmen as much as Kohli?

* Go find out where these people are investing their money. Are they like Ratan Tata Sir or Laalu Yadav?

"Isekai","t5_3hwoy","I don't disagree with you but at the same time I kind of have to. Only because he essentially got sent to another world but at the same time it might have just been another version of Earth's past. Like I actually hope that it is on another version of Earth rather than it just being essentially like a time before even the dinosaurs are right after they died off or something. Especially given that the lore of their world doesn't add up to our own. Cuz when we look up in the sky and see the sun it doesn't look like some fiery angry beast of hardcore metal rock ü§òüèæ. And while that'd be amazing as well as terrifying, It doesn't make more comparisons than it does parallels.

So for the most part I do agree.

Especially given that Jack Black is just awesome in general. The guy does not get enough respect for his entertainment value. I probably don't have that high of a taste in music, because I actually thought him and Kyle Gass were actually amazing in the Tenacious D movie and soundtrack üëçüèæ. I just wish that the game itself was better modded/edited in developing. Like the specs for certain enemies do not match up, and another times you literally need to be commanding forces in the army battles in order just to take down some other enemies. Whereas realistically as the protagonist it should be sort of like Dynasty Warriors, and somebody like Eddie or any of his friends should be clearing out whole swaths of enemies and vice versa if they're high leveled and named like when Ophelia had her heart broken and came back as an avatar of a Tear Drinker, leading an army of them alongside the Demons.

And not to give too many critiques, but outside of general story-based combat fighting monsters and stuff should have been more like Monster Hunter.

If I could do anything it definitely would have been remaking the game for more modern era with those elements. Especially considering that we're in the 2020s now so stuff from the '70s and afterwards like heavy metal rock and roll is actually old as hell. So it would be another way to try to bring its attention back to more current generations.

SEER and SEER2 have testing points in the low 60s for outdoor air, with 78¬∞F indoor air. These testing points favor units with large condensers and/or inverter driven compressors. You can look up the test criteria on the DOE website. 

I agree with you as long as you run your unit in A/C with it 15¬∞F colder outside than inside  for the same percentage. I open my windows. 

If you look at the EER which is BTU/Watt at 95¬∞F Outside, 78¬∞F inside, the 1/2 power usage becomes 10-20%.

"chessbeginners","t5_35d04","What you did wasn't better or worse than system play, because system play in and of itself isn't inherently bad.

That said, you played a reasonably principled opening. The reason you feel it is unstructured is likely because you chose to respond to c5 with c4, which led to the tearing open of the center. The pawns are the structure, so it's reasonable that trading them all off felt unstructured afterwards.

You castled and developed. Your opponent didn't. You used your development to attack before your opponent could castle. These are good things

Your opponent gave you the opportunity to gain way too much material with the same type of tactical blunders, but the reason you were able to take advantage of those blunders was the fact that you had the piece activity and king safety you acquired in the opening. 

Your opening is not so good that every opponent will let you win this way. But it was competent and achieved what you're looking to do in the opening",1719792018.0

"hoi4","t5_2zvvb","Who else was the USA at war with at the time? That's where all the divisions were.

Last game as Japan the UK and USA felt that the key to victory was in the middle of West Africa and did nothing to cover the home islands or their own territory. When I took out the Axis, they garrisoned the Urals mountain front despite it being defended by puppets and hundreds of Japanese divisions stacking around Turkey.

I presume there is a weighing the AI does where if there's an open front, no matter how irrelevant it is, they have to put troops there, and they prioritize that way over naval invasion defense. IE they see territory surrounded by water are basically safe and they really really really don't want to lose territory without a fight without consideration of how useless it is. Then when you naval invade they try and pull forces back but they are out of supply and have a 30 day transport ahead of them where they are being sunk the entire time.

Their inability to just give away territory also prevents them from making a strategically and tactically wise decision to pull back and shorten lines and improve supply",1719792019.0

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","1. Tbh, there wasn‚Äôt a last straw that I can think of. I can‚Äôt recall a time where I didn‚Äôt want to leave and I aggressively lobbied for it since I figured it was an actual possibility, lol. In definitive terms, that ended up really taking off in my early teens, because my mom kicked me out on multiple occasions, which allowed me to stay exclusively at my dad‚Äôs for weeks each time despite my mom having full custody, but also finally convinced my dad to file for shared custody, which eventually led to him getting it in full. I think the time she punched me clean in the eye, while custody proceedings were ongoing, helped on my quest for very LC, too, lol. But yes, mostly it was years of pushing for being allowed to leave.

2. I mean, she kicked me out and she‚Äôd spent my whole life mostly showing and telling me how much of a burden I was, so technically she told me, lol. But yes, I think I‚Äôd been clear enough on that I wasn‚Äôt a fan either, by the time I got to leave.

3. Man, I always found it way harder not to act that way. I assume I‚Äôd also have the instinct to do whatever just to stay alive in a situation where my abuser may very well kill me or send me to the hospital, but in a situation like mine, I just couldn‚Äôt make myself stfu even if I tried, lol. I didn‚Äôt enjoy the raging, beatings, the double dose of gaslighting, the reminders my very existence was a mistake and a burden, or being smear campaigned since I was in elementary school, but I hated walking on eggshells, living to cater to her emotions, the neglect and parent-child role-reversal, and the idea of taking decades of the abuse that still happened anyway so much more.

Also, the idea of allowing her to get away with abusing us - and on top of that alternating between playing the great mom and the victim, getting other people to blindly give her sympathy, support, and even admiration - while we (even my sibling, who was an angel as a kid) were neglected and punished for having basic needs and emotions, scolded by people who knew nothing for not making it easier for our mom, and I - joined by dad and whatever relative, authority, or acquaintance on rotation - was portrayed as the bad kid unless she felt like playing with her living doll or needed me for validation as the smart kid or some other bs. I felt like if that was normal, then the world sucked and justice wasn‚Äôt a thing, and I didn‚Äôt want that to be the case or to contribute to that. Not to mention, it felt like such self-abandonment. If even I didn‚Äôt think my sibling and I were worth standing up for or caring about, who would? 

So yes, less courage than instinct and impulse, I think. Though, frankly, I accumulated quite the collection of physical and emotional scars and trauma by ~~speaking~~ yelling up, sure, but I have no regrets about it and I still roll that way. I‚Äôm nowhere near the bad bitch I used to be as a small child, though, lol.

4. The same I handle the fear of performing in public, pubic speaking, exams, or my lowkey social anxiety, tbh. I try to put things into perspective and stay conscious of what‚Äôs anxiety and what‚Äôs a reasonable concern, first and foremost. Then, for the latter I try to stay on top of things, take precautions when possible and (objectively or subjectively) needed, and for both I work on myself and occasionally go to therapy (should be more than occasional, working on it) to work out anxieties, trauma, attachment issues, trust issues‚Ä¶ 

Also, sometimes I‚Äôve come to terms with the notion that it‚Äôs just about accepting what I can‚Äôt control, setting myself up for success, and then approaching it like you‚Äôd do jumping off a really high diving board if you really had to: dissociate away before your fears can stop you, and once you‚Äôre in the air, your survival instinct has every reason to shift the focus away from possible threats and towards the present moment.

"yakuzagames","t5_2xx8w","It's pretty good, if not a little rushed due to the weird development cycle for Gaiden 

The lip flaps weren't reanimated like in LAD or IW, making it closer to the Judgment games in that regard 

That said I do think everything gave a solid performance, with Shishido and Nishitani's VAs being standouts for me 

I also think Kiryu's english VA did a good job here, notably an emotional scene by the end that solidified that I think the choice of VA for him is something I like, as you said it's mainly something you'd get used to over time 

Notably there was a lot of doubt that Yong Yea could even *touch* upon that scene since Takaya Kuroda killed it and then some, but I don't think that's *entirely* fair since Kuroda has been voicing Kiryu since 2005, making it feel very personal, but in the end he did great there imo 

But yeah, overall I think Gaiden's dub is pretty good if not a little weaker than LAD/IW's due to the weird development cycle (Gaiden was developed after IW, and Gaiden's dub was added in a patch a month later)",1719792019.0

You can adjust your witholdings easily. Be careful that it can often take months to take effect. It also can be a little tricky to figure out what dependent adjustments really equate to dollar-wide, but the info is out there. I used to ratchet up the dependents and then control the amount withheld using an actual dollar amount of extra money to be withheld. These are the usual options on the W4.

The IRS has rules that inhibit back-ending your payments. They check things on a quarterly basis. See [https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/irs-letters-and-notices/guide-to-irs-tax-penalties-how-to-avoid-or-reduce-them/L7Unetw5B](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/irs-letters-and-notices/guide-to-irs-tax-penalties-how-to-avoid-or-reduce-them/L7Unetw5B)  
  
The requirements to avoid penalties are that you pay:

* **90% of the tax you owe for the current year.**¬†[Estimate what you'll owe](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/calculators/taxcaster/)¬†and pay at least 90% of this amount by making timely quarterly estimated tax payments or through paycheck withholding.
* **100% (or 110%) of last year's tax bill.**¬†Pay 100% of the tax shown on your prior-year tax return before applying estimated payments, withholding, or refundable tax credits. If your adjusted gross income is more than $150,000 (or $75,000 if you're married and file a separate return from your spouse), the safe harbor is 110% of your prior-year tax.

So, tweak your withholdings to accomplish either at year end and you're safe from penalties. Presuming your income increases some every year, Hitting the 100% (or 110%) of last year's target should make you safe from penalties and a liitle in the red on taxes (i.e., no loan to Uncle Sam).",1719792019.0

That article also called out the other Chinese people on the bus for not intervening. It was very clearly written from a CCP perspective.

It was so bad it initially had me questioning the veracity of the incident. I'm glad the Herald have confirmed with Police that an investigation is taking place. No matter what may have been said to this woman, that kind of violent outburst is unacceptable.",1719792020.0

"FemdomCommunity","t5_2whne","As a proDomme spanning many years, I literally was professionally dominating pre-backpage era, pre social media, pre everything as we know it today... I can appreciate how people are feeling losing a platform that had been very user friendly and profitable and easy to market to a wide range of people without having to carry the weight of trying to get the world to your online store as etsy has a proven reputation and their ability to bring buyers to you has been fairly successful. I know how it feels to have your maketing platforms disappear overnight. Being a proDomme,  we have our own stigmas, even within the kink community we are not welcomed, and deal with alot unacceptance in the BDSM lifestyle and community. But it also has given me alot experience finding RESOURCES for marketing. Unfortunately as ONLINE PLATFORMS SUCH AS TUMBLR, IG, FACEBOOK, ETSY, EROS, BACKPAGE, COLLARME/SPACE, TIKTOK HAVE ALL DECIDED TO BAN ADULT EVERYTHING IT MEANS YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND YOUR NICHE PLACES TO MARKET YOURSEF. 

#1 Fetlife.com  (I understand many people think Fetlife is not THE place for kinky everything BUT it really is, I've been on fetlife almost 20yrs and  the platform is still going to be your BEST place to reach KINK, BDSM, FETISH, ALL AGES, ALL DEMOGRAPHICS... WITH THE LARGEST POPULATION OF HUMANS THAT WILL WANT WHATEVER YOU ARE SELLING ... IF ITS ITEMS THAT WILL APPEAL TO KINK COMMUNITY. But there is a caveat. You need to understand how to use the platform and that in itself is the issue with many people. How the fuck do you get anywhere on fetlife?I feel the resistance as Im typing this, sorry folks but it is honestly one of the best places to promote your artisan and handcrafted adult and sex specific things n stuff. 

#2 Discord is another platform that the kink community has decided to utilize, but im too old to figure out that community. My brain can not grasp how to navigate that platform but the younger generation and gamers have zero issues and have built thriving groups on that platform. 

#3 After those 2 places this man has developed a very solid reputation marketing to the kink, sex, adult industries as a whole. He has a very very useful RESOURCES  section on his website thats free and easy to access but it will require some research on your end to find the possible places that may be your  bets to market and promote whatever you are selling on ETSY... somewhere else. 

SEXYNETWORKING.COM - DIRK HOOPER

UNFORTUNATELY IT WONT BE  THE EASY ALTERNATIVE RESOURCE FOR EVERYONE WHO ISNT WILLING TO DELVE INTO ALL THE VARIOUS SITES AND SIFT THRU ALOT OF THE WEBSITE LINKS TO FIND THE NICHE PLATFORMS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND A BIG DRAW OF PEOPLE AND HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR YOU TO MARKET YOUR THINGS N STUFF ON. 

Good Luck to ALL I hope this helps a few of you find new places for you to sell your beautiful stuff!",1719792020.0

"Appliances","t5_2rxfl","Long time Cafe Fridge french door owner (not happy) here.

I would check the filter - that it's inserted right (it's very easy to get wrong). Ours will take quite a few large glasses - I think it's at least 6, before it's happy. The first 2 or 3 glasses have filter components in them - it as that gets out of the system it eventually switches to normal - ie. the red ""flush"" message disappers. No big fanfare, message etc - it just happens. 

I would not be surprised if your fridge has a board issue, but if it's functioning it's basically one of those two - bad/wrongly inserted filter or it's done but you haven't noticed it :D  We've only used official GE branded filters - they all come with a RFID strip that I think is used by the control system to see if the filter is in the right way and if it's ""original"" and the right model. I don't know if things work if you remove that - but that may be something to look for?

The UI is horrific on these fridges. Being color blind I hate the fact that it's a color I need to look for, although having replaced the filter many many times by now, I know the process when I replace the filter. It doesn't warn you that when you insert a new filter, the first ""purge"" cycles shoots out water very fast as it pushes the air through the line and whatever water was in the line to the dispensor goes out with a ""bang"" - you will get wet (not much but you will get wet).",1719792024.0

"Eldenring","t5_122hf1","Copy from my comment in other thread:

I loved the DLC through and through, with the exception of Consort Radahn, all the other bosses are harder than most of the bosses in previous games, but they were still fair and fun to fight and learn.

But then comes Radahn, I beat him after 70 attempts and, for the first time facing a difficult boss in a From game, the only thing I felt was relief. I made it through the first phase almost flawlessly, only getting hit when I was pushing for one attack more.

But then came the second phase and it was complete bullshit, mainly because of Miquella's hair and the Pillars of Light, these two things made the fight a shitfest for me, because half the time I couldn't tell what was happening on my screen, even more so because my main strategy was to use the Deflecting Hardtear.

Not to mention the bullshit Right Handed -> Left Handed -> X slash move.

I hope that over time this bossfight will grow on me, but for now I really disliked it and it isn't comparable with Malenia, Messmer, Gael, Artorias and so on.",1719792024.0

Kix really engaged with the audience but Ronnie, barely.  Seemed more into the other band members.  Glad I'm not the only one.

title. ate something fucked yesterday and have been dealing with vomiting, nausea, horrendous stomach cramps, and diarrhea today. the vomiting and nausea have died down, stomach cramps fluctuate based on how much paracetamol i‚Äôve taken and diarrhea does not end. 

i have a fucking 17 hour total journey (3.5 hours on one plane then 13.5 hours on another after a layover) tomorrow and i am shitting bricks and i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a good idea to go. i don‚Äôt know if i should just suck it up, or if 17 hours on a plane with food poisoning is a recipe for disaster, especially when my parents couldn‚Äôt book me an aisle seat. i‚Äôm also genuinely terrified of flying and have consistent p4n1c attacks every time i fly on a plane, especially long haul + am also flying alone. would it be worth trying to alter the flight to one in a few days time?

""Why do you need to make someone a partner/have equity?""

I want the person invested in the company and I want to do right by them. I want them to want the company to succeed. I don't want to have to keep finding people to do the work. HawkFan said above that was the biggest pain in his house cleaning business. Ideally, I would have some sort of vesting period. So, they get 5%-10% every 5 years till they reach 20% equity. Something like that. I have a family friend in mind. He is young, hard-working, and great with his hands. But, he is limited on the finance, advertising, etc... side. I think we would complement each other well.

Arizona is a beautiful place and we get a lot of pictures here (especially of sunsets). So we ask that all pictures include the subject and location taken in the title.

The proper thing to do in that situation would have been to knock a few times, call again, see if you woke up. If you don‚Äôt, you don‚Äôt! They can leave a message or a text saying that plans changed and they‚Äôll be at this location until about this time, love for you to join us when you‚Äôre awake!

I know this is out of the ordinary, but I will not be writing a lengthy treatise today. Rather, in honor of all the players who played the Games ‚Äútheir way‚Äù this month, particularly Cowzilla3, enndeegee, and alg82, [I‚Äôve recorded a little song](https://on.soundcloud.com/VZh922yUmWrKPnpe7) (which I‚Äôm amazed Crisp_Mango didn‚Äôt parody last year). Lyrics are below, for those who need them or prefer not to listen.

All products today are from different countries, and none from United States of America (where I live). They are each denoted by their according flag emoji, but to make sure it‚Äôs clear, in order of product listed: [China](https://i.imgur.com/h7aRzL6.jpeg), [Germany](https://merkurshave.com/merkur-safety-razor-34c-straight-guard-german-9034001/), [Turkey](https://thesuperiorshave.com/product/lord-double-edge-razor-blades/), [Canada](https://henrietvictoria.com/pages/contact), [Italy](https://www.italianbarber.com/products/razorock-mudder-focker-after-shaving-splash), [France](https://usa.essentialparfums.com/products/orange-x-santal/).

Now, for my final trick, I convince the djudges and wally that my shave has a thematic thread that ties it together, beyond meeting the challenge. Amande is a take on the classic almond shaving soap a la Cella, and presents as an almond biscotti which has been soaked in American bright red maraschino cherry juice. It‚Äôs a kick in the face, and hardly mellows upon lathering. Now, what to follow this up with? Well, thinking about what Cella believes you should pair with their soap, an aromatic aftershave seemed appropriate. With clear culinary and citrus top notes, Mudder Focker blends surprisingly well with the maraschino note, before it takes over entirely. Now, what‚Äôs weird about Mudder Focker is that it‚Äôs [allegedly a dupe](https://www.thirstybadger.ca/shaving-fragrance-homage/) of Panama 1924 by Boellis. If that‚Äôs the case, it seems to be a‚Ä¶creative take. I haven‚Äôt smelled Panama 1924 before, but the internet tells me that there‚Äôs either an almond note or a tobacco flower note, neither of which show up in this splash. The former would have likely been more welcome than the latter, in this scenario. [I maintain that the folks at Cella were out of their gourds when they decided to make such different and not-very-complementary scents.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1d7q3nw/comment/l73qxuj/) Though Orange x Santal might not be what I would typically spray on after such a sweet almond soap, it‚Äôs a perfect addition to today‚Äôs splash. The sandalwood is a clear connection here, along with the herbal notes which drift around in the background, while the bitter orange is a fun, bright, complex yet simple ending to this fragrance journey. #FOF

**And with that, I bid you all adieu.**

We had our fun, with all the blather
We shaved ourselves each day
No care for formatting the right way
And more, much more than this
We did it our way

Good laughs, we‚Äôve had a few
Like when I skipped that challenge
We did what we wanted to
And skipped the points for hardware scavenge
No plan, no charted course
Each silly step, the game that I played
And more, much more than this
We did it our way

Yes, there were times, I‚Äôm sure you knew
When we broke the rules, formatting skewed
But through it all, when there was doubt
We lathered up and shaved about
We faced it all, and stood up tall
And did it our way

We‚Äôve loved, we‚Äôve laughed and cried
We‚Äôve had our fill, of memes and puns too
And now, as games subside
We find it all so damn amusing
To think we did all that
With no real goal, some others might say
We did what we felt like
We did it our way

For what is a shaver, what have they got?
If not their jokes, then they have naught
To spam the threads with shaving memes
And not just follow others‚Äô schemes
The record shows we took some blows
And did it our way",1719792027.0

"illustrativeDNA","t5_56k3f0","Firstly If you claim Ashkenazis to be native to Israel despite being not even half Levantine, then Palestinian Arabs are most definitely native, which debunks the entire premise of Zionism and the foundation of your terrorist country, because you have no basis to steal their lands and evict them from their homes. You people are so dumb it‚Äôs insane 
 I said most Jews world wide are Sephardi and/or ashkenazi, not within Israel so nice try changing the premise of the argument. Even then most Israelis aren‚Äôt mizrahi little bro I‚Äôve read that stat before and looked into it, North African Jews were classed as mizrahi even though they‚Äôre mainly Sephardis. Most modern Israelis are some form of mixture of all the 3 groups. 
 Mizrahis aren‚Äôt the closest to ancient Israelites (I spoke about Roman era Levant as that‚Äôs when your cult claims you were exiled from Israel so nice try changing it again). Mizrahis are a massive umbrella term, Iranian, Bukharian, Yemeni and Iraqi Jews aren‚Äôt closer to ancient Israelite samples than modern Arab levantines. The closest modern group are Samaritans followed by Christian Arab Levantines. Even Muslim Arab Levantines derive most of their ancestry from the natives of the region, with mild additional input from Africa. Again, all of this can be backed by actual scientific evidence and research, so you can cry and deny it all you want.",1719792027.0

"ezraklein","t5_3e6fz","Speaking as somebody who was also surprised at Biden‚Äôs debate and pushing for Kamala Harris to step in, yes they do and that‚Äôs why they pushed Biden. Many of their lives were directly threatened on January 6th and they have been attacked by right wing extremists personally. Let me explain some of what I figure was their thinking:

- They wanted to consolidate quickly and keep a fundraising advantage for a longer time over Trump. They felt that Biden had done a good job as President basically until Oct 7th which split the party and its core activists. No primary means no criticism and no money spent.

- They probably didn‚Äôt know quite how bad Biden was and thought that SOTU Biden was closer to what they would see at the debate, so figured it‚Äôd go fine. 

- They did not want a long and bruising primary where Dems would attack the admin to end up in the likely position where the highest name ID candidate, VP Kamala Harris, wins. 

- Politicians tend to believe in sort of mythological concepts like ‚Äúincumbency advantage‚Äù and ‚Äúif you haven‚Äôt done something to make swing voters hate you, they will vote for you.‚Äù  

So better to minimize criticism and line up behind the guy who beat Trump before and didn‚Äôt seem to harm the party‚Äôs chances in 2022 than suffer all that. Now that Biden showed he may be personally making the situation worse, they‚Äôre considering alternatives.",1719792028.0

This was a body shop at a Honda dealership in Los Angeles. 

Our cars are unique and most mechanics will say that they can work on them, but there are nuances with the designs that I learned about with ownership. Is there a way for you to confirm the pump was replaced correctly (meaning the connections are tight and routed properly)? Also, are you the original owner of your QX70 S?

I‚Äôve had Costco batteries in my car since my first battery change. Sometimes I go through a battery once a year, but with the battery guarantees ‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs really no additional cost. 

My car is 20 years old and would rather work on it myself now than ~~trust~~ hope that the mechanic is competent and knowledgeable. I got a lot of knowledge about my model from the NICO forums back in the day.

Te dir√≠a que expliques la situaci√≥n que no ameritaba la multa, que era legible la patente y que al horario en el que pas√≥ todo no hab√≠a comercios para arreglar patente y que est√° de m√°s esa multa.

""God"" is not some supreme being on a throne. That just reflects the times in which many religious books were written. Kings and kingdoms and such. And battles.

There is but a single consciousness that powers all that you see around you. ""God"" is like the clay from which all of creation is made. The idea of a spiritual journey is when you come to the realization that there really is only one ""God"".

When the creator and created become one and the same. When your little raindrop of a soul hits the ocean it came from. Where did you go?

There is a convergence where the trauma to to a victim of statutory rape is the same as rape which is why laws are in place. Statutory rape by it's arbitrary nature also criminalises  between someone 17 and 11months and someone 18 even though people develop maturity at different rates.

"AmITheDevil","t5_27t6v0","OMG..... I \*wish\* I had dumped someone I was with because his friends were such garbage. No, I don't want to be friends with them (as he tried to encourage me), and BTW they're rude to me. But far be it from me to to force someone to ditch their friends.

If you put up with 'friends' being shit people, don't expect others to be okay with it. I don't wanna say that you have an ultimatum-- your friend or your girlfriend-- but she has her choices to make, and so do you. 

If OOP can accept being a bystander and tolerating his friend being a creep, you can bet that Jessica is going to be thinking of a LOT of scenarios. OOP might consider himself a decent person, not sexist, someone who would make the right choices in any situation. He might think that the friend is harmless because it's just words. But are are so many unsettling what-ifs. 

If I were Jessica, I would worry about how things would go if I stayed with OOP. That friend would be making commentary about me behind my back. If I had a disagreement with my BF, that friend might have some rude stuff to say about me. If he got married or went on dates, that friend my make comments about how I look. Or he might try messing with my friends. I would consider him a toxic jack-in-the-box and wonder what shit he's going to pull next. 

OOP's friend doesn't respect other people. OOP might think he's better than that, but it's not enough to just passively not do or say the bad things. You also have to call it out when you see it, and not tolerate racism, sexism, or anything else. Not being friends with someone like that is the least I would expect from my partner. 

Seriously, people put up with way too much shit in the name of not being lonely or cast out. But we can just as easily front-load the expectations of respect and doing the right thing, more or less force each other to become better people, and then form friendships that reinforce positive personality traits. We can be good people and not be lonely-- we need to all collectively shut down the acceptance shitty people in the name of not being lonely.",1719792029.0

The one thing that really helped me break my sugar addiction was taking food grade diatomaceous eart (FGDE). Sold on Amazon or pet/tractor supply stores.

Just a TINY pinch in my morning coffee. (Be careful, if you take too much you will get sick. Keep Activated Charcoal capsules on hand to minimize side effects.)

After taking DE everyday for about 1-2 months, I was able to regain some willpower and quit my daily soda drinking. Small, but meaningful achievement for me.

I flexed my newfound willpower in the grocery store aisles, by walking right past the ice cream. I didn‚Äôt buy easy-access sugar, like candy & granola bars. Instead of buying Doritos, I bought nuts.

By 3 months of FGDE, I noticed I was thinking about food less often & not craving sugary junk. I paid attention to my body & only ate when I was genuinely hungry. The longer I went without sugar, the easier it became for me to make smarter food choices.

I stopped nighttime snacking. My goal was to only eat when the sun was out. (Timed eating.) 

I lost about 5-7 lbs with DE & timed eating. I learned about it from a Facebook group, can‚Äôt remember the name but just search for Diatomaceous Earth (might be a DE/Borax group). Moderator is named Neil & he has the best links to info.

 I‚Äôd send you a link but I‚Äôm no longer on FB. I flexed my willpower (to stop wasting time scrolling) & deleted my account!",1719792029.0

"Habs","t5_2r10m","This was one of the worst draft for the Q in ages, and outside of Justin Poirier who slid down I don't feel like we had any Q pick available/relevant for any of our picks. So why ask the question when it was literally never a realistic probability for a team looking to compete at some point in the future?

They ask this question ( which isn't one, it's simply criticism) every single year regardless of the Q players available and their slot related to habs picks, and when habs pick quebecers in later rounds then the discourse is ""this is simply whitewashing"" instead. So sorry but I absolutely understand Lapointe getting real tired of this comment.

By the time he found them, each and every Primarch was, at best, severely weakened for the role he wanted them in, and at best completely ruined.

"uscg","t5_2rcfq","It looks like you're looking for information about joining the Coast Guard. There are a very high volume of these posts on a regular basis so they are restrcited to the Weekly Recruiting Thread at the top of the sub. Members of the Coast Guard are responsible for attempting to find the information they need before they ""ask a Chief"". Do your best to use the resources that have been created for people like to you answer your query before you ask a potentially redundant question on our sub. It will also prepare you for the culture of our service. 

Before you post your question, please start by checking out the [Coast Guard Recruiting Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.gocoastguard.com/faq) page. 

Try using the [Sub-Reddit search bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/uscg/search?q=&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all) to find threads with questions similar to yours. People have provided thoughtful responses and links that you'd likely want to see. 

Our Recruiting Corps uses [this manual](https://media.defense.gov/2018/May/16/2001917927/-1/-1/0/CIM_1100_2F.PDF) to do their job. Try giving it a search (download it and use contrl-f to search) to see if your situation has been outlined. Coast Guard manuals are often easy to read and understand. Your question in the Recruitng Thread will be much more likely to get an answer if you mention that you've read the manual and is framed around a specific situation outlined in it. 

Finally, if you've exhausted the above, post your specific question in the [Weekly Recruiting Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/uscg/search?q=Weekly+Recruiting+Thread&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all). General quesitons will get general answers. Try and be specific. It's better to add a comment with many, specific items that you want answered than to ask a simple ""what's life like at a station for a non-rate""? type query. 

Good luck on your recruiting journey. The Coast Guard is an excellent career full of opportunity.

"AirConditioners","t5_2w26a","Thank you very much for the excellent reply. Covered all the questions I had and provided some great suggestions. Finally measured the actual dimensions of the unit and it's 18.5"" w x 12"" h. Not sure how large the hole in the wall is (under the moldings) but you're right that Friedrich had some great small options.

`Current (w/h,"") : 18.5 x 12.0`  
`Friedrich Chill : 19.3 x 14.0`  
`Friedrich Kuhl  : 20.0 x 14.5`  


I'll talk to the landlord and see what he'd like to do (open the wall, chip in $ for a sliding window unit, etc). He's currently trying to remodel his own house nearby but work has been stopped due to a missing permit... Maybe once he gets that cleared up and gets his work crew back working, he'd let them install a standard TTW unit with a quality slide-out sleeve for easier maintenance/upgrades in the future.

Sealing the rest of the house better (weather stripping around doors, etc) and cleaning the ac unit's outside vents seemed to help a bit but in addition to being generally weak, the ac's radiator will sometimes freeze up, turning into a giant ice block and I'll have to turn off the ac while I wait for that to thaw.

Thanks for suggesting casement/sliding window units. I did see a few decent options there though they're definitely pricier per BTU. There's a sliding window in the room with a width around 17"" that could work. Shame about the lack of standard up-down opening windows. I would have liked to try the new [**Midea U**](https://www.amazon.com/Midea-Inverter-Conditioner-Flexibility-Installation/dp/B08677DCKN) w/ inverter - that looked like a *cool* option. Too bad the ac units don't work turned on their side. :(

If the landlord doesn't want to open the wall or chip $ in for a casement/sliding unit, maybe I'd look for a dual-hose and inverter portable unit like the [**Midea Duo**](https://www.amazon.com/Midea-Efficiency-Inverter-Conditioner-Assistant/dp/B0D52LSR1V), especially since electricity is included with the rent here (they don't have the separate units metered so they can't charge us specifically).  
  
Best wishes Vtgac, thanks again for the confirmation - I doubt even the landlord himself would have remembered what kind of unit was installed.",1719792032.0

"RandomThoughts","t5_2rka3","My first love, 4 years together, engaged. 

‚ÄòYou lost a once in a lifetime kind of love, and so did I. You broke the heart of a man who loved you more than he loved himself, who lived for you.. You were always going to do this to me. It‚Äôs in your blood, not mine. And you‚Äôre always going to do this, to anyone who loves you.‚Äô

I‚Äôm seeing comments from people who were blindsided or hurt by someone they loved, when they didn‚Äôt deserve it. Not the case here. I hurt him very badly and took no accountability for it until it was too late. Other issues in the relationship and his own faults didn‚Äôt matter because my actions overshadowed everything else. 

This was years ago and that break up forced me to change my life in ways I never thought possible. I‚Äôm healthy now, I‚Äôm happy but it was a long, difficult journey getting here. A lot of guilt, a lot of regret. I look back at it now and cannot comprehend how I could treat another person that way. It was a very hard lesson to learn and it came at a great cost, a great loss and a lot of pain at the time. I learned a lesson though, and even though I hate that it happened the way it did, I try to be grateful that it forced me to course correct. 

But for a while those words haunted me because I was terrified that he was right. That I would ‚Äòalways do this because it‚Äôs in my blood‚Äô. 

I‚Äôve been with my current partner for 2 years now, we‚Äôre building a life together and I would honestly rather drop dead than be so cruel to him.",1719792032.0

Your MIL has the expectation of being a third parent to your kid, like she has a say in this.

Since he was born, she has had rage filled tantrums  over boundaries over the safety of your kid. And my guess is that ANY BOUNDARY set either has or will result in the same rage filled tantrums.  She refuses to spend time with your kid at your home and only wants sleepovers at her house.

She demands to have your kid alone.

Why?  Cause she can't parent your kid and do things her way, if you are there.


Mom to mom, do we reward our toddlers' tantrums? Nope. So why do you guys put up with what I would call complete and total disrespect of your roles as parents and perfectly reasonable safety measures?

Actions have consequences.  For every rage filled tantrum a consequence must be enforced.  The best consequence is a time out and any further contact will resume when she takes accountability and changes her expectations.


Don't be scared of her.  This is the thing, she has likely always had rage filled tantrums to get what she wants, people cave as they get scared and don't want to set her off.

YOU, YOUR HUSBAND, NOR YOUR CHILD ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR MILS FEELINGS, NEEDS and EMOTIONS.

If she flips out and has another tantrum, you either hang up the phone or get up and walk out.  So what if she gets upset?  It's a her problem not a you problem.  This has been going on for 2 years not 2 weeks.",1719792032.0

No taking baby and turning baby away from Mommy, no leaving the room with baby for ""alone"" time. No pop in visits ""just for a minute""  No ""well when I had my kids...."" crap.

Ok how do I keep these plants alive. Deeply researches aquatic plant care. Wow aquascaping is kinda interesting. Two months and lots of money later had a huge tank filled with various ever more difficult varieties of plants with co2 systems and high end lights and timers. All for my $5 betta who lived like a king lol. Similar for non aquatic plants. Went from a pothos and trying to figure out how to keep an orchid alive to a mini jungle with lots of ever harder varieties.

I liked the fight itself, though I am a bit dissapointed. I agree that there is a lot of shit to dodge in P2. At some point I recognized how to somewhat deal with most of the stuff, but a lot of the time it involved tanking some damage while dodging the rest. (still don't know how to consistently dodge all the meteors though, or the second meteor tornado sequence.) I used the Carian Thrusting Shield with Carian Phalanx AoW. Great for tanking a bit of damage while simultaneously poking him. Gotta watch out for the stamina though.No summons. I ended up killing him at half HP and no pots left.
My biggest problem with the boss is the lore. I see it as an enormous missed opportunity that is honestly kind of mindboggling to me. Would have been interesting as a second-to-last boss (P1 at least), but I was really hoping to fight Godwyn, especially with the lore connections from the base game.

And take it seriously, not ""oh yes! I will do this.. tomorrow!"" 

Here are at least key things I think of.  

1.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†You need complete full determination. One must do a great deal of effort (big extremes is what I'm getting at) to himself to stop sin. It is like a cancer. You do not treat a cancer with a nap and cough syrup. With deadly diseases, powerful remedies are necessary.  Do your maximum in every way, and treat it like the most important thing, embracing great sacrifice. Hence, you must hate the sin truly, fully, and fully entirely.



2.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Make a new prayer life. Give thanks to God always, and turn always. Give Him thanks in the morning, and praise Him in the day. Speak and seek Him constantly. Without constant prayer, I cannot imagine any great chance of success. From St. Alphonsus: ""St. Paul tells us, that we have to contend not with men like ourselves.... but with the princes of hell.... By these words he wishes to admonish us that we have not strength to resist the powers of hell, and that, to resist them, the divine aid is absolutely necessary: without it, we shall be always defeated; but, with the assistance of God‚Äôs grace, we shall, according to the same apostle, be able to do all things and shall conquer all enemies. ‚ÄúI can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.‚Äù (Phil. iv. 13.) But this assistance God gives only to those who pray for it. ‚ÄúAsk, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find.‚Äù (Matt. vii. 7.) They who neglect to ask, do not receive. Let us, then, be careful not to trust in our resolutions: if we place our confidence in them, we shall be lost. ""

Have you heard of the Rosary? It is an incredible prayer that helps us grow in worship of God, I cannot recommend it enough and I would love to help you with it if you haven't! 

Practically, fasting and exercise are very helpful I've heard.


As a Catholic, I really recommend that if you want personalized help, talk to a Catholic priest",1719792034.0

"flying","t5_2qm1t","If you were to start gliding now in July, you'd immediately start flying gliders dual with an instructor.  The instructor would tell you what you needed to know.  Glider training moves ahead much faster than airplane, on the first flight you rest your hands feet lightly on the controls and you follow the inputs that the instructor is making during aerotow close to the ground.  Once you get about 1000 AGL, the instructor will let you take the controls.  The instructor sits behind you and 'guards' the stick/rudder to keep you from making too big of wrong inputs.  Similar approach with landing, but the instructor will verbally coach you and may take the controls if it's windy or sinky.

Ground school is not a big deal for PPL airplanes or glider.  Many people do it without any classroom time, either videos and/or book.  Having good independent study skills is important throughout a pilot's career because there's always new stuff to learn.

>If I finish the [2-3 lessons a week over 4-8 months without any breaks]

As I mentioned before, the season is short.  Most glider training happens June-August when youngsters are not in school.  Glider clubs are weekends only and the weather has to cooperate.  There are a handful of commercial glider flight schools that try to fly 7 days a week, but weather has to cooperate.  Very few people rush glider training because there's no race to getting a job.  The emphasis is on having fun.  My club has a bunch of high school age students who enjoy training with people their own age.  At the end of the day, they also fly their RC planes at the field.  They're all 'aircraft nerds' so they've 'found their tribe' at the airport and have a good 'friend group'.

>would there be any opportunities for me to do anything afterwards, being before I turn 16?

If you're talking about airplane training, the answer is no.  This 'waiting around for your birthday' is why starting airplane training at 14 is not a great idea.  And some 14 y.o.'s body and brain need another year or two of growing before they can really get the full benefit from costly flight training.  We often need to delay first solos because our young students still have some teen traits that they will outgrow in a year or two.  For example, 'poor impulse control' is pretty normal for age 14, but it makes a 14 y.o. not ready for solo (even though the FAA allows it if the instructor gives the solo endorsement).  By 16, you're more likely ready to have those 'dangerous attitudes' in check and be ready to be PIC (Pilot in Command).",1719792035.0

"australian","t5_2qmdy","Wait who's arguing to increase immigration?

I'm a leftie and havent seen anyone arguing this. And I fucking hate this idea that the only reason we have so little ourselves because of immigration and foreign aid.

What about the fact that 33% of houses are currently owned by investors?
Or the fact that our public healthcare has been steadily declining over the past 40 years and is no longer free.
Or that we have record numbers of private and Catholic schools, and worse outcomes in public schools then ever before.
Or the fact that the opposition government is pushing nuclear power against the advice of every expert who has done analysis.
Or the fact that wealth inequality and the gap between the median wage and the average wage are the largest it's even.

Sure, immigration can affect some of those things. But blaming it as a major factor in any of them is exactly what the government pushes because its a simple answer we have been buying for the last 40 or 50 years as every one of those issues has gotten worse.
It's the immigrants, no it's the chinese, no it's the Muslim or maybe those African Gangs we were so scared of.

Or how about it's the fucking rich cunts that run the country who are in bed with the event richer cunts that don't want to give up a cent or their unearned wealth. I'm talking about the people who will passively, as in without lifting a finger to contribute a single thing to society, generate more wealth in a single year than you could earn in your entire lifetimes of working yourself to the bone.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","If I'm not mistaken, the IFAB agrees. I believe they are trying to revise the rule so that as long as SOME part of the attacker is behind the last defender, they will still be considered offsides. This will give attackers CONSIDERABLY more advantage when it comes to passing into open space behind the back line, and I think this could potentially have huge implications for football as a sport.

Games will have many more goals, and I think it could even usher in an era of ultra-high goal-scoring as we have never seen in the modern era of football.

A rule change like this HAS to be taken with a grain of salt, however. Defensive efforts will become significantly less efficient than they are now, and teams will start to shift toward quick offense with a weaker defense, and who knows how much that can change the beautiful game.",1719792037.0

"IncelExit","t5_26rn4p","No, I guess not. I thought that friends did talk about sex and that there were situations like FwB's or couples introducing 3rds, maybe I overestimated the likeliness or those events.

I think part of that is because I triggered and upset when single people talk about doing those kind of things. Getting their cake and eating it too. Being single to them means all the positives of being single while also enjoying having their needs taken care of via sex and companionship.

Which makes me upset because it feels deeply unfair to me. Everyone else gets to enjoy these fun things with others, everyone else gets to experience that intimacy. No one is entitled to anyone and I sure as hell am not entitled to a relationship just because I really want one. But I'm still single and I've never even had a relationship. I'm 34, that's going to be considered extremely weird to a lot of people. I matched with someone on Bumble a few weeks back and when she asked about my dating history, she was floored when I told her the truth. Practically grilling me because to her that was such a strange thing to hear. Because sex and dating is just a normal part of everyday life. 

Obviously, that didn't work out.

I just feel frustrated how my circumstances and my life has given me so many obstacles to overcome and I just never feel like I'm good enough for anyone to date. I don't match up with other guys who are taller, more masculine, more fun and more positive. But I'm not exactly a feminine man either. I just don't fit any particular sort of box, I don't have any of that.   
  
I don't feel tall enough, skinny enough, handsome enough, and no I'm not a ray of sunshine. Of course I'm not, I'm deeply unhappy and I feel like I've had to deal with a lot of extremely painful events and conversations that deeply hurt me and never had any closure on.  
  
A partner will not fix this. No one really can, and I think that's what scares me the most. I don't feel like I can ever come back from this kind of hurt and this kind of painful loneliness that I've endured.  
  
I'm scared of forever having to miss out on love, connection, joy, fun and a sense of personal fulfillment. Like life just decided for me that I will not get what I want, I'll never be happy and to just accept whatever little scrapes of things to feel gratitude over.

cats want to scratch and they *will* so you need the appropriate places. multiple scratching posts because cats are lazy and don‚Äôt want to go to another room to scratch sometimes. you don‚Äôt need one in every room but maybe at least 1 per floor. 

now here is how i‚Äôve trained all of my cats not to scratch and trained my parents cats out of doing it and it‚Äôs so simple.

if they do start to scratch your couch, calmly grab them and take them to the scratching post. scratch with your own hands and they will copy you. if they don‚Äôt seem to be taking to it, rub catnip on the post and they will instantly become interested. I have posts and I have a floor board scratcher that my cat really loves. sometimes they want to scratch in a different way. they will try to scratch your rug and so I do the same thing of picking him up and taking him to the board scratcher

my cats of course still try to do it a little but it‚Äôs mostly when people come over because they like to show off. that‚Äôs when I shoot them a look and they‚Äôll go to their scratchers",1719792039.0

"nuzlocke","t5_2setk","I'll add more to the list later but I think its an alright tier list. There are some...interesting picks.  
  
Underrated Mons:  
  
Starmie not being in S tier is criminal. It is easily the second best if not best pokemon in the game. Starmie has incredible coverage, a solid type combo for this game, psychic is dumb in this gen/region, has access to recover, and its bulk is good enough to dodge a crit or avoid 2hko range.

Jolteon also has a good argument for being in the bottom of S tier because its fast, strong, and has a surprisingly diverse move pool that can help against mons that are physcially frail (Bite can potentially OHKO/2hko psychics and ghost types. Double kick can eliminate most trainer fodder normal types). Thunderbolt can also deal big damage to anything that does not resist or is immune to it.

After that I don't really agree think there are any mons that should be. Maybe vaporeon in A because it's pretty good against special attackers thanks to its 130 / 95 bulk and can learn ice beam with surf. If it got recovery it would be for sure S or A but the more I think about it's matchups the more I realize its matchups are mostly even except Giovanni and Blaine. Other waters are better.

  
Mons I think are too high in the tier list:

  
Gengar: I think Gengar is a great mon in terms of stats. It gets a lot of value out of Thunderbolt and Psychic but because it can't ohko alakazam with shadow ball (it's physical frlg and its a 50% roll with max iv, no evs, and neutral nature) I wouldn't recommend it. It's good against everything else but it requires a huge investment in using your only psychic TM that could be better utilized on Jynx or Starmie. I think it's top of A-tier considering everything it needs to do well in requires a ton of investment or gambling.

Scyther: It has potentially technician Aerial ace/ wing attack and that's it really :/. It's good against bruno and if you get a free SD you can bust Agatha and Lorlei. Lance is a bit tricky since his mons are pretty strong. Against everything else it has even or losing(Blaine). I think because of that fact it should be in B-tier.

Venusaur: I like the guy and normally I pick him because he makes early game FRLG easier and has utility with sleep powder. After that he doesn't really contribute a ton in fights and doesn't have any super key winning matchups late game. Good grass type moves are also pretty rare outside of pedal dance which is a high commitment move. Overall I wouldn't rate him that highly. Definitely A-tier because sleep powder is a very good move. 

Zard: Probably lower in A-tier. Flamethrower is really good even vs neutral mons and its movepool is good enough to handle other late game threats.

Onix: Bro its onix he's doing no damage even against Blaine's team. He loses to everyone with his horrible typing and special defense. You put him at the bottom of D. 

Porygon: I don't really see the vision with porygon, his stats are pretty weak aside from his special attack-and that means he gets 2hkod or ohkod by a lot of pokemon. His movepool is pretty good tho i'll give him that.",1719792039.0

"FluentInFinance","t5_3qpaq8","That's not what my sailors complained about. They complained that they had to leave their wife and 2 kids in CT while they were living overseas because they got crap orders and not enough pay to live out in town, so one of my guys saw his kids 2 times over the 3.5 years he worked for me, and one of those times, my buddy and I split his plane ticket so that could happen. Another one had his first kid on the way, but couldn't afford a passport to fly back for the birth, so my boss bought it for him. Two of my sailors couldn't afford car insurance so they just hoped they didn't get caught coming onto base. Another one couldn't afford to feed his family unless they ate every single dinner at the base galley for over a year. Not one of the E5 or below sailors in my division on my last ship had a second car of any type. Two drove beaters that often broke down while we were out to sea. Other families took the bus if there was one because it didn't run early enough to get them us base in the morning. I've floated my sailors' phone bill and brought them groceries to fill an empty fridge on occasion. My predecessor hosted BBQs not because we like spending every minute together in port, but because 2 of his people overdrafted buying necessities for their families. The day I reported to my last ship, two of my people tapped out, quit, became suicidal because my predecessor was the only reason their family survived and they didn't want to risk that I wouldn't help them like he did. E4 over 4 years or married, that's the rule to request to live off base everywhere I was stationed.. otherwise, you live in the barracks and get no pay. If you're in base housing because you're married, the 'landlord' company takes the entire housing allowance, so you have no more money than a single 18yo living on base, but most have families to feed.

I know I tend to find some stuff pretty zappy through thin layers of cover, but don't have to wash off the cover after removing the thing to handle said cover without zap. Doesn't necessarily rub off on the material, just cloth is generally a weave so there's tiny holes all through it to expose me through.

Not that you can't be sensitive to pressure - especially if it's digging in, as bras that are slightly the wrong shape can do even in the right size (they get tilted slightly or sit lower than they're supposed to, both of which result in harder pressure localized to a spot) - I'm just used to the band being a lot more pressure than the wires are barring some really hunchy postures that I have to avoid anyways since they mess with my spine injury.


As long as you've got some options you're comfy with you're good though - most important part of fitting is your comfort, just the potential 'hey you might be allergic to this material' might come up again in some other context, e.g. metal rivets in some denim, metal zipper head touching your skin even if the zipper itself doesn't, cheap jewelry, so it's good to be aware of as a possibility before you get hit with prolonged exposure without a chance to change out of whatever.",1719792042.0

The few people who can get in really early tend to make a lot of money because of having so many people below them but the overwhelming majority of people in networking marketing don‚Äôt make any, or in fact lose, money.

According to an AARP survey, 25% of MLM participants said they broke even, and 50% said that they lost money. However, FTC places the numbers at even higher, saying that as high as 99% lose money. The chances that you will lose money increase the later into an MLM‚Äôs growth cycle that you join, and even the minority who make money often do so by influencing other people to join (of course, later than the original recruiter joined, therefore with worse odds of making money‚Ä¶)

I don't just dislike AW2 I also don't respect Remedy anymore after they sold out their a bunch of clowns and I'm glad AW2 didn't sell to theirs and Sony's expectations

My hope is (and so far true) that I can be out of apple in the short term and get better gains elsewhere because no one including myself is going to upgrade to an iphone 16 just for emojis and a better Siri when I can use websites/apps for that.  Additionally, doesn't seem like AI's coming to EU anytime soon either due to marketplace as you said.

We have your single values, strings, ints, floats.

Our singletons True, False, None.

A list (which is not precisely an array). 

Our hashmaps, set() and dicts. 

We can add more matrix style, and precision by importing things like numpy. 

What makes Python‚Äôs data sets powerful, yet sub optimal, is that everything is a reference in memory. In this way we don‚Äôt make arrays like int[], in which it‚Äôs a list that must be integers, which can be more memory efficient. That would be in ‚Äútype strict‚Äù languages. What this means for Python programmers‚Ä¶is a lot less work to do thing a bit slower, but easier to program, maintain and read. 

What‚Äôs in portent is we nest types, list[dict[str, list[int]] really easily and can automatically access everything. 

Beyond that we have classes, in which we can have an object with attributes set for us, this comes closer to a type, as we can methods or functions that use those datasets.

In either case, India is too big for America to sustain an alliance with, even after India's population also starts slowly declining around 2050. Our own experience with China shows us that the US shouldn't be feeding monsters more populous than itself.

"Portland","t5_2qi2i",">You're just ignoring buyer psychology in this analysis, and the realities of mortgage lending. 

That's exactly why a home with a built in tax advantage will see a corresponding increase in price.  Because at the end of the day, if you had two (imaginary) identical homes with two very different tax values, you will see a theoretical pool of bidders bid higher on the lower tax bill house. 

In a perfectly balanced market, which the factors you mentioned help enforce, the final monthly payment of the winning bid on both houses will be nearly identical (assuming they have the same mortgage rate and insurance costs on their identical homes), because economically it makes sense to overpay up to the exact amount you will save, excluding some margin, less for how unsure people are that the law will remain as it is, and more for the value of compounded savings (by starting with the lower rate the 3% annual increase will be less).

But, outside of that last point, it sounds like I may have been griping at you for a point you were not trying to make, so I apologize for that.

Never knowing why, and not being taught what to do to grow and improve myself; left me wide open to further trauma, because I was 'weird' and not like other girls.

So it doesn't make sense to impliment twice a month DM fair, for that reason, and then NOT let players get the full benefit of the main quests people care about each fair visit.

So either this is an oversignt and unintended. Or it is a huge troll.

"ftmspunished","t5_addfp","ALERT! Here are some common issues with comments that may result in removal. It is also solid advice and doing you a favor if you were planning on just sending a few characters in response. It‚Äôs not too late to edit!

 - Too little effort: only saying ‚ÄúDM me.‚Äù

 - Too little consent: introducing a new kink without asking, that the OP did not reference. Try to aim for what seems like is being asked for. With something like a humiliation flair, yes, misgendering or body-shaming can be part of humiliation, but you don‚Äôt want to assume if it‚Äôs not referenced by OP.

 - Here‚Äôs how to horny-comment just right: your comment should interact with the kink (post, title, flair) and person (user flair, profile). If you‚Äôd like to play in DMs, you may ask if they‚Äôd like to chat further, or go ahead and DM them if they don‚Äôt say not to in their post, pinned posts, or bio. The OP can and may also DM you themselves if they like your comment.

* The guy found Marco unconscious, never heard him say anything and immediately speaks Italian to Marco.

This is basically burying the idea that Argentina speaks Spanish (or Marco only Italian). Ex-post, I wonder why they did not simply mention that Marco learned some Spanish. Planning to go to Argentina would even have been a good reason to do so.
* Sixty kilometers ‚Äì tantalizingly close.
* Marco went from almost dead to happily walking on in 3 minutes of screen time. Not sure I like that.
* Random half deaf guy.
* He is setting up Marco‚Äôs next transportation!
* ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt had snow in years‚Äù ‚Äì so it was a freak occurrence. I wondered about how the snow got there.
* Last night before Tucuman? Understandable that Marco would be nervous.
* I wanted to make a point about Anna only worrying about Marco and not her other son ‚Ä¶ but I forgot his name, so I guess I am not one to talk.
* Dude, don‚Äôt scare Marco. Like any mother would forget her son. 
* Sugar cane ‚Äì stuff that made many people very rich and many many more had to work for it.

"lawschooladmissions","t5_2y2gn","I question if applying is the right choice all the time, practically every day 

I took my LSAT last year and got a score much higher than I was expecting. A lot of doors seemingly opened up and there was a lot of pressure to apply last fall, but I decided to give myself at least one year to decide if applying was the right thing for me. I've been very grateful for the extra time I've had to reflect on this decision 

Ultimately, it came down to this. I would regret not applying at all. There would always be a question of ""what if?"" Looming in the back of my mind. I've also worked for a bit after graduating undergrad and I understand that every job/career has its downsides and challenges. 

However, i always make sure to tell myself that i can apply and decide not to attend. If the numbers don't add up or i decide it isn't for me, then nobody is forcing me to go. There are plenty of other careers I can pursue and I'm young enough to pivot to something else if I need/want to. 

Take a deep breath, and maybe give yourself a year to think about it.  Law school isn't going anywhere and your LSAT score is valid for 5 years. That's a lot longer than you think tbh.",1719792047.0

"auckland","t5_2rd5j","I‚Äôd ask a few questions:

1) what‚Äôs the reasonable resale price for the car? How much work will it require to get to that - ie let‚Äôs say most Corollas of a similar year and mileage to yours are worth $5500. If yours comes with a bucket of issues, will you actually get $5500 for it? Probably not. Maybe you‚Äôll only get 3500. If you have to dump another 1500 into it for repairs, will you get that money back in a sale? 

2) Can you afford to move to a new car? Let‚Äôs say you want to have a budget of $10,000. Maybe you have 2500 cash, you can get a loan at a decent rate for another 2500 and you expect to sell your old car for $5000. Is all that realistic for you? If you don‚Äôt have much cash and you can‚Äôt sell your old car for $5000, then you‚Äôd have to finance a larger portion of a new car‚Äôs value. Right now is not a good time for taking out car loans - interest rates are crazy. 

3) This means you might get stuck at a common crossroads - waste more on a money pit of a car or take out an expensive loan to get a new car. The answer to this conundrum will rely heavily on your financial situation and your options - ie can you just sell the old car and go without for a few months while you save up for a new one? If not, can you keep the old car going at minimal cost? If you have a secure financial situation and some cash on hand, maybe look at an economical replacement to keep you going for a few years. It might not be the next car you‚Äôd hope you have but it could be a good economic stopgap.

Ultimately there‚Äôs a lot of other details that fall into place with cars - owner‚Äôs financial situation, owner‚Äôs options for alternative modes of transport, sentimentality, costs, financing prospects etc.",1719792047.0

We ourselves followed suit with that choice in each of our lives. We have goodness written on our hearts and each of us have chosen selfishness instead of obedience to the creator. The beauty of it though is that we have access to forgiveness at any point through surrender to the Father and he makes us completely clean.

"OpinionesPolemicas","t5_87u90z","Si, si es adoctrinamiento aun que no lo parezca. Es solo que para los que llevan a sus hijos a misa y los obligan a ser las siguientes rodillas ensangrentadas; o los llevan a colegios cat√≥licos donde las madres los adoctrinan en la f√©, lo ven m√°s como ""hacerle un bien a los ni√±os"" y como algo de tradici√≥n. Osea, ""si a mi me obligaron de j√≥ven a ir a la misa y creer en X f√© y sal√≠ bien, no veo por qu√© no se lo puedo aplicar a mis hijos"".


Pero con tu punto de lo LGBTQ+ depende. M√°s bien es que no es malo llevar a los ni√±os a, digamos, marchas o reuniones de estos grupos si no hay contenido inapropiado y solo es para convivir con amigos y familia... pero hay ciertas reuniones en las que se ve que cierta gente no tiene filtro en lo que les muestra a los ni√±os y no se les hace raro mostrar gente semidesnuda en cierta ropa o sin esta caminando aqu√≠ o ac√° con ni√±os presentes. Ahora, no me consta porque ni he ido a estas marchas ni he visto situaciones as√≠ en mi pa√≠s... pero recuerdo a un youtuber gay subiendo un video sobre marchas LGBTQ+ donde se ven videos de ni√±os cerca de gente que anda semidesnuda hasta bailandoles como si fuera un lap dance; o con juegos recreativos a base de juguetes sexuales. Y aunque el mismo youtuber y los comentarios mencionan que esos son casos aislados, no dejan de dar mal nombre a la comunidad (en especial porque hab√≠a gente en los comentarios, parte de la comunidad, admitiendo que eso era demasiado y que las reuniones a las que han ido si han sido aptas para todos y sin esa clase de cosas).


El punto es que la gente en general, da igual el lado al que pertenezca o las creencias que tenga, debe saber tener control en el material que les muestra a sus hijos ya que a la larga puede ser da√±ino; fuera del adoctrinamiento al obligar a los ni√±os a ir a ciertos lugares que no quieren ir o no deber√≠an por el material y su edad. Es como decirle a un padre que no deje al ni√±o todo el santo d√≠a viendo YouTube Kids, skibidi toilet o Baby Shark en los m√°s peque√±os, y que se dedique a educar a sus hijos en ves de dejar que otros lo hagan.",1719792048.0

"tabletopgamedesign","t5_2szh7","In my case, as I do coding, I started a game about combat between 2 capital ships as if it was a software. I started with the idea of having work allocation. I would have 100 crewmen. I wanted boarding ships and fighters as if it was Battlestar Galactica. Obviously it was very impractical for a board game.

I had to drop many ideas like monitoring if people get itired or get hungry, because it would happen if they have to stay for hours, but combat takes minutes.

In the end I needed 2 phases. One of worker allocation and one for all combat operations. Due to table space and player time constraints, crew would have 8 crewmen, and they would be chess pieces. 

A game like Starship Captains has a single strategy to win the game, go for missions.  In Monopoly there is a single strategy to win the game, hoard houses but never buy hotels.   I did not want that in my game.

So you can fire cannon turrets, send board parties, and send fighters.  3 ways to destroy the enemy ship,  But none of them are a winning strategy, as enemy can take countermeasures, but that requires to anticipate moves and it requires to stop doing things against the enemy.

I did the math to achieve balance. So there are 3 strategies when  attacking, but it also means you are not doing things to defend. To defend you need to stop attacking and defend, and that makes the attack last longer and lose efficiency in your use of resources.   If you do not defend, your ship gets damaged and even your attack is easier to disrupt in the right situations.  It can take a lot of damage, but it is not eternal. 

Is there luck? Yes and no. For direct fire, there is a simple system of cards, qhere each playes has 3 combat cards.. The mechanics is designed in a way that it does not feel like there is luck.

In the end, each capital ship has 2 cannons, 2 boarding ships, 2 fighters, 8 meeples where I use chess pieces for specialized work.  People do not die, they go to crew quarters.  So it is family friendly.  There is a chance crew can be injured during an attack, and one of the specialized jobs is doctor.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tabletopgamedesign/comments/16rh9sx/first_playtesting_prototype_of_the_game_i_created/) are some photos of my game.

So I started with incredible complexity, simplified, then defined turn phases, did math to balance strategies, and made this game full of trade offs. The final result is chaos because you do not have enough people do do everything you want and you cannot just execute plans without interruption because your opponent will make you choose..

Playtesting at home was amusing. I designed this game for myself, as I have no way to find a publisher or even a gaming fair. I live in a third world country where nothing happens.",1719792048.0

Only temporary, but nobody knows that when it happens for the first time! Fucking TERRIFYING. It is a very little understood syndrome that only occurs in psilocybe species that grow from wooden substrate like pine mulch, hence the name. Although mycologists are still only learning about this phenomenon, apparently there is an antidote or treatment. - Antihistamines. Okay, so I digressed from your O.P, but a couple times a year should make no noticeable difference.

I had an ex-husband and three kids but found my true partner and got re-married at the age of 34. He was an old best friend from middle/high school that I reconnected with so our adult time together was shorter to marriage than if he had been a total stranger, but I FULLY believe it is possible.

I went on a date the week before my now-husband confessed he had feelings for me and got along so well with the guy that he's actually remained an amazing friend, I got him connected with an animal place that he now got an amazing job at, and the three of us often hang out because we get along so well. If I wasn't already in love with my husband at the time of the date, I probably would've gotten together with this guy!

That is my personal take on it as an older gay man reflecting on who I was before and after I started dating other men.

Cleric *doesn‚Äôt* have aura obviously, and saying aura isn‚Äôt cracked would be disingenuous. 

Cleric also doesn‚Äôt have smite, which even with the nerfs is a good reason for Paladin to be up close and punch for a few digits when they need to.

What Cleric *does* have is boatloads of utility, party buffs that *aren‚Äôt* aura for days, and a comparable level of survivability. 

This isn‚Äôt even mentioning that Druid and bard can also fill similar roles, or that Ranger, EK, and various gish builds can still compete for melee half-caster flavor.

The issue isn‚Äôt that smite got nerfed, it obviously needed that. The issue is that it got nerfed enough that some identity got stripped away from the class and there are very clear and present alternatives that step on its toes now.

Once per turn would have been fine, or barring that, the old smite spells becoming the focus so that Paladin had an identity as the ‚Äúmelee debuff‚Äù class. The version of smite that got revealed just wasn‚Äôt what anyone wanted.",1719792053.0

"Feminism","t5_2qr7i","I'm going to be 100% honest here. I'm a 23 year old woman and only recently became a feminist. Warning: this rant is VERY long and I apologise in advance, but I really needed to get this off my chest and I've never told anyone about this. English is also not my native language, so I apologise for any mistakes or possible confusion.


I've been extremely fortunate to never have experienced an occurrence of sexism or misogyny before in real life, or maybe I have and I have forgotten or not realised, and I was one of those people who openly rolled her eyes and groaned whenever I heard or read anything about feminism, only thinking about the toxic, radical and misandristic examples that the internet and media loves to portray.


I honestly believed that people were just being dramatic or hated men for the longest time and I was sick of it and wanted nothing to do with anything related to feminism. However, that changed when I took an actual look at the world around me, as dramatic as that sounds and it changed everything.


This time, I didn't just look at my own little bubble. This time, I truly paid attention and did my reasearch on how women are still treated and oppressed in many countries, how they still have to fight for their rights to be seen as a person rather than an object to own and order around and all the absolutely vile, cruel and brutal crimes that people have committed against women and how nothing is being done, rather, it seems that the justice system, no matter where, is siding with the monsters instead of the victims and it was absolutely terrifying and infuriating.


I've also decided to take a closer look when people like Andrew Tate or ""Alpha Male"" podcasts popped up rather than scoffing and making jokes about it like I did before and the sheer amount of extreme misogyny I came across made me genuinely sick to my stomach and I started to see people like that everywhere on the Internet, no matter the site or the content, and this time I actively fought them, only to realise that nothing is being done against them and instead I was the one who was being jumped and insulted by other people and had my replies deleted, despite having been very careful to not let my anger take over and staying calm and inoffensive, while their extremely toxic, insulting and dehumanising comments stayed.


I was already fighting with depression and anxiety for many years now and going through a very hard time and now I was even more uneasy around other people than I was before and my trust issues only grew from there, especially around men. I've also come to realise just how influenced and male centered I've been for many years now.¬†


I still vividly remember how I very actively avoided and hated anything to do with femininity and saw it as weak, so I refused to wear any feminine clothing, make up, as well as any hobbies, themes, symbols or colors that are seen as girly and even only consumed media and music made by men and was very prejudiced whenever I saw women or girls anywhere, whether in real life (other than my mom and sister), the internet or in media in general and I only spent time with men, thinking I would be seen as strong, independent and respected if I did that.


Thankfully, I've now come to realise that I was completely wrong and I would slap my old self if I could and shake some sense into her. I now realise that sexism and misogyny weren't just something that people brought up to be dramatic and that it's not a man-hating movement at all. Since then, I've also decided to try out feminine and girly things and I love them, especially skirts and dresses and there are so many female artists and creators that I absolutely adore and look up to now and rather than being ashamed to be a woman, I am now proud of it.


I've always wanted to be an author and an artists who draws and paints and I've pretty recently graduated from an art school and got my diploma. Back then, I was only interested in writing, drawing and painting male characters, thinking that they were far more complex and interesting to portray than women, and could any think of all the poorly written and portrayed women in media rather than all the amazing and inspiring examples, and that has definitely changed now as well and my work has become so much more diverse and I'm truly ashamed of my mindset in the past.


If anyone took the time to read through this absolute mess of a rant, thank you and I'm sorry for what you had to read. It took a long time to get where I am now and I'm embarrassed that I hadn't realised how toxic and twisted my views had been, but I'm so glad that I know better now and my goal is to spread and promote positive and empowering examples of femininity and womanhood with my own work and the work of others, to hopefully contribute to a much needed change.",1719792053.0

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Actually there is no overlap. Women can be racist. Gay people can be sexist. Black people can also be homophobic. Experiencing one brand of discrimination does not give you any actual insight on the other brands- unless you are also experiencing them yourself. If there was any ""overlap"", how could women, who have experienced sexism their entire lives, still be racist? Idk if you've ever heard of intersectionality but I suggest you look into it. I'm using Black people as an example because I'm black. But in almost every single culture in the world there is homophobia, especially in POC cultures it can be pretty intense. A straight black person cannot understand what it means to be queer. They only understand what it means to be black. There is a lot of homophobia in the black community- because the two do not overlap. You are not exempt from being misguided or internalising racism because you're not straight. That's crazy.  Race relations between black people and Asian people in America has been tense historically.  Lighter skinned people discriminate against darker skinned people all over the world within their own cultures\\races.  What if a straight woman was like- ""why do LGBTQ people have to use labels? We are all people after all. This is wrong. I understand discrimination because I am a woman and think we should stop using these terms this community has chosen for themselves.""

**Buyers and sellers, use the link above to verify where to redeem codes to ensure 4K codes redeem properly.**

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a transaction has been completed, one user (buyer or seller) must create a comment (can be in-line with the deal discussion) tagging both `DCSbot` and the user they transacted with, for example  u\/YakuzaDemonSithLord.
 * The u/ is required, and the username for the bot ***MUST BE TYPED NOT COPY/PASTED*** to work properly.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential transaction must be made via comments. Exchange codes/payment via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted buyers and sellers.  **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

 * If you believe you have been scammed, please [fill out this form](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/digitalcodesell&subject=I%20Think%20I%20Have%20Been%20Scammed&message=*%20Username%20of%20the%20person%20scamming%20me:%20%0D%0A%0D%0A*%20Link%20to%20the%20thread%20where%20the%20transaction%20originated:%20%0D%0A%0D%0A*%20Link%20to%20screenshots%20uploaded%20to%20imgur%20of%20my%20conversations%20with%20the%20scammer:%20%0D%0A%0D%0A*%20An%20explanation%20of%20the%20situation:%20).

I have several and there's a huge difference in the type of affection my pets can handle and want because my kids did not listen to the pets boundaries and had severe cute aggression. I have a few pets that cannot stand to be held due to my kids when they were younger. The pets we got when they were older tolerate being held due to my kids being older and respecting the pets boundaries.

Depending on how your child is and your preferred style of parenting you might have to constantly remind your kid to not do x y or z with the pet due to their age and attention span and memory.

However it is your choice and your life so if you want a pet go for it! But it's literally like having a second child so keep that in mind.",1719792055.0

-If the trailer has fucking amazing music, use it in the game as well, and not just for the final fight, I wanna hear that shit often

There's nothing much to playing it. All the know hows and tricks can be taught in just 30 minutes. And the rest will be just how to implement it at the right timing and knowing how to react/anticipate. The right timing is probably one of the harder things to perfect.   
  
Turn on the audio, hear for all the power ups that are happening. 

What power ups do you use? Gold 4 means... you have very limited access to power ups 

Bounce trap is great but must know the right timing and place to put. Electrocution web is an easy and effective power up. 

Do you have Afterburner? I used that when I was at lower level. 

Shield is good. Stealth is great because the players won't know where you are and when they don‚Äôt know where you are, they can't attack you with certain power ups (example saw blade). And stealth lasts a rather long time. 

I use blizzard and magnet for the other 2. For power ups like these, make sure at least 2 other player haven't just got attacked. Because if they just got attacked, the powers up will do nothing to them. Give it 1.5-2 seconds wait and then use these powers ups to make sure at least 2 players are affected. If you can affect 3 players, that‚Äôs the most ideal.",1719792056.0

Meƒëutim to ne znaƒçi da on nije napravio mo≈æda i par prekr≈°aja a onaj koji se mo≈æe sasvim sigurno oƒçekuvati je da nije prilagodio brzinu vo≈ænje uvjetima na cesti.

Poku≈°aj ucjene je kazneno djelo i on to mora prijaviti pa da se i to obradi. Prijava, ako je uopƒáe napisana, se neƒáe mijenjati jer nema potrebe. A ta osoba mo≈æda to radi serijski. Imali smo takav sluƒçaj u Puli nekoliko puta.",1719792057.0

It would be wrong and discriminatory to do it to just those who are gay or trans or some such.

Document your reasoning just in case...  And be damn sure you apply your rule consistently.

Applying it to just possibly protected groups would be discriminatory and illegal.

"mitralvalveprolapse","t5_39vga","Yeah, and he is such a chill guy. When I mentioned the anxiety and stress that I have lived with since I was in my early 20's, including adrenaline rushes for no reason multiple times a day, increasing over the decades, he said something like 40% of his patients either report it as a symptom, or it resolves, or something like that. But he would not commit to the causal link. 

I woke up after surgery and felt like an empty vessel. That constant fight-or-flight feeling was completely gone. I told him that on day 2, and said I had to figure out what to do with that. He said I had X years to find out. That X, I won't disclose, it's one of those things that I don't want to put words in his mouth. But it's a long time. Turns out, my heart is quite healthy after working so much all it's life. No plaques, no coronary disease whatsoever. I'm going to live a long time, as long as I don't walk in front of a bus.

My genetics both blessed me, and cursed me. As this whole thing is, for me, a mutation. Bad collagen gene, certain hard tissues are not so hard. ""Loose joints"" and all that. A very very mild form of Marfan's, or something that's similar. Still, blows out your mitral valve, but hey. Marfan's is pretty bad.",1719792057.0

The next values are 1600, 3200 and Hi1, and the three will give you very noisy photos. Try it yourself, go out and take several photos with ISO 3200 in different light conditions and you‚Äôll see the amount of noise that iso level gives you.

Modern cameras can handle iso of 30,000 or more without any issue and you can photograph perfectly very dark places with very low speeds and you‚Äôll get a very clear photo.

Not this one. The best thing you can do is test the limits of your camera. At least on a D3100 I learned to never shoot at iso 1600, and try to stay between 100 and 400, 800 only when I really needed it.",1719792058.0

I guess the UI after death portion is still usable, you could view your one life and relive your memories instead of most likely ceasing to exist.

It also doesn't specify humans, so you could potentially choose to become a different animal, though that would still be somewhat controversial and vary from person to person.

So I guess there are some ways to use it, but it is pretty limited if you aren't willing to kill people, and even more so if you aren't willing to kill any animals (mostly just reliving your memories after death in that case).",1719792058.0

I observe a lot of facets of U-Pick operations that sure seem like they'd be frustrating to manage around. And last year I came up with the perfect solution to every single problem that might come up in your U-Pick operation. 

1) Make customers sign a liability waiver
This doesn't mean or do jack shit. The important part is that pages 3-12 are also appearance and publicity waivers. 

2) Fuck with your customers in creative ways and turn it into a reality TV show. I've got about a season long list. 

Specifically this could be addressed with the 'snitch' 'supervisor' or 'undercover agent' episodes. Maybe also the 'stalker' episode

Snitch- Actor posing as customer picking at a respectful distance notices target behavior and loses their marbles, alerting management to the target's malfeasance 

Supervisor- every customer is escorted at an uncomfortably near distance by a worker at all times

Undercover Agent- Same as snitch but camouflaged workers hiding in rows; and/or workers who document behavior from a distance and apprehend with evidence in hand

Stalker- Actor posing as customer aggressively and competitively picks berries at an uncomfortably near distance.

I imagine those are the slots that would be difficult for an ironman. I don't have a good alternative to the trident except maybe just an ancient staff? Maybe even Ibans staff. 

Keep me updated! Not a problem. Add me in game NuCrough if you have any other questions. I'll be on grinding out 100cb achievement cape üòÖ",1719792059.0

""In June 2005, Kennedy [RFK jr.] wrote an article, ""Deadly Immunity"", that appeared in both Rolling Stone and Salon and alleged a government conspiracy to conceal a connection between thimerosal and childhood neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism.[236] The article contained factual errors, leading Salon to issue five corrections.[237] Joan Walsh, Salon's editor-in-chief at the time and the sole Salon editor of the piece, said she had mistakenly relied on Rolling Stone's fact-checking, a process she later learned was ""less than arduous"". As soon as the piece was up, she said, ""we were besieged by scientists and advocates showing how Kennedy had misunderstood, incorrectly cited, and perhaps even falsified data.... It was the worst mistake of my career. I probably should have been fired.""

No games but there was some MadLibs thing to fill out but I don‚Äôt know what the ‚Äústory‚Äù was supposed to be, so that might have been a pointless activity. My MIL had some plain cloth bibs and diapers to decorate but hardly anyone did, it wasn‚Äôt really a shower games crowd. I think just the bibs to decorate would have been better, but whatever. She also made a diaper cake and offered to help me unwrap each one, since they are all individually rubber banded. I‚Äôm definitely on team diaper cakes are a waste of time, since I have negative time to unwrap a bunch of diapers to be used when my baby is basically 4x their current size, but I guess it made her happy to make a decoration.¬†",1719792059.0

Let's not pretend like the activity isn't 70 years old, competition breeds innovation and what you see today is the result of the desires of the activity becoming vocalized and agreed upon by the member corps themselves, a community of music educators who care more about the activity than you ever would.

"adhdwomen","t5_31aao","there‚Äôs nothing i won‚Äôt pick omg it‚Äôs annoying to me. i don‚Äôt have to look at myself in the mirror to have a pick fest on my face. i have the awful habit of slightly rubbing my temples, hairline, and jaw line and if i feel the slightest bump i already know it‚Äôs something and i have a mission. i once caught myself having picked my entire face for the entire drive from my office to my house 45 mins. what triggered it was a tiny piece of dead skin peeling off.

i also have bad eczema on my face so i‚Äôve found the perfect combo to help with the excess dry skin after a bad patch. but it‚Äôll often leave me with a few whiteheads lingering around and im just so eager to pick at it.

my scalp, lord please don‚Äôt let me feel a pimple or little dandruff cap bc ill start going at it.

my ears, i get blackheads in my ear and the slightest bump my nail will feel, im on another mission.

i get bikini waxes, i take my aftercare very seriously but when i spot one random ingrown - i will stupidly try to pick at it when i know i shouldn‚Äôt. i try to avoid it and just try to exfoliate as much as i can to avoid picking.

my nails, especially my toes. the slightest catch of a blanket or sock by my pinky toenail, im sitting there picking at it if i don‚Äôt have a clipper in hand. if i have one, done and done - no picking.

i try to keep my hands busy or ignore the need to pick. but it‚Äôs frustrating when i **do** do it and when i **don‚Äôt** do it.",1719792060.0

That's always felt so stupid to me, but hopefully you get it soon and get that cash cash money! I think it's kind of normal to have a paper check at first if you don't put in your direct deposit information before you start your job though, something with how payroll works I guess? 

I'm late, but I had a wedding yesterday that somehow lasted 8 entire hours. It was way too long! The ceremony was nice and short, but the reception took place in a catholic high school gymnasium, which meant no air conditioning in what has been nearly a heatwave and the humidity was about 90%. 

This is the first wedding in boyfriend and my relationship where it was my friends, but I still barely knew anyone. The groom and bride definitely made a great call and sat me with some people that I've talked to on discord or hung out with once, and our table definitely made a little clique that kept hiding outside and drinking while I was vaping. They were fun people and everyone was very kind, especially when we went to the ""after party"" (more like sitting at the bride and groom's house and relaxing in air conditioning) and I sort of just sat in the dark in the corner and didn't feel much like talking. They still talked to me to include me, but lowered their voices so I wasn't freaking out.

It was kind of weird because I was best friends with the bride and her sister back in middle school, but we drifted apart. I went to high school with the groom for a year, but then we didn't chat again until a few years ago when he saw me online at 3 am and felt like chatting. They said in their speech that they had to cut their guest list in half because of how many people they could actually invite, so we should count ourselves as very loved if we were there. I was kind of confused because I didn't actually realize we were close friends. As I was leaving and saying my goodbyes, the bride took me aside and told me that boyfriend is really nice and an actual good person. They want to do a double date (which I still cringe about) but it might be fine. Her sister (whom I also used to be very close friends with) gave me a ride to the car and also said that she wanted to do a double date with her husband and us. 

I guess lots of plans coming up soon, but my success was that despite the open bar, I was still pretty sober all day. Took me 7 days to finish this handle this time, so that's a big win for me!",1719792061.0

Have you talked about it since? Has he apologized? 

The problem i see is that if he ""didn't mean it"", it was genuinely cruel and intended to hurt, nothing more. I don't know that I could stay with someone who uses words as weapons. 

On the other hand, if he really feels that way, this relationship isn't going to last. It can't. 

> I was having a serious discussion with my partner over text after we got in an argument in person the day before.during the conversation i told him that i will never beg someone to love me correctly

It sounds like there may be some chronic issues with you needing something and him being unable or unwilling to offer it. Would that be accurate? 

I used to think that loving a long term partner was hard as a matter of course. I was wrong. I'm kicking myself for giving a decade of my life to someone who thought I was hard to love, and who was difficult for me to love. I'm in a healthy relationship now and realizing that life is hard, and relationships require effort, and being a good partner can take a lot of work. But *love,* that is not hard.",1719792061.0

"godot","t5_2znmk","**How to: Tech Support**

To make sure you can be assisted quickly and without friction, it is vital to learn how to asks for help the right way. 

**Search for your question**

Put the keywords of your problem into the search functions of this subreddit and the official forum. Considering the amount of people using the engine every day, there might already be a solution thread for you to look into first.

**Include Details**

Helpers need to know as much as possible about your problem. Try answering the following questions:

- What are you trying to do? (show your node setup/code)
- What is the expected result?
- What is happening instead? (include any error messages)
- What have you tried so far?

**Respond to Helpers**

Helpers often ask follow-up questions to better understand the problem. Ignoring them or responding ""not relevant"" is not the way to go. Even if it might seem unrelated to you, there is a high chance any answer will provide more context for the people that are trying to help you.

**Have patience**

Please don't expect people to immediately jump to your rescue. Community members spend their freetime on this sub, so it may take some time until someone comes around to answering your request for help.

Good luck squashing those bugs!

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","It‚Äôs all depressingly predictable, happening across the rich Western world (other than the US).

Step 1: birth rate among citizens falls below replacement and population growth rate falls below the rate that the previous gov assumed it would be to fund their wild spending

Step 2: the gov sets immigration rates way up because the gov needs bodies and a growing population to keep the economy humming and to fund said spending via taxes

Step 3: usually all this is coupled with a decrease in productivity and an increase in COL. So many people get upset by the inflow of immigrants making these problems worse.

<Canada is here>

Step 4: current gov knows the score and knows they can‚Äôt upset the apple cart too much. So they hold the line, to their own demise and a further right / more anti-immigration party is elected.

Step 5: new gov realizes the reality and other than some token grandstanding gestures, generally doesn‚Äôt change immigration much. This is also due  to pressure from the corporate class who like cheap labor and generally are closer to the further right parties.

Step 6: cycle continues until‚Ä¶ ? Can‚Äôt be a good end. Add in the issues if you‚Äôre welcoming in a lot of people from specific countries (in Canada‚Äôs case, India and China) who may not share the county‚Äôs values, and you get even more tensions.

I don‚Äôt know what the answer is other than having the harsh reckoning sooner vs later. But that‚Äôs tough medicine to take if your generation lived through the pandemic and current COL crisis already etc.",1719792062.0

"soccercirclejerk","t5_2tfso","Ok hear me out Mudryk is far superior in dribbling pace and maybe even passing but Haaland is better at shooting and physical. 
Not to mention that mudryk can play more place on the field with haaland only place being striker which he is a bit of a tap in merchant 
(I will admit not as much this season but last season he was).

Now Mudryk would be so much if he had enough confidence he is constantly be hated on by football fans all over the world like he got so 
hated on for scoring a cross goal (which he meant) but if Saka or Salah did that everyone would go crazy. 

Also Haaland scores goal for 1Mitre off of the goal line and get praised for such a beautiful goal which is stupid because he Jackson did 
3 of them same goals against spurs people said it was the worst hattrick ever but if Haaland did it every city fan (12 year old) would go 
crazy.

Now my final point is that Haaland has been playing in the big leagues for a few years now and Mudryk has had only 1 and a half seasons and 
gets hate for playing bad when vinis first few seasons at Madrid were that exact same but look at him now.

"anime","t5_2qh22","I did order the *Hibike! Euphonium 3* OST earlier today. That spun off a short loose tangent in my head about how Kyoto Animation has been extremely restrained in their authorization of anime merchandise for the intellectual property that they directly control.

Or maybe that's just a reaction to how few figures they license. They do have the typical array of general merchandise like acrylic stands, can badges, clear files, wall decorations, etc.

I'm guessing that they do have local control over the production of those items, as they're simpler to make compared to figures.

The most recent figures associated with one of their productions have been for *Kobayashi-san Chi no Maidragon*, but they only produced the anime, they don't own the property. (And of late the *Maidragon* merch has had more fanservice dragon items than I particularly care for.)

People seem to want *Violet Evergarden* figures fairly often, and there isn't anything official, leaving a gap filled by a couple of unlicensed figures of variable quality.

*Free!* had a few scale and prize figures produced for it. *Tsurune* has nothing that I'm aware of. *Musaigen World* at least got a Kawakami Mai.

For *Eupho* the only ""figures"" are acrylic stands. That said, I haven't noticed a lot of clamoring for *Eupho* figures.

But it's certainly popular. It seems odd that they've never even authorized trading figures for it.

Lift tiny souls upon their feet.
A smile, a touch, a gentle hand,
Helps children blossom, understand.

Their eyes reflect a boundless sky,
Where endless possibilities lie.
Encourage, guide them on their way,
And brighten each and every day.

For in their laughter, joy, and tears,
Lies the hope of future years.
Be kind, be patient, let them see,
The beauty of their destiny.

For every act of kindness sown,
A stronger, wiser world is grown.
In every heart, in every child,
Lives a spirit free and wild.

So cherish, love, and always find,
A way to be forever kind.
For in their hearts, your kindness stays,
And lights their paths through all their days.

fun story example ..

a british explorer found early native islanders upon his travels that led him to their shores, he needed some of their resources, he chose not to take it by force but by trade... the native islanders denied due to their divine beliefs. so with knowledge of the stars he knew a solar eclipse was coming soon, he told them if they didn't agree he would block out the sun... sure enough the eclipse came and with a light performance from him, the native islanders were in awe graciously and fearful of his divine power they agreed to the trade without question begging  the divine explorer to release the sun from its dark prison...

moral of the story, knowledge is power yet a recollection from a lesser mind doesnt mean its false, the contrary there is less motive, less knowledge/imagination and creativity of what to lie about. Simply events told by a lesser intelligence only means the descriptions arent exact, but the events are as they remember them, being told by the current available knowledge... ergo the earth is flat, all celestial bodies revolve around the earth ..doesnt mean planets dont exist it means the order of which is incorrect as that requires more knowledge  to know, seeing the planets in the night sky isnt the same as calculating gravitational orbits...

"hypnosis","t5_2qjlg","This is absolutely understandable, and you're not alone in having those fears. Hypnosis is *not* entirely safe (especially when approached without much knowledge!), **but** I do believe that it's possible to approach it in a way that makes it safe enough for you to feel comfortable being hypnotized.

Bad actors can absolutely pretend to be trustworthy in order to trick people (something which is particularly applicable in the recreational hypnosis community), but you're not immediately going to be getting hypnotized by a hypnotherapist. If you don't feel comfortable getting hypnotized, any good hypnotherapist shouldn't dismiss those fears like they're nothing. If you feel like they are, *find a new therapist*.

Your main worry with hypnosis seem to be a fear of losing autonomy/control during trance (and having that lack of control be exploited or lead to personal harm), which is *entirely* valid. I've worried about that too, and I'm glad you're thinking about that.

The most significant way to help with that worry is to discuss ahead of time what will happen during the session. As someone who's been hypnotized *many* times, you should ***never*** go into a session without any idea of what will be taking place. Better understanding what will happen allows you to recognize if a session is deviating into uncomfortable territory, and to take steps to stop the session.

Tell your hypnotherapist straight-up that you don't feel comfortable being in a situation where you can't stop a session, and discuss with them ways to ensure that you don't get into such a situation. 

Having your friend (or some other trustworthy person) accompany you to your first few sessions might be helpful, and you can absolutely work with a hypnotherapist on practicing coming out of trance whenever you want to. Again, this is something you could do with a trustworthy friend in the room.

Learning self-hypnosis could also be helpful, both to give you an idea of the limits of hypnosis and to practice coming out of trance.

I totally get your worries, but I think there's absolutely ways that you can deal with them. Better understanding how hypnosis works is a great way of protecting yourself from bad actors; I'd personally recommend Dr. Dylan Morgan's book ""[Hypnosis for Beginners](https://hypno1.co.uk/BookHypnosisForBeginners.htm)"".

If you have any more worries, feel free to reply with them; an informed decision is the best type of decision.

Regardless of your decision, I hope that whatever choice you make goes well, and that you are happy that you made it.",1719792065.0

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I have demonstrated that not only do you not understand Buddhism or Christianity but that you don't actually care about them. Your just trying to reinvent religion your own religion and use Christianity and Buddhism as a smoke screen to trick people into following blindly into your trap. As religion any religion is inherently evil. Look at d.t Suzuki. Look at the crusades or the inquisition. There zero benefit to religion. Because you don't need religion to be a good person. To be a good person you have to act like one . And if only the fear of divine retribution causes you to act morally you aren't a good person. Because a good person wants to be good. And they'll be good no matter what. So if you personally need to be religion to be better you're not such a good person as you think you are. Religion also doesn't make people better it only forces good people to do bad things. Look at Abraham he was told by God to kill his son who he loved most of all but God is morality so if God tells you to murder your son it's the moral thing to do. Buddha also didn't actually care about morality he said being a good person doesn't get you enlightenment and infact hinders your ability to be so. That's why Buddhists only care about meditation because meditation gets you enlightenment. And being enlightened also doesn't make you a good person there are story's of enlightened individuals raping and murdering like anyone else. Some even say pol pot was enlightened and he was fucking evil incarnate.



So I don't believe you and I hope for the sake of freedom and morality no on else does either. Because religion is evil inherently.",1719792065.0

I ate 1600 calories a day and lost 20 pounds in 2 months. It felt like forever but in retrospect the weight came off pretty quickly. Once I was close to my normal weight I went up to 1800-1900 and even then lost the last few pounds to my prepregnancy weight and have maintained since.

She tells me that she‚Äôs so ‚Äúfull‚Äù that pretty much any position and anything I do hits the g-spot continuously that means she pretty much always orgasms in 5-10 minutes during sex.

"tacobell","t5_2sd9o","In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Taco Bell‚Äôs famous motto, ""Live M√°s ."" But I realize, only now do I truly understand what they meant. Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Taco Bell who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in USA.I will be returning to Taco Bell soon, hungry for more.",1719792066.0

"TombRaider","t5_2sk5x","I think many classic fans feel as though the Core Tomb Raider Games are masterpieces when in my opinion they are far from it. 

Crystal Dynamic is never appreciated for revitalizing the Tomb Raider series twice. I think both the LAU and Survivor series are fantastic.

I think Rise of the Tomb Raider is the best game in the entire series, along with Legend and Tomb Raider III.

The real enemies here are Eidos and Square Enix, who have persistently mismanaged the series. For instance, Tomb Raider Underworld was gearing up to be a technical marvel for its time, but was rushed by Eidos. 

I do agree that the survivor series does dwell a little 
 far from its source material, but change should be welcome in with any work of fiction. 

Look, even now CD is bringing back classic elements in the new reboot and classic fans are still complaining. I think the new Lara looks amazing, and think Tomb Raider is in good hands with CD and Amazon. I really do believe Lara is entering her magnum opus era in gaming, with the new game, Netflix show, and Amazon show.",1719792067.0

"writers","t5_2r1ti","Well...

Personally not a fan of ""it goes nuclear"" or ""the bad guys want nuclear war"" trope.

That's me personally, but also because it's rare to see a story where that goal even makes sense, let alone why they'd resort to it the way they do and not as some opening move.

Basically, it gets very awkward to write war stories this way when you know about real world politics and why we've avoided nuclear war IRL for so long despite the close calls.

Take the Cold War...

For a while, the strategy was that because Western forces didn't have the numbers believed necessary to stop a Soviet push westward, strategic use of nuclear weapons would be necessary. Nuclear war would've been seen as a strategic part of preventing a total defeat.

This changed with Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. Suddenly both sides could nuke each other, and mutually assured destruction was theoretically guaranteed, even as things like interceptors and first strike capabilities increased.

So the strategy changed again to proxies and simply having such a powerful conventional force that it wouldn't need nuclear weapons to win another world war.

That's the strategy the US has taken for example. We have a congressional mandate for ten aircraft carriers to be active at once, and we can only decommission one when we adopt a new one.

It's why when Russia IRL implied they'd use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the official word was vocal disapproval, while a retired US Army general flat out stated a nuclear weapon in Ukraine would result in NATO sinking the entire Black Sea Fleet conventionally. So, not really a tit for that nuclear response anymore.

Even by the 1980s, the theory was that we'd pursue escalation only in response to the Soviets, not immediately jump to nukes. Even declassified Soviet documents revealed that their response also depended on how NATO acted. So both sides knew the best move was to not go nuclear.

But in a fictional scenarios where some evil all powerful organization wants to nuke mankind, why would there be a conventional war that escalates to nukes if the evil organization can just have one side launch all its nukes at once and leave the other side no choice but to shoot back?

This COULD be mitigated by the fact that it's far off in the future so maybe some of those safeguards are gone... But explaining why they'd be gone to begin with would be important as well, and THAT gets into a lot of awkward writing territory regarding speculation and the weird evil organization.",1719792067.0

I keep wanting to make Summoner work (even just the main class), but all the characters I try don't quite gel for me. The archetype is even less ideal for a lot of reasons. The one nice thing is that after level 5, the eidolon has all the same progressions as the main class, if I recall correctly, so it holds up at higher levels, whereas beastmaster you do have to take all the extra feats to make sure your companion stays relevant.

The CRM is dog shit, because people don't update anything, so contacts are wrong often.

Asians didn‚Äôt have their own category so I assume Asians are ‚ÄúOther non-Hispanic‚Äù but others will be in this category so it‚Äôs not a complete 11% that are Asian users.

Considering European-Americans are the dominant users on Reddit, and Asian are least likely to use it, the r/AsianParentStories sub is substantial.

There are bad parents of every race and ethnicity, but if you compare Asian experiences to others, Asian parents are more ruthless and extreme.

#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

>Ôº∏ What is the difference between „ÅÆ and „Åå ?

>‚óØ I saw a book called Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÁü•„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑÊó•Êú¨Ë™û , why is „ÅÆ used there instead of „Åå ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

>Ôº∏ What does this mean?

>‚óØ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

>Ôº∏ What's the difference between ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè?

>‚óØ Jisho says ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does ÂÖ®„ÅèÂêåÊÑü„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between „ÅØ and „Åå ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Here are the likely outcomes if Biden drops out:

1. Kamala for president
-Harris will be the presidential nomination
-Harris will be the president because how can Biden justify being the president, not the nominee
-Harris has to pick someone more moderate, someone white, or someone older to her running mate, alienating leftists. She would have to choose a Schumer, a Pelosi, or a Manchin to make the blue dogs and moderate white dems feel comfortable about voting for a black woman
-Conservatives would call her the DEI hire and it would be the ‚Äúbut her emails‚Äù of 2024 and Democrats lose
-every debate, every attack ad, every news channel, every political wonk would make the election about how Harris wasn‚Äôt elected to be President, even though she was elected with that possibility, distracting people from issues and policy

2. The party picks
-After 8 years of leftists and leftist voters screeing that a cabal of democrat party elites pull the strings on who will be the candidate when they didn‚Äôt show up to vote for Bernie in 16 or 20, the party‚Äôs delegates reject Harris and select two candidates of their own
-rejecting Harris likely pisses off voters of color, fracturing their voting block.
-Conservative groups have vowed to challenge the validity of the party choosing the candidate without a primary",1719792068.0

So the Apple Watch I got her sits nicely on a side table for most of its life lol. Now if he is a watch wearer, I‚Äôd recommend the Forerunner 165. It‚Äôs got a nice, sporty, unisex, look to it and can do all the things you need and more. It also has a few smart watch features if he ever needs them, like getting notifications, checking the weather, setting timers, and checking calendar events. There‚Äôs a music and non music option as well. The data on device for step count, heart rate tracking, sleep tracking, etc. is fantastic. Non music version is $250 usd, music version is $300 usd. The Venu 3 is also a nice watch with the same smart watch features and all the basic features you mentioned he‚Äôd need. It has Garmins latest heart rate sensor, although I‚Äôve had no issues with the one on my Forerunner 165. If you‚Äôd like more in depth info on these devices check out Desfit and or DC Rainmaker on YouTube. They‚Äôve both done great reviews on the Forerunner lineup of watches as well as the Venu lineup.

"Barbie","t5_2r31h","Honestly, if you're in the U.S., Goodwill and Savers are great places to start looking for dolls. Any kind of thrifting is great for saving money if you're willing to sometimes wait for a complete doll to come together because secondhand in that way is not always guaranteed to come completed. Temu is great for cheap doll furniture and you can get good dupes for some Barbie outfits for $5 and under plus some that are just honestly great. I've had good luck with Ebay but not everyone does. Please make sure you check recent reviews of what customers have received to gauge whether you should buy from them. Also have in mind what you're willing to spend and don't settle for anything less than what you want for the price you're willing to pay. I've done this before and have regretted it. AliExpress is basically a treasure trove of name brands and pieces for customs that are very hard to come by. They can be a little pricey at times but I find them to be incredible. They sell Barbie heads from 70s to 2000s and some full Barbies from those eras as well. Make sure you're looking for things labeled 1:6 or 1,6 because that's for 12 inch dolls. Unless you particularly want a Mattel made furniture set for the look, I'd recommend buying the doll furniture off of Temu because I find it to be sturdier and nicer looking and it's far less expensive. The Temu furniture is at most $15 for a piece and anywhere else it can be $35 and over because it's more standard to make 1:12 which is miniature scale dollhouse furniture.
I hope this helps. Please don't feel bad about being a teen boy being interested in this hobby. I only got into this as a 25 year old woman and spent $1000 my first year of collecting. Dolls are for everyone.",1719792070.0

"CrucibleGuidebook","t5_3os9l4","Stompees are good, the other exotics considered top tier are Wormhusk and Knucklehead. Experiment with all of them and pick your favorite. If you have an exotic class item, Ophidians and Dragon are the best column 1 perks and Wormhusk/Coyote are the best column 2 perks. Just be aware that the class item version of Wormhusk is slightly weaker than the helmet version.

  
Prismatic is definitely the best right now, and it has a really strong build. Take Gambler's Dodge, Snare Bomb, and Swarm Grenade. Jump is personal preference, just be aware that Blink will break invis. For aspects take Threaded Spectre/Stylish Executioner. For fragments Facet of Solitude is what makes the build work, the rest are personal preference or whichever you want the stat boosts from. I run Dawn, Blessing, Protection, and Defiance. Which super you take is also personal preference, but Storm's Edge is really strong right now so I like to use it. One thing to note is that if you take Golden Gun or Shadowshot you should run Facet of Purpose so when you pick up an orb you get overshield/restoration. 

  
For weapons, use Thorn. It will proc Facet of Solitude in 2 headshots, which means that every 3c or 2c2b or 2c1b with Soul Devourer active will proc Stylish Executioner and give you wallhacks without using an ability. Use whichever special and heavy you want, I like using a Retold Tale and Half Truths with Eager Edge (but Eager Edge is disabled right now). If you don't have Thorn, Hawkmoon also can proc Facet of Solitude in 3 headshots, but will only sometimes proc Stylish Executioner. Crimson is also pretty consistent with proccing it, but I'd recommend against it if you're on MnK because that gun is pretty much unusable.

  
The playstyle of the build is starting a gunfight with a Swarm Grenade or Snare Bomb to debuff an enemy so when you kill them Stylish Executioner will proc. When you don't have an ability Thorn can proc it anyway. Threaded Spectre is mostly used as a makeshift barricade, since if you dodge backwards they have to break it first. This synergizes really well with Wormhusk if you choose to run it. All of your abilities are also great area denial tools, so you can use them like that too.

  
For mods, run targeting for your helmet, dexterity and fastball on your gauntlets, unflinching on chest, and a holster mod for your special weapon and whichever orb pickup mods you can fit. Recuperation and Absolution are best, but if you can't fit Absolution just slap on Innervation instead. For your class item you want to run Reaper/Bomber/Powerful Attraction, which also lets you run a 4 cost stat mod. One trick you can do with Reaper mods is that if you kill someone and immediately dodge you will spawn an orb and immediately pick it up with Powerful Attraction.

  
For stats, prioritize Recovery first and Mobility and Discipline second. It's usually better to sacrifice a bit of mobility for 100 recovery and discipline, especially if you're a newer player since you likely won't be using your dodge off cooldown. People will argue you want 70 Resilience because that lets you survive 2c1b from an Igneous Hammer without Precision Instrument, but most people who will consistently use Iggy will just run Precision Instrument anyways. When you're starting out you probably won't notice when Resilience will save you in certain interactions, so I'd recommend just going for 20 and then ignoring it. I run 100/20/100/100/50/20. If you don't already, use d2armorpicker to get the exact armor stats you want.",1719792070.0

"BostonBruins","t5_2rmt9","Listen, there's legitimate criticism to point in Sweeney's direction, but ""deal not reached immediately after QO deadline"" isn't it. McAvoy wasn't done until October. Marchand's last extension took until late September, too. Pastrnak's RFA extension (not the most recent) was mid-September. Pasta getting the second one done in-season was kind of an outlier as far as the team's big names go. This is not inherently an alarm bell. 

Hell, we could look around the league at other GMs for a frame of reference. Vegas got Hanifin and Barbashev done in April and June, but Pietrangelo took until October, as did Stephenson, and Hague. MacFarland got Mackinnon done in September and Towes in October; before him, Sakic got Rantanen done in late September and Makar done in late July. Florida didn't get Barkov done until October 8.

Those fortress settlements and settlements with the high tier defensive buildings built should get a modifier that delays siege attrition for a number of turns.

It‚Äôs a bit easier if you‚Äôre young and single - if (like me) you‚Äôre in your 40s, with a wife and kid, it‚Äôs more difficult. Younger folks get bonus points to their ability to immigrate there, since they‚Äôre more likely to contribute to taxes for longer.

We made it more difficult on ourselves, by wanting to live in a place (and make enough money) to be able to come back and visit our friends and family that still live in the US semi-regularly. I‚Äôm sure there are countries where it is less difficult to immigrate to than Canada (which is, specifically, where we looked).

I needed to find a new job (in a country I couldn‚Äôt visit because of the pandemic), and finding one that would pay me even close to what I was being paid proved to be really difficult (and I had no trouble finding people who wanted to hire me, but salaries don‚Äôt align well). And they would also have to be willing to sponsor my visa, which was another knock against me. And finding a job when you‚Äôre already working full time, a parent, etc, is exhausting.

And that‚Äôs me, all privileged and stuff. I own a home in one of the countries least-affordable cities. I have better savings and retirement than most people my age. We might have been able to make it work, but it was too damn hard (and then Biden won in 2020, making the problem less urgent) - I don‚Äôt know how someone without my level of freedom could even begin to do it.",1719792072.0

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","so i don‚Äôt remember much of this but what i have is what i‚Äôve been told. back when i was wayyy younger like before from birth to preschool i used to live in this house with my parents 2 older brothers and older sister and so many weird things happened here when including doors and cabinets randomly opening and stuff just randomly disappearing but the most interesting stories were these:

my mom was sitting on a bench we had at the table when it just went flying across the room with her on it she didn‚Äôt even have her feet on the floor or anyone near her so there was no way it could‚Äôve been pushed 

my older brother was once in the shower when one of his belts ‚Äúfell‚Äù off the counter and started moving around the floor like crazy like it was some type of snake 

i somewhat temper this one but it was just me and my mom home as my siblings were at school and dad at work and i was sitting on the couch ‚Äúreading‚Äù a book more of just looking at the pictures (not important but i vividly remember it being a dora book) when a bookcase just fell over the couch luckily not enough to hurt me more than a scratch on my arm 

also i‚Äôm not sure this had anything to do with the activities that happened while there but shortly after we moved in my parents statue holy mary was stolen and when we were in the neighborhood years later visiting an old friend we passed by the house and one that looked like ours was sitting outside in the exact spot it had been stolen from it was pretty obvious that no one lived there from the state of the house my dad decided to check it out and it had the exact same price marking on the bottom we figured it was ours but my mom refused to take it home with us",1719792073.0

What are your favorite Console games? Are you an RPG guy? You might have played cyberpunk, baldurs gate 3, the witcher 3 (if not you should and the witcher is cheap on steam right now) you could try something like disco elysium that is perhaps less pretty but is a great innovative game with an amazing plot.

You could also try something with a great modding community as that's a thing that is only really done well on pc in you may have played Bethesda games on Console but you can do unspeakable things to them on PC and give them a brand new lease of life.

Also Kerbal space program, I know it's on console but you can mod it on PC and turn it into something else entirely. (Not ksp2, never ksp2, it doesn't work)

One thing to consider is that you will have a hard time getting credit in the EU since you have no credit history there (the same reason bad credit in the USA won't affect you there). You might want to maintain some credit in the USA so you have some available if you need it. 

Also, defaulted debts will eventually fall off your American credit report after a certain number of years. You'll still owe it, but they won't be able to collect on it. So you will be able to come back to the USA with essentially a clean slate in due time.",1719792074.0
"HorrorGaming","t5_2w4bb","The fact that you're getting so mad and generalizing my point is making you look worse than me dude.

First of all, the game didn't call them witch doctors so that one would be on you. Second of all, the fact that African tribes literally have and do exist does not make African tribes racist lol, this is purely nonsense. Is it racist against American natives if there are natives in a game? This sort of guilt grab logic just doesn't hold up to scrutiny and that's why you're getting frustrated, it falls apart when you try to explain it because it doesn't make any sense.

Why is it racist to have African culture in a zombie game if it's not racist to have Spanish culture in a zombie game? Why isn't it anti American or anti Russian (in re6) or anti police in re2? You are affording some special sensitivity to African culture in which even referencing tribal African natives in any way is automatically inherently racist.

"AutoTuga","t5_4oizbx","Gostaria de obter a vossa opini√£o, acho que se enquadra dentro do tema. Comprei um carro a 31 de janeiro a um stand de pessoa conhecida, antes de comprar o carro disse que pretendia que fosse autom√°tico, com ac, tinha de estar em boas condi√ß√µes, n√£o ter registo de batidas e pouco kms. Foi me assegurado que o Smart correspondia ao que pretendia e que o mesmo ia para oficina para ser pintado e revisado. Passado 1 m√™s e tal e de muito telefonema consegui ir buscar o carro, a oficina estava mto cheia e n√£o conseguia fazer a pintura do carro. Fui buscar o carro e o vendedor n√£o me entregou fatura -contrato- nem o que estava inclu√≠do na garantia - apenas me disse presencialmente e nada escrito. N√£o me entregou o documento da inspe√ß√£o nem a declara√ß√£o de circula√ß√£o, praticamente tive de o chatear todos os dias e s√≥ no dia 22 de mar√ßo √© que pude conduzir o carro.
Quando fiz o test drive detectei logo que era semi autom√°tico e disse logo que n√£o era o que pretendia.

Quando fui buscar o carro a 4 de mar√ßo detecto que o carro n√£o tem AC e tem o farol solto, o mesmo levou uma batida de lado. Contacto o vendedor e diz que para o conduzir que vai arranjar outro ve√≠culo.

Em abril quando come√ßo a conduzir notei que o trav√£o s√≥ travava quando era pressionado 2x. Chamei a aten√ß√£o do vendedor e disse que era mesmo assim. Detecto que o trav√£o de m√£o n√£o est√° bom e o carro falhou durante uma subida. Contacto a oficina e dizem n√£o ter tempo.

Preferi ir a um outra oficina especialista em smarts e apena pedi um check in. Foi detectado erros estruturais graves, que muitas coisas que me disseram estar mto boas n√£o correspondia a verdade, o carro est√° cheio de ferrugem num grau mto mau. Est√° oficina disse que estava em causa a minha seguran√ßa e que n√£o devia conduzir aquele carro. Deveria desfazer a compra com o vendedor.

Na m√°quina o carro deu alerta vermelho para erros em tudo, tem problemas nos sensores de travagem, motor de arranque, aba, airbags tudo e mais alguma coisa. Quando contactei o vendedor o mesmo gozou cmg a perguntar se alguma roda tinha ca√≠do. Exigi que ele levasse a s√©rio o que estava a dizer e que tinha de arranjar a situa√ß√£o, esta oficina disse que o custo de todos estes problema era mais de 6000‚Ç¨. Era imposs√≠vel o carro ter passado na inspe√ß√£o e que at√© o farol estava montado ao contr√°rio.¬†

Dia seguinte foi para oficina do vendedor, este entra em contacto cmg no dia a seguir e exige o pagamento de 600‚Ç¨. Diz que apenas tem problemas de pe√ßas de desgaste e obviamente eu sou a culpada. Recuso o pagamento levanto o carro da oficina, dep√¥s do vendedor assumir os custos. Pe√ßo o relat√≥rio e √© recusado. Conduzo o carro e os problemas mant√©m-se. Neste momento avancei para o portal do consumidor com o apoio de juristas.¬†
Tendo em conta os problemas mencionados eu enviei email ao vendedor a pedir a devolu√ß√£o do dinheiro e a anula√ß√£o da venda.

O carro n√£o tem o que eu pedi
O mesmo tem problemas graves de seguran√ßa
Os kms afinal n√£o s√£o reais e pensasse ter o triplo cerca de 400
N√£o tenho fatura
S√≥ tenho contrato do cr√©dito

Jams, pickles, salsa, condiments. Dried mustard powder, dried worcestershire sauce, powdered salad dressing mix, syrup, honey, I really like sucanat for baking.

Gravy (canned and powder), spices (all kinds), cinnamon.

Powdered milk, powdered butter, powdered eggs, buttermilk powder.

Soup, chili, sausage gravy, canned tamales, cowboy beans

Boxes of powder pudding and jello, cocoa, chia seeds, flax seeds, citric acid, drink mixes.

Cartons of almond milk (only about a year exp. Date but comes in handy).

I have a dozen MREs.  I have a 30 day tote of Readywise meals.  I have 6 or 10 Mountainhouse packs.

Don't forget water!

It's important to have a variety of basic staple ingredients to put meals together.

"forge","t5_2qmpd","I did a quick Google search and found [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/13261/how-to-get-a-reflection-vector). Don't have time to test it, but it looks right at a glance.

https://preview.redd.it/258zc27tss9d1.jpeg?width=842&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=316a16554831f5ea5377df464404b0da014ad36b

D = your object's velocity vector.

B = the wall surface, likely equal to **Get Object Forward**, but this shouldn't be needed in the equation below. It's just for you reference.

N = the vector perpendicular to the wall's surface, likely equal to **Get Object Up**. This is used in the equation below.

R = the reflected vector of your object's velocity vector, so it'll be your result at the end of the below equation.

### R = D - 2(D ‚Ä¢ N)N

R will be a vector output that you can plug directly into your **Set Object Velocity**.

D will be the **Get Object Velocity** of the object you're trying to reflect.

(D ‚Ä¢ N) will come from **Dot Product** of **Get Object Velocity** of the object and **Get Object Up** of your pointer. The output result will be a scalar, so just a number and no longer a vector.

Take the output of (D ‚Ä¢ N) and run it through **Multiply** with ""2"" as the other input. Then plug the Product output into **Scale Vector**. If you want to further scale the velocity, like to speed it up, then you could run another **Multiply** node just before scaling the vector.",1719792076.0

Going back to the possible underage bit, rule 34 has to be the worst thing to ever grace the internet which basically means ‚Äúif it exists there is porn of it and if porn doesn‚Äôt exist of it there will be porn of it soon.‚Äù It‚Äôs a depraved part of the internet. There are some anime‚Äôs that in my personal opinion are ruined because of the fan base. Additionally my eyes may be deceiving me but one of those heads seems to have a ball gag.

There is a lot of misunderstanding regarding the command to keep the Sabbath. Yes, we are to honor the Sabbath, but the way we do so has changed with the resurrection of Christ. Christ is now our Sabbath rest (Heb 4). The ultimate rest God had in mind was not a physical plot of land.

I remember the MARICOPA INCOMING. I remember the 2020 freakout over Florida. There is one thing about this subreddit that I have always found interesting: it had a near-perfect track record when predicting election results.

2020 - Correctly predicted that Biden would win and that Democrats would retake the Senate. 

2021 - While many were hopeful that TMac would win, many were also sounding the alarm of a Youngkin victory.

2022 - Immediately after the GOP's wins and overperformances in 2021, this subreddit was one of the few subreddits that were adamant about how there wasn't going to be a red wave. It was often mocked relentlessly. I won't name names, but I remember the subreddit being called ""going to have a shock in September"" ""full of delusional bloomers"". Additionally, even after Roe vs Wade was overturned, many subreddits were still adamant about a red wave occurring ""voters care more about the economy"". Yet still, this sub was defiant. Well, November came, and this sub was right. Turns out it wasn't ""full of delusional bloomers"" after all.

2023 - Predicted Jill would win in Wisconsion, Democrats would retake the Virginia House, Mississippi would be closer than many expected, Beshear would win in Kentucky. All came true.",1719792077.0

For motors, honestly just go brushless nowadays. I‚Äôm a big fan of Warhead. I run a Base 27k long shaft in my M4 and it has (unsurprisingly) no trouble pulling an M90 spring with 18:1 gears at pretty close to the theoretical 25 rps with a 3s.

A motor upgrade will increase performance of the gun, but a motor upgrade typically also requires reshimming and confirming your gear mesh and motor height and all that. Expect snappier lock time and higher rate of fire from a nice torquey brushless motor, all else being equal.

You likely have 18:1 gears. Try putting .36 BBs in, lifting those is a matter of hop and not motor. If it‚Äôll lift them, you‚Äôre good. If not, try an omega nub and a macaron.",1719792078.0

"technology","t5_2qh16",">Oh I don‚Äôt believe it was foolish for them to smash the cotton looms. If their livelihoods had been protected in some way, if they could have had some stake or ownership in the factories or there had been some other kind of compensation they would have responded differently.

What did smashing cotton looms achieve in terms of protecting their jobs?

>At the time the whole concept of that was so alien to the ruling class that they immediately resorted to violence. The Luddites were all executed.

Counter point: Had they not smashed up the cotton looms, they would not have been executed.

There was no way to protect the jobs of people who had a machine come in and produce 5 times the produce at a fraction of the cost. There's no way to protect someone's job today from an AI that will produce 5 times as much work for a fraction of the cost.

Let's say for a moment you own a business producing cotton, and you decide to compensate your weavers by giving them a portion of the profits from your factory. The problem you're going to face here is your maths goes like this:

Weavers make ¬£100 a year, pays the staff ¬£20 a year. Now the machine and staff costs ¬£2 per year and the weaver makes ¬£200 worth of cloth, they could eeasily give some of those profits to the now obsolete weavers.

The problem with this scenario is it ignores competition. Inevitably when you have huge margins, if there is a low barrier to entry, someone will create a rival company and offer the same product for less. Looms didn't just produce more product for less, it also made the prices become much more affordable. Now the factory owner who has given away 40% of his factory's income to the workers is fighting off competition with one hand behind his back.

In time technology makes some jobs obsolete, and creates new jobs. Historically this has been even handed, but AI looks like it will make a lot of jobs obsolete (actually it won't, it will just make a number of people surplus to requirements) without creating the same number of new jobs.

If your job is going to way of the dodo, no one has a responsibility to help you out other than the state. Private businesses shouldn't have to compensate someone because they have an obsolete skill set and aren't needed. I would hope that unions, if well run, would be negotiating for support in retraining employees but instead in many places in the UK they just advocate for bigger wages which makes automation inevitable.",1719792078.0

I'm just the tiniest bit tired of people telling 3-row SUV buyers to get a minivan - mostly because people don't want to hear that, so the advice isn't useful. But if you're loading all three rows and going on a road trip, it does make a pretty significant difference.",1719792080.0

"cloudxaerith","t5_gy2fo","I didn't feel like the game centered on Tifa, a lot of people got more screen time because the game is so long. Aerith was very present the entire time I played and in a lot of quests and scenes. However, IMO Tifa has more screen time because the game delves into Cloud's past, and she just happens to be part of it. Realistically, Sephiroth is also trying to manipulate Cloud into thinking Tifa isn't even real, hence the scenes referencing her underboob scar and when he turns on her and slices her and she falls into the whale weapons. She's there for the storyline of Cloud being a ""Jenova puppet"" or whatever you'd like to call it, and I don't think the main storyline is about Tifa, she's just a side character that has an impact on Clouds mental state because of Sephiroth/Jenova. Aerith is the main heroine of FF7...Tifa is part of ""and the others.""",1719792081.0

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","I read the Dune books that were available at my high school library (late 1970s - early 1980s).  They were a bit long and complex.  

You might want to visit a good used book store and spend several hours browsing to find something that interests you.  Recommendations are fine, but you have to find the stories that you prefer reading.  Used books are usually less expensive than new ones, and there's also the public library--if your library doesn't have the book you're looking for, if they have an interlibrary loan system, they may be able to get the book for you (that can take up to a year, though).  Find what you like before starting your collection. 

While it's definitely not Game of Thrones or Dune, I started reading Andre Norton's science fiction books, then her Witch World series, in high school when I ran out of horse stories to borrow from the library.  They were just about 200 pages each or a little more, and I'd read each one in a day or two during the school year.  I'm not sure what shorter novels these days have themes similar to Game of Thrones or Dune, but a knowledgeable bookstore clerk might be able to recommend something, as well as others commenting on this thread.

I slogged through The Lord of the Rings because it was a classic.  Much preferred reading C.S. Lewis' novels.  

Lois McMaster Bujold's novels might also be of interest, or CJ Cherryh's, Asimov, etc.  I grew up in the 70s and 80s, so my favorite reading hasn't kept up with modern times, as it were.",1719792082.0

"futbol","t5_2qpwe","""Y no, no creo que M√©xico es lo mejor del mundo""

Es por que sus hinchas y su prensa siempre han sobrevalorado a su selecci√≥n de una forma rid√≠cula.

Ultimamente andan con la capa ca√≠da, pero previo a los √∫ltimos 3 mundiales y tambi√©n la copa centenario vengo escuchando a muchos Mexicanos ponerse como uno de los favoritos. 

El tema es que son un pa√≠s con 130 millones de fanaticos que llenan estadios enormes y no han logrado nada, y nunca han estado cerca de ser una potencia, pero su prensa y algunos de sus hinchas se han cre√≠do que Mexico es un gran equipo. Compara con uruguay o Croacia, pa√≠ses con el 3% de su poblaci√≥n son muy superiores a ustedes.

Para el mundial del 2014 no clasifican si USA no le gana a Panam√°. Dado el gran pa√≠s futbolistico que son, eso es una verguenza.

Para la copa centenario se hac√≠an favoritos frente a Chile que era el campe√≥n de America, y se tragaron 7.

Ganar la copa centenario no es ninguna gracia, todos los oponentes son d√©biles, excepto USA que ahora los tienen para la joda, y en USA el futbol es el 4to o 5to deporte.

Hasta Turqu√≠a, tambi√©n un pa√≠s grande y muy futbolizado (80 millones de habitantes) llego a semis en el mundial del 2002.

Est√°n acostumbrados a creer que son buenos porque han ido a todos los mundiales, simplemente porque para ustedes es muy f√°cil clasificar. Lo otro es que aparte de Rafa Marquez y Hugo Sanchez, no han producido grandes jugadores. Su gran referente de area era Chicharito, eso lo dice todo.",1719792082.0

You should approach this topic with your gf! Every trans person has a different priority & gender envy preferences, so letting her know before you try things more would help IMO.

I drive 40mins to work now but thats a sacrifice im willing to make instead of paying someone elses house off. Once your settled slowly upgrade what you can, raise the value of your home and using a credit line based off that you can get a second mortgage and rent your first home or sell depending on market.

My Q adjacent Significant Other and I were driving in the car this afternoon.¬† There was some contrails in the sky, and they said that a bunch of people were talking on line about chemtrails.¬† And that there were skeptical about that issue.


I said straight out that I saw it as crazy conspiracy talk.¬† We talked about the issue and things seemed to be going in the right direction


So I asked about who those people were, and where they were talking about it in line.¬† That's when my Significant Other became evasive.¬† I didn't press hard, because it quickly became obvious that my S.O. didn't want to tell me who or where.


Needless to say, that's a huge red flag for me.


I asked if those people had talked about 9/11 being an inside job.¬† ""Nope, they haven't.""¬† I'm not sure I believe that answer, but it's possible.¬† My last comment was that I considered the chemtrails stuff to be crazy conspiracy stuff, and that the 9/11 stuff is too.",1719792084.0

Look, I'm not a fan. I like a few of her songs....a little. A bit. Maybe. But I can recognize talent and success when I see it. She has both. She is also excellent at business. OBVIOUSLY! 

I can't imagine how horrible it would be to have a bunch of strong, independent, wealthy, smart, successful women running around.....lol. 

From a practical standpoint: Her biological clock IS ticking. Men have a much larger window. That's a fact. They are also not ""down"" physically the way a woman is with pregnancy and childbirth. So it makes far less sense to get on to them about why they haven't had kids. For men, they just have sex and they are done. It's this whole thing for women....

Also, though I have never heard (nor cared) about her position regarding having children, if she DOES want them she probably only wants 1 or 2. So there is not nearly the hurry she might have if she wanted say 4-5. She may have just decided she doesn't want them and never bothered to tell anyone because it's not our business. 

I don't care one way or the other. I'm happy for her as I would be for any human who managed to hone her talents into a billion dollar brand. That's damn impressive any way you look at it.",1719792084.0

Ahhhh.....ohhhhh where the noises he sent. I'm sure these first few noises are just the uncomfortable acceptance of a phallus in his ass. I know the feeling and what is amazing is how much responsibility this is. I don't want to hurt him but I know what he's going through.

There you go. It's in baby.

Is it?

Yup.

All of it?

Yup. All of it.

Ok....¬†

I start gently as I grab his ass with both hands. I'm looking down at this rubber cock going in and out of his ass and it's beautiful. He says the likes the long slow strokes. My cock is as real as they come. Veins, circumsiced head, balls..everything. He says that the slow long strokes feel best and he can feel the ribbing of the veins on the dildo and that is what he reports as the most pleasurable and I'm more than happy to oblige. I love fucking him and I love this whole thing of having my man on all fours giving me his ass.

I fuck, add lube, fuck some more and he begins to moan and breath deeper. 

You want me to go faster?

Yes.

I pick up the pace. I've said this before but it's hard work fucking. It's just  
is.

I am now getting into this and he's now relaxed. I'm relaxed. I start the dirty  
talk.

Yea baby. Take that cock. Oh yea....I love watching my cock disappear into that  
sweet ass of yours.

I slap is ass.

You like that baby? You want momma to slap that ass?

Yes please.

You want me to fuck you harder.

Yes....

I'm now thrusting as hard as I can and I'm aware that I'm getting tired. I won't be  
able to keep this pace up.

Stroke yourself.....touch yourself.....

He starts playing with himself and I'm getting tired.

I stop....I need a break...Turn over.

I pull out and he turns over onto his back. I can see his face now and he lifts  
his legs up and back. I grab my cock and put it in and now I have access to his  
cock. In this position, I am now leaning more down and into him. I'm more  
comfortable and I've got my left hand pushing against his thigh and my right  
hand around his cock. I start stroking and thrusting....

You like that baby?

Yes.

I want you to come for me.

It an Alesha, Who Smiles at death deck that had a stipulation to only use cards with 2 power or less. There is a pet card of mine in aristocrat strategies called \[\[Wake the Dead\]\] that returns x creatures from your graveyard but they die at end of turn, and you can only cast it on an opponents combat step. It is supposed to be used for surprising your opponents with a bunch of blockers, but I like it to get all of my enters and death triggers again. Turns out though if you have dockside, a sac outlet, a blood artist and \[\[Ardent Elementalist\]\] (he returns an instant or sorcery on ETB) you can start looping the wake the dead over and over as long as you make at least 4 treasure with the dockside. 

I didn't realize it for some reason when I built it, but then quickly realized when all the cards came together one game. Ended up cutting the dockside since he was just way too off balanced for the deck (the other 98 was fairly medium powered, but dockside made the list way too fast for that powerlevel and there were multiple ways to search him out of the deck).",1719792085.0

Se tiver como trocar de sala. Pede pra trocar..

Se n√£o der, tenta trocar de turno.

V√™ com a Gabriela como √© a rela√ß√£o dela com a Larissa.

V√™ com a Gabriela se ela tb mudaria de classe ou turno.

N√£o poe ela em grupo, faz amizade com outras pessoas e v√™ se vcs conseguem fazer um grupo fixo pra trabalhos j√° pensando na situa√ß√£o da gabi preferir a larissa de novo.

Se a professora colocar voc√™ com a larissa avisa com anteced√™ncia que se ela n√£o dividir tarefas a larissa vai deixar tudo pra voc√™ fazer.

Avisa sua m√£e sobre oq t√° acontecendo, fala pra ela n√£o contar nada pra m√£e da larissa!! Diz que vc ta dizendo pra que caso a m√£e da larissa queira planejar algo a sua m√£e de um jeito de tirar voc√™ da situa√ß√£o.

Se sua m√£e for igual a minha e n√£o der a minima pra nada que vc diz, ai fica dif√≠cil.

Pq se vc n√£o avisar nada a larissa pode aparecer do nda na sua casa, ou pior, sua m√£e saber da treta pela vers√£o da larissa e te xingar pq na vers√£o dela vc fez coisas terr√≠veis..

Agora se sua m√£e for dif√≠cil e n√£o te ouvir mt ai contar pode ser √∫til pra s√≥ garantir que ela tenha sua vers√£o dos fatos, ai se for questionada pela sua atitude ela vai ter um conhecimento pr√©vio do que aconteceu e talvez vai saber julgar se falaram mentira ou se t√£o exagerando.

O problema √© vc contar e as m√£es querer reconciliar voc√™s sem que vc queira.

Se nada puder ser feito e vc tiver que conviver com ela at√© o fim da escola deixa p√∫blico que vc n√£o gosta dela, e se voc√™ tiver que ficar longe do seu grupo pq eles preferem ela vc vai sobreviver, depois que a escola acaba sua vida vai mudar mt, melhor coisa a se fazer √© planejar o p√≥s escola que ficar tentando salvar amizade t√≥xica.",1719792085.0

That is besides the point. The current immigration is not sustainable and can't continue like that. At some point people won't care if legal or illegal immigrant they just want less. There should be a cap on immigration no matter illegal or legal.

March of Wretched Sorrow does two out of those three, and it can drain a lot higher (or lower) than Spike. But it does not win you the game, so you will end up losing a lot of games where you couldn't get through with attackers, or got comboed before you could win. It also just saves you from the unlucky times where you don't see any other lifegain.

Plus, it costs zero mana. This is vital in times where you have to tap out, or hold up mana.

If you want to play at a highly competitive level, then the competitive cards always cost a lot. I don't blame you for not wanting to dump that much money for a playset of cards that were under $5 a month ago, but that's the nature of MTG. Until then, proxy it when playing with friends, and do your best without it when playing at FNM or whatever. If you're not convinced at the difference, go through a bunch of games on Cockatrice or whatever both with and without it. The difference is big.

You could try replacing it with [[Zombie Infestation]] or [[Feast of Sanity]]. But both of those require they be case before you go full throttle with Necro, so they are lackluster at best. Soul Spike works the end step you draw it. If you're trying to use Feast, you're probably re-working the deck to use [[Beseech the Mirror]]. On the plus side, you can now Beseech for a free-cast Necro, The One Ring, or Sheoldred. But, its four damn mana *and* you need to sac a creature, so even if you cast it you can get blown out by a counterspell. Timeless uses it, but they also use Dark Ritual, so, yeah.",1719792085.0

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Metas vary - currently aheals are preferred for reasons mentioned below; but aheals needs to bring other key boons as well as the healing. Understanding prestacking, etc. (fract esp). And Raids/Strikes does differ from Fract; not hugely but just due to the different content mode some aspects of a healer/boons are preferred. 

You COULD make many healers work tbh with the RIGHT open group; but... PUGs and CM/etc. def not. 

There's no HoTs in GW2; there's pulsing heals, n burst n leech etc. 

Chronomancer is sorta the MVP right now, and in terms of ease. Now, as a longtime Chrono that dreamed of these days I'm happy 6 months ago there was no such thing as real Chrono healing. BUT - they bring big heals, cleanse, stab/aegis/prot/might/regen n your choice of ala or quick. Prob ala. And utility; lots of ways to change out a skill etc. AND they can tank if needed the former main tanks of yesterday (tho you dont need ""tanks"" in every raid/etc.). 

However, others posted more options. Mech is easy; used to be on top; FB is still prob preferred in Fracts, tho Chrono n Herald is right up there now. Druid is solid I never personally liked them; but cant go wrong. Anyways, key is learning healing in PvE for GW2 is not quite the same as other MMOs. However, pvp/WvW also is totally different.",1719792086.0

"cubancigars","t5_2ud4e","Your post seems related to verifying whether your Cuban cigar is legitimate. You can verify a box code through the Habanos website here: http://verificacion.habanos.com/

They also have a page set up to verify the various features they have to prevent counterfeiting: https://www.habanos.com/es/verificacion-de-autenticidad/?age-verified=f93e567137

You can also see the various features of boxes, bands and warranty seals from here: https://www.cubancigarwebsite.com/packaging/information

But you should always trust your source. If the cigar is from a verified retailer from our trusted retailers link, your cigar is almost certainly legitimate. If your cigar came from Mexico, # # the US, the Dominican Republic a friend who travelled to Cuba, a friend of the family or another uncertain source there's a high likelihood your cigar isn't authentic. 

Keep in mind that Cohiba is one of the most counterfeited brands in the world. 

It would be very helpful for everyone if you posted clear, front on pictures of the band and cap, as well as a comment advising where the cigar was obtained from.

My partner and I were lucky enough to buy items when nobody was looking decades ago and made a collection that is quite respectable by today‚Äôs standards.  I‚Äôll be the first to say that past strategies may not pay off for future collectors. But with more accessibility, the art world is smaller and regional galleries aren‚Äôt currently a good option.

"Pathfinder2e","t5_gkc60","Fortissimo Composition itself doesn't have a duration. Its a spellshape, so it modifies your next action.

If your next action is to use a composition, that composition's duration is its normal duration (1 round).

Every composition lasts 1 round by default; you aren't *extending* Courageous Anthem each round you cast it one after another. Each time you cast courageous anthem it is a different courageous anthem. In fact, the Anthem only lasts until the start of your next turn; if you cast Courageous Anthem on one round, you won't benefit from it on the following round unless you recast it. 

One caveat is [Martial Performance](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=4576), which *does* extend, and also extends a Fortissimo'd composition for one round if you land a Strike. 

> Because if it only lasts one round I really don't think it's that good and I'm not sure if I should take it, I like the consistency that Lingering Composition provides, since it frees up my actions.

The argument for Foritssimo Composition is stacking power. At high levels, when you can get the crit on fortissimo, coupled with a powerful debuff like [Synesthisia](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=328), you can effect a massive swing for your allies in one turn. For example, an off-guard target affected by Synesthisia and being hit by a barbarian with a +3 status from courageous anthem is a net **EIGHT ACCURACY** swing from its baseline AC. That's absolutely absurd, and is where the potential of the ability lies.

If you just kind of throw it out at random without looking at the tactical situation it can definitely feel worse than lingering, which does benefit from just being used arbitrarily. Fortissimo is absolutely a very timing and team focused ability.",1719792087.0

They are written fairly differently to normal fics, almost reading like a script fic, but obviously lacking in stage direction, just the texts between the characters.

Obviously texts are also written rather differently to normal speech, both in vernacular, spelling and structure and the author of the text fic has to decide how best to represent that.

"datingoverforty","t5_su6ij","Original copy of post by u/WonderfulHoliday5859:

I (42F) have been in a relationship with the boyfriend (42m) for only 7 months.  I told him early on this transition of being single for 3yrs to now being bf/gf is a bit awkward for me. I need this to go at a slow pace. I enjoy my space and I am not a texter. And he accepts it. He is very consistent and drives 45min to see me twice a week. When he leaves the next morning he‚Äôll give me a kiss goodbye and I tell him to be safe. I won‚Äôt text him until 2-3 days later. I also didn‚Äôt show much affection until a month ago. Things are honestly going great. It‚Äôs the first relationship where I feel safe, supported, and able to be myself. 

Now that I realized we past the 6 months mark I am finding myself wanting more effort from him. I would like for him to text me every now and then and ask me how my day went.  I would also like him to show more affection towards me, or surprise me with my fave bottle of Prosecco, flowers, or snack when he comes over. I should preface that when he comes over I have his favorite drink ready and I will either cook dinner or pick something up. Now that I am ready, how do I bring this up without sounding needy?

### Meme Shadow Realm

Last Meta Thread we thrown everything into the meme shadow realm. The result of that was FMAB Vote Brigading being removed. All other entries were voted to stay banished. However, the mod team for the past few months has wanted to somewhat retire the Meme Shadow Realm for a variety of reasons. [If you checked the shadow realm entries](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animemes/wiki/shadow_realm), you would have noticed additional changes. We're still discussing the last two entries remaining, but in the mean time, please give us your thoughts on the MSR or anything adjacent to it.

### Sub Changelog:

 - Updates to the Meme Shadow Realm.

### Scheduled Events:

Everyone on here is saying speak to a financial adviser. What no one tells you is they're just sales people. They sell what companies like investec, allan gray, old mutual, etc, are providing  - unit trust investments. Those aren't all that great for a cash income stream if you want your money (capital) to last.

I saw one comment here saying invest in US markets. Sure, they do perform well. But what about the ZAR/USD? Those S&P500 returns won't be so sweet when the ZAR claws it's way back with our improving political situation.

I'll sound old saying this but ""these days"" everyone thinks unit trusts are the default vehicle for savings and retirement but don't  realise they haven't always been around. And they're only around because they're something that can be sold to the average consumer. 

20 years ago my rich friends thought unit trusts were a scam (they were fairly new back then). 30 years ago there was no such thing. Only the very rich could invest in the stock market via brokers or personal fund managers. So what did people do with their savings or retirement funds? Well, one option was always property. Or investing in your shifty nephew's new business... 

If you're not looking for income, invest it in an index fund (don't need an advisor for that) and leave it for 10 years. Compound interest is magic and the money will be ""safe"" in an index fund.
If you do need income, property is going to be a good option. And if you have more properties (or rooms) your income sources would be a little bit more diversified meaning your income would be steadier than a single property.",1719792089.0

How he reacts will tell you everything you need to know. If the dancing and hands up in the air is a cover story, it's one bf made up on the fly to you, I'm positive that bf won't know to say that if it didn't happen. 

But, again OP, I really think you already know he's lying to you and *something else*  happened. So what matters to you? Does it matter what happened? Or is the lying the problem? Because that already happened and you know this deep down. If it's the degree of the lie that is important to you then keep pushing for the truth. But, if your trust is already broken, it doesn't matter to ""prove"" he lied or cheated. You don't need proof to break up with someone.

"climatechange","t5_2rawx","Atlas‚Äôs key purpose is to provide right wing groups with well-researched talking points, media strategies, funding and tools (like bot networks and targeted advertising) to persuade people to support their agenda.¬†

Across the anglosphere this work is often also supported by extensive right wing press ownership, sympathetic to these messages and methods and who have had a large hand in helping develop them. Well known examples are the Murdoch empire, Sinclair in the US, and NZME/ZB locally. Recently there is another level of more extreme local operations helping push the Overton window even further back in time; viz. InfoWars, Bannon, GBTV, and locally we have that cooker radio and The Platform.¬†

We can see the same tactics and objectives repeatedly used across democracies since the late 80s and becoming ever more sophisticated since. Brexit, The Voice referendum, Trump himself are all products of these efforts. The Act party is essentially a political manifestation of these groups agendas in NZ.¬†

Their messages are necessarily manipulation because the ideas they are supporting have been disproven by science and history. They are anti-human and anti-planet.¬†
They are holding onto lies and pushing doubt and fear about positive change. When in power, they blame their inevitable policy failures on outgroups; immigrants, women, black people, immigrants, jews, immigrants, trans people, immigrants and also¬†sometimes¬†immigrants just to switch it up.¬†

Knowledge that these networks exist, that they are well funded and experienced, knowledge of the techniques they use and the reasons they continue to pursue these goals is essential to inoculate people from these messages. But as we can see they are currently very successful.¬†",1719792090.0

"ExecutiveAssistants","t5_37qwv","Dang so much story - anyways - the real decision here is how much do you hate working there? I would grab a piece of paper and print $125k + 5 weeks vacation. In size 32 font on it. Give him that. See what he says.

What you need to understand about your situation is that them paying you what you deserve is not enough anymore, right. They had all this to pay you what you're worth. Now, they have to make it up to you. On top of that, it's a steaming load of BS and you don't like doing that, so they should pay for it as well.

My story: I was in a job where I figure I should've made about $65k a year, but was making about $48k .. I was talking to my boss about getting a raise, blah blah.. I was a kid - stayed there for 3 years getting the runaround. When I finally tendered my resignation, boss came running with $65k on the paper - well.. I told him that I appreciate his effort but that he ""would have to show me that he wants me to stay"" and I would ""Really like to feel appreciated"" as well as ""recognition for the job I've done"" (I've basically turned around one of the businesses the company acquired, went from $400k before me to $800k year1, $1M year2 and $1.2M year3...). Crickets after that. From what I've heard, the business is pretty much where I left it - there was so much room for improvement, I could've had it up to $2M in two more years I bet.

Looking back at my last decade in the reserve, the only tangible benefit USAR afforded me was getting the post 9/11 GI bill eligibility transferred to my child.  Outside of that, USAR has not offered me any meaningful training, rarely pays me on time and is an unnecessary strain on my family and civilian job and generally a massive time suck.  The fact I'm close enough to my 20 year letter is the only reason I haven't quit.

Law school is a big endeavor and ensuring you have the time to do right by yourself for your future makes so much more sense than joining USAR.  The extra time to focus on getting the grades you need, networking and thriving in that environment is key.  Most of my USAR units were metrics obsessed and expected a lot more time beyond the 48 MUTAs and 12 AT days they paid you for, but somehow still found a way to do absolutely nothing of value in that time.  Any money you make in USAR is going to come at the expense of your time to study and more importantly, your mental well being.

"MemePiece","t5_2tt3v",">  If we assumed that kaido is just a coward and rat. that doesn't make him a bad character lol. it just makes him human

1 It makes him a fraud.

2.Kaido isn't a human, he's an oni.

> all of your claims are misconceptions and straight up lies

Nope. You just can't accept the fact that Kaido isn't a good character like you think he is.

> Kaido didn't make a deal with Oden, the deal was with orochi

What are you talking about?

Kaido and Orochi made a deal with Oden. The Beast Pirates shot poisoned arrows at the citizens after Oden attacked Orochi.

> kaido didn't even know who Oden is at this point

Wrong. Kaido [knew](https://i.ibb.co/HxYVfyS/IMG-20240701-001547.png) who Oden was at this point.

> this was an interference that he didn't like

Doesn't change the fact that he used it to his advantage.

> that's because he is a human

He's not human.

> Kaido is a character with complex psychology who core topic is the paradox of hope and projecting hopelessness to cope with his hope

Blud tryna gas it up.

Complex psychology? Where?

Paradox of hope and projecting hopelessness to cope with his hope? Where?

> a character about founding connection and understanding within a world where he feels that he is alone because he is fated to be alone

It was his decision to be a warmonger and tyrant. Stop trying to portray him as tragic.

> yet his human nature makes him hope for this impossible connection

First of all, he isn't human. Secondly, he was never shown to hope for a impossible connection. You're making things up to portray him as more complex than he is.

> in the execution, Kaido said to Oden. ""your death will be remembered"" but Oden answered ""I don't care, I only want to pass my will"". this is complicated so I won't go deep into it but basically this was where the disconnect between kaido and Oden started

They never had a connection to begin with.

Oden hated Kaido and Kaido only respected Oden's strength.

That's all there is to it.

Stop trying to make it look deeper than it is.

> Kaido became even more depressed after it. He didn't care about what orochi would do after that

He wouldn't care what Orochi would do after that even if he wasn't depressed.

> but we know that he hates orochi. we saw how he ""killed"" him without a second thought

Kaido ""killed Orochi"" because he spoke out of turn. Not because he hated him. Kaido liked Orochi, he was valuable ally to him. He was shown enjoying the scene when the citizens laughed at Yasuie's death because of SMILE.

> kaido went to oden's house seeking momonosuke. he wanted momonosuke to be the next Oden, someone that he can connect with after the failure of Oden. but momo was a disappointment as he couldn't even speak his own name

Pure headcanon. Kaido didn't even know that Oden had a son, be learned that after Oden died, and he went to Oden's castle to kill Oden's family. But yes, he was disappointed by how weak Momonosuke was compared to Oden.

> well. here is the plot twist. there is nothing called oni. it is actually ogre. this is used in japanese to describe people who are large and scary like kaido

That's your headcanon.

Kaido literally has horns.

Kaido and Yamato are Oni/Ogre. Their race could be be descendents from Oars's race.

> Kaido is a human

A giant with horns is a human?

> but kaido for his whole life was treated as a weapon. a tool that can only fight. people feared him. He thought that he could never make an actual connection with someone because others just fear him he can't understand the weak and can't connect with them. but he was angry that yamato found friendship. not just that but also became his enemy. if his blood can't understand him, then who can?

Bruth. Everything you just said is made up.

From ""Kaido thinking that he could never make an actual connection with someone because others just fear him"" to him being angry that Yamato doesn't understand him.

You keep making things up to portray him as more complex than he is. Kaido was never shown to even try making connections with others. He always only cared about strength alone.

> what you have are just misconceptions. if you understood kaido properly. you will know that he is one of the best fictional antagonists

You must be reading Two Piece. He isn't even One Piece's best antagonist, and you think that he's one of the best fictional antagonists? I can think of at least thousand antagonists that are far better written.

> that's a lie

No it's not.

> I mean you can theorize about kaido's origins and how it is connected to the battlefield. but we got a confirmation

No we didn't. We don't know anything about his oni origins, who his parents are, etc. All his flashback did was repeat the same message, that Kaido is strong, which we already knew.

> we understand his connection with the concept of joyboy and he is actually a man who wanted to save the world

????

Kaido is pure evil. He has no redeeming qualities. He's a liar, hypocrite, coward, tyrant, and murderer. He abused, tortured, and killed people just because he felt like it. He boiled someone in oil, abused his own child and turned a country into a wasteland. He has no honor. He was already pure evil before he even learned about Joyboy. And no, Kaido respecting strong people isn't a redeemable quality. Kaido is not a deep character.

> this isn't repeated stuff. it is a short yet masterful flashback

Kaido's flashback: [""Kaido is strong Kaido is strong Kaido is strong""](https://i.ibb.co/FWg3nMm/Grid-Art-20240701-015909510.jpg)

And you're calling Kaido's flashback masterful? NahhhüíÄ

> they weren't actually modes lol. naming the modes was just comedy

It was a unnecessary and confusing gag.

> drunk kaido has some of the best self-reflections in wano though. ""maybe it was just not meant to be""

It took him 20 years to self reflect?

> kaido's character is about the paradox of hope, the meaning of connection, what it means to be a human and what truly matters when it comes to life

Whatever you say.

> I hope you accept that you just misunderstood him and maybe reread the arc? or watch a video because he is a generational character

Nah I'm good. I reread the Oden flashback and Roofpiece a bunch of times, and Kaido is mid as a character. You wanna know great antagonists? Tsurumi, Griffith, Johan, Meruem, etc, those are top tier antagonists. Kaido lacks their intelligence, charisma, and writing.",1719792094.0

When an experienced player finally has enough experience with Master Modes that they're comfortable sharing their thoughts, that's cool too (even if they have some negative feedback).

"cycling","t5_2qhyi","Here a counter of each of those points (I have both AXS and Di2):

1. I would say it‚Äôs more reliable so far than mechanical, no more shift cable to replace. Even better if you are internally routed. 30,000km later, I have replaced nothing.
2. They all connect to your head unit. It will happens if you disregard the warning at 25% (at which point you still have 500km), the alert at 15% (300km left) that beep and warn you at the start and end of the ride. Then you disregard that your front stop shifting (100km left). Then you will be stuck without battery. I mean at that point I would be more worried for your brakes, you probably don‚Äôt look at them ever even if someone tell you many times to check them.
3. It‚Äôs very reliable, very hypothetical situation where they may (or not) be a side road fix on a mechanical. I prefer my odds on an electronic groupset than the risk of a snapped shift cable. Overall electronic is more reliable, not less.
4. That‚Äôs a bike company problem. You can also order a 105 di2 from Asia for $700. 
5. I ride in a tropical climate. I never heard of anyone around here having di2 or axs problems. Bottom bracket and chains are bigger concern in rain.",1719792094.0

 **I'm a bit tired of people saying how much worse Japan is.** 

 I know this may not be the best place, but I'm tired of people saying how much worse Japan is. Sure, I get the intention of trying to help me, but it's annoying. Every place in the world has some kinda problem. I'm the kind of person who wants the structure Japan has, and I just like it. I feel like people are trying to play up how bad it is. They make it seem like some kind of dystopia. Sure, I'll get treated differently and it'll be hard at first, but let people live where they want.

For the players, the trick is going in prepared. That means scrying and divination galore, learning everything about the boss and the lair before they start.

check that you are not over watering potted plants as that can provide them with a good ecosystem to reproduce in as well.

and there is supposed to be standing water in all of your drains, that water is there to prevent sewer gas from coming up and out the pipes. if one goes dry you will smell it. 

id recommend that you also check all opened dry goods, if you have misidentified the insect you're having a problem with then it could very likely been a panty pest of some kind feeding off an open bag of flower or such things.

you can also use Zevo Flying insect killer to help thin the numbers down a bit so they are less annoying. its mainly peppermint and rosemary so its safe to use in most places, but its not going to be as effective as synthetic options. but ive used it in my own home and it will work to a degree",1719792096.0

The fact that you can't acknowledge that there is only one reason why we need to vote for Biden tells me that you're not being objective nor are you paying attention. 

There are tons of reasons to vote for Biden and against any other opponent. I'd say plenty of reasons not to vote for him, but when our choices are literally maintaining our democracy and freedoms vs losing them under republican control, there is only one reason that matters. I would vote for a pile of shit over Trump any day. I would vote for a cockroach or a monkey or god damn cinderblock over Trump. 

It doesn't matter who is running against Trump. When the literal worst case scenario exists with Trump, the other option automatically wins. That is the objective truth and the only thing that matters in November. 

I can give you a long list of reasons why Biden is doing well and will continue to do well. I can give you a list of reasons why Trump did terrible and will continue to do terrible if he wins. But only one reason matters to vote for Biden.",1719792096.0

"Fire","t5_2qx4j","I'll just list the pro's and con's of having parents who FIREd, as an adult child of such:

Pros:  
-I've benefitted IMMENSELY from learning how to handle money. They helped me get started investing early, encouraged me to stay out of debt, and encouraged me to work from a young age. \*Almost\* priceless.   
-I am VERY!!!! Glad they will not be dependent on me financially in old age. I can at least sleep at night knowing they won't become my dependents. 

Cons:  
-We lived like we were on the poverty line, which caused my sibling and I both IMMENSE distress as children and young adults. We were both convinced we were about to end up on the street, but really, they just saved a ton for retirement.  
-Knowing THEIR financial success was largely aided by their parents' generosity-- large monetary gifts, free childcare, and interest-free lending for large purchases. These are privileges that they can't or won't show my sibling and I because they retired so early, but were instrumental in their accomplishment.   
-""Potential inheritance"" is dangled over our heads at every turn, but it's more realistic that that money will evaporate with inflation, increasing healthcare costs, and their inflated lifestyle now that they feel richer. 

FWIW, I have a mostly positive relationship with my parents, but it really sucks to be ""bootstrapping"" out here while I know they were able to FIRE largely because their parents had helped them out significantly. I just don't think they know how helpful even the smallest slice of help is when you're young and starting out.",1719792097.0

Or do nothing

I went with the 2k because he was only 3 years old at the time, had his whole life ahead of him.

It worked! But we all got off lucky. Though... now that he's 9, I'm not so sure I would do the same if the issue reoccurs. It was very hard on him and he basically lost an entire half year of his life in healing, which is a lot for a dog. Dog wheelchairs in reality are not the cute thing you see on instagram.

"uscg","t5_2rcfq","It looks like you're looking for information about joining the Coast Guard. There are a very high volume of these posts on a regular basis so they are restrcited to the Weekly Recruiting Thread at the top of the sub. Members of the Coast Guard are responsible for attempting to find the information they need before they ""ask a Chief"". Do your best to use the resources that have been created for people like to you answer your query before you ask a potentially redundant question on our sub. It will also prepare you for the culture of our service. 

Before you post your question, please start by checking out the [Coast Guard Recruiting Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.gocoastguard.com/faq) page. 

Try using the [Sub-Reddit search bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/uscg/search?q=&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all) to find threads with questions similar to yours. People have provided thoughtful responses and links that you'd likely want to see. 

Our Recruiting Corps uses [this manual](https://media.defense.gov/2018/May/16/2001917927/-1/-1/0/CIM_1100_2F.PDF) to do their job. Try giving it a search (download it and use contrl-f to search) to see if your situation has been outlined. Coast Guard manuals are often easy to read and understand. Your question in the Recruitng Thread will be much more likely to get an answer if you mention that you've read the manual and is framed around a specific situation outlined in it. 

Finally, if you've exhausted the above, post your specific question in the [Weekly Recruiting Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/uscg/search?q=Weekly+Recruiting+Thread&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all). General quesitons will get general answers. Try and be specific. It's better to add a comment with many, specific items that you want answered than to ask a simple ""what's life like at a station for a non-rate""? type query. 

Good luck on your recruiting journey. The Coast Guard is an excellent career full of opportunity.

"passive_income","t5_2v763","There's lots of constructive ways to make more money with $2000.  Because it's not much money, you have to focus on what you can leverage/  Dropshipping would be OK, but it's going to take a while to get the sales pipeline up before you make anything.  

Let's do some thinking: make several spreadsheets on several businesses where you could invest this money into different very small businesses to make money.   Have you thought of buying $2000 worth of small things you can mark up 100% +  to resell individually? Do you live in a suburb?  If so make a spreadsheet and put buying several lawn mowers and seeing how much money you could make mowing lawns (and even hiring others to help)? 

Spend the time on these spreadsheets before you launch anything with Cost of Sales, amount of clients needed, and cost of marketing, etc. before diving in.  

As a serial entrepreneur I have lots of millionaire friends who are their money with simple ideas - screen printing T-shirts of college teams and selling them outside the arenas.... food carts selling hot dogs, ice cream, or burritos (harder because of licensing), craigslist buying and reselling.   

The key is knowing what would sell and then being in the right place.  You have to have a way to have customers be able to pay other than cash, so a fast Point of Sale via Stripe or other vendor is a necessity.  If you have the right product people want to buy in the right place you will make money.  Ice cold bottled water for $2 is a deal if you can get them for <$.50 per bottle.",1719792099.0

I'm hopeful that he's going to come soon. I'm pounding that ass and stroking that  
cock and there is this rhythm and I can see his muscles tense up and he closes  
his eyes....

I'm going to come.

Yes baby! Come for me! Come for momma!

I aim his cock at about a 45 degree angle up and back onto him. I've seen this  
before and he always has a huge load when his prostate is being stimulated. I'm  
fucking and pumping and he starts meeting my thrusts and arching his back and  
it happens.

He starts shooting way up into the air and onto his chest and neck. I'm delighted,  
smiling. 

Yes baby...damn!

He has like 3 or 4 spirts and it's thick and he's shooting far stronger than  
usual. I'm trying to aim and paint with his come and I'm still thrusting....

Ohhhh....uggggg......fuuuuuuuuuck where the noises he presented to me. I'm spent and I stop thrusting and his cock is oozing in my hand. I slowly pull out. We are both sweaty, slathered in  
lube and come. He's spent and his eyes are closed and I just hold him in my  
hand until he opens his eyes.

Good god babe, that was fucking amazing.

Yes it was. Are you good? 

Yes.

Come on. Let's shower. 

He gets up and starts the shower, I wash off and undress and we both jump in the  
shower. We hold each other, wash each other, kiss deeply.

dogs watching a movie. This was an amazing Sunday.

"Stellaris","t5_39cuc","Militarist-Spiritualist with Psionic Ascension can become pretty good. Their pops are on par with Modularity-pops when it comes to resource output. But I've never really done a proper build for them, always pretty much winging it. And generally, I rather focus on setting up a good late game, instead of rushing early- and midgame.

On that matter, Synthetic Ascension with the Physical Path and a Democratic Government works pretty well - not only do you get the modularity traits for your pops now, you also get +1% Specialist Resource Output per District on a planet from your government - so big planets will have a +30% Resources from Specialist Jobs or more in the late game on top of all the other modifiers - and you can turn conquered pops into your own superior pops.

In comparison to that, I found Virtuality to fall off a bit in the late game. Setting up your empire to support a large (as in: 5k+ Naval Capacity) navy, while also getting into repeatable technologies requires a creative build. I achieved it with some mix of Militarist-Materialist Ethic, appropriate Civics and Leader Starting Skill Level Cheese, but other builds have a much higher late game power potential.",1719792100.0

"AmIOverreacting","t5_4uoy2u","You cannot, ever, have a healthy relationship with an alcoholic. Right now, you are choosing to stay in a relationship with a very unhealthy man. You are choosing him over yourself. You are deciding you aren‚Äôt worthy of a healthy relationship with a healthy man. He has a serious problem (emphasis on the HE). 

The only thing to do here is separate from him. You must let him deal with his problems himself. You cannot reason with an alcoholic. Their brain is changed. You need to work on yourself, your boundaries, and making a life for yourself that brings you joy. By staying, it‚Äôs all about his alcoholism, but nothing about why you are keeping yourself in this situation. You need to switch your focus on to yourself and learn to love and respect yourself. 

I truly hope you take the overwhelming advice here to leave this relationship. I‚Äôm 5 years sober so this is coming from someone who has recovered from this insidious addiction. I did not piss the bed, abuse anyone or fuck up all the time, but I STILL lost everyone I cared about. Time to choose you. Time to love YOU.",1719792100.0

"UKmonarchs","t5_8zqn9x","Margaret of Anjou, Elizabeth Woodville, Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, and possibly Katherine Parr all deserve to be higher than Philippa of Hainault and Elizabeth of York. They were influential players who are all somewhat within the public consciousness (or extremely in the public consciousness when it comes to Anne Boleyn), which in my opinion is one of the key requirements when judging who is a significant consort. All of them pushed the bounds of what a consort should do ‚Äì Margaret basically led the Lancastrian faction during a civil war, Elizabeth Woodville's plotting ousted a king and got her descendants on the throne, without Anne Boleyn the most significant religious policy in the history of England would have never happened, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was the most dangerous woman in Europe, and Katherine Parr used her position as queen to become the first woman in England to publish under her own name. What did Elizabeth of York and Philippa of Hainault do other than fulfil the role that was expected of them? I don't think either of them should have done poorly in this vote, but they certainly shouldn't be top ten. 

Also, what some of the people in the final eight are being lauded for, others were criticised for. Isabella of France came 39th for rebelling against Edward II successfully, but Eleanor's failed rebellion against Henry II and sixteen-year imprisonment gets her a top spot? Isabella was a very solid queen for years before her rebellion, just like Eleanor was, so why the disparity in responses? If we are going to condemn Isabella's rebellion, we should certainly condemn Eleanor also, especially as her tenure in Aquitaine is totally irrelevant to this poll. On the other hand, Elizabeth of York and Philippa of Hainault fulfilled the role in a way that was expected of them, but so did Eleanor of Provence (23rd), Margaret of France (26th), Anne of Denmark (29th), Jane Seymour (35th), and Catherine of Valois (38th). Yeah, sure, there's issues of longevity, but to me it makes no sense that two very cookie cutter consorts have made the top ten while lots of other cookie cutter consorts were let go by the wayside ages ago, and genuinely significant consorts who are still poured over today struggled to get near top ten.",1719792101.0

He's still a high effort guy but has now realized his limitations and the clippers have been able to utilize what he's still good at in an appropriately sized role. 

He almost certainly cares about 1) being on a team with a shot at things and 2) being an actually useful, contributing part of a team even in a diminished role than he cares about a few more million in salary.

"Skincare_Addiction","t5_3fwbd","Welcome to r/skincare_addiction! We'd like to take this time to remind you of a few things:

#Do not ask for a diagnosis/treatment advice for acne or other medical conditions, and do not play doctor

What constitutes medical advice?
***

* ""What is this?"" 

 This is asking someone to diagnose the issue, and is medical advice.

* ""What should I do?""

This is asking someone to advise treatment, and is medical advice.

 * ""Should I go to the doctor?""

This is asking if you should seek treatment, and ergo, medical advice. 


**If you would ask the question of your doctor, it falls under this rule and not allowed. As a general rule, asking for medical advice from internet strangers is never a good idea. If you have questions regarding your acne or other medical condition, you are advised to contact your healthcare provider. If you are a medical provider, we would gently remind you that users are not patients, and you should not be offering medical advice to people who are not your patients.**

I do have some supportive people, but my husband is the one who wants me to just get over it.  I know he doesn't want to see me unhappy, but I just can't fake or change how I feel.  I also want to get another dog and he doesn't so we have that going on.  I am 62/retired so I don't have a job and the gap they left in my heart is so big.  One of my dogs followed me everywhere.  I like to quilt and my pup would just come in the room with me and sew with me all day.  Now, I'm alone.  My husband's attitude is making it far worse.  He's not a bad person, but can't deal with my grief.  I had the dogs before I met him, but he was with the dogs 10 years.  I don't know if he just isn't dealing or what.

She has a more ‚Äúspecialized‚Äù power from what I assume is someone around ‚Äúpowerful guardian tier‚Äù but she also had billions of years to learn how to use that

Admittedly, this plays with some pagan classical tropes, but so do the mosaics of Ss. Peter and Paul in Roman churches. 

Now... you can argue as to whether Washington were saintly enough, but he did demonstrate a fair level of religious piety as well as care for his country and people.

"autism","t5_2qhs6","Something involving loud noises. Trying new things or being in new places especially like I said if there's a lot of noise in the background. It's like my brain and I just more or less start to shut down and I get really quiet, sometimes frantic depending. 

People standing close by and staring at me (happens quite often with customers because I work in retail and will sometimes have a line of people build up waiting for me to help them) It both irritates me and gives me an intense feeling of discomfort so much so I will turn my body away from whoever is staring at me while I do what I'm supposed to because seeing them in the corner of my eye like that is too much. It just feels very invasive. 

Another work related situation but when one of my managers is doing stuff within my section of the store and feeling like he's listening in on my interactions with customers. Again it's the invasive feeling on my space. If anything his presence there makes me perform WORSE. 

Not knowing where my belongings are.

Phone calls, lol.

Driving, driving is terrible. I don't know how people manage to do it, focusing and remembering everything they should about the road. So much multitasking, I just find it way too overstimulating.

One comment in particular brought me to the realization of how beautiful this community is, and I was being kept from experiencing how beautiful it was because I was constantly worrying about her being happy. About her approving of my decisions. 

We're definitely gonna sit down and talk about this going forward. I will make sure that she's 200% sure it was a consensual experience. If it wasn't and he hurt her in any way, I will update you guys when they release me.

- you aren't playing around cover enough. Jiggle peaking is the new meta.


- I know you are cracked with kbm, but you need to slow down and think. You are running around everywhere.


- you need to play off your team more. You over commit to fights too often, jumping out of position and cover, and getting yourself killed. But when you need to commit to a fight and just run to it, you stay away from it, looking at angles for enemies that aren't there, when they're already at the fight killing your teammates.


- you are a free kill. There are a few times where you are living behind cover, and then you jump out while one shot getting yourself killed.


- you are not positioning thoughtfully. More over point 2, but you need to recognize what areas you are allowed to traverse and what areas are dangerous. This isn't a yes or no list of spaces on the map, but constantly changing invisible boundaries based on where your teammates are positioned and where they spawn, and also sightlines, because those can stretch cross-map.


- this one is easier, use your bandit. The commando is good if you want something to swap to, or catch someone off guard, but you shouldn't be maining the gun.

[Bellona, a very big wolf, is trying to find a date for the Coexistence Dance, where herbivores and carnivores are supposed to come as mixed couples.]

**Series of shots - INT. Cherryton campus - Week before the dance**

*-Bellona is coming out of a classroom behind a yak. Bellona is half a head taller then the yak.*

Bellona: Excuse me. I'm looking for a date for the dance. You know, a mixed couple. Would you like to...?

*The yak looks up at Bellona.*

Yak: Ah...I have a date.

*-In a lecture classroom, Bellona leans over towards the zebra sitting next to her.*

Bellona (half whispers): Do you want to go to the dance with me?

Zebra: Nope.

*-Bellona is standing in a hallway, looking up at an Indian elephant. The elephant shakes his head.*

*-In a hallway, Bellona is taking a couple of long strides to catch up with the flamingo in front of her. The flamingo trots to avoid Bellona.*

**INT. School Cafeteria - Lunchtime, several days before the dance**

*Bellona is standing at a table of four boy herbivores.*

Bellona: No one?

*All the boys shake their heads.*

Bellona: What is it? Why can't I get a date? And no one is asking me. It can't be just my size. Even boys bigger than me are turning me down. Is it because I'm a wolf? Maybe it's just me.

I should bring Lucy along to ask for me. Then they'd see I'm not so scary. How embarrassing, having your little sister fix you up with a date.

Hina: I'll go to the dance with you.

*Bellona turns around to see it is Hina (a white-tailed deer doe) talking to her.*

Hina: I can't go with who I want and I wouldn't mind being seen with a big wolf girl.

Bellona: Thanks Hina, but I'm not into girls.

"precure","t5_2tov2","To be honest, I never truly believed that would become Cures. I'll be happy if I was wrong, but right now all I see is hopeful speculation from people, and that's not enough for me.",1719792106.0
"OpenDogTraining","t5_2zw8v","No shame for whatever you decide to do as long as it prioritizes her quality of life. In the meantime, maybe you can try to get creative to prove to her you are safe and you will keep her safe. Research, ask a trainer, and pay very close attention to the body language and what makes your dog comfortable. Show her that you're safe and will provide her with things to help. 
A towel wrapped tightly but gentle around the head to cover the ears and slow petting really calms my dog down but it took more than 6 months to really make this a ritual of ours so he knows to trust it. If his triggers cause barking, I go bark at that shit too, just once or twice, then I stand and act all tough but like I'm sneakily checking if the threat left, and he'll mimic me. Then I say good job and we go inside. We defeated the threat together and I didn't invalidate his fear of the noise. I gave him confidence. 

It's weird but it's the only thing that worked for my highly anxious high energy rescue dog. 

My dog isn't perfect but we have a communicative bond now and it makes ongoing training easier.",1719792107.0

Does this mean the Allies‚Äô crimes were equal to the axis‚Äô? Does this mean in particular Hitler and Hirohito‚Äôs atrocities were exaggerated? Fuck no.

However, for example: Does this mean stalin‚Äôs brutality was exaggerated? Yes. 

The common narrative of Stalin‚Äôs death toll as an example of his atrocities range from 40-100 million, when actually, it was more like 6 million. The death toll in the tens of millions includes deaths of Nazis, deaths of Soviets fighting Nazis, and categorizes declining birth rates as a result of better conditions and industrialization as murder, even though these supposed people never even existed.

If you have all your mushrooms in one photo it means that the larger the number the less detail we can see and it gets difficult or impossible to be confident as a result quite quickly.

Personally I disagree with the suggestion of numbering them as this means they are likely to be spread out more (meaning they are more distant and we can see less) and because this usually results in people using white paper backgrounds which due to the contrast often means even less detail is visible.

# GIVEAWAY RULES

Thank you, u\/ItWasAllAMeme23, for hosting a giveaway!

Posters of Giveaways

* Do not post codes in the clear, this is a good way to have it taken by a bot or lurker
* Making a game of it is not required, but it's more fun to have someone to directly give it to
* It's happened plenty of times in the past where someone redeemed and never said they got it, or even a thank you.

Winners

* Unless ***explicitly*** stated by the OP, codes won in giveaways are not to be resold or traded
* Codes won/received in giveaways must be redeemed by the winner, or can be given to friends/family
* Only redeem the portion won, ie if you win an iTunes redemption, ONLY redeem on iTunes.  Any other redemptions are not yours, and redemption/trade/sale of un-gifted redemptions constitutes theft.
* ***Selling/Trading codes won, or redeeming/selling/trading redemptions that are not given to you will result in a permanent ban***

Lastly, ***giveaways do not count for either party for flair purposes.***

Hi guys! I usually look for solutions instead of asking for help, but I'm desperate. I was using my Razer Barracuda X Quartz Edition headphones to play on the Xbox Series X, as usual. At the same time, I had the dongle connected to my PC. I‚Äôve been doing this for months, and I‚Äôve never had any problems.

When I returned to the PC and disconnected the headphones from the Xbox controller, they simply stopped working. The light is green, and everything on the PC indicates that the headphones are functioning. I can even pause and resume videos or songs using the on/off button on the headset, but they don't emit any sound.

Not even on my cell phone. They only work when connected directly with the audio cable.

I've already updated the drivers and the headset itself. If anyone has a solution, I would appreciate it!",1719792108.0

"Eldenring","t5_122hf1","Yea I knew there was a reason I didn‚Äôt remember the move being a problem for me.

It looks like he does have different moves to follow the attack up on, however, it looks like he always slams down with the same move. 

Followed by either:

1. The move where he swings his left arm across, and then swings the same arm back the opposite way. 

2. Or alternatively he will do the same slam down, followed by the move where he brings both arms on his left, and swings his right arm followed by his left arm. 

Those were the only two variations I saw in my recordings. And it looked like the dodge window was the exact same for both moves, as it was basically just roll his actual slam, and delay a roll by just like half a second to give him time to wind up whatever follow up move he was gonna use, which both attacks looked to both just be dodge arm swing 1, and immediately roll again to dodge swing #2.",1719792108.0

I think most people have the same issues with this that they have with The Unnatural which is they are basically self indulgent projects from both DD and GA and you can tell.  I.e., GA in real life isn't shy about being more spiritual than religious and she wanted to explore that in TXF with Scully.  Meanwhile DD is of course very much into baseball and his whimsy was mixed into his episode.  Meanwhile, you have two relatively mid stories that are sandwiched between a beginning and ending with really great Mulder and Scully scenes, so while the episodes are largely solo projects, they get a pass due to the shippiness.

I personally like baseball and loved the episode for The Unnatural.  But other people prefer all things.",1719792109.0

It helped me think straight i would say. Helped me get rid of unreasonable overthinking and just generally helped me clear my mind, enough to make room for me to work on myself and improve. I would handle all kind of situations way better and would be able to see things as they are, but i would still put myself through them.. as i said, it's really different for everyone and mitra cleared my mind, while esci just made me a plant xd i am not sure how sa differs from person tho and why these therapies worked like that for me.

"ik_ihe","t5_39bxv","Ik heb het gevoel dat het collectief geheugen van Nederland een beetje verloren is gegaan tijdens de COVID...

Volgens mij is de COVID periode vooral een van slechte communicatie van de overheid, en hoewel hij zichzelf ook ergens een schouderklopje geeft over het feit dat COVID ""goed"" ging... het tegendeel is waar... het begint met het feit dat hij komt van ""we moeten allemaal het virus krijgen"" wat veel mensen interpreteerden als ""oh dus we kunnen gewoon doorgaan"", dan doet de overheid moeilijk over mondkapjes terwijl Duitsland al vanaf eind april 2020 een openbare mondkapjesplicht had. Tuurlijk deels ook de fout van Van Dissel, maar wie was ook alweer de baas? Wie kon hem vervangen zelfs toen Van Dissel strak volhield dat hij tegen maskers was, ookal waren alle andere experts van mening dat een mondkapjesplicht het virus vertraagt? We hebben meerdere momenten gehad dat het in Nederland totaal uit de hand liep, het virus, terwijl onze buren het allebei prima deden. Nederland schroefde de testcapaciteit totaal niet snel genoeg op (ook wat we van Duitsland konden leren). En laten we niet de avondklok rellen vergeten, waarom was dat alleen in Nederland? Er waren meerdere democratische landen met een avondklok een tijd, maar vanwege de vreselijke communicatie van de overheid, kregen WIJ die rellen. En wat doet de overheid daar tegen? Ze noemen de relschoppers ""tuig, een voor een"", en Rutte kwam met zijn populistische ""wij moeten ze allemaal in het gevang zetten"", terwijl justitie, zoals het hoort, zich vooral bezighield met het kijken van persoonlijke omstandigheden van de relschoppers, waaruit ook heel duidelijk naar voren kwam dat het jarenlange bezuinigen op de geestelijke gezondheidszorg een grote factor is dat deze rellen √ºberhaupt begonnen. Dat is Rutte's corona, slechte communicatie van een man die altijd zegt ""ik ben niet de baas, maar je ouders zijn de baas"", terwijl hij toch echt even een sterke leider moest zijn. En vervolgens zijn er mensenlevens verloren gegaan, sommige daarvan hebben we kunnen voorkomen, maar Rutte deed niet wat hij had moeten doen. En kom nou niet van ""maar anderen waren toch ook slechter?"" Het gaat niet om de vergelijking, hij had het ook beter kunnen doen, dat is wat we verwachten, we willen het beste voor Nederland, en Rutte is dat nooit geweest.",1719792109.0

A ""late"" period is not in itself cause for alarm! Most women are a bit irregular and even if you believe yourself to have a perfect clockwork cycle, it's normal and common to occasionally have one that doesn't fit the mold. Please refer to this post.

[Your period isn't late (amipregnant version)](https://www.reddit.com/r/amipregnant/comments/oy9jjs/your_period_isnt_late_amipregnant_version/)

If you believe your absent period is genuinely a sign of pregnancy, take a test.

It is really, really well done faux wood grain. Hard to tell unless you get super close. And if the door had been in good condition, we would have left it as-is.

But there was a storm/security door installed for a long time, and the facade was not water-tight, and so the whole bottom of the frame had rotted. Our contractors have started to repair that (and also some missing chunks of curved moulding around the window), which is what you can see in the photos.

Matching the existing faux grain over the repairs would be virtually impossible. And since these doors were historically painted colorfully (the faux grain is probably from the 70s), we're going to lean into that history (and match the other similar doors in the neighborhood)",1719792110.0

Debit cards that ran on there own network and the network portals at business where free and net based with VPN protection .  With every day that goes by the more people lose complete trust in central bank currencies and the way any gov spends or collects the money they work for.  Right now XMR trades around what Solana does and the only thing I see about Solana is it's ability to host 100 scams a day .  Being able to build other applications off XMR prevents everything that would make the above possible if it was it would be worth more than Bitcoin and XMR would be widely used by more than politicians to accept bribes.

- United Kingdom: 7%¬†
- Canada: 6%¬†
- Australia: 4%¬†
- Germany: 3%

American Reddit users by race, according to Pew:

- White: 70%
- African: 7%
- Hispanic: 12%¬†
- Other non-Hispanic: 11%

Asians didn‚Äôt have their own category so I assume Asians are ‚ÄúOther non-Hispanic‚Äù but others will be in this category so it‚Äôs not a complete 11% that are Asian users.

Considering European-Americans are the dominant users on Reddit, and Asian are least likely to use it, the r/AsianParentStories sub is substantial.

There are bad parents of every race and ethnicity, but if you compare Asian experiences to others, Asian parents are more ruthless and extreme.

But from the other side of that, the multiverse is a bit of a universal thing once introduced. DC/WB has made it so there's reason to consider all live-action stuff part of multiverse. The DCEU had a minor crossover with the Arrowverse. The Flash film crossed over with the old Burton films, and several others.

Marvel is following a similar path, throwing in previous Spideys, introducing overlap with the Fox films etc.",1719792112.0

If you have minors playing the game, Trust and Safety has an obligation to protect them from objectional content.

The M4A1 and the Bushmaster M4 are very different things that have almost nothing to do with each other aside from cosmetics. The Bushmaster M4 was basically an AR-15 with a shorter barrel chambered for 5.56 to make a semiautomatic cosmetically similar to the M4A1. 

That does make for an interesting question, however. The AR-15 wasn't anywhere near as popular before the awb. It wasn't even particularly well regarded at that time and by far not anywhere near as prolific. Would the AR-15 even really be a thing in the US in the year 2000.",1719792113.0

Prior to my diagnosis, I had just dislocated my hip and was having near-fainting episodes in the shower. It took me exactly one year to get a diagnosis after an initial doctor told me I had anxiety and basically told me to fuck off. Now having a diagnosis, I‚Äôm not treated like garbage because I look perfectly fine on the outside. It also led to my daughter‚Äôs diagnosis so she doesn‚Äôt have to advocate for herself as much as I‚Äôve had my entire life. Especially after spending about 10 years in active misery.

And to answer the initial question: my treatment plan is really just is to work out for the rest of my life to build muscle and reduce the strain on my joints.

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","I'm Evangelical. I like all Christian as brother and sisters.
Differences in leadership aside.
I agree with many things.
Spoken with many different Christians.
I rarely see ""hate"" like all Catholics are evil.

Seeing a lot of of comments here that think some of us dislike you because of how ""original"" or ""old""  Catholic denomination is.

Yeah.
That's is not it and you're very far off.

However if Catholics are disliked. It is for the following reasons.

1. History and politics. Catholics vs Protestant conflict run deep in many ethnic groups like Scots and Irish. Many of those ethnic groups eventually settled in Southern USA.

2. Papal domination. The Pope's extraordinary power and the lack of any checks/balances against him is unparalleled in any other denomination. It makes many weary his seat could become a entry point for an anti christ. Certainly there have been wicked Popes before and the Church has an attitude of ""suffer"" through them.
Rather than vote them out.

3. Catholic aid organisations have been extensively facilitating large numbers of illegal migrants into the US southern border. 

4. US catholic politicians who openly support abortion and other woke garbage. They always dominate the Left Wing and Liberal spectrum.
Yet the Vatican and Pope never denounces them or punishes them for their ungodliness.
Instead they get a hug and a selfie with Francis.
It screams phony.
 Pelosi, Biden, John Kerry, Kennedy dynasty, AOC etc.

5. All Christians who aren't even Catholic receive backlash from the large scale catholic pedo problems/ sex abuse of recent years.
That was largely facilitated by higher ups who protected priests from being prosecuted in large numbers.

People have bullied me about it and I didn't even know what happened until recently. Athiests and Libs could not care less what denomination you are.",1719792114.0

"ADHDUK","t5_3wfrq","I can't directly answer your question of what you should do or recommend a book on how to make decisions, but this is my advice to try and relieve the anxiety of feeling aimless:

The reason why ADHD is considered a disability is because it makes it harder to operate in a neurotypical world.

One of the neurotypical things that we struggle with is maintaining our focus long enough to see a goal through to completion. 

We are raised to believe that setting goals and sticking at them long term is a marker of success in our society. When someone with ADHD tries to follow this pattern they end up struggling and failing.

I'm not trying to be a deafeatist, I've found a lot of joy and success in changing the way I look at things.

When I started to really think about it, there are plenty of other ways to define success.  

I try not to set myself up for failure by setting goals which directly opposed my ADHD.  I have a new hobby most weeks, if I were to set the goal of sticking to one of them for a year I would undoubtedly fail. But that's not my skill.  Where I excel is that I can gain excitement and become obsessed with a near limitless number of unrelated subjects every week.  A better goal for me would be to learn about 5 new topics I didn't know anything about.   My brain is good at that whereas most people's brains aren't.  Ok so I haven't stuck at a single goal for more than a few weeks, but I have learnt how to brew beer, design 3d models, and fix basic plumbing problems.  None of those achievements will change my life, but I've had loads of fun being engrossed in those activities, and when I talk to my friends who meet their goals they mostly spend their evenings watching TV, so I'm not sure I'm failing.

I met up with some old colleagues who were judgemental about the number of times I've changed job in the past few years (or in their eyes struggled to keep a job), but when I look back I've had 4 jobs with some pretty varied experiences which I really enjoyed and engaged with. Ultimately, I may not have been able to hold down a job in their eyes, but that doesn't mean I'm a failure. I've had fun in every role I've had, and if I'd stayed at the same company I wouldn't have had the same amount of fun, and every job I've had has paid my bills.

Some dubious, but maybe practical advice is: I'm a manager at work and decisions often fall to me, but I struggle with decision paralysis, and not knowing what to do.  If I catch myself doing that I pick an option by instinct (or failing that flip a coin).  This sometimes leads to me making the wrong decision, but I've found it doesn't really matter as long as you're willing to admit your mistake and change the plan when it's clear it won't work. Everyone makes mistakes, but I think that people with ADHD often let perfectionism blind them from their success.",1719792116.0

To cook for yourself, you need to plan far in advance and make sure to buy certain things when you're at the grocery store, even if you don't know what you might want to eat tomorrow let alone 3 days from now.  Preparing a list, driving to the grocery store, navigating an unfamiliar space, checking out, driving home, and unpacking the groceries could be a 2 hour process.

Then there's the time needed to prepare the food and the risk you might mess up.  After it is made, you need to clean up all the dishes.  This might run another 90 minutes altogether.  That means the guy is spending like 3-3 1/2 hours on a subpar meal.

Or, he can just go up to the local fast food joint depending on his immediate craving, order, eat, throw away any trash, and be back home in less than an hour.",1719792117.0

"Amtrak","t5_2rbwq","Difficult yes, not cheap (not that expensive either). Part of the reason why host railroads don't want more Amtrak service is that Amtrak pays pennies on the dollar for its track access - something like $4 or 5 per train mile. Even relatively cheap international examples have the market rate of a passenger train at least double that. With limited track capacity Amtrak might pay in the order of $40/train mile over the pass. The other option is to build UP extra capacity in exchange for cheap slots - they would probably agree to this.

I think if Amtrak paid a not insubstantial sum to buy slots or just to add some double tracking it would be okay. In 2012 a $100 million project was to lay 5 sections of double track, but only 2 were built for $25 million - enhancing capacity by 12% (extra 6 trains a day). If UP wanted say an additional 8 slots for themselves, and 8 for Amtrak (remember each Amtrak train is about the slots of 4 freight trains) that would need another $160 million. It is expensive, but not insurmountable.",1719792117.0

My pool cleaner charges $150 a month to clean my pool once a week.  Every other month or so he will no show a visit.  So essentially, he cleans the pool 3x, not 4x.   I always pay the $150 in full regardless.  Last month he pulled the same b.s.    I paid him $112.50 last month.   I subtracted the $37.50 for the no show.   

My wife said I'm being cheap and that he's just a kid trying to make a living.   I contest that I'm paying for 4 visits and will only pay $150 for 4 visits.   WITF would I pay the full balance for him to not adhere to our monthly contract ?

I dislike planes. Too long to board, usually more expensive, worse for the environment,less load etc.
I'm always envious of other EU countries where you can board a train and cross like 3 countries.

Contact prints are beautiful and easy to do but 4x5 is just a little too small. Obviously 8x10 is fabulous for contact printing but the equipment is hugely, massively bigger, heavier, more expensive and less easy to find. I believe there are two 8x10 enlargers in Australia, only one is working and it's in private hands. Quite a lot of choice in film.

Which brings us to 5x7... not much larger than 4x5, most 4x5 lenses cover 5x7.  Great size for contact prints. Film choice is limited, mostly b+w. Enlargers like the Durst 138 are around but are big, heavy, expensive, industrial grade.",1719792119

There's a reason for that: the industry was missing something, and we filled that void. While I might not be perfect, our service is 10/10. Just listen to some of our members' comments‚Äîyou don't stick with something for 2 years unless it's good. We have members who have been with us for over 5 years. We've bridged the gap between local shops and online sales, benefiting both manufacturers and consumers because we delve deeper.



All the talk about us selling overruns or throwaways is simply untrue. Yes, Farm Rolled cigars are overruns, but that means they're the same cigars from the same factories that produce your so-called big brands, just without the bands. Criticism is inevitable, but if the cigars are good, buy more. If they‚Äôre not, don‚Äôt.

"retrogaming","t5_2qk6v","We got our NES in 1989. Lots of kids had one, and in my memory, somewhere between 5 and 12 games.

It ended up really shaping my view on what makes great artwork. I also had Rockin Kats somehow or another. 

To me one of the biggest differences in attitudes to gaming then and now is that it was perfectly acceptable to not be able to beat a game even after countless hours of play. You just weren't guaranteed to beat a game, and it wasn't a fundamental flaw with game design if you couldn't. In fact, beating a game was infinitely more uncommon.

"Patriots","t5_2rx57","Just as a disclaimer‚Äî sorry if you don‚Äôt like my format of replies, my ADHD will struggle if I reply without it lol.

>I don‚Äôt feel like clicking on links to data, so I‚Äôll take your word for it that you‚Äôre doing both. All I‚Äôm saying is when your argument is predicated on saying that the Pats were the 23rd ranked line‚Ä¶

The link grades out every OL, assigns point totals, and then sets an average (0).  The Patriots were closer to 0 than the bottom of the league (somewhere around -7, -8).  No rankings, their quantity of points is closer to average than the bottom.

>I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm missing the problem at all. The whole point is that the line is terrible, not that the other things didn‚Äôt make it worse... 

You‚Äôre still missing the point here.  The line itself is independent of everything else, their performance is independent of everything else, *how they look* can be changed by everything else.  The QB play in 2019, for example, by Brady was not bad, it just looked worse because of the surroundings.  

>Even Mahomes wasn‚Äôt able to overcome an abysmal O-line in the Super Bowl against the Bucs, though I completely agree that he makes a mediocre line seem much better than it is. Plus, we don‚Äôt have good receivers, so whether or not the line would look better with them is immaterial...

Mahomes‚Äô OL in that Super Bowl was far, far worse than what the Patriots have right now.  He also made the line play worse.    I don‚Äôt think it is immaterial because it represents the potential of the offense.  If the OL is bad and they get good receivers, they still could have some limitations due to the OL ‚Äî see the Dolphins ‚Äî but if the OL is good and they get good receivers, their OL could actually be an asset ‚Äî see the Texans.

>As for your claim that you could ‚Äúchange one spot‚Äù and make the line look like a top ten line: I agree with your general premise, though top ten seems a bit much...

I dunno, I don‚Äôt know many OLs in the league that have two good OTs plus a solid interior.  If the Patriots had Wirfs/Leverett/Andrews/Sow/Onwenu, for example, that would be a great OL.  That‚Äôs a hypothetical and obviously they didn‚Äôt do anything to that affect, but the point is that an atrocious OL would need more work than just one spot to be even close to good.

>As for Chuks: maybe he‚Äôs a mediocre tackle that will play 17-18 games, or maybe he‚Äôs a well-below average tackle who will play 17-18 games, in which case, I‚Äôd take Brown for 8...

If they had this year‚Äôs depth at OT, I‚Äôd agree.  But when your split is Trent Brown at OT for 8, Lowe for the other 9, I‚Äôll take the serviceable left tackle for 17.  *Especially* when the RT is a good player, allowing you to slide protections and help out the LT more.  The major problem I had with last year‚Äôs line is that there was *always* a really, really bad tackle on the field.  We only had 1.5 games of Trent pre-injury at LT and Onwenu at RT‚Äî and those games looked pretty good.  I think their current roster makes that very unlikely to happen again (unless disaster of injury luck strikes).

>I agree Strange would be a good addition‚Ä¶

Nick Leverett should give them some quality depth as well.  My hope is that one of the rookies pops, Leverett is their depth iOL guy, and then Strange can return at around the halfway point.

>I didn‚Äôt intend to say that they didn‚Äôt do anything to address the line issues‚Ä¶

My belief is just that the statistics are just so highly in favor of the OL improvement that it‚Äôs kinda pessimistic to think they‚Äôll be the same as last year.  

>My claims about the line being bad last year aren‚Äôt unsubstantiated...

I would appreciate if you kept this civil, I like you and enjoy talking ball with you.  If I said something to offend you, then I apologize.

I don‚Äôt think statistics are the only way of evaluating the OL, I think your argument is not substantiated because you haven‚Äôt actually argued it.  Which spots are the concern?  How much did it actually affect their offense? Where are the major issues?  Did they not do anything to fix those issues?

I saw one last year overall (though at points there were others, such as OG having a couple bad games due to depth ‚Äî looking at you, Mafi) - OT.  In which I think they traded an injury riddled, at times elite, at times horrible OT & a terrible OT for a bad-mediocre OT & a good OT.  Which, IMO, is a significant improvement because the impact of a bad OT is much less than an absolutely terrible one.

>LT: I am not convinced that Chuks and Brown are a push...

That‚Äôs fair, I just think when the backup is Vederian Lowe, you kinda are putting them in a significant hole.  While Chuks might not win you any games, Lowe was actively losing them.

>Strange at LT likely isn‚Äôt happening at the beginning of the year...

I‚Äôm not too concerned about LG.  In the absolute worst case scenario where Leverett is starting, that‚Äôs fine.  He‚Äôs proven to be a fringe level starter, so not too big of a deal as the weakest link.

>RG: based on many reports, I think there‚Äôs a chance Onwenu stays at RG, in which case, I‚Äôm happy about that spot. If not, maybe Sow or Robinson? Either could work, but would likely be a downgrade.

Onwenu staying at RG would be an extremely, extremely good sign (I‚Äôll get to that when we discuss RT). 

Sow at RG is my prediction, which would be a downgrade but still fine and solid.

>RT: see above. I think there‚Äôs a good chance Onwenu plays guard, which means Wallace (probably?) at tackle. That won‚Äôt be any worse than the first half of last year, so whatever. If it‚Äôs Onwenu, I think he‚Äôs a capable tackle, but not as good in pass protection as some seem to think. Still, I wouldn‚Äôt be worried about the spot.

If Wallace is playing RT, that means he‚Äôs a mediocre-good player.  In which case, their line would be significantly improved.  I would be ecstatic.  My one caveat here is if Mayo is doing what Bill did and fucking up the OT position by playing a bad one there so Onwenu can play his ‚Äúnatural position,‚Äù then I want him fired now lmao.

>RT: possible no change, possible upgrade

I‚Äôm just not seeing where there can be a possible no change here.  The Sidy Sow/Lowe tandem at RT was absolutely atrocious.  If Wallace is playing RT, he‚Äôs not *that* bad.

>Net: downgrade at LT makes the line worse, since the upgrades and downgrades cancel each other out at the other spots.

IMO if you had a downgrade at LT and an upgrade overall of your two combined OT spots, then you upgraded your line significantly since the impact of OTs far outweighs iOLs.

This is all before getting into coaching as well, which should significantly help their OL since they actually have a coach now.  Usually I am hesitant to assume better coaching since it‚Äôs something hard to argue, but this is a pretty special circumstance.",1719792120.0

Nope.

> the biggest proof is that you didn't understand him and don't even understand his core concepts

My brother in Christ, literally 90% of what you said about Kaido is made up.

You're the one here who didn't understand him. You said that Kaido wanted to save the world even though he's pure evil and has no redeeming qualities. The dude is a liar, hypocrite, coward, tyrant, and murderer. He abused, tortured, and killed people just because he felt like it. He boiled someone in oil, abused his own child and turned a country into a wasteland. He has no honor. He was already pure evil before he even learned about Joyboy. And no, Kaido respecting strong people isn't a redeemable quality. Kaido is not a deep character.

Idk why you keep trying to force your headcanons into everyone's throats.

> why tf did you copy the same shit 4 times?

Why tf did you say the same shit about Kaido to multiple people?

> do you want to make sure that I see it or do you want to make sure that more people will see it

Neither. I couldn't care less. I just saw you spamming your Kaido glazing in the comment section so multiple different people, so I debunked what you said, that's all.",1719792123.0

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","So I‚Äôll start by saying these words are often intentionally misunderstood, and there is also a mass propaganda scheme intentionally misinforming people, so rather than let people be misinformed we should educate them. People aren‚Äôt stupid, and the concept of patriarchy is not one that‚Äôs hard to understand.

But to answer your question, it‚Äôs important to properly label issues related to social justice because watering language down makes it easy for oppressors to convince others that the oppression isn‚Äôt happening, or dismiss people‚Äôs concerns.

Pedophile for example is a word with a specific meaning and a pretty bad connotation. Should I avoid using this term to describe people with a sexual attraction to children just because it‚Äôs an icky word? I could say ‚Äúsexual abuser‚Äù instead but now we are starting to lose sight of the root issue I am trying to solve, which is pedophilia. People who are pedophiles and people who are sexual abusers abuse people for different reasons. In order to prevent harm to children it‚Äôs important to properly label these groups of people, because their issues need to be addressed differently on a psychological level. The same is true for societies issues at large, they need to be labeled properly so we can properly address them. 

Also the victims of these systems of oppression are not given a watered down version of the oppression they experience: they have to face the horrifying and disturbing realities of that oppression daily. So why should we be obligated from removing any emotional burden from our oppressors who are simply experiencing discomfort from a word?",1719792123.0

"weddingdrama","t5_9d2qi","Forget your family. Forget your guests. 

CANCEL YOUR WEDDING AND DO IT NOW. 

Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, about ANY wedding is more important than the way you are feeling. To get married to someone who treats you this way, with whom you live in fear, would be a travesty.

YOU WILL NOT BE DESTROYING YOUR LIFE. YOU VERY WELL MAY BE SAVING IT. 

Don't fall prey to the Sunk Cost Fallacy. That's the one where we think ""I've put so much into this already. I don't want it all to go to waste, so I'm going to go forward with this decision."" It's also called digging the hole you're in deeper and deeper until it collapses and buries you.

You deserve so much better than this. 

You deserve to be happy. You deserve to feel safe in your own home. Clearly that's not the case now. 

Whether he will always be an abuser, I can't say. But the behavior you describe from him now is classic abusive behavior, right down to the apologies and promises to change. Maybe he can, but that doesn't mean you have to live with it on that faint hope. 

If I haven't been blunt enough already, just a few more points to consider:

1. Many ""non-violent"" ""oh he would never hurt me"" abusers become MORE abusive after marriage, not less. Often emotional abuse, which you're suffering now, escalates to physical abuse after a marriage takes place. 

2. The Supreme Court is taking aim at no-fault divorce right now. If they overturn that statute, which is likely given their track record, you could find yourself trapped in a marriage with him for years, with no way out. 

Cancel the wedding. Get out. Save yourself. Nothing whatsoever in this situation is more important than your emotional and physical well-being.

- being bored is not a good reason to leave a marriage.  What does that even mean? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","Starting at 18, or 15 with parents legally responsible for the minors actions. If you go to free safety lessons for hunting you can get a free license to own a max 5 round rifle or bow or shotgun. People who have committed violent or sexual crimes should not be permitted to ever own a weapon, and would forfeit any current license or future licence. Joining a regulated state militia allows you a license to carry a weapon while in service with your militia. Serving in the armed forces gives you access and license to buy and own whatever you want. No domestic law enforcement should carry lethal force unless special response forces trained to use them.

I would also dismantle a majority of our armed forces as the need for defense would be shifted to state militias.

Nobody can own tanks, flamethrowers, nukes, bombs, rockets.
If it can be used by a trained individual to kill other humans, at range, at a rate to be expected of more then 1 per minute then it should not be allowed. Only by special law enforcement, or national military units who never lose their rights to any full automatic silenced guns with no limit on ammunition capacity or type.

All ammunition would be regulated, limited to purchase for specific reasons. Ideally the casings returned, limited to 20 per week or more for regulated training.  Again special rules for military and former military. 

All melee weapons are permitted, any projectile weapons that could potentially kill a person would be regulated.  (This is broad) But we won't regulate baseball or hockey pucks or rocks.... So wording would be more detailed and extensive.

After 5 years of having a license certain regulations are lifted, allowed larger capacity 10 rounds max no magazine just hand load, larger more powerful calibers, crossbows, allow for a 3rd firearm in including handgun for self defense. Self defense license required. 
After 10 years of ownership all guns are available, no more then 20 round magazines, silencers allowed, short barreled rifles allowed. License to craft ammunition. Allowed 5 guns, no more then 2 handguns and no more then 2 semi automatic rifles.

Mandatory minimal mental health screening for all new licensee, or any upgrade in license. State approved doctors, and if denied you have the right to request a hearing of your peers.

Weapons that are meant specifically to maim or cause extra pain or injury are prohibited. Torture devices etc. weapons meant to cause great physical damage to a structure or large body, could also reasonably be used on persons would be banned. (Cars fit into this) We gotta fix cars!

Special consideration is always considered, for example, those who have demonstrated a reasonable threat to their safety could be provided a level 2 license or even level 3 if warranted. A threat could be considered a physical abuser, or a stalker, high profile persons who have experienced threats.   Or physically challenged people where hand loading, or rifle size may be physically restrictive for them.

Guns must be locked and ammo locked, public lockers available for free. Owner is responsible legally for loss of weapons if not properly secured.  Min 100 days in prison, min 365 if negligence is found.

"FRM","t5_3fdtc","Charterholder here finished L1 (stillüò°üò°üò° waiting for results): CFA L1 is on par with FRM L1. FRM L1 might be a little harder. For a deeper comparison, I did a detailed comparison of Kaplan and between the CFA and FRM (that nobody read üòÇüòÇ) and I copied/pasted below: 

>>> Fair. I did comment on quite a few, but good for you to point out this rather unhelpful response ‚Äì especially to a fellow charterholder (assuming you‚Äôre one from the original post). To that end‚Ä¶here‚Äôs more info than you‚Äôll need on the subject (also, yes, I did cover a lot of this in the last 30 days :)).

>>>I think most would say: yes, Kaplan is more than enough. Full disclosure: I haven‚Äôt gotten back my E1 result yet, but like 90% sure I passed (and did rather well at that, not just a barely pass). The GARP books are more difficult than CFAI‚Äôs but the tests are easier imho, which is a sweet spot for Kaplan. That said, I felt in retrospect Kaplan had studying for the CFA tests down to a science, as in what to cover and how far to go. When I consistently hit 65% or above on Kaplan‚Äôs CFA QBanks I felt like I was passing the test: I don‚Äôt feel that‚Äôs as true here as you might have more variability - so shoot for higher on the QBanks.

>>>Fwiw, I bought Kaplan and Bionic Turtle‚Äôs packages and BT material/questions are just way too tough, and the juice isn‚Äôt worth the squeeze. On a lot of subjects, Bionic Turtle is actually more difficult than Garp‚Äôs, which is obviously not ideal for a prep provider. Also heard good things about Analyst Prep and I like the fact that its QBank is like 10x Kaplan‚Äôs size.

>>>If you‚Äôre a CFA charterholder, think you would say that most of the FRM test is equivalent to L1 in terms of difficulty. There‚Äôs certainly some questions that are/approach L2, but not many. Will say most test providers seem to overly-focus on quantitative things while the test I took was highly qualitative.

>>>That doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt need to know formulas, but rather the how/why versus the rote memorization is more important. For a simple example, it‚Äôs just as important to understand the joint probability of two mutually exclusive events is 0% than that two independent events is = P(A)*P(B). (Admittedly, ymmv here per year or even by test.)

>>>The things I‚Äôd spend more time on if you‚Äôre a CFA charterholder are

>>>Book 1: Ch: 1 - 4 (mostly easy foundational stuff, but not a big part of CFA exams). Ch: 7-10 (enterprise risk management/history or risks/financial disasters ‚Äì basic stuff that you either know or don‚Äôt know for the test). The middle will be a bunch of stuff related to equity risk/measure of performance you‚Äôre well-versed on (CAPM/Sharpe/APT).

>>>Book 2: Can probably light read Chap 1-5.  Lean in on Chap 6 (hypothesis testing). Review chap 7-9 for the parts that are more about hypothesis testing; the other stuff is just easy regression). Read/study rest of book beside Ch. 12 (basic stats/equity stuff).

>>>Book 3: Will be the closest you come to a nearly exact replica of CFA material imho, so should be an easy read. The only word of caution it to know this is from a risk POV, so know how to hedge and know what‚Äôs over/undervalued and how to correct. Do pay attention if you‚Äôre long or short.

>>>Book 4: Ch 7-8 are newish to a CFA charterholder (operational risk/stress testing) but most of it is stuff you hit on in your studies.

>>>Tl;dr ‚Äì You‚Äôre already miles ahead of an off-the-street candidate and Kaplan will be fine. Reference GARP if you don‚Äôt understand Kaplan‚Äôs materials.",1719792125.0

I (33F) no longer speak to my sister (37F). 4 years ago my birth father told me I was a mistake. He regrets ever having me and I am never to contact him or his wife, who I should never refer to as mom  again. 
So I stopped all contact. I still talk with by birth sister and birth brother. They also no longer speak to the parents after the shit they did to me. 
My step sister though. She lives over seas. We would video chat every few weeks and it was awesome. She also cut contact with the parents after this event. . . Until last summer. 
She had a baby and reconnected with the parents. They paid to fly her and the baby out and she told me she was going to do this as she wants the baby to know her ""Canadian family"" while here for 3 months I saw her 4 times. We went for dinner once then after that she contacted me to take her infant and babysit her, for free. I did it 3x then refused the fourth. 
Sis then told me that it was making the parents uncomfortable to see my car on their street cameras when I would pick up the kid so she would no longer be able to see me while she was in town. I said ""ok."" 

We have not spoken since. I found out recently the parents flew her in again for 3 months but none of us siblings are talking to her.",1719792125.0

"godot","t5_2znmk","**How to: Tech Support**

To make sure you can be assisted quickly and without friction, it is vital to learn how to asks for help the right way. 

**Search for your question**

Put the keywords of your problem into the search functions of this subreddit and the official forum. Considering the amount of people using the engine every day, there might already be a solution thread for you to look into first.

**Include Details**

Helpers need to know as much as possible about your problem. Try answering the following questions:

- What are you trying to do? (show your node setup/code)
- What is the expected result?
- What is happening instead? (include any error messages)
- What have you tried so far?

**Respond to Helpers**

Helpers often ask follow-up questions to better understand the problem. Ignoring them or responding ""not relevant"" is not the way to go. Even if it might seem unrelated to you, there is a high chance any answer will provide more context for the people that are trying to help you.

**Have patience**

Please don't expect people to immediately jump to your rescue. Community members spend their freetime on this sub, so it may take some time until someone comes around to answering your request for help.

Good luck squashing those bugs!

"PolinBridgerton","t5_6815yo","I agree. I honestly don't understand when people say they turned Pen into a girl boss who doesn't need anyone or that the feminist was hamfisted. Personally, I found that there was so much nuance in how they handled their female characters this season.

A girl boss' grand act would never be to publicly apologize for all the hurt she's caused and promise to do better. A girl boss would not be loudly declaring her love to a man multiple times and saying she needs him to love her back and stand by her. A girl boss wouldn't meet him in the middle and decide to do away with her literary persona because he said that secret would always come between them. A girl boss would not be shown healing several of her relationships and finally getting a support system that she can lean on by communicating openly with the people around her. And so it goes.

I know some people don't like that they made LW about *women*, but that was always part of it. The reason Pen didn't feel heard was never just because she's a wallflower. It was always because she's a woman too. If she wasn't a woman, she wouldn't have to stand at the edges of ballrooms clinging to walls to begin with. She wouldn't have to secretly write gossip sheets because that wouldn't be the only way she could have a voice. And Pen *is* a gently bred lady who made a career for herself in the 1800s despite being told, ""ladies do not have dreams, they have husbands"" her whole life. *Of course* they went down a feminist path this season. There was never any escaping that. It would be weird if they didn't go there.

And while I understand that some might have found Pen' speech at their wedding breakfast jarring (because Pen is backed up against a wall and finally makes a stand in a not so great moment), but they built up to that. There are so many scenes that get Pen to where she is when she makes that speech.

And she never says Colin doesn't know what it's like to conceal parts of himself. She says he doesn't know what it's like to *not have a CHOICE but to conceal parts of himself.* She's not wrong, and it's an important distinction to make. It doesn't undermine his arc at all. Even when Colin tries to live up to the man society wants him to be, that's *never* his only choice. The women in the show aren't allowed to choose.",1719792127.0

"nuclear","t5_2qkcl","I was asking if it was a ""good enough"" situation or not, and you didn't answer that. So I checked it, and yes, it is... 

The US military doesn't really care about cost effectiveness. Their budget is just that huge, and **what they prioritize above all is combat effectiveness.** 

That's why if they can just replace their ships by even bigger, better ones afterward (ex, going from nimitz class to gerald ford class), they will do so to stay ahead military speaking. Like, the decision isn't even a technical one, it's just that after a few decades, the ships will be scrapped anyway, nuclear or not, and unlike diesel one, you can charge nuclear ship once only, so you might as well... So really, it's not saying anything, and just showcasing the advantage of nuclear.

Also, the lifetime aren't even bad ? You compared them to land based nuclear powerplant, but a powerplant produces power for tons of people, it's not just about moving around. And well, the first nimitz class aircraft carrier has been launched in 1972, so it's already 52 years old (it was planed for 50 years) but seems they are decommissioning it only in 2027 (at 55). That's a long life, especially as an average cargo ship last [20/30 years](https://splash247.com/ships-set-shorter-lifespans/) before being scrapped from what I'm googling. You also said that as if it was big point earlier, but now that I looked into it, I don't see why you're making such a big fuss about refueling them... 

Unless you want to have nuclear ships run for more than century ?

There are nuclear powerplants that have been decommissioned after reaching 60 too...

> The older models could be refueled but they decided it wasn't worth it on new ships, and these are super carriers / nuke subs which are way more costly to construct than commercial vessels.

Everything military is always more expensive than a civilian counterpart. That goes all the way to [coffee machine](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/20/us/military-price-on-coffee-cited-as-7622.html)

Looking at subs (with the recent australia debacle), the arguments were that for each nuclear sub, you could get 3 diesel ones, but when you factor in the extra capabilities in speed, stealth, endurance, range, etc, the nuclear sub is cost competitive. So even in this case, you can't really say ""It's 3 times as expensive"" For shipping, the combat aspect like stealth don't matter, but range will. To start with, if you double the lifespan of cargo ships with nuclear (just use them for 50 years like a nimitz class), even if it's twice as expensive to make than the average cargo ship, it would be viable... Then add other advantage, like the speed advantage which could actually be useful (the ""just in time"" model doesn't care about speed, as long as it arrives when it's needed, but higher speed also means more back and forth over the same period) or not having to make stops at all (could be very useful to avoid paying tariffs beside at your destination) etc

The idea seemed ridiculous to me at first, but the more I look at it, the more I think it's quite possible",1719792127.0

"CatholicMemes","t5_2wfd9","I get that the guy is a troll but ur entertaining him by calling him Muslim and using dumb allegations.

Look, this how I would deal with this troll if I was in ur place:

""If ur really Muslim, why don't u read ur quran which says in Al Ankabut 46: Do not argue with the People of the Book unless gracefully, except with those of them who act wrongfully. And say, ‚ÄúWe believe in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to you. Our God and your God is ÀπonlyÀ∫ One. And to Him we ÀπfullyÀ∫ submit.‚Äù

When I am faced with a seemingly ""Christian"" troll, I don't insult his beliefs/accuse him falsely, since this would give me the lower place. I also always put the idea that he is not neccacirly an actual Christian (could be a troll) or simply doesn't stand as an example for every Christian there is.

"uxwriting","t5_o90n7","I agree with all the comments already. In addition to matching the title at the top of your resume to the title on the job description, here's another tip. 

Below your name and job title, have a 1 - 2 sentence elevator pitch / about me / whatever you want to call it. The point of this is to convey the MOST important details about you so that if someone doesn't read your entire resume, they'll know the highlights. 

So in your case, that sentence might start out with ""UX Writer with X years of experience doing Product Design (... then add stuff like the industries you have experience, type of product such as B2B, B2C, SaaS, etc, and another other context that would set you apart from someone else)""

We are in a very difficult situation.  It's a wide spread mold problem but it's all hidden in the walls and attic.  Seems to be a builder defect as I have had symptoms ever since moving in this new build 10 years ago.  
I think our situation is very similar to this family's house in this video.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2u3BqETS1g  

So we're debating wether to remediate or move but it seems as if it would be a much better option to move.  Do you know of any builders that keep the HVAC inside the house and not the attic?  Also ones that build better and not use moldy lumber?  Or which high volume builders seem to be the best as far as low mold goes?  Our budget is pretty tight, maybe $300k tops.  Those 3D printed homes made out of concrete look like a good option but I'm not sure what other options we have besides that.  I know there are other custom home options but probably not within our price range.

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","Actually, transgender women *can* (and often do) get periods! No bleeding of course, but the cramps and nausea caused by the body attempting to shed a uterus that *does not exist* can be completely debilitating. 

A *lot* of a (medical) transition is... well, not really a walk in the park. It hurts like hell, it isn't reversible, and it's honestly kind of scary. Muscle atrophy is no joke - I feel like I can barely lift anything anymore. I wish people talked about the agony of it all!!!

But you've definitely raised a fascinating philosophical question, one that has captured the interest of writers from Aristotle to Sandy Stone, and of course, most famously, the existentialist superstar Simone de Beauvoir. What exactly *is* a woman?

The answer to this question is very dependant on culture. What fascinates me is how often people equate femininity to suffering. Sucking up misogyny, sucking up period pains, sucking up birthing pains. A woman in my family was accused of being ""unfeminine"" for having a c-section! 

Let's think about that for a moment. The cultural assumption that to be a woman is to suffer... what does that reflect about how we see the world? Is it a worldview that threatens male dominance? The endlessly brilliant Audre Lorde would have a few choice words to say about that.

In more egalitarian cultures - I'll use indigenous nations on the American East Coast as an example - femininity is conceived of in terms of wisdom and love. While the first period *was* (and is) a feminine coming of age ceremony, it certainly wasn't the suffering that marked the onset of womanhood. And not every woman had a period in said cultures. Some were/are 'two-spirited' - some even had/have a penis. I mention this to point out that other cultures have an *extremely* different understanding of what it means to be a woman. Rather than thinking of different perspectives as ""barbaric"" or ""infactual"", we should consider our *own* ideas about femininity to be relative to our personal situations, not objective fact. 

So... if the question can't be ""what *is* a woman"", maybe we should ask ""what *should* a woman be?""

Ah - but I'm probably starting to sound like your grandmother by asking questions like that. 

But your cousin is kind of doing something quite deep here. Her *love* of what is feminine has *pushed* her to accept the suffering you mentioned earlier. Putting aside the biological suffering, being a woman isn't easy. Being a trans woman comes with regular misogyny *and* extra death threats from ""feminists"". So... why the *hell* would she accept all that??? Seriously! It fucking sucks!!!!

She's saying that ""dresses and long hair are worth it to me"". I don't think that's superficial, I think that's actually quite profound. She could have it easy and live as a cis man... but the joys of womanhood make the suffering worthwhile. 

Maybe makeup isn't your thing, but surely *some* aspects of womanhood must make you happy or feel good about yourself. The sleepovers? Clothing? The sisterhood? Romance, maybe? Surely womanhood isn't *just* an act of suffering to you!!! After all, not all women *have* a period. My friend was born with a ""deformed"" uterus, leaving her without a typically ""female"" puberty. She's still a woman though, isn't she?

But most importantly, I think that all women would agree that parts of being a woman make them happy. Of course, this is different for every woman. Many women - cis or trans - can say they feel sexy in makeup or lingerie. And that fucking rocks!!!! If it's only a problem for *transgender* women to feel that way... well, maybe we've encountered a transmisogynistic double-standard?

I certainly believe that the joys of womanhood make the pain that comes with it worthwhile. Would I ever live as a cisgender man? Absolutely NOT! I understand that it would be easier... but the parts of womanhood that make me feel good are much better. I think that all women can agree with this too. 

And I think that's what makes your cousin's choice quite profound. She isn't taking these things for free, she's going through a really extreme and dangerous ordeal to have them. I think that's a quite beautiful affirmation that being a woman isn't some great curse - it's something worth suffering for. 

There are days I feel quite sexist for wanting to be slimmer, or wanting to have larger breasts... the TERF Janice Raymond uses this as evidence to claim that all transgender women are inherently sexist and shallow. They reduce the woman to an artifact and then they seek to reproduce it. She does kind of have a point. 

But then I remember that... *all* women feel this way. My aunts and cousins constantly compare waist sizes. My close friends all talk about feeling self-concious about their chest, especially during puberty. They're victims of misogyny, not misogynists. We shouldn't treat it as different when a transgender woman feels the same way. 

Ah - but thats all rambling. To answer your question, womanhood cannot be defined because of how personal the definition is. For me, it is all the things that make me feel special, powerful, or just plain good. Boobs, makeup, pretty hair, yoga pants, sure. I hope that honesty doesn't make you uncomfortable. 

But theres more to it than just that. Sisterhood, feminism, the girls-nights, a real woman's name. The experience of being a daughter, a mother, a sister, an auntie. Of breastfeeding your child. Most of all, the joy of being a girlfriend or a wife. None of these things define womanhood to me on their own - but they come together to be something worth having. In spite of misogyny, trans misogyny, infertility, periods, the agony of breast growth, and everything else that comes from the horror of HRT. 

I'll borrow from Audre Lorde again and say that this is how I define womanhood. Not the agony and suffering - but the joys that make the suffering worthwhile (and of course, the feminine power to fight back). I truly hope that you - and your cousin - can agree with me on a definition like that.",1719792129.0

"CICO","t5_3c3pm","Ok, a few things to note. First of all, kudos for tracking everything. This is the most important factor because it is the best way to identify where you may be going wrong. Here are my tips:

1) Recalculate/double check your TDEE in the app. Try to be sure that your calories burned at rest match up with reality i.e. your actual weight, height etc etc.

2) There is likely a flaw somewhere in your calculation... either TDEE or something you are ingesting that you may be accidentally low-balling.

3) Weigh yourself every day in the morning, before you have anything to eat/drink. This will help you track more consistently. Do not worry about day to day fluctuations. Think of it more of a week to week measurement. A lot of people freak out over a big weight gain in a short amount of time but it often turns out to be water weight etc. etc. 

3) Do not eat back calories burned. You may be overestimating how many calories you are burning. You have to be incredibly conservative if you do this.",1719792129.0

It has functioned like this since the beginning, save the re-emergence of the automatons, when they took an entire sector from out of nowhere, and the explosion of the Meridia supercolony. The community demanded the supply lines, because we were on the receiving end of several actions where clarification on how the enemy moved might have prevented losses. Obviously, we can only attack in directions that the supply lines support, but the enemies operated off the same rules, until now.

Our dog‚Äôs seizures are still not well controlled a little over two years into this, but I‚Äôm starting to think we‚Äôve managed to stop the cluster episodes (knock on wood). At the beginning of May we started giving our dog oral diazepam following a grand mal seizure, and she has not had any cluster episodes since then (previously we were giving her the rectal suppository form of diazepam and it had no effect). She has had 6 grand mals since starting this protocol at the beginning of May, and none of them turned into a cluster episode. Our pup is 3 years old, 60 pounds, husky/shepherd/lab mix, and we give her 15mg of diazepam every 6 hours for 48 hours following a grand mal. It‚Äôs only been 2 months since we‚Äôve started this, so it‚Äôs a bit early to say for sure that we‚Äôve found a solution, but it‚Äôs working really well so far. 

Additionally, she takes phenobarbital, keppra, gabapentin, topiramate, and fish oil daily. Still averaging a grand mal every 10-14 days, but our neurologist has assured us there are still plenty of options to try. I hope this gives you a little reassurance!",1719792130.0

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","I was born and raised in the Mormon church, was super faithful to the point of scrupulosity (OCD-like behaviors, keeping myself in check, making charts and lists for reading my scriptures, praying, and then emotionally destroying myself internally when I slipped up. I've had a lot of self-hate to the point of needing counseling and medication years later).

In my 20's, one of my favorite professors at BYU was asked to leave because she was a feminist. I loved her class and was shocked that BYU was so rigidly against women's rights, outspoken women professors, and intelligent, thinking ones, at that. In college I also got a tattoo, and I wore pants to church and this enraged my very domineering, narcissistic father. 

I served a full-time mission but broke rules (quietly), bringing tons of literature with me that I read and studied the entire mission. **I treated my mission as a cultural experience first, and as a spiritual quest second. I think doing so saved me from falling into more rigid Mormon scrupulosity and ""Who's a better Mormon/missionary"" competition, which some missionaries do.**

I was married/sealed in the LDS temple and later had a bunch of kids. I held church callings and leadership roles in my ward. Out of sheer exhaustion and awareness, I became PIMO probably 10 years+ ago. I was tired of seeing the same RICH, WHITE MALES leading the church, and women having little/no voice, from local wards, to stake leadership callings, to the Q12 and first presidency. Women are the silent majority, as are middle class and lower class Mormons, Mormons of color, on and on.

A few years ago, 2 of my kids came out as gay. This was a very hard to deal with as a Mormon mother. One thing my bishop warned me was, ""We hope you don't leave because of your kids."" Well, turns out, yes, that's what happened.

**At the end of the day, am I going to choose a church or my own children? I choose my kids.**

My gay son recently said, ""So, I'm supposed to be celibate my entire lifetime, then after this life, my reward is that I'll be STRAIGHT? I don't WANT to be straight. I'm gay.""

I'm done waiting for the Mormon church to understand women, LGBTQ+, people of color, and anyone **not** in the Utah bubble. The Mormon church is the RICHEST church in the entire world, and still can't hire janitors to clean their buildings?

"marvelstudios","t5_2uii8",">No you used the comics as an appeal to authority. I countered with the same to show why your argument doesn‚Äôt hold water because in that same argument it shows him giving it to Sam as well.


No. You bought them up first saying ""well he gave the shield to Sam in the comics too"" as way if making out the MCU writers were following them without mentioning the important differences in context and the situation.¬† Namely Bucky had already been Captain America at that point.


>Yes they are different. Sam spent all that time with Steve looking Bucky. Sam was on the run with Steve while Bucky chilled in Wakanda. What did Steve do after the snap? He carried on Sam‚Äôs legacy doing the group sessions.


Dude. You don't have the same relationship with someone you grew up with and then knew you entire adult life¬†as you do with someone you knew for only 4 years.¬†


Steve knew Bucky since they were tiny kids. They grew up together.¬† Bucky was close to Steve's mom, and Bucky's family in some sources saw Steve as another son and vice versa.¬†¬†


And that's not an assumption. Bucky literally used the personal details he and only he knew about Steve to prove he wasn't still brainwashed. (It's in CW). Steve is literally like ""you can't read that in a museum"".¬†


>Sam literally fight with Steve for years across the whole Infinity Saga saying otherwise is you intentional ignorance on your part and yes absurd.


¬†Bucky's right there. At the start. In TFA.¬† And it's not the entire Saga.¬† Steve only met Sam in TWS. That's 4 years before he was snapped. He's known Bucky over 20 years by that point if you don't count the time in the ice.¬†¬†


He fought with Sam against Thanos for like a total of one day. Bucky was also right there beside him in IF. Before Sam was even born Steve and Bucky were fighting together in WW2. That tends to create a unique bond.¬†


>And you‚Äôre straight ignoring everything Bucky said in F&WS.


Which part. When Bucky said Steve knew him longer?¬† That was true.¬† The rest of the risible series I ignore because it's piffle which can't even be bothered to pay attention to the movie continuity.¬†¬†


> Like your argument is so ridiculous because you minimize Sam‚Äôs impact and relationship with Steve with 0 facts to support your argument.¬†¬†


My argument is based on what we see in screen and the characters stated words. Steve was in two movies before Sam was even introduced.¬† The only movie Sam is in without Bucky being in it is AoU.¬†¬†


Bucky is the guy Steve talks about most often too when they're not with each other. He's Steve's weak spot basically and the guy Steve discarded the shield twice for¬†",1719792132.0

Idiots, or people coming into it w/a preconceived notion that the white devils that are the LAPD conspired to frame him. Anyone w/o these notions has no problem understanding what happened. I‚Äôm fully aware of T he history of the LAPD, going all the way back to the Manson murders. I know V Bugliosi was a huge piece of shit that should‚Äôve been in a jail cell. All that has jack shit to do w/OJ Simpson. He clearly murdered Nicole and Ron and it takes impressive mental gymnastics to try and come to any other conclusion. 80% of his supporters are just basing it on race, w/zero knowledge of the history of corruption of the LAPD. And the other 20% know those things and think it somehow included OJ‚Äôs wife beating ass. No, OJ was exactly what he looked like. He loved his image and it served him well for a long time. But he was your avg wife beater, who murdered his wife and another fella. Then tried running, because even he knew it was plain as day who murdered them. Even he knew how unlikely it was that he could beat the case. But he underestimated how shallow that jury could be. And he underestimated how bad the LAPD could look in court, in which case I don‚Äôt blame him. As much power as they held in the judicial system, as many crimes as they‚Äôd gotten away with by that point I fully agreed w/him in that respect. What saved him was the King riots, and the states unwillingness to deal w/that again. (Which I bet you think were justified as well. U probably didn‚Äôt feel anything from seeing Reginald Denny being beaten for no reason) OJ murdered them, and a person is either flat out dumb, or thinks one murdered white girl and Jewish man is a small piece of payback for all the horrible things the LAPD has done to poor people and minorities. Nothing you say can get around that. It‚Äôs absurd to even suggest otherwise. Listen to what the jury foreman Crawford has to say now. Not that he was innocent, just that they presented a bad case.

If half of what Democrats fear from a second Trump term were real, how could the Democratic Party have allowed our democracy to slide this close to the precipice? The prevailing feeling among those inside the Biden campaign should be shame; outside it, fury.‚Äù

"thedivision","t5_2xiqd","I use a similar build for farming public exe when I want to get a couple dozen bounties stacked up, I believe mine is worked out to 1.6 million armour with 6 skill tiers. It‚Äôs a fun build for sure. Prefer using skills predominantly when farming those & being more tanky for when the hostages decide it‚Äôs a great idea to start shooting their pistols at passing patrols/convoys/etc while I‚Äôm busy trying to save their lives. 

I‚Äôve seen this sort of build pop up in Conflict quite a bit recently after the Capacitor got its buff, but in my experience, the brand bonuses aren‚Äôt useful at all there, and I see no logic behind dropping 2 armour cores to get a tier 6 defender drone. 

It‚Äôs one of those builds that I recognize is not really ideal but it‚Äôs fun to use because we finally do have an option to get higher skill tiers without having to run around with few to no armour cores (such as a typical Empress/Wyvern/etc) build.",1719792134.0
"CyberStuck","t5_ac04s6","A rigid (stainless) steel body is actually unsafe, as all the kinetic energy gets transferred through rigid bodies and into the meat sacks sitting inside. A well-designed car transfers collision energy INTO the structure, to crumple and fall apart when hit, minimizing transfer of energy into the meat sacks protected by it. Look at F1 and Indy cars for examples. Those things fly to pieces when they crash, but the drivers usually walk away unscathed.

Was confused why first class and economy were the same but I selected first class, and all three of my flights ended up being amazing- got 2x European first class and my flight home was on Delta one, which I had no clue it was going to be that so I was in shock.

"teenagersbuthot","t5_4qkqf1","I think you‚Äôre under the impression that I think the USSR and Eastern Bloc was a workers paradise where nothing went wrong. No, I‚Äôm well aware that the Soviet Union was authoritarian, much of the eastern bloc were repressive police states, and had little freedom of speech. My goal is not to say that it was perfect, I‚Äôm saying that it wasn‚Äôt a purely evil regime that did nothing for its people, because that‚Äôs simply false.

In 1991, 78% of people from 9 Soviet member states(the majority which did not declare independence) had voted to preserve the USSR with reforms. That encapsulates the situation perfectly. The people did not want the Union to dissolve, but they also did not enjoy authoritarianism.

>You could ask millions of people who suffered trough these times and get the same answers, 

Yes, ask the specific group of people who suffered through a country and of course you‚Äôll get the same answer. Do the same for families fleeing the US or any other developed country. That‚Äôs why I go off the specific data that everybody responds to. 

>yet you choose to cite some dumbass pro-kremlin redditor, 

Insulting somebody that has a different perspective than you on a country they *lived* through does nothing. They weren‚Äôt saying that the Soviet government was absolutely amazing, they just said that life was better in their country when it was an SSR for a variety of reasons which were true.

Also, you‚Äôre a Redditor as well‚Ä¶.what you say doesn‚Äôt have more weight than any other single person on the internet. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs a ‚Äúyour word against theirs‚Äù situation, and I never implied that it was. Both of what you and the other person are saying is true. 

It‚Äôs not just one random Pro-Soviet person on Reddit in a sea of others who say it was horrible. Everywhere I go on this topic I see former Soviets saying similar things and they all tell a similar story. I cannot link every single one, but here‚Äôs a few more. It‚Äôs worth looking at the comment sections of the videos as well, especially for the first one. Most of the people aren‚Äôt even from Russia.

https://tcpa.aua.am/2021/02/09/exploring-the-legacy-of-soviet-armenia-2/#:~:text=SHOGHIK%3A%20In%20Soviet%20Armenia%20life,the%20central%20government%20in%20Moscow.

The United States is the opposite, to an extent. There‚Äôs far more human rights(though far from perfect, the hundreds of innocent people are shipped off to the US prison system and child labor is rampant) and freedom of speech, but millions of people die on the streets while Elon makes more every second than they do in a year. 

>a video of Russians (who were actually treated much better than any of the people in the occupied countries) being interviewed and a graph of (again) Russian surveys.

Russians weren‚Äôt necessary treated much better, and if they were, this would be reflected in the 1991 referendum. Out of all the countries which participated, the Russian SSR had the *lowest* ‚Äúyes‚Äù votes. 

People in other member states of the USSR received the same social benefits as Russians. Many of these countries(such as Armenia) which used to be agrarian societies rapidly developed and literacy rates skyrocketed with unemployment and homeliness plummeting([the opposite happened after 1991](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/ROU/romania/unemployment-rate)). What was true is that the Soviet government suppressed signs of Pro-Independence, often with violence. This is why when there *is* resentment against the Soviet government, it‚Äôs in the eastern bloc. 

>Our countries still see the remnants of the past, like the brutalist buildings and abandoned towns.

Reminds me of this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/s/fY20goeF5C). Brutalist buildings and abandoned towns aren‚Äôt unique to Soviet countries. Also, keep in mind that the flats in the USSR were provided by the state for free(along with your job, I‚Äôve heard). They may not have been pretty, but I would rather live in an ugly apartment complex for free than be homeless outside a villa.

To say that these countries were not developing in any way is just wrong. They were not caught up with the rest of the world in terms of consumer technological goods, yes. That‚Äôs different than ‚Äúdeveloping‚Äù.",1719792134.0

This is a theme I gleaned reading the hobbit and then lotr to my kids, that‚Äôs the hobbits are really children playing in whatever immediate scenario they‚Äôd gotten themselves into, and the older beings are the grown ups with an entirely different world view n a different scale of time.

>Commonly known as the¬†Carolina sphinx moth¬†and the¬†tobacco hawk moth¬†(as adults) and the¬†tobacco hornworm¬†and the¬†Goliath worm¬†(as larvae), it is closely related to and often confused with the very similar¬†tomato hornworm¬†(*Manduca quinquemaculata*); the¬†larvae¬†of both feed on the foliage of various plants of the family¬†Solanaceae. The larvae of these species can be distinguished by their lateral markings: Tomato hornworms have eight V-shaped white markings with no borders; tobacco hornworms have seven white diagonal lines with a black border. Additionally, tobacco hornworms have red horns, while tomato hornworms have dark blue or black horns.¬†A¬†mnemonic¬†to remember the markings is tobacco hornworms have straight white lines like cigarettes, while tomato hornworms have V-shaped markings (as in ""vine-ripened"" tomatoes).

And [tomato hornworms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manduca_quinquemaculata):

>Although the tomato hornworm,¬†*M. quinquemaculata,*¬†can be confused with the¬†tobacco hornworm,¬†*M. sexta,*¬†the larvae of these species can be distinguished by their lateral markings: tomato hornworms have eight V-shaped white markings with no borders and dark blue or black horns, while tobacco hornworms have seven white diagonal lines with a black border and red horns",1719792135.0

Long story short: B12 stopped being effective, my health declined, I started to get chest pain, breathing issues, chills, paresthesia, etc. I attributed these to iron deficiency and my ferritin levels have always been low-ish. So I naively megadosed iron. From what I'm reading that's a pretty good way to deplete your copper stores.

So now I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. If I take either iron or B12 those symptoms return with a vengeance. If I don't, then I'm ok, but without B12 I quickly start to become foggy, sluggish and depressed again.",1719792135.0

"LongDistance","t5_2s6ky","As a person who was on the other side of this dynamic (two family members passed away suddenly and quite violently):

I suddenly felt very alone and confused about the world, grief can make your emotions do funny things. What made it difficult for me was that my partner would say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here if you need anything‚Äù but then when I would ask for help (which was a phone call, my family is from a different country so I had to fly home to deal with everything) he was always busy or it was inconvenient in some way or another. For example after the first funeral I told him it just finished, I could use to hear his voice and I was feeling emotional, and he said he was busy doing sports but maybe tomorrow. The next day came around and he never picked up, it turned out he was out with friends. Being busy didn‚Äôt make me scared he wasn‚Äôt there, but showing support comes in different ways (like making an active effort to find some time for the two of you because their wellbeing it‚Äôs important to you) and I didn‚Äôt feel any of that. It felt like I was already very vulnerable, I was falling, and no one was there to catch me. Granted that made me shut off as well because I didn‚Äôt trust he would be there for me when I‚Äôd open up. When we reflected on this later he said he felt I was very closed off, freaked out a little in his own way, and thought I wanted space and he was just being in the way. So the very long example was to say in our case our own insecurities and defence mechanisms were kind of feeding off one another and making the situation worse and everyone unhappy in the situation.

I empathised with her situation but this is not an excuse for her to be aggressive: as they say in therapy your feelings are valid your behaviour is not. If you want to battle it through with her and this is unlike her let her know you‚Äôre there for her, you imagine this is a really scary and confusing time for her, and follow up to do the things you tell her to do when you ask her what she needs.

In a moment of less heightened emotions (not in an argument) let her know that the aggression has hurt your feelings, and that whilst you understand this is a hard time for her you are not the enemy and you‚Äôre trying to help. Tell her honestly you are feeling insecure - saying those things out loud can sometimes be quite powerful and may break some of the assumption games I mentioned above - and whilst you want to support her fully you want to feel loved to.",1719792136.0

There are even plenty who do take hormones but still go stealth in more risky environments like workplaces or family gatherings such as myself, it's literally why terms like ""boymoding"" exist and hiding your transness in certain situations for the same of safety by NO means changes whether or nor someone is trans.

You say you support people who want surgery but can't afford it, but then what about those who are simply averse to surgery generally? OP seems as if he would love to have a smaller chest but is terrified of the idea of getting top surgery, which I think is completely reasonable given the complications that can potentially come along with it. For some its worth the risk and investment, but that doesnt mean those that it isnt are any less trans because of that.

Ultimately, the gatekeeping you do and your need to differentiate between people who are more or less trans is destructive and counter to the entire point of transness as an identity. To oppose the gender norm and be your truest self is valid regardless of where it may take you, and that would be the biggest thing I would say to OP <3",1719792137.0

By the end of your creation process, if I can tell which real culture is your inspiration for your fictional one easily without analysis, then you did not integrate your study into the world building. You shouldn‚Äôt copy-paste cultures into your world. It‚Äôs jarring to notice a real world culture in a work of fantasy fiction because it‚Äôs often out of place without any context. 

The idea is to study real world history to understand how cultures develop and root your world in realism. It‚Äôs realistic because it happened in our history; there is precedent for it. Most fantasy which you find derivative is rooted in our understanding of feudal Europe, with kingdoms and knights and crusades, etc. It serves as inspiration. But since everything is based on it, everything *feels* the same because it always explores the same historical structure.

To make your world *feel* different, you need to base it on a different system, a different historical context. For example, instead of feudal Europe, you could study Ancient Greece and its city states. You want to understand how the world can work like this and apply the system to your world. When you apply it to your world, I shouldn‚Äôt recognize the Hellenic states. Instantly I should be saying that it‚Äôs city states, *just like* Ancient Greece.",1719792138.0

"GPT3","t5_2vkqv0","### Brief explanation:  
Machine Learning trains on Input -> Output.  
If your input is too complex, it may get harder to predict the output.

### ELI5 example:  
Imagine you need to predict the weather, and you can only peek at 2 numbers.  
They are temperature and humidity, but you don't that. At first, you don't even know what they mean.   
But I give you 100 examples and you'll learn how they combine to make rain.  
  
Now imagine I also add +50 numbers to each example.  
They may be the wind speed, yesterday's temperature, the air pressure at stratosphere, etc.

Personal experience gives the strongest impact, I think. And many times it is not a factor which is in your control.   
   
Also, the upbringing, environment, education system, friend circle (and their outlook of other races), very importantly, also parents values instilled in child plays a mayor role irrespective what society he resides in.

"islamabad","t5_2rjvm","Wait for more responses before you make a decision

Here are my 2 bits of knowledge:

Dha valley/homes has been a 15 year long project already where military and nahria management kept runnimg away with generated funds.They were cheaper than bahria plots back then and many local plus overseas people invested there.

The land itself kept changing(current dha 5 was the original location) and they also ate up dam lamd and stole more land around which caused a court order.

In raheel shareef era his own family had investments there so they finally started working on it to deliver results.Dha homes is the only sector with built houses for sale and all the rest are still undergoing allocations,balloting and ploting.

Done with history,now current assignment: the area precisely is closer to kallar syeda road and away from main pindi and islamabad so there will be slight security issues due to lack of settlememt.

It is a bad option if you work in islamabad main sectors because whatever you spent on rent will become literally feul money.It will be more ideal if you wfh,now if more people are working in islamabad from fam then even 2 people travelling to city will add up to more than rent expenses.

For your basic needs if you have your own conveyance than dha 5 is pretty close for basic necessities,and dha 2 for restaurants(20 mins tho) but yeah no food deliveries.

Personally visit and check of the place has gas meter approval and established gas lines,water lines and fiber Internet conection(i heard dha homes has it now but double check)

That is all i know for now",1719792139.0

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Remember to be careful, as you pushing will make you stand far way from your tower.

Step next to the side of the river you have vision or your jungler is at, so it's more secure.

If you have completely push the wave, don't hug the enemy tower trying to poke the enemy laner, as it's an enemy gank angle, just do it if you know where the enemy jungler is (use your pink ward in a way that covers the botside i told your or shows part of the enemy jungle, so you track the enemy jungler).

As you are not punishing the enemy laner under turret, you just don't stand there like and idiot, but step back out of vision, look to the state of the sidelanes and decide if YOU are going to be the one roaming or just hide outside of enemy vision to create invisible pressure on the map (as the enemy doesn't know where you are and it opens the idea you are actually roaming to another lane). 

If you decide to roam, here is where tp is pretty superior to other summ, even in early game, as you can gank a lane, and come back for your minions after the fight (if you end up with low health or mana, back first and then TP to your tower).

The idea is to have as push prio in lane through pushing waves as you can, to lock the enemy roaming mid laner in place, but remember always to be careful, and NEVER use all your cooldowns on the wave if the enemy midlaner is in front of you, as it leaves you open to an all in, always hold your CC spell to be able to push away anyone who tries to jump onto you (this is something that needs to be done with hwei, is a reason he can nullify many assassins lanes with his E fear).

Critiques: 

  
There's many parts that are written in 3/4 but sound like 4/4. There's also parts that sound like two unrelated pieces are being played simultaneously. A large amount of passage work in the left hand, and considerable inconsistency in the style--- close to the idea of 'juxtaposition,' or polystylism, but it has a sense as well of them being integrated from the get go and yet misaligned.

The option to set your flair is in the sidebar, either [here](https://i.imgur.com/yvRH3bL.png) on old reddit or [here](https://i.imgur.com/wDGyvES.png) on the redesign.

**You have also selected a topic that should be posted in the weekly thread, not as its own post, so along with [setting your user flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bonsai/wiki/walkthrough#wiki_what_is_flair.3F_why_do_i_need_it.3F_why_all_the_rules.3F), you can find the current weekly thread as one of the two stickied posts at the top of the sub.**  

While the vast majority of users come here looking for advice and discussion on their trees, we understand that some of you are not. In that case, you can set the flair to anything you like to meet the requirement. If you *are* here to discuss your trees, we do ask that you fill your flair out accurately. Thanks!

**If you are on a mobile device and can‚Äôt see the sidebar, try using your mobile browser. That usually works.**

**Also, please read [the Beginner's Walkthrough](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bonsai/wiki/walkthrough)** in the **[wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bonsai/wiki/)** before posting for the first time. The wiki **[answers many common questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bonsai/comments/42n86s/reminder_please_read_the_wiki_before_posting_it/)**.

"cybersecurity","t5_2u559","From what I can see there are a few reasons you may see this in cyber security SaaS offerings:

1.   SaaS is much more expensive to provide vs on-site deployments.  Those internet servers ain‚Äôt free,  so you have to balance a proper trial experience while not wasting resources. 

2.  As someone else mentioned,   Cybersecurity generally is not as easy of a one-size-fits-all scenario,  as everyone‚Äôs environment is different which makes it much more difficult to automate a customer PoC startup    The more manual process benefits from having you reach out to the vendor who can help you get the most from the trial. 

3.  Cyber toolsets and applications generally are going to deal with a lot of sensitive data,  such as your network traffic,  application data,  etc.   because of that you generally don‚Äôt want to just throw your data into a SaaS platform without some sort of understanding around data confidentiality,  safeguards,  and agreements on the removal of your data after the trial.  (Another difficult to automate process)

4.  Going back to sensitive data and shared platforms,  working with the vendor for the trial also helps to ensure the system performance isn‚Äôt being abnormally impacted by other tenants,  or there isn‚Äôt something malicious being input into the trial systems that could facilitate some sort of trial data leak or infections",1719792142.0

We‚Äôve lived in that house for 20 years. No way I could have gotten everything in 20 minutes. She was yelling and screaming at us to get out of ‚Äúher‚Äù house the whole time. The police were very understanding and gave me the info to get the body cam footage of her behavior. 
I‚Äôm currently waiting on my attorney to schedule a longer assisted move out but now she‚Äôs telling my son that half of my garage, tools etc are hers. The angry part of me wants to also fight for half the jewelry I‚Äôve purchased for her over 25 years. 
 I‚Äôm to the point where I‚Äôm considering walking away from it all.

 There‚Äôs no way she can afford any life without my paycheck. 

Just feels so hopeless to get her back. Even worse when her delusions have her believing that I was cheating. Cheating on a long term emotional level.

However, you can pay for video chat to see what the woman really looks like and I have done that. You can also travel and meet on your own (you have to pay to set this up) and I will be doing that soon. My best advice is if you have a woman sending you letters all the time, ask her to limit them to once or twice a week. If she can‚Äôt do that, it will tell you something about her motives - and move on.",1719792143.0

"HonkaiStarRail","t5_4q5zoc","Should I get E1 Ruan Mei or Firefly?

I have pretty much just entered end game in my account and I have one great super break team with Boothill (who l like as a character). I have Ruan Mei and her S1 but my other possible five star dps for a second team is literally E2 Yanging loll.
I am quite high on the pity of this banner due to the good four stars it has and I'm wondering if I should pull for firefly for other endgame content like Pure Fiction, or just leave it for E1 Ruan Mei (since I already have a Boothill I enjoy though I won‚Äôt really use for PF).
I am not very interested in the upcoming banners, and it seems that for a while hoyo will be releasing characters focussing more on FUA and Breaking support rather than a hyper carry dps or rerun.
Any advice on what I should do?
(Keep in mind I am currently building a hyper carry xueyi for my second team and my yanging is already fairly built, just not effective in current endgame modes now)",1719792143.0

There's a few concerns on whether or not it's as easy to use as any of the other sigs in practice.

It is a form of dementia associated with thiamine deficiency, which is most commonly the result of digestive problems related to severe alcohol abuse.

I see people who are sometimes only in their 40s or 50s but are already incapable of living independently. One of my residents (I work in a nursing home) just has a very unsteady gait, poor memory, and occasional delusions. He spends most of his time lying in bed doing nothing, doesn‚Äôt even bother to turn on his TV. I have another resident who can‚Äôt walk, rarely speaks, and only eats when we bring food to his mouth. Another one, who died last year, could walk until the final weeks of his life, but he couldn‚Äôt carry on an intelligible conversation. He seemed to think he worked in the nursing home rather than living there, but if you asked him what his job was, he couldn‚Äôt tell you. I suppose it‚Äôs not necessarily *worse* than other dementias, but it has the potential to strike at a much younger age. And people can survive a very long time.

1) you are newly a manager, but you did not get your promotion yesterday. I assume you've been working hard and excelling at the sous chef role since March, 3 full months ago, and have proven yourself over the last 3 years with the company,

2) two weeks can be a lot in the hospitality industry, but I assume you have other chefs working under you who can step up and keep the line moving, and if not some serious leadership development/cross training is necessary for the success of the business,

3) the service industry can be grueling, and since you're in pastry I'm assuming your hours are particularly rough. You should be able to take two weeks to care for yourself when you are going through a lot.

You have to understand that female emotional maturity and male emotional maturity are vastly different. Males don't reach their full psychological development, on average, until around the age of 25. We don't prioritize some of the things we should until later because we're literally *immature* in certain aspects.

Now throw all of that into an organization built on creating warriors whose sole purpose is to do what they're told, when they're told, and without question. The bonds become very strong to the brothers around us. We don't take the uniform and the camaraderie lightly either, it's something beaten into us from Day 1.

He'll eventually start to level out at some point and start creating a better balance of priorities, but like I said, it's going to be rough. The Corps takes a lot out of you and gives very little back in terms of time and energy. I suggest posting this exact same question, with the details you've told me, in r/relationshipadvice.

"Fibromyalgia","t5_2qwut","That's very possible. My PT was familiar with fibro and she helped me improve my range of motion by a lot, but she only focused on specific areas and didn't believe my pain was interconnected, whereas I'm certain it's all connected (for example, whenever the pinched nerves in my low back flares up, so does the right side of my neck as well as my TMJ. I never have one flare up without the other). I also found strength building was almost impossible, because inevitably another area would majorly flare up.

"taekwondo","t5_2r3yo","My thinking on this is that 1st dan is the point where you have learned and have good knowledge of the basics. 

2nd to 4th is where you work toward a mastery of the basics and work on leadership.

I would not have tested for 5th (for us that is master level) util I had students begin under my instruction and earn their first dan.

For us  8th dan is Grandmaster, and I know our GM did not push for his 8th dan until he promoted at least one of his instructors to 5th Dan. 

In other words 5th dan demonstrates your ability to teach and develop dans. 8th dan is where you demonstrate your ability to run a school/program.

This is one of the reasons for the longer and longer waiting periods between dans.

And 9th dan is for those who contribute to the art as a whole.

I am sure others can put this better than I, but that is my feel.",1719792145.0

"MrRipper","t5_2ke4xt","I've homebrewed an entire world, but I'll narrow it down to my currently running game group.

Star Veil: a country that's perpetually covered in snow and ice. Not the most original idea, sure, but the reason for its everlasting winter is more interesting. It's home to Saleetha Sun's Bane, an ancient silver dragon.

In my Homebrew world, dragons don't die of old age and only get stronger as they age. So essentially Saleetha is so ancient, the proximity effects of her lair encompass the entire country. Not only that, but she's been around for so long that the flora and fauna have evolved to exist in the eternal biting cold of the land. There are many plants and animals that exist only in Star Veil and nowhere else because of this.

Also, she's revered as the empress of the country and rules the land with icy claws. (Dragons are not neatly divided into good and evil according to metallic and chromatic heritage in my Homebrew world.) Those who are born in her land are considered part of her ""hoard"". If you want to leave and live somewhere else, you have to pay the amount of gold you would make in your lifetime. A minimum of 630 gold pieces per year of life for the average life span of your race/species. 

As one might imagine, this setting has a lot of potential for adventures and factions for the players to engage with. It's been my first try at a more ""Sandbox"" game with no set course for the players and it's been pretty good so far.",1719792145.0

Immigration is the only thing that will carry Canada for the next 50 to 70 years.  All western developed countries will be competing for new immigrants as our current declining birth rate will not support our economy.  By opening immigration up earlier than other countries we have an opportunity to have more educated and wealthier immigrants move to Canada, we get to skim the cream of the crop from other nations. 

The carbon tax is cost neutral to average Canadians and targets the largest industrial emitters of green house gases. Ninety per cent of the government revenues are returned to households in those provinces through a quarterly rebate program, with households receiving a quarterly payment based on family size.

The other 10 per cent is to help grant recipients, such as businesses and schools, reduce their fossil fuel consumption.

The provinces have the opportunity to design their own carbon tax program or they must put the federal carbon tax in place.

And that's just from the Audi stable, if we look at other manufacturers, I think the BMW M3 Touring is a better car now than the RS6.

Like I said at the start, I know this is going to be controversial, but I think the game has moved on from the RS6 now.

Having driven all current RS cars, with exception of the RSQ3, my pick for best RS cars would be either 8Y RS3 or RS e-Tron GT.",1719792146.0

* It did not have a community-approved [tag] **typed** into the title (this is the #1 reason posts are rejected)
* The [tag] was formatted incorrectly (i.e. the brackets were not included or the wrong brackets were used)
* The [tag] was misspelled

&nbsp;

The tag system helps to organize your posts into searchable categories and to filter out spam/bots. If you want your post to make it through my filter, you will need to create a new post, but this time make sure you **type in** a **properly formatted** and **correctly spelled** tag at the beginning of your title. The list of community-approved tags is as follows: 

* [gourmet]
* [medicinal]
* [actives]
* [general]
* [freebies]
* [trade]
* [technique]
* [contamination]
* [article]
* [business]
* [now hiring]
* [meet up]

&nbsp;

Descriptions of what these tags mean can be found in the sidebar. If you're still unsure of how to type up your title properly, check out some of the most recent posts on the front page of the subreddit and try to mimic their formatting (you can just copy-paste them into the title if you're still unsure). You can also work off of the examples listed below:

&nbsp;

* ""[]"" ‚Üê these are the proper brackets. Don't use ""()"" or ""{}""

* [You type one of the tags from the list in here, between these brackets] You type a descriptive title/question for your post here, outside of the brackets

* It should look something like this: ""**[General] How do I grow mushrooms?**""

&nbsp;

Please read the Post Guidelines, Rules, and Newcomers sections located in the sidebar for more information. Please also note that *the Mod Team is not able to edit titles*, so you will have to start over and repost your content with these changes. Thanks for understanding!

As far as personal stories go I know that one of my relatives (that I did not meet) was a soldier in Greece and was arrested after the 8th of September 1943 and spent the rest of the war in a German pow camp, almost starving to death.

The remembrance of ww2 is a very political thing in Italy because of the underlying fascism of it, along with the fact that we got away with basically all of our war crimes.

It actually started with Willis O'Brien, the creator/animator of King Kong, writing a script treatment for a movie about King Kong fighting Frankenstein's monster. He took the treatment to former RKO Studios producer John Beck, who hired a writer to flesh out the script and started shopping the project around to different studios. Most American studios passed on it due to the expensive stop motion animation, so Beck started shopping around overseas and caught the attention Toho studios in Japan. Godzilla creators Ishiro Honda (director) and Eiji Tsubaraya (effects) were both huge King Kong fans and the Toho studio execs were eager to cash in on Kong's popularity so they worked with Beck to retool the project into King Kong vs Godzilla.

Unfortunately it was later revealed that Beck did all of this without Willis O'Brien's knowledge or consent. Beck had cut him out of the project completely, something that even Honda and Tsubaraya were initially unaware of.",1719792147.0

I agree it's kinda beating around the bush, and just being blunt is likely to be more productive, but they're likely to get very similar answers.

I think the show writers are deliberately building it up on the premise that he's a hallucination like Becca, but this doesn't make any sense. The reason I say this is he doesn't disappear like she does Butcher will say something significant he turns around and Becca's gone, with Joe Kessler we actually see him walk away from the conversation when it's over instead of just going poof. People will point out Sameer looked confused when Butcher said ""we."" But I don't think it was confusion that he wasn't seeing anything, it was confusion because he didn't expect Butcher to be working with someone else to nag him, hell for all we know he could've known the guy. Another point people make is he's actually dead on a mission he and Butcher were on, again Butcher isn't stupid he knows Becca isn't actually speaking to him but speaking to a figment of how he remembers her as a person helps him honor her memory. If Joe Kessler was dead like people say Butcher would know this and would've probably brought it up at some point in they're conversations.

"Cricket","t5_2qhe0","Honestly I think you're correct as to why adding NZ to the BBL isn't gonna work. What I do want to add tho is if it doesn't happen immediately, it will happen eventually that second tier players like Allen or Phillips will also probably choose other leagues over SS, cause those will likely grow faster than SS will. 

I think the only thing that truly fixes the problem here is the ICC being truly committed to equally distributed revenue sharing and a true guaranteed international league system. I just don't see how bilaterals don't enter the death loop of:

lesser importance of bilaterals means less MVP players, which means less fans show up, which means lesser importance, so on and so forth, for the non big 3 plus Pakistan teams. 

The only way bilaterals work going forward is it there's a guarantee that NZ will get meaningful bilateral matches in the future. This would mean a league, where yeah, the big three and Pakistan will absolutely bring in more of the revenue (via tv rights and the like) and be required to care about the profitability of smaller nations like NZ (hardest part of this whole proposal lol). 

But I think if NZ can use this revenue properly, I do think they can set up a functional, marketable, and profitable domestic t20 league, which helps to develop their players as well as bring stronger and more watchable teams to meaningful league bilaterals. That would benefit the big three in the long run as well, since international cricket can't function if there are few functional international teams.

I realize that this is all a bit over dramatic, bilaterals will still be alive for the next 10-15 years most likely, but in the range of 20-30 years, I could genuinely imagine them being a few and far between event.",1719792149.0

"Kayaking","t5_2rbz0","If you're after advice on what boat to choose, read [this guide first!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kayaking/wiki/choosing). Then, try the subreddit's search function -- between these two options, the answers to most common questions should be covered. 

This guide is a work-in-progress -- please let us know any thoughts and feedback you might have.

If your questions are not covered by the guide, all boat recommendation requests must include the following at a minimum:

- **Location:** what country and region are you looking to buy a boat in? The kayak market can be very different depending on your location.

- **Budget:** How much money do you want to spend on a boat? (Don't forget you'll need accessories such as a paddle and personal flotation device [PFD])

- **Intended use:** What do you want to get out of the boat? There is no one boat that does everything -- a boat that's great for surfing waves or tackling whitewater won't be the same boat you want to take fishing or for a long ocean trip. Set out some realistic goals for what you expect to be doing in the boat.

- **Experience level:** How much kayaking experience do you have? Is this your first boat?

If your original post is a request for a boat recommendation and does not contain this information, you may reply to this comment or edit your post with the details above. Any low-effort recommendation posts without the above info will be removed.

"StLouis","t5_2qpnm","People complaining about a protest at pride confuse me. The entire queer movement was founded on solidarity with other groups. The only reason we have the few rights we‚Äôve got today is because of said solidarity with other marginalized groups. To complain about your fellow queers showing that solidarity, even if it‚Äôs at a pride parade, is like pulling the ladder up behind you. A certain subset of cis gays already kind of did that to the rest of the queer community, and we‚Äôre all still feeling the effects of that today. 

The first pride was a riot for good reason, the idea of people being gay wasn‚Äôt even accepted until about a decade ago. But there have been people along side us fighting for us long before corporations decided we were marketable. And we shouldn‚Äôt leave behind those that are still struggling to be able to live their lives. 

Also just like, the idea of the MIC sponsoring a pride parade is really dumb to me? Like surely someone in the planning of it thought about the optics of it??",1719792149.0
"originalxbox","t5_2rww7",">Considering the whole point of this console is to run games emulation still can't run

You mean original Xbox games that aren't available on backwards compatibility for newer consoles?

I know people upgrade ram and cpu for other system emulation on the Xbox, but you can find modern emulators for all those things that run better on actual modern hardware rather than a 25 year old hardware platform that's as pushed to its limits.

All the original Xbox games run as best as they could at the time. Some games can benefit from cpu and or ram but most people would have 2 consoles with one without those upgrades.  

You can also 720p patch games and stuff and get some added benefit from extra ram but the games are also going to need to know how to use it, they don't just use it because it's there. So mostly it's homebrew that benefits the most, so maybe better streaming media transcoding without stutter and stuff like that benefits",1719792149.0

## General Info
- Chains of Prospit = CoP
- While our Punch Ghost operates at C Power and C Speed, the movement and speed of chains is A Power
- Reese will find the animal parts in the Mall and Arcade as the first and third locations, regardless of where we go first and third. 


Sonika sighed. Her job was to find information, gather clues and uncover the crew's next target for assassination. But her mind wanted fun, it wanted to relax, it wanted to take the edge off of things and let itself cool down. Walking through the streets, she noticed that Reese had disappeared; her Private Investigator skills were already active as she deduced several locations for him to be around. With those locations in mind, Sonika won‚Äôt do much except grab a rock and fire it at A Power towards them, whether or not they hit isn‚Äôt up to her. It‚Äôs moreso about sending a message-making sure Reese knows she shouldn‚Äôt be fucked with at this point in time.

An important point throughout this match is that Sonika will always be in detective mode. She‚Äôs here to relax but she also has a job to do. As such she‚Äôll be alert at all times for Reese‚Äôs shenanigans, any stealth he attempts having to play against her 3 skill as well as any sensor traps she may set up. 
# [Cinema](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaHrneT9BfU&pp=ygUSd2F5bmVyYWRpb3R2IGdub21l)

Her first stop would be a cinema she‚Äôd heard experienced an incident involving her target. Figuring out what happened while catching up on the latest Rakin‚Äôs cinema scene had to offer would be enjoyable. Unfortunately, the famous Nic Cage movie ‚ÄúBat Man: Shadow Knight‚Äù was not available, the theater instead showing the far less popular ‚ÄúMushroom Jones Mini-Movie‚Äù (commonly referred to as ‚ÄúFungus Jones: Descending Lies Atop The Ladder‚Äù by fan translations). 

Sonika buys a ticket for the movie, insisting on paying full-price as she believes that good cinema should be rewarded, before moving over to the snackbar for her assortment of food. Sonika will buy a large bucket of popcorn, a packet of banana lollies, a chocolate coated ice-cream, bags of M&Ms, Reese's Pieces and Skittles. She‚Äôll pick a seat right in the middle, but open her bag of banana lollies as she moves towards it, spreading them around the cinema occasionally, most notably away from her seat and even providing some to the janitors. 

An important fact about mosquitos-they love the smell of bananas, which is what attracts specific types to bite targets. As such, these banana lollies will distract the mosquitos and cause them to swarm in locations that we see fit and hinder anyone who comes near us. We‚Äôll also aid in the clean up while the movie occurs, sending CoP to remove any goop and put it away; helping the community out is its own reward! She‚Äôll also grab some goo and put it around the choc-top ice-cream (note: choc-tops usually have a wrapper, she‚Äôll be keeping the choc-top wrapped while doing this). 

As for our viewing experience, we‚Äôll attach a few points to our seat and slowly move it over the course of the movie experience, keeping away from any animals that might harm us inconspicuously enough that no one will notice we‚Äôve moved the chair. These points will keep our seat elevated slightly at all times. Not only will this improve the view, but it will allow easier cleaning by our feet while making attacks from sneaky snakes and otters more difficult. Thankfully, the emptiness means we‚Äôre not rudely blocking the view of other theatergoers.

As for dealing with sprinkler systems potentially being set off, CoP will use some of the goo it gathers from the arena and apply it to the sprinklers themselves, jamming them and making them ineffectual. We‚Äôll remove this when we leave so as to not ruin the janitors‚Äô work. Lastly, we‚Äôll combine the Reese Pieces, M&Ms and Skittles into the one container as we leave and ask the person out front to give it to Reese if they see him. Sonika will also ask the cashier for information about their boss, specifically what he is like, and how he acts.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Information #1: Confession

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ truthly, he‚Äôs not the worst, sure he acts like a jerk around the press but deep down he has a heart of gold. He knows this place is going under soon but he tries his best to keep it afloat with his own funds and movies, says that Rakin needs its spirit to stay alive.‚Äù
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [Mackelmore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww9foxLjjck) 
With this information, Sonika moves out with the aim of gathering some new clothing, likely needing more after having been to an area in such disarray. Not to mention, the prospect of a new outfit would definitely be enticing considering her profession change! Moving into the store, Sonika will first put a point outside before moving in and using her Private Investigator skill to identify all the clothes that would not just fit well with her, but also any outfit that would suit Reese to a tee for a disguise (just for his own personal interests). Any attempts to try them on or grab them will have them fly out of the store, sneakily having been connected to the point outside. She‚Äôll have him running after or with the outfits, not only moving him away from Sonika but also putting the heat on him for having stolen goods. Additionally, Sonika will have CoP shift the layout of the store around by moving the racks, transforming the store into a maze of inevitable chaos Reesen needs to keep constant tabs on. One or two boxes in particular will be at Sokina‚Äôs beck and call, ready to dart across the floor to block a sneaky attack from below a rack or around a corner.

At first looking for something inconspicuous, mostly darker colors, she is soon distracted by something far more interesting: a Mushroom Jones graphic tee! Seeing no one else around, she takes it‚Äîfollowing up with some Mushroom Jones-themed pants and a hat. It looked a tad unserious, but her nostalgia for the fungal friend outweighed any such hangups.

As she changes her clothes, a picture will fall out, one of not only herself but the rest of PINDROP. They took it when they first formed, their first big case together, they were quite happy back then. Her fingers trace the photo, remembering all the good times they‚Äôd had in such a small time. An employee comes over to her, concerned about the lady who appears to be tearing up slightly.

‚ÄúAnything the problem miss?‚Äù

Sonika shakes her head, wiping away the tears and looking at the employee, she's younger than her, but not by much. 

‚ÄúApologies, just reminiscing about some old friends of mine, thinking about the past.‚Äù

The employee gives a knowing nod to her, patting her on the back as she does so.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Information #2: Advice

‚ÄúYou know, my boss always says, ‚Äòlive in the past, life is too fast to go with the flow‚Äô, and I gotta say‚Ä¶ I think he‚Äôs right. You must really care about your friends‚Ä¶ whether they‚Äôre here or not, they still touch our lives. Some say he‚Äôs delusional and should let go of old ambitions, but I think the past and the choices we make are important.‚Äù

Sonika thinks to the past, the choices she made, the pivotal point at the crossroad and the formation of PINDROP. Those moments, they‚Äôd all been planned, they‚Äôd all been thought out ideas‚Ä¶ had she really been caught in the flow of the city, swept along by the currents of change?

She thanked the employee for her time, the information she‚Äôd gone to retrieve had turned into advice instead, some poignant advice at that.

But even if the story is a complete fabrication, the point being made is on the story Israelite religious scholars \*\*want to tell\*\*. Within the confines of the narrative they espouse, true or not, there is no support for the idea that God lied in telling Adam and Eve they were to die instantly from eating the fruit. From a religious standpoint, it is out of line with the philosophy they want to convey and it's not a mistake that could fly under the radar.

I think ignoring  that a rabbi has already lied to the general public because of misguided ideas of ethnic loyalty, or what can and can‚Äôt be printed in a prestige papers opinion section, is an impulse to examine.  If you heard a group of Catholics trying to defend a priest who had been caught lying to his followers and doxxing people, on the basis of him being a man of God, you would probably be concerned that they were being taken advantage of.

"Trumpvirus","t5_2gg7fd","I‚Äôm being downvoted because people think I‚Äôm standing up for Trump / defending Trump. 

When that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying at all‚Ä¶ 

Even the left wing media is covering that Biden did a terrible job with that debate. 

I am a Trump supporter for what it‚Äôs worth, but I think Trump did a terrible job of debating Biden. Biden should have been so easy to wipe the floor with given his recent mumbling and general signs of decline. Sooooo many things Trump could have hammered Joe on that appeal to Trump‚Äôs base, yet he didn‚Äôt. 

All Trump seemed to do was make childish digs at Joe, repeat the same old worn out republican talking points, and generally bore me. I wasn‚Äôt impressed at all. 

I‚Äôm not here to debate with anyone who to vote for by the way, it‚Äôs irrelevant to this thread. I‚Äôm just disappointed that one of the most important debates of the year left me none the wiser of who to support‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm always open to having my mind changed, but Biden offered very little indeed to swing me towards him, and Trump just left me wanting to support neither of them‚Ä¶.. 

Back in 2016 Trump had strong ideas, articulated them very convincingly and won the election as a result. Whether you like what he stood for or not is irrelevant; what I‚Äôm getting at is that Trump has lost this strength that made him a good leader back in 2016, given he was able to wipe the floor with Hillary Clinton yet against Sleepy Joe, he struggled really badly. 

I‚Äôm hoping that they make Joe stand down and get a new candidate in for the Democrats. Someone who the population will want to vote FOR, instead of against. Because right now I see a lot of reasons to vote against Trump / Biden, but very few to vote for them",1719792155.0

"politics","t5_2cneq","While a lot of blame can be put at Biden‚Äôs feet, the fact of the matter is that nobody compelling came forward in 2020 except maybe (if you‚Äôre of the belief that democrats path to victory is to push decently far left as opposed to playing to the center) Bernie Sanders, who is older than Biden.

So democrats are stuck in this position where there‚Äôs no other particularly great candidate, looking to replace a sitting president in his re-election campaign when he has accomplished a lot and there‚Äôs a lot of positives to campaign on. 

And a lot to lose by making your party appear to be a shitshow especially with the GOP being in that position and it being an argument to vote Democrat up and down the ticket.

So should Biden be running? Absolutely not. If he thought he couldn‚Äôt do the job would he step aside? I‚Äôm not inside of his brain but based on my assessment of his character, yes. Is there anyone that is a high likelihood of being a net gain for Democrats to step forward? No.",1719792155.0

Mendoza's bullpen management this weekend cost the Mets the series.

I then promptly met my now-wife. 

But we really didn't date per se. We just hung out and talk shit about our exes (she had also just been dumped). And over discussions, we found out we had way more in common than either of us would have thought. 

Over many weeks and months, one thing lead to another. The more we talked, the more we realized we were perfectly aligned. 

And I went from being ready to embrace being a lifelong bachelor to celebrating 21 years of being married to the same woman.

This is really all we can say. I certainly can't say for certain that the universe is not eternal. All we can say about this is the measurements we have strongly suggest that it's not. Even the physical laws of the universe suggest it can't be eternal. 

But ultimately we can't know for sure and I'm aware there are many different ideas about what the universe may have looked like before expansion. 

In the end we can't know anything other than what we can measure...and those measurements suggest it is not eternal.

That's how textual criticism is done. But this is not a good argument you're making. Because the argument *against* dating the gospels before 70 AD is based on verses from the book as well. 

So you can't have it both ways. You can't be in favor of the argument that the gospels are post 70AD when that is based on verses from the Bible but then criticize the counter argument because it is also based on verses from the Bible.

Do you see that?

>Also this is heavily disputed by sholars. Many if not most of them believe this account was written AFTER the fact,

For one main reason. They assume that Jesus could not have predicted the temple destruction. That is only an assumption that ignores textual evidence. So we have an assumption vs. evidence. 

>and honestly even if this happened to have been true it still isnt' even very compelling. ""That temple will fall"" is a pretty mundane prediction.

If it's such a mundane prediction then why is it used to reject textual evidence in favor of an assumption that doesn't make sense or fit the text?

That doesn't sound mundane to me but everyone is different I guess. 

>we know that all sorts of mythologies have existed on earth and you presumably think most of them were just made up.

I don't think they were made up, I think they fit a context and worldview. 

>And a handful of primary accounts for this event shouldn't be convincing since the event would have defied all known natural law.

Then why do you think some speculations about quantum field fluctuations are convincing enough to defy all the scientific knowledge we've gained that an eternal universe would defy all known physical laws? 

It seems like you will weigh speculation more heavily when it favors your view and when speculation doesn't line up with your view it isn't nearly as convincing. 

This is bias and we all have it. Including me of course. 

>Why don't miracles happen anymore?

You're assuming they don't. Those assumptions will get ya. 

>Except that there are numerous contradictory accounts of how the apostles were killed and for what reason.

That's not entirely accurate. We have strong evidence for Peter, James, Stephen and Paul being martyred. We know that christians were persecuted and killed by the Sanhedrin immediately and Tacitus tells us in Annals that Rome was persecuting and killing christians by as early as 64AD. 

What you can say is as we get through the patristics like Clement of Rome, Ignatius, Dionysius of Corinth, Irenaeus, Tertullian we are getting progressively further from when the events themselves would have happened and so all of the traditions of martydom for the apostles.",1719792156.0

 - Too little effort: only saying ‚ÄúDM me.‚Äù

 - Too little consent: introducing a new kink without asking, that the OP did not reference. Try to aim for what seems like is being asked for.

If you want it to be easier to get a roleplay across with just an image and title, it would help a lot if we could add text to the post under the picture like in similar subs, instead we have to flair and post a comment to go into detail about the roleplay. Removing the gallery option slows the entire process further if someone wants to use more than a single picture.

The second reason is just punishing everyone for the guilty few. It‚Äôs an issue everywhere and isn‚Äôt going to disappear with this change. Making it harder to use pictures on the sub will make it require more effort to find the rule breaking pictures when they exist and aren‚Äôt at the front.

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","I think this is highly dependent on what country you live in. 

In America I think you have 3 types of hookers (note - I have used hookers)

1. You have native borns that use it to supplement their income. They tend to charge amounts that would be absurd in other countries because the supply is so low here. A girl that's a 5/10 will charge 600 an hour here, but they might only be working once a week. That's still 31,200 a year which is about 40k a year if you account for taxes. These girls also make 20k - 150k a year (most in the 20-60k range), let's just say 50, but that sticks them up at 100k or so equivalent pre-tax which makes a huge difference in lifestyle

2. Drug Addicts. Probably some in cat 1 are feeding their drug addiction too, but this category is being a whore as much as possible by setting their price at about 200 an hour to fill up their whoring hours. They tend to look rough, and rougher over time. If they were pretty enough they would be in category one and would at least have a receptionist or waitress job. They probably work 2x a day average however many days it is they need to work to support their drug habit and keep them house and fed. 

3. Girls from Asia and Latin America that the police pretend are being 'Taken' so they can pretend they're heroes. These girls are here short term to make as much money as possible before they head back to their home country. They probably make around 100k-200k a year and a lot of them are sending it back home for family or it's their retirement plan. One lady I saw was putting her daughter through medical school in Brazil. 

3 is the easiest to point at and go, are you people fucking retarded? All you ahve to stand against this is your own morals. You have a bunch of people coming from countries that have 10k or less GDP per capita coming here to make 10-20x that. I just watched a Mr. Beast video where he gives away 100 homes - watch that and you'll see how those people live. In reality marginally better than that. And yes I do think a lot of the koreans are here to pay off their loan debt, and their faimilies. What do you really want them to do? Make $12 an hour equivalent adn live in a hut? You can get a beautiful home in these places for 100k and you can save up for your retirement, home, children's future in 10 years. No Chun Wu, you can't suck dick for 100k a year, you have to work in a sweatshop for 7k a year and save nothign and just barely meet living needs. Why? Because I think it's better for you. And if you disagree with me, well that's fine. You're a victim and have no agency or ability to make your own decisions. You're being 'trafficked' - a term which might mean that when you decide to come work in the US you're provided with a place to sleep initially while you make the transition. And maybe there are cases where the girl is paying off family debt. Do you think if you send her home that debt goes away? If they have enough power to send her to another country to be a prostitute, what do you think they can do to the family back home. But don't worry there's an out for you! The bitch cop, bitch judge, bitch prosecutor, bitch Karen constituent, and beta bitch Harry bitch tits will all celebrate you being a victim of 'trafficking' because it makes them moral heroes.

"rant","t5_2qn2b","the pro lifers are bad but sometimes the pro choicers forget that sometimes choice means choosing to NOT abort. like it's an extremely personal decision that should be respected even if it isn't agreed with. but yeah I definitely disagree with the pro life/conservative assholes who don't believe in assisting those who need it because they're a ""leech on society"" or whatever. but the mess that is the US for profit healthcare system is a disaster in its own right that needs to be addressed (can't speak on how it is for disabled people in countries with universal healthcare).

i just think it's equally shitty for pro choice people to use disabilities as a reason to abort. I totally get that not everyone is cut out for raising a disabled child! but when they look down on OTHERS who choose to have disabled children or disabled adults who choose to take the risk, and say that that child (specifically born children, I'm not talking really about a fetus as much as I am already-living disabled children) shouldn't exist or should have been aborted. that is what I take issue with. it's just really shitty.",1719792157.0

Rudy shares blame in this too for not rejecting her, even if he feels the way he does. He put his own feelings and Roxy's above his own wife, which is pretty shitty. A friend of mine more familiar with the source material told me that this particular development was the author's biggest regret in the whole series. I'm not sure what the author would have done differently, but I would probably assume not to cast Roxy in such a negative light with how she physically pushes herself on Rudy instead of emotionally being there for him.

As a rule of thumb, Statistics posts need to inform readers through visualizations and insights that cannot be obtained from raw data alone. For example, a post containing a qualifying gap between two drivers expressed in tenths of a second is an easily obtainable raw piece of data and constitutes a bad Statistics post. A visualization of what that translates to on-track, or visualization of how that gap came to be would constitute a good Statistics post.

AS for long lines and waiting for procedures, any longer that what it takes to see a doctor NOW? Or waiting to have a surgery NOW? In case you don't recall the average time to see a Doctor in most big cities in almost a MONTH and waiting to get a surgery is almost 3 months? 

So how does paying the bill yourself make it any better?

So lets look at Universal health care in Spain...the cost of an ER visit is REGULATED to around 200 USD for tourist. Any extra test needed is regulated by the government, the prices MUST BE posted in the ER. For a deeper read on their system...[HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Spain)

In Germany all they have to do is sign a single piece of paper explaining the purpose of the visit and the government pays it all. No co-pay or annual payment. No insurance company telling them they can't go see this doctor or can't have this procedure.

In the UK, which is a NATIONALIZED system, meaning the government owns everything. The hospitals, clinics etc. and is the employer to all the medical staff. They provide medical, dental and eye care to everyone. If you want extra care, insurance is available to purchase that will provide a private room and even private doctors. Does it have problems, sure does as the UK is currently suffering through the Brexit fiasco(withdrawal from the EU).

As a Chinese company without any history in the market, much people are skeptical and prefer to pay for the brand.

"gardening","t5_2qhkh","Agreed, plus your lettuce doesn't have the relatively high oxalate content of purslane (or spinach, so I'm not saying it's bad), so I personally consider the equally nutritious but lower oxolate option healthier and more convenient overall.

That said, I eat and don't recommend most shun high oxolate foods (like spinach and many popular examples), but I am mindful to either not eat it excessively (unlikely since Americans rarely eat enough of any vegetables) or to prepare in ways that reduce oxolate content or absorption by my body (either blanch or eat with high calcium foods like dairy).",1719792159.0

"Veterans","t5_2rc75","I did my undergrad at UF and I'm wrapping up my master's at Georgetown. All while in Active Duty. I did take the community college route first too, BUT I was always aware of the classes and requirements I needed to even be considered for a transfer to the University of Florida. I did pretty well there, and loved my professors and classes. I would recommend it 100%.

After my UF graduation, I took a year to explore my options. I was lucky enough to find several programs that didn't require a standardized test. However, please note that that score will also be your way of showing schools you can keep up with the other big dogs applying to the program you're interested. In general, schools LOVE veterans/military. We bring a fresh perspective and experience not many others have. I've learned that our applications do stand out.

Finally, I'll tell you what I tell everyone else who's considering applying to a big school: read the program's course/admission requirements, attend the info sessions, and get help with your application. Another friendly user below already mentioned Service2School, so I highly recommend reaching out to them!

Best of luck!",1719792160.0

"FireEmblemHeroes","t5_3imv0","I really enjoy how all the Emblem artists so far have done their best to imitate Mika Pikazo's style. It's probably obvious that they would in hindsight, but it makes me glad to see that even things like the difference in Celica's hair and eye color were maintained.

It's definitely an unpopular viewpoint, but I'd honestly have to say Mika Pikazo has my favorite artstyle of the mainline artists so far. The vibrancy of the colors does a lot for me, and it really stands out from the crowd in just about anything she contributes to imo, from FE to FGO to general Vtuber designs. If either Alear does win CYL one day, I'm hopeful she gets to do the art for them.

That's not to discredit other artists at all, though. Wada Sachiko, Hidari and Senri Kita are all phenomenal in their own rights as well. Hidari is probably my second favorite, and just like with Mika Pikazo, I really appreciate how so many Echoes artists try to imitate their style, most notably with Zeke and Luthier.",1719792160.0

Your post does not contain the minimum 250 words required by INAT rules. Posts are vastly more likely 
            to succeed on INAT when they describe both the project and what they are looking for in-depth. That 
            way anyone checking the post will know if they are able to help or are even interested in the project. 
            The mods of INAT are very busy with a large number of modmail, the fastest way to get your post live, 
            upon fixing the word count, will be to delete this post and try again. 


            Attempts to get around this automoderation of the rules will result in a BAN. 

I noticed you don't have any URLs in your submission? If you've worked on any games in the past or 
            have a portfolio, posting a link to them would greatly increase your odds of successfully finding 
            collaborators here on r/INAT. 

If not, then I would highly recommend making anything even something super small that would show to 
            potential collaborators that you're serious about gamedev. It can be anything from a simple 
            brick-break game with bad art, sprite sheets of a small character, or 1 minute music loop.",1719792160.0

You need to sit her down and talk about how this is going to work. If you two are really committed to each other, and have YOUR family's support, you might make it. But don't get it twisted: this will be HARD on her. Very hard. And while she's dealing with people she loves deeply being deeply immoral, she'll also be managing her own natural resentment at the situation so that she doesn't unfairly blame you. Your marriage will be starting off already behind.

My cousin went through this exact same situation; except his wife's parents didn't expose their racism until they'd already been married for years and had a kid. They had to go NC with her parents mid-stream. It was awful, even though they had their own family to fall back on, and HIS family (us) is mixed race already, and very supportive.

I'd delay your wedding for at least another year, until the two of you have really figured out how this will work, especially if you plan to have children. (I wouldn't let her family anywhere near my kids.)",1719792162.0

"blackmen","t5_2skaf","You chose to ignore the part where Tyson claims Newton just stopped. And he makes Newton's faith the culprit.

Newton did not stop. He returned again and again to the n-body problem. As did Euler. And Lagrange. And d'Alembert. The n-body problem was a popular challenge for mathematicians of that era.

And then Laplace. Laplace built on all their work. His 5 volume M√©canique C√©leste was the culmination of a century of effort from five of the greatest mathematicians that ever lived. 

See https://letterstonature.wordpress.com/2015/11/04/neil-degrasse-tyson-on-newton-part-1/

And yet you and Tyson will claim as absolute fact that Laplace's perturbation theory was a simple extension of calculus that Newton could have whipped out in an afternoon. It is one of the stupidest claims I've ever heard.

Did you see the part where Tyson says he wouldn't want Newton in his lab because those who believe in intelligent design don't search for answers?

Newton searched for and found many answers. Through out his life, not just in the two months before he turned 26 as Tyson claims. And it was Newton's faith that sustained his passion for inquiry.",1719792162.0

"PCAcademy","t5_9qtyf","> That is an interesting idea. I was thinking about taking control of the acolyte as well to maintain that player agency while I build up the trust between the party and my ""tieflling,"" but I think you are right in having a more scripted end point to the acolyte's involvement.

I don't know that I agree with the other commenter that this is a good idea I'd welcome at my table. 

- The start of a campaign's really about players finding their characters' voices, and you're already splitting your focus.

- You're already forcing the DM to accommodate a heavily religious, heavily moral storyline that other players may latch onto hard instead of the proposed story. (Which they may be down for, as always, talk to DM). 

- You're forcing other players to play your backstory.

I think it's a solid backstory, but I might take a Skyrim approach to it, launching into the campaign starting from the moment you escape captivity, instead of shoehorning the party into playing your backstory as well. 

> However, I am a little nervous about how it might present as my character will essentially travel with the party in chains for the first bit

I think you could still pull this off to a degree. They need to be severed, otherwise you're walking into every fight basically restrained and at a huge disadvantage. BUT, they could be Arcane Lock enchanted restraints, only shorn through by a magical blade during your escape, and now you can only remove manacles and severed chains once a) someone learns Knock and picks them at level three b) someone learns Dispel Magic at level 5.

As for why you're adventuring instead of going wholesale into rescuing, you recognize that while the fanatical priest's new faith is small, it's still well-resourced and potent, especially now that you're sister's actually been semi-deified. You know you need resources of your own, and maybe to keep your ears open for others sympathetic to your cause.",1719792163.0

I started doing the same with having a set of indoor and outdoor clothes.

"sketches","t5_2qncz","Hi! :D I think, if you want to draw humans, you could start by studying proportions and gesture

Here is how some of the materials work, if you want to know

The graphite pencils go in order from H to B

H pencils are harder and their lines are more gray and ligth, The higher the number on the pencil, the lighter the line you draw. 

B pencils, on the other hand, are the opposite, they are softer and have a draker stroke, the higher the number the draker the stroke. 

I can see you also have charcoal pencils, those are like B pencils but very veeery dark, their leads are a bit more fragile too, tehy are good for doing high contrast sketches but they can be a little bit messy and Hard to erase.

Hope this helps and good luck with your drawings :D",1719792164.0

If you're looking for dangerous and unhelpful diagnosis, maybe try looking, idk, everywhere. autism is a fake diagnosis. there is no cause and there's hardly even correlation between genetic identifying markers, it's literally not a valid diagnosis. it's a collection of diagnosis criteria that the general population finds undesirable. there's like 27 different diagnostic criteria and you only need to fit 5 of the 27 criterion to get the diagnosis. Hans Asperger was also a treatment specialist and didn't have any interest in creating a secondary class of disabled people, as far as I understand. aspergers is a useless diagnosis because the diagnosis for autism includes levels 1, 2, and 3, which covers the ground aspergers used to cover. finally, don't ever argue for changing language for the sake of changing language. these men think that when they have changed the names of things they have changed the things themselves, or whatever. finally, I think you should work on things that actually matter instead of policing the language of others.",1719792164.0

It looks like your trying to make the face realistic with how small the eyes are but then the nose and lips are so small and the nose is so high up, as well as the face being very short, it almost looks like she is meant to be a very young child when that is clearly not the case. love the colours and flow though, hope i helped.",1719792164.0

Baby's position can play a huge role, especially in regard to the abdomen! We are measuring by placing a perfect circle around the baby.

Guy sits across aisle from me. Tries talking to me as people are still boarding but I can‚Äôt understand him. It‚Äôs first so he immediately orders double Woodford. I realize he‚Äôs just really drunk.


Lights off and he‚Äôs pounding them all flight. He can barely speak but they‚Äôre still giving him doubles. Kids in first row are throwing toys at each other for half the flight. Couple times toy rolled under seats in to aisle by both of us. Mumbles something after the first time it happened. 


Happens again and he gets up. Beside me and the hammered guy(and kids), the median age around me is 60. Gets to the first row and I hear him hit the ground. I thought he went to go yell at the kids. Stewardess gets on and asks if there is a doctor on board, feel the plane decelerating over Wisconsin, and he comes to after about a minute or so. 


Initially freaks out because he‚Äôs drunk and confused. We calm him down and he‚Äôs just embarrassed now. He was just very dehydrated. Wife of doctor switches seats with him so he could sit next to the doctor. Thankfully we make it to Detroit.


We land and taxi super quick. Paramedics meet us but the guy is super embarrassed and asks if he can walk off the plane and get in to the wheelchair waiting in the walkway. Paramedics finally agree and the guy gets off.

"EDH","t5_2scee","I'm sorry to be the one to bear the bad news but...You're asking for a strategy that is entirely contradictory to its own gameplan. A bit tough to make **political deals** with people when you are EXPLICITLY the player/controller of the cards tormenting them and punishing them for advancing their gameplan which is...exactly what group slug does. Not exactly gonna incentivize people to make deals with you when you're playing cards that say ""if you don't do X, you get Y'd in the face.""   
  
They will either A. kill the thing that does that or B. Kill you.

Which loops back to pillowforting. If you run cards that piss people off (eg. the entire group slug strategy premise is running cards that punish people for advancing their gameplan), you need to run all manner of cards that just exist to defend yourself. Prison effects, smites, etc.

My closest recommend to getting the feeling it sounds\* like you want is either \[\[kaervek the merciless\]\] and letting other people suggest where you throw the damage around (but this will just be kingmaker most of the time so people will likely/eventually just gang up on you for trying it) **OR.....**

You could run goad and forced combat effects, or even combat redirectors like \[\[illusionist's gambit\]\]. Two examples of commanders that are quite nice is \[\[Baeloth Barrityl, Entertainer\]\] paired with the background \[\[Noble Heritage\]\] or \[\[Nelly Borca, Impulsive Accuser\]\]. Outside of these, there is incentivizing people to look the other way with commanders like \[\[Breena, the Demagogue\]\], bribing them with card draw for attacks on opponents of yours.",1719792165.0

"GayConservative","t5_2xrs9","Well, the term ""homophobic"" in this day and age is often times conflated with anything that's simply not affirming whatever some very loud, obnoxious, and very obviously politically motivated LGBT person wants to hear about the world at any given time. 

  
Reading your words over several times, it really sounds like you did nothing wrong. Though I personally have mixed feelings about Pride month, and I don't think it's an *entirely* arbitrary thing, I also tend to stay away from it more than celebrate it. Having an *entire* month dedicated to sexual liberation is... a bit strange; and though LGBT have objectively fought like hell to get the rights that they now have, a single day of remembrance seems like it'd be more appropriate than a whole calendar month. As a practicing Christian myself, I also don't necessarily agree with the way LGBT has rebranded the rainbow. 

  
There is nothing homophobic about your attitudes around this. It just seems you don't make your sexual identity such a focal point of your identity at large, and that's perfectly fine. Please keep your chin up and don't let this eat at you; those women sound like nut jobs lol. There are others out here who share your values. Rock on, man. <3",1719792166.0

Toda vez que a esquerda ou at√© mesmo os progressistas, tentam resolver algum problema real como acesso a sa√∫de ou acesso de qualidade a educa√ß√£o, a direita ataca os direitos b√°sicos ja adquiridos das pessoas, as vezes s√£o direitos trabalhistas (PJotiza√ß√£o que o diga), outras vezes √© das mulheres (PL do estrupo que o diga), e segue com ataque as minorias.

Pra voces terem uma ideia, o numero de transsexuais no brasil √© tao pequeno que provavelmente dava pra encher uma cidade media ai no maximo.

I‚Äôm so sorry your designs are getting stolen. That is an awful thing. 

I‚Äôm going to broach this subject as kindly as possible. This is meant to enlighten not to scorn. 

There are some issues with intellectual property - a very gray and contentious subject btw.  While many fandoms tolerate fan made things for personal use, neither personal use nor commercial use is really okay. It violates their copyrights and personal image rights. 

Is your merch licensed by Hozier? Did you get permission from Hozier to use his logo created by Stevie Appleby? Did you get permission from the photographers to use their images in your designs? The guy that did those famous Obama posters was successfully sued because he used a photograph without getting permission from the photographer. 

Making and selling merch based on IP without license can be swimming in murky waters and pressing any cease and desist action against those stealing your work may open up a messy can of worms. 

I know, the internet makes everything seem like it is free to use and no one tells us where these lines are! Copyright and intellectual property is not clear cut and bewilders even the courts at times.

Now, would I say all White people are racist probably no, but apps like Grindr don't do enough to combat racism, in my opinion anyway, but like I said that was 10 years ago.

Just like you who like. It's OK to have a preference, if you get rejected it sucks but you could use that energy on someone who likes you for just the way you are.",1719792166.0

Sure it does have some grapefruit (a beautiful one and realistic one a an opene) but you've some floral notes in the mid as well as some berries, woods aber notes.

The grapefruit takes a step back rather fast but up close you can smell it for quite some time. It does really perform well in the high heat but it's one of the scent profiles where you can go noseblind rather fast.

There are days where I don't notice it anymore after half an hour only to get after hours a sniff of it when a breeze of wind touches me and on other days it feels like I'm sitting or walking in a scent bubble for 2 hours straight.

Yes but no. 

MIL is the problem. I can see why you are pushing this way you are tempted to take this route. At first I didn't disagree but I backtracked while writing this.

Before I continue if you haven't checked out r/raisedbynarcissists do it.

MIL is a narcissist. I'm really leaning towards an emotional incest situation. This is really bad for your SS, and it will affect your daughter's. 

The flaw in your plan is you are putting her in the parental role. You are encouraging his dependence on her to the ignoring of you. She is treating him as a Golden child and he will become the biggest shit in the world and will play that on your daughter's. Your daughter's will see that Grandma treats them different, mixed with older brother expressing Golden Child behavior it will be horrible for them. 

Your MIL has to go. Get husband on board. It sounds like he's thinks it's harmless but MIL is specifically alienating SS from you and his siblings. If hubby cares at all for his son he will end this. He has to be the one to stand up to her. He is literally in the position of choosing his mom or the entire rest of his family. His mom's a grown ass woman, the kids aren't. 

Read up on Emotionally Immature Parents, read up on narcissistic abuse, read up on emotional incest. Educate hubby and call her out. 

He admits your plan is not not in the best interest of SS. Well his mom being around is in the worst interest of SS. 

A mix of maybe great and definitely not so great advice is escalate. Retract your no parenting. Set up him to talk to the school counselor, get him to a therapist. This woman is a villain and everyone needs to be made aware. MIL thinks she is winning cause you keep getting upset. It's hard as hell but keep that in. Yes this all involves your husband's family but it will impact your daughters, if it hasn't already. Make that your motivation. She wins by you getting upset, you win by getting her upset. Her advantage and disadvantage here is she feels justified so she doesn't give a fuck. 

Ask your SS critical questions. He acknowledged you'd get mad MIL said she didn't care. Ask him. Do you think it's ok to not care about making someone mad? Do your friends sleep with their grandma every night? Help him to see when Grandma is being bad without calling Grandma bad. If he understands his sister is a step sister, ask him if it would be right for you or husband to treat him or your daughter differently. It is somewhat analogous to how MIL treats you and husband. 

I once told my kids that ""hitting is what people do when they can't figure out what to do"" it turned out to be very valuable to them. They were punished by spanking, not by me, and they took my message to mean when they got spanked the person that spanked them was wrong for not finding a better way.

Kids are smart and want to do the right thing. They just need guidance to see when someone else isn't doing the right thing and encouraging them to. And someone to have their backs when they step up. It sounds like he still believes you will do that.",1719792167.0

That's literally it. Hyli as always been that player, nothing in the middle. But in the past it was 80% of the time he's the best player, 20% the most dog shit. Which was perfectly fine.

Last season it was 30% god, 70% the most dog shit player, but those 30% were during a playoff run, that allowed his team to win a split. But over the entire year, if you look at his average performance, he was overall an extremely mediocre support not worth his spot in the LEC.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","1) I don't think so, necessarily? Unsure. I think most moral strategies are functional and workable on a societal level - I will acknowledge that there are a select few moral strategies that are probably unworkable on a societal level, but I think it's a small minority and probably necessitates it being very extreme (so none that exist in a society on earth, but maybe in some specific individuals).

2) I think that there are a lot of different ways to be happy, and also ""happiness"" as a concept is tied to modernity in a way that really doesn't make it mean anything. Like in that one edgy comic, if you tied everyone to a VR chair and injected them with pure heroin every day for 20 years they'd sure be ""happy"", but I think most people in the society we live in would not especially like that society

But again, I don't think any of these are useful metrics, but they are obviously not all the ""same"", they have different results, but picking one thing as a metric to judge it by is and of itself a moral value judgment, so it's circular, so I reject the idea that it has any bearing on my argument.",1719792169.0

I don't really have any questions, most of the interesting ones have been asked already lol. But I just wanted to gush over how cool yall are. And I totally get that last part.

"thehouseinfatamorgana","t5_5ozswz","*The House in Fata Morgana* plays *really* fast and loose with languages in the service of keeping the logistics of the narrative simple. In truth, the 'Italian' a character like Maria would speak in the 10th century would more likely be Vulgar Latin, and 19th-century Maria likely would have had difficulty recognizing it as Italian at all. That said, ""Id ut..."" does sound Latin-esque.

Another good example of this linguistic looseness is when Giselle first encounters Hayden and says she's able to kind of understand him because she'd picked up bits and pieces of his language (English) from working in ""the city"" (presumably Paris). Of course, this was in 1099. She would have spoken Old French, and she would have picked up Old English, which is a very different form of English from Hayden's Early Modern English. The English Giselle would have picked up would have been closer to that found in *Beowulf* while Hayden's English would be more similar to that found in Shakespeare.",1719792170.0

EXCEPT in New York! A lot of German operas - including Der Ring were performed in Italian! I can‚Äôt recall all the details around those productions, but this was discussed a lot in ‚ÄúThe Guilded Stage: A Social History of Opera‚Äù. 

As for classical opera in English, Henry Purcell‚Äôs ‚ÄúDido and Aeneas‚Äù is the only piece that‚Äôs considered a ‚Äútrue‚Äù opera. Purcell died shortly after its first performances and the next big name composer in England was GF Handel - a German composing opera with Italian texts. Handel actually went to great lengths to bring Italian singers to London!! 

There‚Äôs plenty of modern opera composed to English libretti, so no reason opera can‚Äôt be sung to English. Classical opera wasn‚Äôt written in English for a myriad of other social reasons.",1719792171.0

"h3h3productions","t5_3345f","Yes, you make an excellent point. I was speaking specifically on snarkers in this case, but you are right that this applies broadly to a particularly insidious form of recent ultraleft claptrap. I think Ethan is a realist in the ""millions of Jewish people will live in Israel and that has to be accepted"" sense. I don't think Ethan is a ""Zionist"" in the pro-settler, anti-Palestinian sense, which applies even to alleged ""liberal Zionists."" He has condemned the settlers and supported Palestine. That excludes him even from the camp of ""liberal"" Zionists.

The fact that people demand endlessly that he and Hila repeatedly condemn Israel is where valid critique of Zionism proper veers into antisemitism. There is absolutely no reason they should have to condemn Israel or speak in favor of Palestine over and over, except that they are Jewish and Hila is Israeli. These are the things that snarkers won't address or speak honestly about, and the same goes for the ultraleft folk who permeate Xitter, many of whom just learned about the Israel-Palestine conflict after October.",1719792172.0

Then you acted like there was a tiger, for you moved around it. Now your supposed unknown has consolidated and forced you to make a sacrifice of action, time, and effort. You approached it like a fool if there was no tiger, but a wise man if you do find a tiger. That is the surrendered mind of the child.

>Also does that mean you want to tell me you were never wrong about something, learned something new and adjusted your future actions?

Of course not. When you are wrong you are forced into the child mind. Most people experience this as panic and stress. I am saying that you should willingly enter that state of mind when reading the bible, or else you will dismiss it based on only that which your filter permitted you to see.

It was a nice time (apart from the bugs) when we started to hear thrashing in the brush near the edge of the lake. Out walks a bull moose and starts drinking from the lake. Super cool to see *until* the moose starts wadding into the water and swimming in our direction.. we were paddling as fast as we could away from him. 

Luckily he was just crossing the lake and didn‚Äôt bother us but I envisioned a scenario where he‚Äôd either pop our kayak and drown us or follow us onto land.

Do you have any idea how much vile shit other demographics hear? You can‚Äôt go on Twitter without the algorithm throwing something racist, homophobic or transphobic in your face.¬†

Do you make similar excuses for other demographics if they become radicalized?¬†

‚ÄúSomeone was mean to me so I became a bigot‚Äù is a personal failing.

>¬†Your progressive stack bullshit stinks and barely any young man will go along with it. Return to class-based analysis or fuck off out of the Left

¬†No. Class based politics is just an excuse to ignore everything unique to marginalized peoples struggles that don‚Äôt go away by focusing solely on class.¬†

It is a lie repeated ad naseum in to get people to shut up about it and fall in line. It stopped working when the various problems of racism, sexism, homophobia and other bigotry weren‚Äôt being adressed.¬†

>¬†welcome to what women and members of the LGBT community have been facing for decades then"" is a laughable but all too familiar response to young men, who weren't even alive through said happenings.¬†But this stock response is emblematic of why young want increasingly less to do with the left

And this is emblematic of why such complaining falls on deaf ears. It wasn‚Äôt something that ‚Äúhappened decades ago‚Äù it‚Äôs things still happening right now.¬†

Everyone on the planet catches flak for something they didn‚Äôt do. We ‚Äúlive in a society‚Äù.¬†

The question is why young men seem to think they are unique for it. ¬†Or why they are the only demographic that goes right as a result.¬†

You don‚Äôt see woman hearing their ancestors were racists deciding to embrace racism as a core aspect of their personality.¬†

>¬†you cannot give an inch to young men, who've had it ""so good"", lest your zero-sum oppression lens which we're now all meant to view the world starts to wain.

People now want to argue, as you did, that this is racist and its actually not the people per se. Its the circumstances and political influences they grew up with and that they have now internalized.

And i would somewhat agree with you. I bet such people who dont care about our legal system and country would be better persons if they grew up under the same (more or less) good cirumstances as we did. 

Sadly were not living in that reality. In the real world there are tons and tons of people who simply dont care about our western values and only come here to profit and will gladly break the law and take advantage of the things and systems we have build here.

Humans will always generalize, thats how our brains work. And when our brains recognize the pattern that very often people from the same countrys and regions make problems, then over time our brains will group that together.

Is this now racists when we call this groups by its name and want political change or is it just the truth? In the end thats something only you can decide for yourself but in my opinion it is not.

At 29, it's important for women to draw boundaries. No more hookups or fwb if you plan on having children. You need a good 3-4 years of dating monogamously, moving in together, marriage if you want that or defacto if not, before having kids. To ensure the future father of your children is a good man, is necessary if that's a goal.

If kids are not a goal, which is 100% valid, you can most definitely change that timeline. 

Find the courage to state clearly what you want your life to look like over the next 5-6 years and what you require of him should he choose to be part of it.

This doesn't mean you have to play that way though. My impression of DCC is that it's written to be a game where you roll a lot of dice and see what happens, but they keep the rules less filled out so GMs can step in and pull it in whatever direction they want. If having luck play so large a role isn't something your group enjoys, it might be worth discussing at your table how to alter the rules to better suit your group's needs.",1719792176.0

"gentlefemdom","t5_31rd4","I wish it were that easy. Those types of men aren't in spaces where they will openly admit to sending creepy messages to women. Even playing online games for nearly 15 years, I've not found a space that allows that type of behavior. Do some spaces exist? yes, but they are very rare. Do some men minimize the effect these types of messages have on women? yes. However, I don't see a way to make those people realize that fact. I don't think they can even understand because, more than likely, it has never happened to them.

I can understand why you feel it should be on men. Realistically, though, it's just not possible. There is nothing we can do to stop a guy from private messaging someone disgusting things. They won't admit what they do to their friends unless those friends are just as bad as they are. 

Every guy knows that these types of guys exist, but just like women knowing toxic women exist, there is absolutely nothing that can be done to stop them. I feel like we have exhausted what options we have, those being the implementation of block/mute, report, and options to disable private messages. 

It's just like any other shitty person online. You can yell at them until you are blue in the face, try to reason with them, show them logic, and appeal to their emotions. Nothing will work. A person being racist online isn't going to stop being racist online because someone else wants them to. A homophobic person online isn't going to stop being homophobic just because people ask them to.

I sincerely wish it would stop. I have experienced this a few times as a bisexual man. It is absolutely jarring, hurtful, vile, and disgusting. Women have experienced this far worse and more often than I ever have, and it makes me sad and disgusted. I could not even begin to try putting myself in a woman's position and what she would go through trying to navigate online.",1719792177.0

"godot","t5_2znmk","Hey there Zenva founder here. Thanks for considering us as an option. You can check our free Godot course to get an idea of the teaching style and determine whether it's a good fit: [https://academy.zenva.com/product/godot-101-game-engine-foundations/](https://academy.zenva.com/product/godot-101-game-engine-foundations/) You'll likely know within the first 20 minutes whether it's a yay or nay for your learning style.

There are a couple of things I wanted to highlight based on what I've read in the comments. Firstly, our courses are not only video. Every video includes a written version (often with screenshots, annotated code, etc), quizzes and downloadable project files. We also have an AI Tutor that can answer to lesson questions in real-time, at no cost (even in the free course), so that if something in the video isn't clear or you want more examples on a given concept, all you have to do is ask it.  
  
So the comparison with YouTube is only valid if you are someone who learns strictly from video, and who doesn't need to read, be quizzed or have real-time support.

Secondly, sometimes advanced developers go into a beginners course and will not like the coding style (e.g. people in the comment saying you should take Harvard courses before learning to make simple games). That is because we try to keep things simple at the start of the journey (while following the Godot coding guidelines from their own website). But we do have lots of courses on more intermediate-level practices covering many different types of well established patters.",1719792178.0

To me tinder always felt transactional, and I‚Äôm a bit more of an acquired taste. I was also looking for a real relationship, but one that didn‚Äôt necessarily need to become serious. 

I know this will sound shilly but OKcupid was pretty great for me, because the setup is uniquely different. 

OKcupid has a countless quizzes about things like attitudes on religion, guns, politics, marriage, relationships, drugs, family, kids, and some really interesting personality quizzes too like love languages, communication style, strengths/weaknesses, and silly ones too. You can even red flag answers that must be a match for you. 

The interesting thing was, the more quizzes I took the better the algorithm got at matching me with other people. Ultimately, I met my wife on it, it guessed we would be a 98% match. 11 years later I still pinch myself on occasion realizing how insanely right it was. 

Anywho - Here‚Äôs more about if you‚Äôre curious. https://www.okcupid.com/about

Either way, wishing you all the best. Keep your chin up, the race is long and only with yourself.",1719792178.0
