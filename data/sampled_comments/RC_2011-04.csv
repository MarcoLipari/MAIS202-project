you can push start a manual if you have a dead battery.
  
a new car with a manual costs ~$1000 less than an automatic. 

manual trans allows you to choose gear based on conditions of the road ahead.  Automatics can't (yet) anticipate what's ahead.

manual trans allows progressive shifting (lots of throttle, highest possible gear, low rpm) for better fuel economy. Automatic thinks lots of throttle means ""downshift and accelerate quickly""

"Coachella","t5_2qsp9","Capitalism is about supply, demand and a free market. It is not about taking advantage of a captive market. It is absolutely unethical to buy tickets in bulk to create falsely inflated demand in order to drive up ticket prices to gain a larger return on what scalpers consider an ""investment.""

Buying a ticket with a bad faith intent to sell to another against the non-transferability clause in the contract that comes with every ticket you buy from Ticketmaster is not illegal in the sense that it is criminally culpable in California, though in other states this isn't true, but it is nonetheless a breach of contract. Capitalism thrives on enforceable promises in trade, not manipulated markets and broken contracts.

I argue, and many agree, that going to a festival like this is a gathering of people that enables many to feel free in a spiritual sense. This is not some material experience people are after--this is what church is for Christians for the die-hard fans of the bands that are playing this festival. Is this necessary to survive? No. Is this necessary for a happy existence? Apparently, yes, because people go to great lengths to travel to this festival, as well as many others, all in the name of enjoying music as its supposed to be enjoyed.

I am not sure putting up for auction a ""one of a kind"" item associated with a celebrity is analogous.","1301616002"

"reddit.com","t5_6","If no one buys a product (in other words if everyone views/uses it for free or pirates it), it will cease to exist. A movie cannot support itself on ad revenue and neither can anything else. Big productions like hollywood movies only exist because people buy them. If the movie industry loses enough revenue to piracy it will die, and we will be left with shitty youtube videos made by hobbyists and self absorbed cunts. 

Likewise, if the game industry loses enough revenue to piracy the PC game industry will die, and we will be left with shitty freeware. It's people like you that ruin it for everyone else, you fucking stupid asshole. 

Do you know why DRM exists? Because of fucking piracy. Do you know why publishers are just throwing half-assed ports at the PC market? Because they don't care anymore, they know we won't be a major part of their income, so why try to provide value to us? 

Now I agree with pirates on one thing, and that is that DRM and other anti-piracy measures are the wrong way to go about this. Developers should be trying to offer value, convenience, and ease of use, instead of making it worse to use a legitimate product. Now let's get this clear, you can never, never, use that as justification for piracy. ""Oh i'm not paying for DRM, i'll just pirate it."" Are you fucking dumb? All you're doing is telling the company to give up on you next time and take their business somewhere else. Piracy is never justified, it is a criminal act that destroys the very entertainment industry that you are trying to rip off.

If you don't like what a company is doing with their product, then don't buy it. Don't pirate it either. Take your money that you should have if you want to use a luxury item like a video game or a movie and put it towards a company that makes quality games/movies/whatever, with no features withheld. /unorganized rant","1301616006"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Zardoz is social commentary about class struggle and the suffering of the common man and the use of ""force"" and propaganda to maintain social stratification but it also exposes the suffering of those at the top of the social scale, which is sorely lacking in most similar stories. 

The Eternals represent the Western upper classes and they give guns and a God to the warrior class of Brutals called Exterminators in exchange of grains and control of the population. ""The gun is good, the penis is evil"" is a clear reference to Western preference of violence over compassion and life that encourages the lower classes fighting each other. 

While the suffering of the Brutals, the common man, is clear in this arrangement the suffering of the upper classes, the Eternals, is also exposed in that they essentially lose their humanity by being so separated from their lower class counterparts. Essentially what is being stated is that Western style capitalism and class stratification separates all people from humanity and can only result in suffering for both top and bottom and that only when the ""strong men"" (be it laborers, law enforcement, military, or in this case the Exterminators) of the lower classes realize that they are in fact the weight that the upper classes are using to keep everyone down and rebel against it can all men be set free.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have a few scars on my left front shin.

In high school I had a Honda VFR700F Interceptor (crotch rocket if that means nothing to you) (motorcycle if THAT means nothing to you) and it was Junior-Senior cut day, the friday before Junior-Senior weekend when all juniors and seniors were supposed to go to Myrtle Beach and be hooligans, basically.

So having some spendable assets I decided to go look into getting a neon kit for my bike, so that I could stand out more on the Strip in myrtle beach and maybe entice the lovely girlies into getting on my bike and pressing up against me. I was into that. (Still am, but no bike at the moment.)

I hit the bike shop but they didn't have anything in stock, so I decided to head back home. This was a 5 lane major town-type highway, heavily commercial. Two lanes on each side and an empty media for turning purposes. I saw a big white custom conversion van, the kind with captains chairs and tvs in the back, waiting to make a left turn out of the goodwill that was up the road on my right side. I.E., she intended to turn across my lane. Being wary of this sort of thing, I paid special attention to her as I got closer and watched her as she looked for an opening.

She looks left and looks right at me, and we make eye contact. I'm looking right into her eyes. 

""Ok, she sees me, good for her.""

Then she pulls right the fuck out in front of me, when I'm really close, doing 45 in a 45. I try to steer away from her into the median (I was in the fast lane) but she's still pulling out. Finally I realize this is hopeless and I can either clip the front corner of the bumper and spin off who knows how, or I can man up and ride into the nice fat quarter panel, grabbing as much brake as I can in the process.

Well, plan probably would have worked ok if I was further than the estimated 20 feet or so away when I made that decision. I straightened up and then got on the brakes hard, but not hard enough to lock either tire up.

Remember I said conversion van. This one had those huge industrial construction sidemirrors that are bolted on with big ass bolts and are basically a huge flat bar of metal supporting a huge mirror. When I hit the van, I catapulted off the bike, with my left leg smashing the windscreen and then dragging through the sharp bits left, which is where the 'stitches' come in. My chest slammed into that fucking mirror, and I had to be doing 35 or better still, at that point.

At this point, or right before, she had slammed on the brakes, so she was squarely in the fast lane that I had been traveling in. I bounce off that Mark II War Mirror, aaaaaaall the way across the median, into incoming traffic. I have the strength to realize the asphalt is like 3000 degrees Kelvin and I lift my head looking around to see if maybe I can crawl somewhere cool (that was my first reaction - not ""Oh that bitch"" or ""Oh hey I'm hurt"", no, it was ""Wow this street is really hot."") and that's when I notice the cars bearing down on me. So I do a kind of hasty panicked reverse crab walk into the median and then just collapse. DONE, NOT MOVING ANY MORE.

She has the decency to not drive off. I don't remember what she said, but I remember just a second or two later the guy I had just talked to at the bike shop is like ""WOW MAN ARE YOU OK I SAW THE WHOLE THING"" so he ends up talking to the cop and telling him what happened, and I don't get a ticket from being out of it and not being able to present my side of the story. I did hear that bitch say something like ""He came out of nowhere and he was going really fast!"" but the bike shop guy shut that down.

So this is also the story of my first ambulance ride. Pro tip: Avoid this ride if you can, and DEFINITELY don't ever get in one if you're hurt. The EMT in the back with me was trying to get an IV into me, the shocks on this thing were War Shocks Mark III, super stiff. I was bouncing all around, and honestly, I missed the 3000 degree Kelvin asphalt at this point.

Finally get to the hospital, get a bunch of xrays and cat scans and whatnot, get lots of stitches and bandages, etc.

Days later I'm at the insurance agency, good old State Farm, filling out my claim and she's like ""We're not paying, the other drive says it's your fault.""

Wat.

I turned even more black and purple than I already was. ""**She** pulled out in front of **me**, I got no ticket, and I don't know if she did on account of, you know, **the fucking ambulance ride** and all, but this is totally not my fucking fault and if you're not paying this claim **and then some** I'm gonna find the sleaziest sheisteriest lawyer in Charleston SC and have you guys buy me a HOUSE.""

Because all I originally claimed for was medical bills and my bike. No lost wages, no pain and suffering, just what I had directly lost. Apparently she reconsidered and found my original claim fair because I walked out with a check.

And then I bought a CBR600 a few days later by walking in the dealership and writing a check for it like a boss. And then a few months later another fucking white van rear ended me at a stop sign, totaling it, but that's a different story.

if we had no military who is to say we would stay a nation?  just  b/c life is stable now in the US doesn't mean that another country wont get the crazy itch to attack, then what will you guys say?  a nation as big as ours with so many enemies can not stay a nation without a military.  yes, i think its stupid that we went off the gold standard and started backing our currency up with military power....but fuck, we got the military power to do that so no body is trying to invade.  

the brainwashing thing can go both ways, in my few years at college Ive noticed that most of the professors are anti-war and thus anti-military.  can i now say that all you guys that disagree with people joining the military b/c the men and women who joined and sacrificed their lives are brainwashed?  

and quote ""YOU'RE ALPHA AS FUCK, BRO!""  i couldn't hear you, could you type louder?  thanks bro!  

its a damn good thing there are people who will always be willing to join the service for whatever goal/reason behind it with the gamble of not coming out at the end of the contract.  defending freedom, humanitarian aid, civil service, whatever the reason, its not something that should be looked down on.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","The best [optical microscope](http://news.cnet.com/8301-27083_3-20038441-247.html) currently has a resolution of around ~50 nanometers. (Check out the link, truly incredible. But don't even dare asking* about evanescent waves, I've no idea what are those!) [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_de_Broglie_microscope)'s a very strange concept of detecting very small things, it's good for about ~1 nanometer.

Now check [this](http://zomg.hu/universe/) out and you'll see how small an electron is. (Though be advised, it's not 100% scientifically correct, for example String Theory is currently just a nice model without (any?) experimental data to back it up.)

As others already said in the comments *seeing* involves light, especially visible light, which involves photons with ~400-800 nm wavelength. (At 400 nanometer a photon has about 3.1 eV kinetic energy, and it has a frequency of ~750 THz.) So when there's an electron, just chillin', and comes a photon and they do a nice [Compton scattering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_scattering ""the electron absorbs and emits a photon, basically deflecting one and exchanging momentum with it"") the formula gives that (if the photon bounces back) [it loses some energy](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=h+%2F+%28m_e*c%29+*+%28+1+-+cos+pi+%29+%2B+400+nm&amp;a=UnitClash_*c.*LightSpeedUnits.dflt--&amp;a=UnitClash_*h.*PlanckConstantValue--&amp;a=UnitClash_*m!_e.*ElectronMasses.dflt--) (because it's wavelength increases, so it's frequency decreases.)


Here's the [experiment](http://www.physorg.com/news122897584.html) with attosecond laser pulses. The technical paper has the juicy [details](http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1060): they used 24 eV extreme ultraviolet laser pulses to excite the atom and produce an ion (decouple an electron from it, then accelerate it to go round and round the ion), they used an other laser to guide the electron back to the ion (or something), the lasers were synchronized, plus the serious magic is timing these pulses so that the created electron wave packets interfere constructively (precisely, they became coherent, so you get one electron with double the ""energy"" -- the timing was calculated with the Time-dependent Schroedinger Equation). Basically they used so small pulses that the ion doesn't get blasted even the laser's [intensity](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%285+*+10^12+W%2Fcm^2%29+%2F+24+eV%29+*+300+attosecond++*+1+nm^2) was 5*10^12 W/cm^2. (So it gives ~4 photons for each square nanometer per second. We know it's per second because Watts is Joules/second.)

Oh, and don't forget, that the more energy something has, the more smaller it can be. (I don't know *why* nature is this way, but the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle describes this phenomenon besides the somewhat intuitive observational limit thing.) So that why some clever folks try to use helium atoms for probing things, because those are big and fuzzy, and peaceful guys with relatively low energy.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I broke my arm by falling off a table. See, my family has this weird curse, every time there's a holiday of some sort (usually New Year's eve) something bad happens to one of the family members (health-wise)--my brother was hospitalised twice, I believe my mum was hospitalised once and most of us come down with severe fever during that day. That particular year was my turn, I suppose. Anyway, I was six years old and my dad bought me one of those guns that shoots arrows that stick to surfaces, I was sitting on a table and looking in the mirror in the hall, trying to aim for my heart in the reflection (I was a strange kid) and lost balance. The whole time I was ""falling"" (which was a second, but obviously because of the adrenaline it felt like hours) I was trying to remember how to break the fall (I was a girl who liked to play-fight with little boys, fighting was a huge part of my playtime, so my parents taught me how to properly do it).. and of course I did exactly the opposite of what I was supposed to do. I fell off with my arm completely straight and hyper-extended, I broke it almost completely, literally only 1mm was holding it together and I was almost hospitalised, because doctors didn't think that it would grow back together properly if I was at home. The break was amazingly clean, basically a straight line on the x-rays. I have a bone-phobia ever since, which doesn't help me, considering I'm a biomedical science student and I plan to do post-grad medicine.

I've broken my toes several times by running into a door. Lots of people say they're clumsy, but they have no idea what clumsy means until they meet me. Most of my friends say that I take clumsiness to a whole new level and they're surprised I've managed to stay alive for as long as I have.

Not an awesome story, more like terrible, but since I liked to play-fight as a kid, I once had my toe broken my three guys (two of them were holding me and trying to keep me from moving) and one jumped on my foot, breaking my little toe. I had it coming I suppose, but three against one was unfair and I was three years younger. I was also once thrown into a wall by those same guys and I blacked out and had a minor concussion, because when I woke up I was really confused and didn't remember fighting at all.","1301616089"

You list the things that are out of your control as some sort of demon.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;Maybe, but that's not sexism. That's gender roles. Sexism is using power to prevent people from achieving what they want. If a woman or man, for whatever reason, doesn't want to go further, that's not sexism, but it still gets lumped into the figures on ""why women make less."" It's hard to normalize for personal choices.

I disagree- gender roles are gender roles because they have actual consequences behind breaking them.  It's not a legal consequence, but social disapproval is pretty powerful, especially when parents and authority figures are applying it to children, which certainly happens frequently when it comes to gender roles.  That is certainly a use of power, and it happens so early we don't even know if it prevents people from doing something they would want to do if that influence did not exist.

The hockey example is more about how people acting ""rationally"" and without explicit sexism can still reinforce disadvantages.  There's very little a girl can do to get that sort of boost, and that seems wrong doesn't it?  Sexism of the past created the situation, and it just sort of perpetuates itself without anyone trying.

I guess at that point one starts getting into differing definitions of sexism.  I have a broader definition, because I don't see a meaningful difference between conscious discrimination and other, unconscious forms of disadvantage.  

I do agree with your last block almost entirely though.  Stats are infuriating in this area, and I always am asking about proper controls.  Unfortunately even controlling is hard- trying to deal with something as basic as controlling for hours worked can result in missing some important differences.","1301616109"

For the first half maybe really smacking the 3 with a snare/clap/whatever type sound (which is already there in most of the bars, just not always emphasized much) in the first half beat-y parts while dropping the volume on the other hits would help as well? Then switching to the 2/4 when the 4-on-the-floor type kick comes in later.

I also agree with the end being a bit anticlimactic - I might even just cut the last minute or so into a few bars fading out? When the kick hits around 2:45 and the 8-16 bars following feels like the climax of the song to me.

For instance, some people are emotionally shattered when a spouse cheats on them.  Other people live happily in open relationships where sex with other people is expected.  Is that a coping mechanism, or is it just that some people are wired to feel victimized by certain events?

Again, I think it's a horrible act because of the emotional and often physical damage, but if someone doesn't want to feel like a victim, why should we tell them they are?","1301616140"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Interesting. I have some problems with that article, but thank you for posting it!  I upvoted, even though I disagree. 

I think there are a lot of interesting arguments to be made about the possible sexism in cooking fields, and statistics about how many top chefs are men, and the tacit process by which authority is assumed in the kitchen, but this article is not one of them. 

I take Tiffany Derry's viewpoint seriously, and thought she made an interesting point about heart versus science. I admit I am impressed by the molecular gastronomy stuff, though I would be no matter what gender used it.  It's odd coming from her, as she was the voted fan favorite of her season and won a ton of challenges. 

I don't agree about the soup issue, but I suppose I believe in the show enough to think it was really about the technical skill in Mike's dish, not a gendered thing. They are not fans of overly strong and not ""clean"" flavor profiles, from what I've seen. They've said it about dishes from men, too.

The judges and guest judges are pretty equal male and female, too, so if they are using some gendered bias to manufacture male finalists there are female judges in on it, all the time, then. 

The first Tiffani's perspective (Faison's) about how men are allowed to be more emotional is not that accurate, imo. I think some of the contestants who have been held up to the most ridicule and hatred have been men - Marcel, in particular. What people hated about Tiffani (Faison) they *really* hated about Marcel, and have hated Dale for the same reason. Angelo was often thought to be sabotaging people, as well. Mike took shit for plagiarizing Richard, and it was that incident that made me a Richard fan, for sure. 

I do think gender could play a role in quite a few of these shows, but I guess I just don't see the evidence of it here, as a removed viewer. Jen Caroll was rude, but they disliked her dish before she was rude. By that same token, a lot of people think Marcel lost his season because of his terrible personality, too. Further, some of the most likable qualities of the contestants are not traditionally gendered ones - Richard is famous for doubting himself incessantly, Angelo for sabotaging himself, and all chefs who manifest qualities like arrogance, lack of consideration, inability to work in groups, are viewed negatively. 

I wonder if anything will come of the Tiffanies' perspectives. I'd be curious to hear what the judges make of them. 

I don't think I understand what remedy the article is suggesting - should the contestants be judged more on ""heart""? Wouldn't that be patronizing to everyone involved? That women getting upset be subject to the same treatment that Marcel got? (be held down and someone trying to shave his head because his personality was not liked. Seriously, if that happened to a woman, the people responsible would have been arrested, as I think his attackers should have been.)

I'm a fan of the show and interested in gender issues. I'm not sure what to make of this article - the contestants themselves don't appear to blame the judges, beyond Faison, so it just seems like sour grapes instead of a [comment on potential overall real inequities in the industry.](http://www.starchefs.com/features/editors_dish/salary_survey/2009/index.shtml) [Summarized here.](http://www.slashfood.com/2010/07/02/female-chefs-make-24-percent-less-than-male-chefs/) (Note: all due caveats about these kind of surveys, of course.)

A. On December 9, 2001, CHENEY announced on NBC's Meet the Press that ""it was pretty well confirmed"" that lead 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta had met the head of Iraqi intelligence in Prague in April 2001, which statement was, as CHENEY well knew, made without reasonable basis and with reckless disregard for the truth, because it was based on a single witness's uncorroborated allegation that had not been fully investigated by U.S. intelligence agencies.

B. On July 15, 2002, POWELL stated on Ted Koppel's Nightline: ""What we have consistently said is that the President has no plan on his desk to invade Iraq at the moment, nor has one been presented to him, nor have his advisors come together to put a plan to him,"" which statement was deliberately false and misleading in that it deceitfully implied the President was not planning an invasion of Iraq when, as POWELL well knew, the President was close to finalizing detailed military plans for such an invasion that he had ordered months previously.

C. On August 26, 2002, CHENEY made numerous false and fraudulent statements including: ""Simply stated there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt that he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, and against us,"" when, as CHENEY well knew, this statement was made without reasonable basis and with reckless indifference to the truth in that the IC's then prevailing assessment was that Iraq had neither nuclear weapons nor a reconstituted nuclear weapons program.

D. On September 7, 2002, appearing publicly with Blair, BUSH claimed a recent IAEA report stated that Iraq was ""six months away from developing a [nuclear] weapon"" and ""I don't know what more evidence we need,"" which statements were made without basis and with reckless indifference to the truth in that: (1) the IAEA had not even been present in Iraq since 1998; and (2) the report the IAEA did write in 1998 had concluded there was no indication that Iraq had the physical capacity to produce weapons-usable nuclear material or that it had attempted to obtain such material.

E. On September 8, 2002, on Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer, RICE asserted that Saddam Hussein was acquiring aluminum tubes that were ""only suited"" for nuclear centrifuge use, which statement was deliberately false and fraudulent, and made with reckless indifference to the truth in that it omitted to state the following material facts: (1) the U.S. intelligence community was deeply divided about the likely use of the tubes; (2) there were at least fifteen intelligence reports written since April 2001 that cast doubt on the tubes' possible nuclear-related use; and (3) the U.S. Department of Energy nuclear weapons experts had concluded, after analyzing the tubes's specifications and the circumstances of the Iraqis' attempts to procure them, that the aluminum tubes were not well suited for nuclear centrifuge use and were more likely intended for artillery rocket production.

F. On September 8, 2002, RUMSFELD stated on Face the Nation: ""Imagine a September 11th, with weapons of mass destruction. It's not three thousand, it's tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children,"" which statement was deliberately fraudulent and misleading in that it implied without reasonable basis and in direct contradiction to then prevailing intelligence that Saddam Hussein had no operational relationship with al Qaeda and was unlikely to provide weapons to terrorists.

G. On September 19, 2002, RUMSFELD told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ""no terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people than the regime of Saddam Hussein,"" which statement was, as Rumsfeld well knew, made without reasonable basis and with reckless indifference to the truth in that: (1) Hussein had not acted aggressively toward the United States since his alleged attempt to assassinate President George H. W. Bush in 1993; (2) Iraq's military forces and equipment were severely debilitated because of UN sanctions imposed after the 1991 Gulf War; (3) the IC's opinion was that Iraq's sponsorship of terrorists was limited to ones whose hostility was directed toward Israel; and (4) Iran, not Iraq, was the most active state sponsor of terrorism.

H. On October 1, 2002, the defendants caused the IC's updated classified National Intelligence Estimate to be delivered to Congress just hours before the beginning of debate on the Authorization to Use Military Force. At the same time, the defendants caused an unclassified ""White Paper"" to be published which was false and misleading in many respects in that it failed to include qualifying language and dissents that substantially weakened their argument that Iraq posed a serious threat to the United States.

I. On October 7, 2002, in Cincinnati, Ohio, BUSH made numerous deliberately misleading statements to the nation, including stating that in comparison to Iran and North Korea, Iraq posed a uniquely serious threat, which statement BUSH well knew was false and fraudulent in that it omitted to state the material fact that a State Department representative had been informed just three days previously that North Korea had actually already produced nuclear weapons. The defendants continued to conceal this information until after Congress passed the Authorization to Use Military Force against Iraq.

J. Between September 1, 2002, and November 2, 2002, BUSH traveled the country making in excess of thirty congressional-campaign speeches in which he falsely and fraudulently asserted that Iraq was a ""serious threat"" which required immediate action, when as he well knew, this assertion was made without reasonable basis and with reckless indifference to the truth.

K. In his January 28, 2003 State of the Union address, BUSH announced that the ""British have recently learned that Iraq was seeking significant quantities of uranium from Africa"" which statement was fraudulent and misleading and made with reckless disregard for the truth, in that it falsely implied that the information was true, when the CIA had advised the administration more than once that the allegation was unsupported by available intelligence.

L. In a February 5, 2003, speech to the UN, POWELL falsely implied, without reasonable basis and with reckless disregard for the truth, that, among other things: (1) those who maintained that Iraq was purchasing aluminum tubes for rockets were allied with Saddam Hussein, even though POWELL well knew that both Department of Energy nuclear weapons experts and State Department intelligence analysts had concluded that the tubes were not suited for nuclear centrifuge use; and (2) Iraq had an ongoing cooperative relationship with al Qaeda, when he well knew that no intelligence agency had reached that conclusion.

M. On March 18, 2003, BUSH sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate which asserted that further reliance on diplomatic and peaceful means alone would not either: (1) adequately protect United States national security against the ""continuing threat posed by Iraq"" or (2) likely lead to enforcement of all relevant UN Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq, which statement was made without reasonable basis and with reckless indifference to the truth in that, as BUSH well knew, the U.S. intelligence community had never reported that Iraq posed an urgent threat to the United States and there was no evidence whatsoever to prove that Iraq had either the means or intent to attack the U.S. directly or indirectly. The statement was also false because, as BUSH well knew, the UN weapons inspectors had not found any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and wanted to continue the inspection process because it was working well.

N. In the same March 18, 2003 letter, BUSH also represented that taking action pursuant to the Resolution was ""consistent with continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those nations, organizations or persons who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorists attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001,"" which statement was entirely false and without reasonable basis in that, as BUSH well knew, Iraq had no involvement with al Qaeda or the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

It's never good to hit either - and it's never good to hit anyone - but looking at this as a hypothetical parent, my kid hits me, no huge deal (but he/she still should be disciplined and made aware that violence won't be tolerated). One of the kids hits another kid, my altruistic side is much more offended by that, and my response to the child who hit the other one will be correspondingly different.

"technology","t5_2qh16","Those all say the same thing.  You can use Android, but if you want Google's branding and access to the Google Market, you have to comply with their rules.

As an Android app developer, I consider this a good thing.  If I were a carrier, yeah, I'd probably be pissed.  Basically, they're saying ""don't fuck with our shit too much if you want our approval.""  The side effect of this is that carriers that want the Google branding will have an easier time upgrading when new Android versions come out.  So, in the end, this is a win for the consumer.

The carriers don't like this because they want the Google branding and they want to heavily modify their version of Android to differentiate them in the market.  This can also be seen as good for consumers (SenseUI vs. Motoblur competition for example), but it makes it really hard for app developers sometimes.

Research 9mm rounds, and you will find that the 147 gr subsonic rounds perform as well or better than the 124gr +P rounds, or any other 9mm loading.  There is a lot more to 9mm performance than muzzle energy, and I choose to carry subsonic 147 gr 9mm rounds in my carry weapon even suppressed over the supersonic 9mm choices, because they penetrate better and perform better through barriers.

And secondary to that point was that .45 ACP always has more muzzle energy, whether suppressed or not, and you just admitted that the 9mm suppressed noise level is similar to the .45, so I simply do not see any reason why you would claim the two rounds are about equal unsuppressed, but the .45 takes the lead when suppressed.  It makes no sense.  Either the .45 is better all the time, or they are equal all the time, from the arguments you have made.  You have made no arguments that show why the .45 would somehow gain more from being suppressed than the 9mm.","1301616168"

Religion was woven into politics, civil affairs, military operations -- see [Pontifex Maximus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifex_maximus), [Augur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur), [Pantheon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome), [Vestal Virgin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestal_Virgin), etc. etc. etc.  Every day of your life, you'd pour a few drops of a tasty beverage (wine, milk) onto your household altar before drinking.  You wouldn't go into battle without sacrificing a *hostia* first.  The rite that the priests (Augurs) performed when swearing into certain offices was called the *inauguratio...*

There were around 40 religious festivals on the Roman calendar.  Some lasted for several days, so that there were actually more sacred days (holy days... holidays) on the calendar than ordinary (profane) ones.

When things went badly for the Roman Empire, people would say that it was because the Romans had turned away from correct religious practice and they were suffering from the anger of the gods (*ira deorum*).

The typical Roman was religious and superstitous.  Lucretius was not.

Oh sure, if the Roman Empire hadn't falled, we might have invented warp drive by now.  Which the Empire would then be using to invade other planets in the name of the Senate and People of Rome.  Meanwhile, you'd be a slave, toiling away in the radioactive di-lithium mines, looking forward to the next episode of *Barbarian Gladiators* on TV when your shift was over.","1301616194"

&gt; There you are, and you suddenly realize that you are spending your whole life just barely getting by. You keep up a good front. You manage to make ends meed somehow and look OK from the outside. But those periods of desperation, those times when you feel everything caving in on you, you keep those to yourself. You are a mess. And you know it. But you hide it beautifully. Meanwhile, way down under all that you just know there has got be some other way to live, some better way to look at the world, some way to touch life more fully. You click into it by chance now and then. You get a good job. You fall in love. You win the game. and for a while, things are different. Life takes on a richness and clarity that makes all the bad times and humdrum fade away. The whole texture of your experience changes and you say to yourself, ""OK, now I've made it; now I will be happy"". But then that fades, too, like smoke in the wind. You are left with just a memory. That and a vague awareness that something is wrong.","1301616194"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Actually, most meteorites are not hot when they land. As they hit the atmosphere and begin to burn up, the surface ablates and the inner layers are revealed. Due to the speed of ablation, these inner layers do not have a chance to heat up until they are revealed.

Additionally, most meteorites are only in the fireball stage for a very brief while. Earth's atmosphere is thick enough at a high enough altitude that the meteorites generally slow to their terminal velocity around 12-14 miles up (where it is quite cold). Because of this, most meteorites are warm to the touch, if not cold. If the local temperature and humidity are right, the meteorites can actually have frost on them after they land.

There are exceptions, of course, as there always are, but this holds true for the overwhelming majority of meteorites. Really, it's the same reason that sky divers don't burn up when they jump out of planes.

All of this being said, I still greatly doubt the OP's belief that he was struck by a meteorite.

If you want to 'reform' a criminal for a cash incentive, at what point do you stop and where are the lines drawn? It's a very dark path to tread on, when you're turning prisoners and the prison sector into cash commodities.

Even with a watchdog, there is no way that if this system went large-scale that ANY governmental organisation could monitor the treatment of every prisoner and we would be potentially letting in abuse of prisoners in the name of cost-cutting. Morally speaking, I would not be prepared to accept that.

What better way to promote prisoner reform than 'accidental' starvation perhaps due to an administrative error? Or that time they 'tried' to start a fight with one of the guards and ended up having to be restrained 'for their own safety'. There's way too many dodgy aspects to this, and if you start encouraging private businesses to both make a profit and at the same time not make a loss by encouraging offenders to not re-offend, I suspect things will start going wrong.","1301616214"

You can make it less confrontational by suggesting as an alternative that your boss could hire someone else to take over these extra duties. It gives your boss another option, but it's cheaper to just give you the raise and if he actually does open up that job you can apply for it as well.

"culturalstudies","t5_2qhwb","1. Face-to-face interaction depends a lot on subtlety. All of that is lost, there's no body language, no inflections in tone, nothing like that. What is gained is a freedom to express oneself in a remarkably candid way. There's no social barriers to break down, they're already broken. 

2. Well, the obvious fact is that anonymity allows you to be anyone. You can be as false as you please with no repercussions, there's no reputation to be held accountable to. The interesting part of this is that it also allows you to be *more* genuine, because being totally genuine can carry repercussions in the real world. So, since most of us find wearing a mask more troublesome, I think the anonymity of these sites makes us more genuine. The obvious catch to this is that systems like karma can encourage us to pick up the masks once again and conform to an image that everyone else finds pleasing. I'm not a karma guy myself, I'll say whatever I feel like, so at least *I'm* more genuine on reddit than in real life.

3. I don't think we can easily determine the actual type in real life, but we make our own categories. This guy's the dry intellectual, this guy's the colorful literary type, this guy's the cynic, this guy's the meme-spouting no-original-thoughts type, ect. A typical reddit user is a young college student, very impressionable and hasty to judge, and to be honest kind of stupid.

4. I think of course that social formalities will weaken. However, they shouldn't end up disappearing completely. As for socializing itself, I think that reddit doesn't really represent the future but just an aspect of it. I believe that the idea of ""this is how you socialize"" will weaken. Nobody will really be making such a distinction between real friends and internet friends. Because it's all real, and especially as we get more and more sophisticated methods of interacting over the net, it will become more and more possible to etch out a meaningful life virtually. I guess what I'm saying that most people will have several modes of socializing, from the fully anonymous social network (4chan) to the non-anonymous social network (facebook), from virtual (second life) to text (reddit). 

5. It's definitely making us lazy know-it-alls. Opinions become qualified for a good reason, and that is because the person worked his ass off to become an expert in his field.

6. It's like meeting them inside out because you learn their opinions before their personalities. People are generally stupider than they appear in real life. Some people are more cruel, but most people seem about the same, except more candid of course.

7. I don't really make online friendships like real friendships. I don't feel like anyone knows who I ""really"" am, but you probably will get a closer idea if you look at my writings and internet presence. I make a different impression online. IRL, I'm a lot less social with people I don't know, but of course I'm a lot more fun with people I do know. It's difficult to be funny online, especially if your natural mode is a more theatrical humor.","1301616232"

(or if you pushed me, maybe 2 methods)  Something that is simple, transparent, and can be audited.  I really don't care other than that.  It could be a flat tax, consumption tax, taxes just on business, taxes just on citizens, etc.  Let the majority of the citizens in an area decide for themselves what they want; or their elected representatives if the local political model supports it.  But having *every* kind of tax put upon us, with various tax collectors, and little to no oversight, is not good.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Yeah, guess I should clarify.

I shouldn't have said 'easier to harder', but I guess no one word is adequate for this situation. I meant starting with an exercise where X weight (135) is challenging, then going into exercises where that same weight would *normally* be easy to do (if you can snatch 135, that's easy for cleans, very easy for high pulls, and complete weaksauce for deadlifts).

So when doing this, the weight change is minimal. You might use a heavy weight for singles at snatch, keep that weight for higher rep cleans, then add on another plate for low rep high pulls and then finish with the same weight at higher rep deads.

If done in reverse (starting with deads, going to snatches) you would start with like, 4-5 plates on deads and then work to snatches which, in a weakened state, would be less than the snatches in the previous example; lot more plate changing.

Plus, you're more liable to hit yourself in the face during a snatch if it's last in your workout.

So my stance is on the changing of exercises. If doing the same exercise (as is your example) and factoring out fatigue (as in your last comment), I doubt there would be any differences.","1301616254"

&gt;They interpreted Quran texts differently, and arguably out of context.  

Part of the problem is that I'm pretty sure they can make the same argument about you, and make good arguments for their position.  

The concept of wasatiah seems peaceful and good, but the article has some quotes that make me wonder, like this one: ""Radicalism and the claim of exclusive monopoly for the truth is the disease."" Isn't islam and all other religions full of ""claims of exclusive monopoly for the truth""? The muslim creed, ""There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God."", springs to mind as an example.

&gt;To answer your first paragraph, again, there's no definitive punishment for apostasy.  

This illustrates my point perfectly. You seem to have a fairly good grasp of your religion, and you make a good point why there's no punishment for apostasy. However, a prominent British muslim, Dr. Mohamad Mukadam, the chairman of the association of muslim schools in the country replied the following when asked about the punishment for apostasy in islam: ""if it's an islamic country, then the sharia is very clear: apostasy is dealt with the death penalty."" (The whole debate is available on Youtbe, here's [a relevant clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQzuFrMRA3M) from it.) I think it's fair to assume that he too has fairly good knowledge about islam, and he could probably argue his case as well as you argue yours. It's probable that both your views can be justified and that you're just a better person tham him, but that doesn't change the fact that he can make such claims and say that he's obeying god's law.  

&gt;Only certain countries are still practicing that, and we can safely say that they are not highly developed countries.  

Absolutely, but the fact remains that our modern societies have moved away from such barbarism not because of, but in spite of, religion. Religion usually has to be dragged kicking and screaming into modernity. I'll cite a few cases from christianity since that's the context I've been raised in and am the most familiar with:  
* The Copernican world view and other scientific progress
* Slavery
* Women's rights
These are not minor issues, and most people in modern societies agree on them, yet they're issues that religious texts, leaders and traditions frequently get wrong.

Saying all that I would only consider known custom ROMs and would take the risk (if any) to completely take ownership of the phone I paid for rather than settling with the non custom ROMs limitation.

The cooling system was made by Thermaltake. I read the directions and part of it was if you had a steel case (I did in this case) to put the really strong magnets it included on the outside of the case, to mount the reservoir to the system. 

I did as the directions had told me and went to try the system. My friend was on the way, so I wanted to ensure it was running well. As soon as I plugged in the computer and hit the power button, there was a hell of a bang and holy smoke. It didn't power up past that. 

My friend came into the house as the smoke cleared and I sprayed room freshener. I told him he could be the first to test it and he plugged it in, hit the power button and nothing happened. 

He said he may have used a bad power supply and he would get a new one to me that he had laying around. I never told him what happened until a few years after that happened. Thankfully, it was only the power supply that fried. ","1301616256"

In particular, there are other explanations for why they were written with a much higher Bayesian probability.

To borrow an example from r/atheism's resident patriarch, NukeThePope: I claim that I have a 10 inch male implement. You are incorrect if you respond, ""You have no evidence of that""- of course I have evidence, I have my personal testimony. You just heard it.

Then how does libertarian socialism propose to counter ""oppression?""  You're right that ""direct democratic small society/city states did not go to the feudal system democratically.""  For instance, those Greek city states (when not fighting one another) were invaded by the Persians.

I gunned the bike and headed up the falls, about an 80deg slope but only about 30 ft high, just a quick blast. As I neared the top there was a wet spot. At that angle you don't have a lot of traction, just momentum, to keep you on track. The wheels slipped sideways and down I went. The bike came out of it nearly unscathed.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","OK, white middle class America aside for a moment, are the other dominant cultures that exist today predominantly patriarchal?  Yes.   What is the relative position of women in China, India, or the Middle East?  Indonesia?  African nations?  What are the other dominant religions besides Christianity, and how do women fare in those?   Historically, say in Western history, has the model ever been different to the despised ""1950's middle America""?  What roles did society impose on genders in the times of the pioneers, or the Civil War, if you want to stick to an American slant?  Or what was life like in medieval Europe?  

Come on, the model of human society where men adopt ""traditional"" male behaviours and roles, and women adopt their own, *is the norm*, not the exception.  Too much huffing and puffing going on these days, and not enough acceptance that gender differences and gender roles are *inherent* in humans.  *When has it ever been different?*  This is key.   Observable and clear gender bias and societal acceptance and reinforcement of gender roles is everywhere, now and in the past.  Point to a time and place in history where we know it was consistently different and then we might start accepting that what we perceive as the status quo isn't naturally derived.  But nobody can.  Suck it up and get over it, this is inbuilt, driven by our biology and you've inherited it just as much as the next person.  

What we do about it is another matter.  We've changed a lot about ourselves by virtue of our big brains.  We don't like violence in our society, so work hard to suppress it.  We understand now that giving in to such basic emotions and urges isn't the best way to survive and thrive.  So, what else that we've acquired from our distant past could we be better off without?  We work on gender bias.  We believe that we would have a better society without it.  But we shouldn't be ignorant of where it's come from.  Three cheers for people who study the evolution of human behaviour.  Fascinating stuff.   Surely better understanding will be the key to dealing with it.  Wilful ignorance of the past before our eyes will not.  I agree that it's a sort of immaturity to be caught up in the emotional side of things and deny the obvious science behind it.  ","1301616353"

The other problem is spondylosis in my vertebrae causing pain upper back pain. This was treated with radio-frequency rhizotomy, where the doctor sticks a very hot needle on the nerves at my vertebrae to basically cauterize them. The first time he did this, it pretty much got rid of the pain, but it came back after about three months. I had that procedure done again, but I think something went wrong because I am in even more pain now, and the pain is a bit different. 

This was five weeks ago, and I'm seeing the doctor again in two weeks. I tried moving up the appointment as soon as I realized it didn't work, but he had no openings. I barely have enough meds left to last until I see him. If the appointment is delayd and I run out, I will be facing very bad withdrawal symptoms.","1301616374"

For example: Picketing and firebombing abortion clinics. If you genuinely think that abortion is *murder*, then firebombing an abortion clinic is a noble, moral act, one that should make you a hero and that people will erect monuments of your image for. It's a rebellion against genocide.

Or trying to convert nonbelievers: If you genuinely think that everyone will suffer eternally if they don't believe (or at least won't get the chance to bask in the awesomeness of God), then the most moral thing you can do is convert as many people as possible, and who cares who you annoy in the process.

*Outland* is interesting in that it's light/dark mechanic is strikingly similar to that in *Castlevania: Lords of Shadow*. The DLC for the latter is on PSN now, and I haven't heard anything about it!

But there are coincidences, and then there are sensational plot points.

Maybe if you'd held onto the bit about Tim's release for two, three, seventeen months, maybe I'd have gone along blithely. But MONDAY? *This week*, mere days ago, the very day you ended your multi-part saga?

Nope, too outrageous. If I had been the homicide detective I had planned on being, or the reporter, I'd put my skills and network of contacts to work, to verify or disclaim that part.

I'd feel it my honor-bound duty to keep what I learned to myself, for the good of the subreddit.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Good game! Here are a few suggestions I have:

* The Zerg army wasn't hotkeyed. Putting an army on a hotkey allows for better multitasking, as it allows you to juggle macro and micro a lot easier. A pretty standard hotkey setup is 1-3 for army, 4 for all Hatcheries, and 5, 6, 7 etc. for Queens
* Many Queens were made, but few of them were used. Most of the Queens got quite high on energy and never attacked. These Queens could have been used for creep spread, larva injects, or transfuses. They might not even be necessary.
* Upgrades were late and few. Only Zerg armor was ever researched. More upgrades could have made the Zerg army that much stronger.
* The balance between gas and minerals was often really off. At one point you had something like 3k minerals in the bank and like 100 gas. I would suggest either building more hatcheries so you can spend your money better by building more units (like more Zerglings), or putting more Drones on gas quicker.

Overall though, good job. I liked the scouting lings all over the map and your Overlord placement wasn't too bad either. Well done.","1301616428"
"CollegeBasketball","t5_2rj3j","From my experience, there are three ""classes"" of offense run in the NCAAs:  

-Isolation/breakdown-  This is Calipari's offense.  Isolate one guy and have them break down their man off the dribble/in the post.  Everything else feeds off that guy.

-Pass, pass, pass -  Move the ball around until you find someone with an open look.  Lots of backdoor cuts, lots of passing around the perimeter.  A lot of mediocre shots (long 2s).

- Pro-style -  Pick and rolls when the clock is running down, and otherwise they try to find open looks at the three point line and right at the basket.  

Most really good teams seem to spend most of their effort on D, then rely on 1 or 2 talented guys to focus the iso offense around.  The second level teams seem to run pass or pro-style offenses.

Full disclosure:  I'm of the opinion that anything other than the Pro-style offense is sub-optimal.","1301616428"

Anyway, I slipped and smashed my face into the edge of the bed's headboard, which was very sharp because it was not rounded down on the edges. I got lucky because I didn't damage any bones or my eyes, and there's really not much flesh on the bridge of your nose so the scar isn't that noticeable and certainly not ugly.

Consider what happens in Science. Science predicts that people observe ""A"" under certain circumstances. If Scientists observe ""B"" under those circumstances, then those Scientists would be rewarded for publishing their observations, and Science would later instead predict that people observe ""B"" under those circumstances.

Consider what happens in Religion. Suppose Jesus was actually resurrected four days later, but contemporary religious scholars hold the same viewpoints they currently do. Religious scholars are wrong in this hypothetical as a simple matter of fact, and religious thought has no means to correct this inaccuracy.

* At no time am I obligated to continue if my health is in immediate danger. Knowledge is cool, life is better.
* I am allowed the following discrete items: knife, slipstick, compass, hatchet.
* I am allowed an unlimited amount of: pencils, paper, erasers, notebooks.
* I am allowed to beg, borrow, steal, or trade for books. Your netbook idea is interesting, but I'd rather leave electronics out of it. Instead, maybe I'd just be allowed to request books on a certain topic, say, once every two weeks.
* Obviously I'd be allowed a camera and tripod, and the batteries/storage medium it required.
* Once I build something, I can trade other people for it. So, once I make rope, I can trade something for that rope.
* Since you can't make animals, you can always trade for animals. I'm thinking chickens, pigs, and cows right now.
* I'd want to start out on land that had abundant resources. Namely: timber, water, copper, iron, and clay.


When I imagined this, it wasn't on a desert island so much as somewhere in the northwestern US with a fairly mild climate (I'd be fine in western Montana). I had imagined it as either a solo exercise, or to be undertaken with my significant other (then, if it were a long term thing, we could make more little workers).

On the other hand being with someone as they die is really a gift.  You have the time to say whatever it is that you want/need to say and you have the opportunity to get closer to them than you would have if they, for example, died unexpectedly in a car wreck.  Just giving the person attention and being with them is a good way to ease them into death.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","Hi,
I am no guru, but i skimmed through your code.
Couple of things I would suggest, relating specifically to this portion:

 If chkLetter.Checked = True And dblPercent &lt; 0.6 Then
                strDisplay += "" | Grade: F""
            ElseIf chkLetter.Checked = True And dblPercent &lt; 0.7 Then
                strDisplay += "" | Grade: D""
            ElseIf chkLetter.Checked = True And dblPercent &lt; 0.8 Then
                strDisplay += "" | Grade: C""
            ElseIf chkLetter.Checked = True And dblPercent &lt; 0.9 Then
                strDisplay += "" | Grade: B""
            ElseIf chkLetter.Checked = True And dblPercent &lt;= 1 Then
                strDisplay += "" | Grade: A""
            End If


First, doing chkLetter.Checked = True is redundant. Its like saying If true = true. Basically you do not need the ""= true"" part. Secondly, for the dblPercent checks I would use a case/switch statement to go through the scenarios:

basically the code could look like:

    If (chkLetter.Checked) Then
        case dblpercent &lt; 0.5
            strDisplay = ...
        case dblpercent &lt; 0.6
            strDisplay = ...
    etc...
    End

The farmer crosses his arms and says stubbornly, “Oh no thanks, I put my trust in God.” The boat goes away. The water rises to the second story. Another boat comes up. The man says to the farmer, who is now at the second floor window, “Hurry, jump in. I’ll save you.”

The farmer again says, “Oh no thanks, I put my trust in God.”

The boat goes away. Now the water is inching over the roof. As the farmer stands on the roof, a helicopter comes over, and drops a ladder. The pilot yells down to the farmer, “I’ll save you. Climb the ladder.”
The farmer yells back, “Oh no thanks, I put my trust in God.”

The helicopter goes away. The water continues to rise and sweeps the farmer off the roof into the swiftly moving water. Unfortunately, he drowns.

The farmer goes to heaven. God sees him and says, “What are you doing here?”
The farmer says, “I put my trust in you, and you let me down.”

God says, “What do you mean, let you down? I sent you two boats and a helicopter!”

I know way too many people who hate seeing someone having an easier time in their life and getting on with it, and would happily target anything that they get for free for it, whilst taking what they can to make their life easier.

It's ridiculous when you hear people who wish they had a disability so they could get DLA and not have to work. That's one scale of it. The other is this attitude that benefit claimants are abusing the system somehow, or that they should answer to the employed and be forced to find work. 

Solutions for the long-term unemployed to find work by the bitter employed are almost always intended to be some sort of circus show intended to force people into a situation like the workhouses of the 19th Century where the worst paid job is better than taking benefits. It's pretty inhumane and you tend to find their view changes when they're on the other side of the wall if they lose their job.","1301616509"

The country term for it seems to be ""scope-bite.""

- Where I live, buzzards tend to be a nuisance/illegal to kill.
- It was calving season and we had probably 10-15 newborn calves.
- Newborn calves are helpless for the most part and if buzzards are hungry enough they will make a pass at them.
So, I get home and see that there is a flock of buzzards all over a field behind my house, coincidentally the same field that holds the calves. I got the rifle (30-30,) a fairly sizable gun. I prop the barrel up on the fence and take aim. I was trying to get the shot off before the buzzard flew away, so I rushed the shot and didn't brace the butt properly against my shoulder. I was also leaned in fairly close, looking through the scope. The gun kicked back and the scope split my forehead down to the skull bone. The pain wasn't anything intense, it just felt like a swift smack to the head. 
Afterward my dad, a veterinarian stitched me up and I was good as new, aside from a nice fat scar. 
-Punishment: I had to get pictures taken with a dog surgical collar/cone over my head.

The real keys to pissing in public are simple. 

1. Don't look at it! This really is the most important part and the act of looking down for that long is what people usually associate with peeing.

2. Keep your arms/hands away from your dick. His cell phone trick is a good idea to keep one of your hands busy, but it's more ideal to keep both hands away from the crotch. Like not looking at it, people tend to associate touching in this area with peeing. Also, make sure there isn't any clothing blocking the stream, as being covered in piss is a dead giveaway.

3. Pee in a area that isn't obvious but at the same time isn't too open. The key is to look like you're looking at something or are involved in a conversation on your phone. Peeing in a very discrete area while huddled in a corner is a dead giveaway. 

They key to everything is to not look like your peeing and to not do anything that people usually associate with someone peeing in public. Using these methods I've peed in/on dog parks, bar patios, gas pumps, and a hotel lobby (very drunk). Now go forth and pee wherever you please, and remember DON'T LOOK AT IT!

Sick fo seeing ""I'll take your laptop for free or a small fee"", etc kind of stuff. I can and will repair your laptop/desktop for small fees plus price of parts. You may think that your computer is garbage but most can be repaired successfully for a small price.

Hi,
Are you still available for the computer repair?

**him to me**
Hi Kris,
I am available to help with your problems.
Thanks

**me back to him**
Fantastic! I'm so glad to hear that you are still available.

I sure do hope you can help me. The other day, I started hearing some strange noises in general area of the computer but I ignored that. Anyways, one day I looked closer and i swear I saw the computer moving. That kind of freaked me out so I just didn't go in the room for several days. When I went into the room today, it stunk to high heaven, like a very ""eggy"" stench. I think something has gotten into my computer and died. The problem is that I don't know how to open the computer and I think it's making my GB's slower. 

I am in Richmond, Va. When do you think you will be able to help me and how much money will it cost? I'm looking forward to fixing this problem.

Thanks,
Kris

**him back to me**
Hi Kris,
So, you think its a computer person to handle this...or an exterminator?  Ha, ha-I will do it no problem but where are you located?  The eggy smell had me puzzled until I readon!
Thanks, Richard 572-6919

**what i just responded with**
Hi Richard,

I definitely would have called an exterminator but two things stopped me from doing that. 1) I suspect that the said creature has already been exterminated. 2) I was worried that the exterminator wouldn't know how to open the computer either. Thanks for responding so quickly and I'm super excited that I found somebody to help me! I have just a couple questions for you. 1) How much is this going to cost me, I already spent $6.49 on a huge bottle of Febreze and $19.99 on a box fan (to put in the window) at Costco so I'm just trying to manage all the expenses. 2) I may or may not have some ""adult content"" on my computer. You will keep that private right? One time at the Geek Squad I think I heard them laughing at me when I left.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot, I live in Chesterfield. When do you think you can come?

Thanks,
Kris

While I've been sexually attracted to people of both genders (and quite a few transgendered and otherwise gender-queer people), and have fallen in love with people of both genders, I find one has very little to do with the other. There are plenty of people I'd be willing to fuck but could never be in love with, and vice versa. I tend to fall in love with people who are friends, people who I have gotten to know, that I would otherwise not find physically attractive. However, once I fall in love with someone, they become more attractive to me, physically and sexually. I tend to want to have sexual interactions with people I love, because I want to be close to them. I fell in love with my current boyfriend (who had been a friend for about 6 months, and a roommate for about 3 months) just as I'd ""given up men for good"". Go figure.

I'm not sure if that makes me ""pansexual"", or whatever. Personally, I find it a lot easier to fall in love with friends than anyone else. Maybe it's the same for you. ","1301616560"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","wow, didn't realize we were going to get out our college instructors - [here](http://english.osu.edu/people/person.cfm?ID=1046) is mine. I don't mean to be a smart-ass theatre historian, but I am one...and there is already enough misinformation about Shakespeare to fill a book (which is why I recommend the Bryson book - he dispenses with most of it, and is a joy to read). And for the record - I'm not even a big Shakespeare fan...

That there are no writings outside of the First Folio is up for some debate - there are other works ascribed to Shakespeare, and if your read any of the books by Richard Dutton on the subject you would see how many collaborations there were - writing of poetry (the word playwright was a denigrating term coined by Jonson to refer to poor poets as mere word smiths) was not the solitary job it became in the later modern period. The play *Sir Thomas Moore* likely was partially penned by the Bard.

Believe it or not, as popular as theatre may have been, it was (is) still not a particularly noble profession. Shakespeare didn't grow rich, despite his fame. We have few plays from playwrights of this era because no one thought to save them. They weren't deemed that improtant. It is not until Ben Jonson decided to put together his own works into a folio that people started to see plays as dramatic literature [the handful of Greek and Roman plays that we have only survived because they were being used to teach Latin!] There is nothing extraordinary about having little left behind - especially if one wasn't nobility or a politician - and plenty of them have nothing left behind besides a few mentions in various public records. Hell, we don't even have records of any of the other company memebers from Shakespeare's company...is there a consipracy here as well? That we have various quartos and folios of Shakespeare's work is testament to his influence, he actually left behind material we still have today, not some silly evidence of a conspiracy of his authorship. (A conspiracy that as you put it, has left no letters and no one involved in this cover-up kept a journal that has survived, despite Shakespeare being widely famous in his time in a city as big as London.) Shakespeare wasn't the only game in town. There were many other popular poets of the early modern ear...and most have little if anything for us aside from an entry in the Master of the Revel's ledger. Interestingly, the problem of documenting theatre still exists today, much of the new theatre created is still considered (as it was in Shakespeare's day) disposable - of the moment.

I know you may take offense, but the kind of scholarship you are pointing to is old and has been widely discredited [see the works of Richard Dutton and others]. There was a fad for awhile coming up with fanciful theories about who really was Shakespeare, but again, none of the theories jive with the facts and I know no modern Shakespeare scholars who subscribe to any of them.

There are plenty of mysteries about Shakespeare that don't involve improbable circumstances and cockamamie theories. For example we don't really know what he looks like - all the images that survive are posthumous by many years...and yet he was widely famous...A good source to look into for the disconnect between being famous and being respectable would be Jonas Barish's *The Antitheatrical Prejudice*.

If I have a student who needs more help to achieve, I may give that student 10 minutes of individualized attention, whereas I give another, more advance child 5 minutes, and other children no time at all. 

Inevitably, the advanced students will bicker and piss and moan that I'm not being ""fair"" when they pull a ""B"" on their paper and the other student, who I spent more time with, pulls an ""A."" They accuse me of playing favorites.  

What they're forgetting is that they spent class flirting with the boy or girl across the room, gabbing with their friends, and being generally lazy instead of focusing on their work or - shock - asking for help...but who do you think they would rather blame? 

But back to the question. Was I being ""fair""? Absolutely. From my vantage point, I was able to determine and evaluate what each student needed in order to get an ""A"" in the class and did what I had to do to get them there. 

You believe that you're standing at a high enough vantage point to determine what is fair and what isn't as it comes to salvation, when the reality is - compared to God's point of view - you're probably not.  ","1301616562"

They are big dudes so they really got some serious distance, sent me half way across the room face first into one of those metal baseboard heaters.  I ended up catching the corner of it with my face and have a nice scar, luckily it just missed my eye.  The best part is that I thought I had swan dived into the bed and bounced off it into the wall when I was going to pass out, and my friends went along with it until they came clean about it the next day.

My other good one is on my arm.  I was messing with my friend when he was passed out and he got up and body slammed me into the couch.  Good thing someone left a drinking glass in between the cushions because I got the opportunity to smash it with my palm on the way down and have the jagged glass slice up my arm, as well as skin my wrist.

"surfing","t5_2qmde","My neighbor, Ramsey, and I took his jetski out to Avalanche, the outer reef out past Haleiwa, the day before the Eddie last year.  We weren't towing (Ramsey doesn't surf), but just checking out the waves and riding a few with the ski.  

It was pretty damn huge, probably the biggest surf I've ever been in.  So, we're fucking around for a while, riding waves, jumping the ski out the back of the smaller waves, and having a blast, when he asks if I want to drive.  

So I take control and we start riding more waves.  I'm just being a cocky fuck and getting closer and closer to the whitewater, until it's breaking right behind us as we ride these monsters.  Now, I'm confident in the ocean, and I could have made it to the beach under my own power, but in retrospect I was putting Ramsey in a dangerous position that he didn't fully understand the severity of.

Anyways, so we're having fun, and the biggest wave I've ever seen rolls in (around a thirty foot face).  I jam the ski out to it at full speed, and whip it around at the bottom of the wave so we can ride it.  

Right then a little piece of chop hits the ski and tips us off.

The ski dies, obviously, and I clamber back onto the thing, jam the kill switch in and turn around... to see Ramsey is ten feet away from the ski.  The wave broke about twenty feet in front of us, and the next thing I know I'm on a dead ski (the kill switch came out in the impact), sliding down then face of this bomb.  Somehow the whitewater didn't flip me, it just pushed the ski out onto the face.  I try to start the ski as it sliding sideways, and finally the engine kicks over and I gun it out to the shoulder.

I'm fine, but Ramsey is gone.  The next thirty seconds were horrible, just scanning the foam for his head and hoping I didn't just kill him.

Finally I see his head pop up and he's swimming for the shoulder like his life depends on it.  I haul ass out, grab him, and retreat to the channel.

The first thing out of his mouth was, ""I lost my sunglasses!""  Followed by, ""That was fucking awesome, I almost died!""

We putted into the harbor nice and slow, and while I pounded a beer and tried to make my hands stop shaking he jumped back on the ski and went back out. ","1301616581"

However I'm contending that faith in and of itself is not grounds for discounting an argument...as all understanding is based upon some ground of epsitemological trust/faith.

Now that faith may take the form of trust in another's judgement, of trust in your own perceptions, the existence of others/yourself, of the future/past...etc. etc. To say that something exists is a claim that requires a host of assumptions being accepted.

Just as your belief that the gasline next to the fire is a product of a myriad of experiences, intuititions, reasonings and trust in the reliable knowledge of others so are all beliefs(even religious ones)...to say faith/trust plays no role is abit much I find.

Now the belief in a transcendent reality as espoused by many non-scientific parties is mired in faith but (as I said in the beginning) it is the veracity and nature of this faith we should question....not simply the fact that faith is required.

TL;DR - We should question someone's faith for it's reasoning and veracity not simply because their belief requires a level of faith.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;The government is going to exist despite your theories.

And murderers are going to exist despite both of our theories.  That shouldn't guide our morality to accept murder as moral.

&gt;what do you propose we do? People shooting the Westboro Baptist nuts for instance.

Unfortunately government has violently prevented alternative justice institutions and social norms from developing, so any large scale non-government response to a murder would currently be suboptimal compared to a society where alternatives to coercive governments had not been violently suppressed.  Anyway, my proposal would be that the murderer be held responsible for restitution to the families of the deceased.  Also, the murderer should be publicly shamed and widely ostracized.

If you want a more in-depth picture of my desired justice system, I suggest you read [*Machinery of Freedom*](http://daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf) and [*Practical Anarchy*](http://www.freedomainradio.com/FreeBooks/PracticalAnarchy.aspx).

&gt;Are they or are they not complicit in drunk driving?

Considering that there is no evidence there was any drunk driving, the forewarner was not complicit in any drunk driving.

&gt;Would he be complicit in that manslaughter, and if so can I kill him?

No, he would not be complicit.  No, you should not be allowed to kill him.  Also, there is a significant difference between drunk driving and killing someone while drunk driving.

&gt;When you tell someone you're a libertarian in the U.S., I think that is taken to mean that you're for smaller, less restrictive government, not zero government.

Yes, libertarianism is widely misunderstood in many ways, this being one of them.  Many people don't know anything about libertarianism.  Also, considering that most self-identified libertarians are for some government, it is a quite understandable misconception.","1301616612"

The only exception I can think of is HC mode, HQ, or SnD, when spy planes become pretty invaluable. But even then, I'd take GP/FJ over hardline since it increases your ability to survive, while still able to contribute to KSes. But in demolition, domination, sabotage, ground war, etc, hardline just falls flat, imo.

History is full of terrible people, and many of them claimed to be doing the work of God.  It is despicable.  There is not a single word in the teaching of Jesus that condones that kind of behavior in any way shape or form.  Peter cut the ear off one of the guards who came to take Jesus to be executed; and Jesus rebuked him and healed the guard.  

Christianity based on the teachings of Jesus is no more soft today than it has ever been.  The witch burners were evil, and I agree with your sentiment towards me if you think I believe any of their acts were biblically justified.  Thankfully there seem to be at least a few less horrible people inappropriately associating themselves with the message of the bible.

Doug Tompkins started the brand North Face, for people who used the clothing for alpine sports. He has since sold the company and now the company is run much like any large international clothing brand, more is better. While North Face does makes some high quality stuff, most of their stuff is of lesser quality made for the masses. If you are interested in another aspect of clothing, might I point you towards Patagonia. Their clothing not only has a 100% Lifetime Guarantee, but the stuff you wear on your back was made with the least amount of environmental harm. Literally they are the only outdoor company to do so. The gear is also some of the best quality out there.

You are right in this regard, I did the research on my own. However again, its just words at this point, I will remain skeptical until I see the demo. As for tracer darts, it was an anecdotal example of how it makes it easier to take down airplanes/choppers. My point was is that a good pilot should have standing chance against new players with AA. I don't want a repeat of Bad Company 2 where the smoke perk could not keep off the amount of tracer darts coming at you, and you would get shot down no matter how good you flew. 

&gt;The latter: dolphin diving was a huge problem in early BF2, and snipers are already a giant problem in BFBC2. If you give players prone you will have to balance that properly which they do with BF3 (adjust accuracy after dropping, apparently a suppression fire effect. etc.)

They were able to do it fix it in BF2. They know how to do it. I don't see the problem in doing the same in BF3. The ONLY issue I see with snipers is the graphics are up do a high detail where a ghillie suit would be indistinguishable from grass. 

&gt;There is no technical analysis whatsoever in there. It's entirely made up and the words used don't even make sense.

Are you sure we are reading the same article? Occlusion is a [real](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_occlusion) word. So are the others. Feel free to wiki them. 

&gt;Evenbalance provides a service called punkbuster. EA pays evenbalance money, who then make sure that the punkbuster support for the game stays up for the amount of time they get payed for. What they then do is customizing punkbuster for the specific engine and updating it to detect new hacks. It works engine specific and it does not check for stuff in your configuration.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I have played udyr before shureylia's reverie even came out (think this was like december? so before december). This means I have some experience and have a reason for my points(i made it to 1300 on my main but stopped and went to my smurf because I had too many leaves tehee). That said, if you disagree with me please refrain from just blurting out against said points, and instead offer your own opinion.

SO, for Udyr. The way I see it, there are key areas which each build for Udyr addresses, but each build has differing abilities in each area. 

Areas: **Jungle Speed** , **Ganking** , **Safety** , **Itemization** , and **Mid/Late Game** . Now I shall address the way that each of the stances approach these areas.

**TIGER**
**Jungle Speed** :As of the latest patch, Tiger has the fastest jungle route early game. If you go golem&gt;wolves&gt;wraiths&gt;lizard&gt; double golem you will be ganking around the 4 40 mark, where phoenix finishes jungle around 5 30 and ganks at 5 40 (will address this later). This changes slightly as the game goes on, but if tiger buys a madred's or wriggles he will stay ahead on the boss-kill-time(meaning dragon, lizard, golem) while falling behind on the lesser camps.

**Ganking** : After you finish your first route you obviously want to go back buy your boots and gank some people, make big-bucks and win. THEREFORE, for tiger, ganking is its main strength, seeing as how its damage is all at once, and greater attack speed allows you to get in more hits while the opponent is cc'd. You will be ganking around the 4 40 mark. The fact that this is early is another advantage that tiger has, because it reduces the chances that someone would have gone back and bought boots.One downside to Tiger Stance ganking if you are on solo queue is that I find myself getting the kill, rather than letting the carry get the gold. This is unfortunate because as tank udyr I find that extra gold doesn't really help you as much as it would help someone in lane, because the items you are getting don't directly increase your farming speed. OVERALL Tiger's main strength and the reason why this debate even exists is because it is so FREAKING EPIC at ganking.

**Safety** : By this i refer to how safe you are from being counter jungled. If you follow the 4 40 route, you will be pretty weak if someone is able to predict where you will be because you'll be either low on hp, low on mana, or both, and you don't get bear stance till the end so you can't really run away either. Tiger's good point  against counter-junglers is that if the person you are against isn't experienced against udyrs, they will have a hard time catching where you are exactly because of your speed. Generally speaking, though, prior to level 6, Udyr is pretty weak against counter-junglers like Nunu, Shaco, and a good Warwick (if the warwick isn't good and you have mana, you will most likely kill him with your ""amg op dmg"").

**Itemization** (for this I'll refer to the cookie cutter tiger stance tank udyr build, since I don't want to have to explain my build, too time consuming (ironic since I am taking so much time to write this xD)) : I find this to be Tiger's weakest area, and the main reason why, after switching from phoenix to Tiger when riot made changes, I began considering switching back to phoenix. Your first real item (not counting boots) will be wriggles (this isn't a tank item and it is worth 1550 gold) next you would get heart of gold, if you were lucky with kills and got some gold you will go ahead and buy either a negatron cloak or a chainmail vest (depends on opposite team). If team is really ad heavy then finish warden's mail, otherwise simply buy the one you were missing of the two. Make warden's mail, finish banshees (balanced damage from oponent team) finish randuin's (the point is to have h.o.g for as long as possible). This is your core build for tank tiger stance. At the moment the build is 8365 gold, and you have to take into consideration that Tiger-Stance Udyr isn't the greatest farmer, so unless you are lucky with kills this will take a while and you aren't even that tanky (also you getting the kills hurts your team). From this point onward none of the items you get for tanking will buff you tiger stance damage, meaning your advantage over phoenix will decrease(you can get atmas, but you don't have the hp to make that item worthwhile (as far as the cookie cutter tank tiger stance build is concerned)). Summary: itemization for tiger stance sucks, you spend money on wriggles which doesn't really help for tanking, and you are forced to buy banshees(bad item budget magic resis wise) otherwise you will go out of mana  due to lack of mana (or you have to take blue from a carry, which is never good after level 10/11).

**Mid/Late Game** : The Golden era of tiger has ended and the game proceeds into mid/late game. I could just automatically say that this time sucks tankwise for tiger-stance udyr but I will allow you to realize that for yourself. What are the points that make a great tank mid/late game: Initiaton, Survivability (duh), Peeling, Speed, and Side Pushing. **Initiation** wise Udyr is meh as a whole, not really much to say about this since it is based off of your skill set rather than you items. **Survivability** Since it takes longer than normal for Tiger to get damage mitigation items in comparison to other tanks his survivability goes down slightly, and if you initiate incorrectly you don't have any ""oh shit"" buttons and will most likely die before your team can come to your aid. **Peeling** Again, this comes down to your skill set and there isn't much you can do build-wise to better Udyr's natural peeling capabilities. Now **Speed** and **Side Pushing** Speed wise Tiger's items do not offer any boost to it, and since the only cdr you will have is 5% from randuin's, that isn't much of a boost to how often you can use bear stance. In addition, tiger doesn't excel at killing waves quickly, since he relies on single burst and wriggles, and thus side pushing is poor at best, if even possibly. Also due to your lack of speed, you are likely to get caught and die, becoming a hindrance rather than a benefit.


**PHOENIX**

**Jungle Speed** : Phoenix used to be the fastest stance, but due to different changes to jungle creep Magic Resis, and the way in which phoenix stance operates, it has been hit severely. I start out with a regrowth pendant and a health pot (the standard is cloth armor 5x hp pots, but i find you waste a lot of money on those hp pots, and that gold can be optimized) If you follow the Golem&gt;wolves&gt;wraiths&gt;dual golems &gt; blue pill &gt; lizard &gt; boots &gt; gank, you will gank at around 5 40. That is a whole minute later than tiger stance. This is nothing more than bad for Phoenix stance because the people in lane will most likely have boots by now, and it increases the likelihood of there being wards. Later into the game though, phoenix stance starts doing amazing damage aoe-wise and you fly through small base camps and any lane waves, your speed is still shit against boss camps, but that is why you ask your team to help you with dragon ^^, teammates op imo, please nerf.

**Ganking** : As I mentioned, by 5 40 the chances of a succesful surprise gank are low, so you have to go with the mindset that you are going not to get the kill but instead to force a blue pill or to ease pressure off of your carry/fellow team mate. *On a side note I want to say that I am planning on making a test on phoenix stance that might help with the ganking ability, but I don't want to state anything before actually testing and verifying* So then your ganking power isn't the best because your upfront damage isn't top notch, but phoenix excels at ganks on even lanes(usually the duo lanes), where your opponent stay instead of running due to various reasons (you might a have a perma slow or snare on your side). Also, phoenix stance is a better chaser than tiger because you do damage by simply standing next to the target. It might not be much, but when akali pops her shroud at like 5% to try and escape and your pulsing damage kills her you feel like a freaking beast (ta dum tssss ... oh Udyr jokes xD). A little icing on the cake: as phoenix the chances of you getting a kill when you mean to give it to your carry are low, since your damage isn't burst and you can control it better.

**Safety** : By this i refer to how safe you are from being counter jungled. As phoenix you have many paths you can take, I went through 3 different routes before ending up on this because it ganks faster than the others by a little bit, and you get money faster. What I aim at when i play Udyr is find a happy medium between safety and speed. I think phoenix offers that, because since you take a little bit longer in the jungle, your regeneration kicks in and your mana isn't as low or your health either. Not only that but since you blue pill before lizard you can take the liberty of  taking 1 point in bear if you are insecure inside your jungle (i have yet to do it in a real game, but i have tested it ^^). What i find shines with phoenix as far as safety is concerned is that even if you feel that the enemy is going to counter-jungle you, you can sacrifice some speed in order to not die, and then later catch up to them through your amazing late early game and onwards farming ability. Summary, Phoenix is pretty safe in jungle relative to the Tiger build.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I've posted this rant in a couple other places on reddit, but I'll repeat it here.

My problem with evo psych is that it just feels like they don't actually make any really falsifiable claims. If they used the methods of other historical sciences, then I'd be more inclined to put stock in their conclusions.

[Paleontology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology#A_historical_science) works like:

1 - ""Hm, all these animals are similar except that a certain trait varies between them""

2 - hypothesize a common ancestor that had a trait that could have given rise to these modern variations

3 - look for fossilized skeletons, genetic material, and other evidence of such a common ancestor

5 - ""Yes, this evidence supports my theory that these modern species are related and share a common ancestor"" OR ""No, it looks like it may be some other factor that caused these species to develop similar traits""

[Historical linguistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_linguistics) uses a similar method. You can give a good historical linguist data from romance languages and they would be able to use it to derive vulgar latin, and we could check that they were right because we have fossils of vulgar latin (mostly graffiti) that we can compare our results to. [Anthropologists](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/evolution-of-culture/) recently found a way to apply the historical method to their own field. It's a paradigm that has been shown to work very reliably, and yet I've never seen an evolutionary psychologist actually back up their claims with anything other than ""well, it would explain how things seem today, so it should be right"". I don't see any sort of actual investigation of historical evidence; I don't see any attempts to find modern differences (rather than just working off of assumed 'universals'). Evolutionary psychologists seem to be a lot more interested in [affirming the consequent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent) than actually seeing whether their premises actually correspond to reality.","1301616654"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; ""What I'm saying is that the humans who 'caused' Islam also happened to disproportionately 'caused' a lot of the science that the modern world is built upon.""

Sure did, same with America, doesn't mean anything else about those systems are right. I think Democracy is right because of evidence that it seems to work (mostly...so far...well....most of the time). Not because America has provided a lot of scientific discovery. i'm just pointing out that in this discussion, that's kind of a non sequitor. it's unimportant to the discussion of Islam as true and as useful culturally/socially/economically. I don' think it's the first, and I know that in the developed world as it is now, it's not the second.

&gt; ""This doesn't prove I'm wrong at all. In fact your own claims back my assertion. You've stated several times that without a proper economic/political/social footing, scientific inquiry/progress is extremely difficult. The Muslim world right now is mired in poverty, war, corruption."" 

yup!

&gt; ""What sort of science would come out of that? But nonetheless, science exists.""

EXACTLY!

&gt; ""They aren't at the forefront of new discoveries (that goes to the highest bidder),....""

sure!

&gt; ""....but they aren't lagging that far behind."" 

um..... may want to check that again. most of the Islamic world (and i'm talking the academics here) think evolution is false.

There are still those in the academic world of islam that claim the world is FLAT.

Is that the majority? Hell no.
But it happens a LOT and those people still garner respect and funding.....with those subject areas being there main area's of research....yah.

&gt; ""The Muslim world still produces many scientists, they're just all drained into the West (the brain drain). Politics.""

Which was kind of my point. Islam from a utilitarian point of view is a hindrance to economic, scientific, cultural and social progress. Even in the Islamic countries with high GDP science lags far far behind, and intellectuals leave in droves. Mostly because there is a strong anti-intellectualism culture (not this 'jock vs geek' culture of america or distrust of intellectuals but actual murder of intellectuals) for anything but theological study.

&gt; ""Because Islam came with an economic philosophy which also rather quickly brought prosperity to the fledgling Muslim state and then fueled its growth. In fact, it was the adoption of an Islamic currency (and it displacing the Byzantine currency as the favored ""reserve currency"" of its time) that fueled Muslim expansion to India and beyond. And that all came out of Islam (the Qur'an and hadith) too.""

again, the economic conditions of the time favored this expansion. The religion provided a codified system sure, and it even worked...but it was a more 'liberal' theology then the one practiced now. 

again. 

it was neutered politically. working with nonbelievers, having them in your city, discussions with them, all acceptable. This is the more liberal form of Islam (and one we are thankfully seeing in developing Islamic countries). In the economically bankrupt and socially hindered countries it's no surprise which form of Islam you find. It's not causative, Islam doesn't CAUSE these problems. That form just exacerbates them and breeds in it.

Keeping half of Islamic countries work force from working doesn't work. That's but one example of where Islam is maladapted to modern economic/social conditions. there has even been efforts to adapt Islam so that it would work in these conditions. That's an example of it liberalizing. I realize it's not Islam itself that is the direct issue here but instead certain cultural issues in conjunction with Islam, but that's one of the reasons Islam is particularly problematic here. It meshes into so many things that changing anything causes issues. Being able to say 'look, this improves lives' should be enough for things to change. Instead you have to debate obscure lines of text from obscure philosophies which where barely relevant to the people of the time. (this is the same condition in America with Christianity, sigh)

&gt; ""This just isn't true. Islamic society maintained a high level of religiosity for centuries as advances in civics and medicine were made by Muslim scholars... scholars of religion (like Ibn Sina, the most famous example).""

When the correct economic factors where available, and even THEN it wasn't islam of today, it was a 'liberal' islam, where actually questioning basic tenets of the faith was done by people without fear of political or mob retaliation. That's exactly my point. i'm not saying 'these people didn't believe' they most certainly *did*. Most of the people in these regions where Islamic believers. But it's a 'softer' islam they believed in.

The Islam practiced in most countries around the world does not work well with 'modern' values. it just doesn't. In the countries where they currently co-exist it's only among strong social and economic forces which support Islam in a unique way. In every country where this support is not provided (usually at a political level with strong economic advantages) Islam has gone the way of christianity. liberalization, personal faith vs public/political manipulation systems, and marginalization of the religion.

Islam isn't leading the modern value system because it's directly antithetical to it. As it liberalizes it can coexist but only through giving up effective power. That's my point.

&gt; ""I disagree somewhat. I'd say religions act to create a stagnation to change in moral variability. Morals are tied to our biological nature which isn't changing (except at an immeasurably slow pace as evolution typically does).""

I 100% agree with this. I'm just pointing out that as economic and social conditions improve, these morals *must* adapt. Islams moral codes only make sense under very nasty economic and social conditions. Why is it acceptable for men to have many women in harsh conditions? because women needed to be protected, men did not. women where precious, men where not. women needed to be controlled because without women, survival for the group did not happen. That's horrible, I fully admit it, but it's the reality of survival in such conditions. *this is not the situation in most of the modern world*.
Islam has utility in those conditions, but only so much as it could resist those who would try to change conditions to a non survival actions, but then just explaining the reasons and enforcing them could do the same.

imagine a group of 20 people, 10 men, 10 women, on a planet stranded far from home. Controlling reproduction is the only way to insure survival long term. it's required. it's not optional. it's a matter of survival. rules about reproduction under these conditions make perfect sense. It's sick. It's upsetting. It's also a matter of survival. Once a large enough genetic pool exists these rules *must* be loosened, because they no longer serve a valid purpose. Islam, like all religions, does not adapt in such a way. it attempts to resist all change. that's it's nature. This is the same for most ideologies that do not have self correcting mechanisms, or ideologies which effectively eliminate there self correcting mechanisms.

&gt; ""are you talking about law or about the natural sciences?
I would argue that the witness-centric evidence system of Islamic social law was immensely better than the alternative during the first few periods of Islamic history:""

I agree. But 'better' and 'best we have' are different things are they not?

We *know* that eye witness accounts are the worst form of evidence, it barely qualifies. It's great to point you in a direction to investigate, but it must never be a substitute. Both the social law AND scientific investigation have been hindered by this (Islam is particularly bad about this on the law, Christianity has had major issues with this on the scientific side).

For trial versions, they get you hooked on the good stuff during the trial period, then suddenly get bitchy and start asking for money after you've forgotten it's just a trial.  I hate being told ""no"" by a machine, it's humiliating.

But like everything else you modify, it's never 100%. Android, out of the box, is not exactly 100% since it's built to be adaptable. iOS was built with the iPhone hardware *solely* in mind. There's a beauty in the simplicity of it, and as my daily driver I wanted a well built OEM experience. Apple does that really well. Like most people have said, it just works. The vertical integration of the device as a whole (hardware, software, media, apps) is just better overall IMO.

To address some of your questions: 

No, I don't think anything paranormal was going on with Chris, but I can't be certain.  The references to his eyes darkening or appearing filled with blood are common descriptions of the change that often takes place in people's eyes when upset, angry, distraught, etc.  I doubt his eyes ever actually turned black or filled with blood, but due to the emotion and stress of the situation, it seemed that way.

As for the speakers, we had originally planned to use them to surround the cast with sounds and had planned to place them all over the forest.  Both Chris and Tim knew this, and may have used it in their efforts.  I only found the one speaker, though, so I can't be certain.

With the hooks, we had brought six along for the shoot, along with about 50 feet of heavy chain.  I have no idea if Chris and Tim had brought more or were recycling the ones I knew we brought.

As for truth, I maintain it to be true, but as many commenting have been skeptical about the truthfulness of this story, I'll leave it to you to decide.  I know what I saw, and whether anyone believes it or not is inconsequential to me.

As for my mental state, I have frequent nightmares and often think in ways that are likely less than normal.  I do, however, have a very strong sense of right and wrong, which allows me to function as a normal human.  I also had these memories blocked out for so long, that I was able to evolve as a normal adult for many years before recalling the story.  Now the memory, even as vivid as it is, seems a distant memory.  The only part that has me a little worried is the knowledge that Tim is no longer in the mental hospital.

You're not a troll.  You had some very valid questions.  I hope my answers help to clarify things a bit for you.","1301616684"

&gt; H.R. 471 would reauthorize the District of Columbia Opportunity Scholarship Program (D.C. OSP), which provides low-income students an opportunity to receive a competitively awarded scholarship to attend a D.C. private school of their parents’ choice.  The legislation would authorize an equivalent amount of funding for school improvement for D.C. public schools and public charter schools, as part of a three-sector approach to school reform.  The bill would authorize $60 million for each fiscal year from 2012 through 2016, with $20 million for the D.C. OSP, $20 million for D.C. public schools, and $20 million for D.C. public charter schools.

If vat-grown meat were a reality I'd jump on it so fast I'd leave my balls behind. I get very little enjoyment out of most of the things I eat. I take my supplements and shovel a bunch of green, mushy crap into my mouth but it is, for the most part, a utilitarian thing. I don't often associate eating with pleasure and therein the reason why a vegetarian/vegan diet is not for everyone. Not many people are empathic enough that they would consider eating crap they hate because the alternative makes them want to suicide out of guilt. 

Personally I have no problem eating most seafoods as they are so far removed from us and their potential for suffering is beyond abstract. As long as they are not tortured beforehand, the idea of say, plunging a knife into a lobster to sever its nervous system does not bother me in the least. Likewise, if the meat and egg industries weren't so cruel I'd have no problem with that either. A symbiotic relationship where we protect certain species from predators and starvation and they provide us with delicious eggs and cheese sounds just fine to me.

* N^firstline-1 .. N^lastline (if you remove the last line, you have to replace the comma on the previous line with a semicolon)
* N^firstline .. N^lastline+1 (if you remove the first line, you must move the _var_ to the next item)
* N^firstline .. N^lastline (for all else)

With his trademark items ruined you have to start a new quest to reforge the sword with help from distant new races, learn new skills (maybe even get a new colour for his tunic) and come back new and improved for the proper showdown. At the least it would be a chance to add some new races into the Zelda canon and explore more areas outside of hyrule.

El problema es que no todo mundo revisa los costos de produccion antes de decidir una compra, por lo que las empresas ""lavadoras"" termina diluyendo el mercado o mermando los precios que el publico esta dispuesto a pagar.

I've now got two PSU's, one of which I want to return.  And it still doesn't work, and it still beeps.


So what's next?  Do I go for a new mobo?  Or a new cpu?  Either way, I'm not getting a new one until I get a refund on the old one.  I spent $700 on all this, it should work.  As far as I know, I haven't done anything wrong as the user.  I'm kinda venting my anger here.  I know you can't expect everything to go right- something must go wrong.  But this?  This is ridiculous.  I've been about two months without a working computer, and I'm $700 down with nothing to show for it.

So where do I go next? The mobo or the cpu?  Cpu would be easiest, but I think the mobo is most likely....

I'm just at a loss.  I have no idea what to do.  I've put so much time and money and effort into this, and I've gotten nothing in return.  I'm tempted to just take it into some viable computer shop, throw money at some guy (hey, I've already spent a small fortune, right? What's another $150?) and say FIX IT.

* 2nd: Saying I'm not depressed and that I'm a whiny little bitch.
* 3rd: Mocking my use of medication. Defending your own posts. Insulting my doctor.
* 4th: Giving me the name of a movie. Trying to pass that as ""advice"".
* 5th: Complaining that I don't like your ""advice"".
* 6th: Yet again more insults.

Let's also not forget that you've chosen to ignore my questions multiple times.

I'm not sure if you are thinking poor people having more babies made them poorer, or that rich people had less babies making them richer, but neither makes sense.

If you do, then 75 child rapists will be punished accordingly. If you don't, then the 75 child rapists will go on living free lives.

What choice do you make?

Another thought experiment along similar lines:

Suppose the justice system X operates according to the 25% error margin, meaning 25% of the subjects it punishes are innocent. The rapes appear to be occurring in groups, sometimes with as many as six men raping the same young girl. Suppose rapes occur in groups of 3--3 men simultaneously rape the same girl.

Then in a group of 75 rapists, there were precisely 25 actual victims. Yet in order to redeem these 25 victims by killing the 75 men who raped them, 25 innocent men must be killed as well. Redemption achieved through the murder of innocents in precise one-to-one correspondence.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Question for ya:

I have an OLD luxaire a/c unit (best guess installed when house was built in 1972) with a janitrol furnace (installed 1998) last summer it did not seem to cool as well as it had in previous years. 

Water was dripping down the front of the inside unit and got on the circuit board shorting it out.  Thought I needed a new circuit board but after it dried out (hair dryer and towels strategically placed to alter run-off) it started working again.  

It is my understanding that it could be low on refrigerant...what kind would it use and can I still put some in there...myself or a technician? or it could be a plugged drain...I don't think it is the latter as I peeled the housing off a bit and crammed a coat hanger down to clear the drain out but it still dripped water. as long as the water is kept from the circuit board it ran fine...although at a seemingly less cool temperature.

what do you think the chances are that I could get someone in or myself to top off the refrigerant. I do not really want to throw a lot of money at it that would be better served towards a replacement but if it is a simple matter of needing to be topped off then that seems like it would be a lot cheaper. how much to recharge a 40 year old unit...if it can be done?

as a note I have been in the house for 11 years and never had it serviced...I know..bad homeowner but in my defense when we bought the house I had an hvac inspection and he basically said don't let anyone near it...implying they would either damage something or convince me that the whole system was crap and needed to be replaced.

tl/dr: old ac unit not cooling, is it worth seeing if it is a simple recharging and if so how much $$ to do so","1301616795"

I'm in Aus so perhaps acronyms or whatever are different for you but basically, do you ever check people's phones for contact info? You mention that you don't personally call... perhaps the hospital does this?

My initial thoughts are that it would be 100% useless and ""mum"", ""dad"", ""home"" etc would be what you're after if anything.

TL;DR: Is creating a specific listing in your phone for an emergency contact in any way advantageous? ","1301616801"

(Added bonus: you end up getting some weird veggies you didn't even know existed, makes you feel like Iron Chef)

Here are the ones I have had personal experience with:

[Telecolte farms](http://www.localharvest.org/tecolote-organic-farm-M406)Lots of veggies, nice people, but only in the summer. Drop off locations in your neighborhood that you go and pick up.

[Farmhouse Delivery](http://www.farmhousedelivery.com/) Switched to these guys last fall 'cause they are year round. Comes from a number of different farms, so some veggies/some fruits. Can also order meats/cheese/local baked goods/etc. (I keep meaning to, but never have). Delivered to your door.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Two reasons.

1.)  I straight up am an addict.  The longest I have gone without internet since about 1998 or so was 6 months.  That was how long I was in Iraq.  My last three relationships started online and actually ended online, with my fiance leaving me by yahoo IM.  I haven't been out socializing in months other than a 3 hour show up at a party friends demanded I be at.  All my free time at work is spent on reddit, web comics or blogs.  When I get home, I check all the NSFW/NSFL stuff I couldn't see at work, I play my MMO (Lord of the Rings online), or watch netflix.

I spend so much time with these distractions, I haven't started the web comic I want to do even though I started planning it 2 years ago.  I used to write all the time, and hardly do it anymore other than forum or blog comments, I have no outdoor hobbies, I have wanted to learn to code SQL/JAVA/PHP to get a better paying job, but I'm always distracted by the web, I have 500 gigs of music that are completely unsorted so I have no idea how many doubles and triples are in there.  I hardly read books anymore.  The dog never gets walked except on smoke breaks.  I am an internet pylop.  Most food I eat can be easily consumed at a computer.

2.)  By quitting the internet, it will be like a smoker quitting.  They notice how often they see smokers in public, on tv, the movies, references in music or books, etc.  They realize how pervasive it is in society.  In that regards, I'm going to write about how often I see true interpersonal interaction replaced with the internet.  Laptops in coffeeshops, people texting at dinner or in nightclubs.

The whole section on the Qur'an. &lt;sigh&gt; 

really? we really have to do this?

&gt; ""and the prophetic narrative (which is revelation brought by one man aided by verifiable miracle).""

except it's not verifiable miracle. it's hearsay by others (you have seen a flying horse?). which, again, you would not accept for any *other* religion, so why would you accept it for islam?

&gt; ""The Qur'an's miraculous nature stands for all time and is empirically verifiable.""

*sigh*

The Koran has contradictions, not many, but it does. Even if it didn't, that wouldn't prove it was from god. It would just be something you would expect a god to get right. A human can write a book that has no contradictions, so a book without contradictions is not evidence of a god creating it. The Koran is more consistent by far over the bible, but then we should expect it to be. It was produced over a very small period of time by one person shocker that it does better then the bibles method =-P. 

failure 1.

&gt; ""Someone (not a Muslim I take it) posted in the other reddit submission about the greatest history mindf**ks that every grammatical structure of the Arabic language is contained in the Qur'an.""

so? I could create a text containing all the grammatical constructs of the english language. here let me link you to one: www.wikipedia.com

A long text will contain most of the grammatical constructs of a language. One containing rhyme and rhythmic schemes will do even better at sampling such constructs....and if you make it a holy book that everyone in a culture must revere and praise as perfect contrary to all observable evidence....they will even take constructs which where NOT in the language...and use them in the language....making it part of the language. wow. 

failure 2.

&gt; ""it doesn't stop there. The Qur'an containes [sic] forms of prose and poetry that are not usable by any human.""

Really? It uses a lot of repetitive rhyme schemes which are not exactly that impressive. half the Koran rhyme schemes end and start with 'nun' that's not exactly 'prose and poetry that are not usable by any human'. It's closer to a rhyme scheme someone got comfortable in and stuck with repetitively simply because they could use it.

&gt; ""The Qur'an itself issues a challenge to disbelievers to produce one chapter (a few lines worth) that fits its style.""

So....it's a miracle that no one can copy (according to some undefined metric here) the style of another author? how exactly are you to measure that? I can produce a computer program that can copy the stylistic behavior of any English author but that's because I know English. Creating such a program for Arabic is probably harder (there being less research in linguistics in Arabic....there being this slight intellectual sink hole called Koranic studies around the whole thing) but it's not impossible by any means. 
the problem is that no matter *what* is produced muslims have a vested interest in not accepting it. Also it's irrelevant to the truth of the claims of Islam but it's interesting to point out the issues with such a 'test'.

&gt; ""Arabic is split into poetry and prose. Poetry is split into 16 metrical patterns (al-Bihar). All Arabic poetry, before or after Islam, fits the 16 bihar.
Prose is split into rhymed prose and normal speech.
The Qur'an fits none of these categories. All other Arabic speech fits into one of the above categories at a time. The Qur'an, at once, is a fusion of metrical (poetry-like rhyme) and non-metrical (prose) speech.""

So let me see if I have this right....a guy....wrote a book...unlike any of the styles in the area....and so....it must have been a miracle? a human being is unable to produce a creative work that has only loose ties to surrounding literary systems?

So when the first western story was produced it was a miracle? 

So when the first guy did beat boxing it was a miracle?

So the first throat chanting was a miracle? 

Same thing. all of these are amazingly creative *different* constructs that where at best loosely correlated to earlier constructs.

not a miracle.

&gt; ""The Arabs of the 7th century were great orators and poets, committing huge epics to memory.""

oral tradition memories do not work the way we think of them. They didn't remember them verbatim, no oral tradition has ever worked this way in history. fahrenheit 451 is a story, not how reality of oral traditions work no matter how much hype people in history and modern culture claim it.

&gt; ""They were shellshocked by the Qur'an.""

I'm sure they where impressed. And? none of this shows that the claims are likely to be true. The followers of Joseph Smith where impressed by his story also, and?

&gt; ""Muhammad (saw) was illiterate and knew nothing of poetry.""

really....really? have you ever *thought* about any of these claims? used some of that wonderful skepticism? How likely is it that he had no knowledge of poetry....go to *any* third world country. pick ANY 'street rat' child of say 12 or so. ask them to list of anything they know about pretty words in music or poetry. They will have something.

Your trying to tell me that Muhammed was cut off from *all* of that? lets for the sake of argument say you are right and that's true.....SO? human beings can't create poetry? bull.

&gt; ""Furthermore, he never used this style of Arabic himself. No hadith are in this style. Only the Qur'an."" 

a back water hick managed to write a story that doesn't match that of the highly literate and accomplished story tellers of the time but that was interesting and enjoyable. Sure, that's impossible without a miracle....really? come on man.

&gt; ""So great was the recognition of the Arabs of this impossibility, they used to convert just after hearing its recitation.""

no. it's CLAIMED they did. I'm sure a few did, i know morons who converted to Mormanism after being told the story while in a highly emotional state. does that mean Mormanism is true?

&gt; ""Westerner commentators created a new category called 'Qur'anic Rhymed Prose' (Qur'anic saj). That's well and good but it still doesn't address the challenge to produce a few lines of Arabic in the Qur'an's style.""

oh look, ad hoc reasoning....did I call it or what.

&gt; ""Once the miraculous nature of the Qur'an is verified, then everything it says is accepted deductively.""

No. Even if the Koran had all the properties you listed this would not mean it was correct.

If I showed you a book that had perfectly smooth paper, wonderful prose, lovely hand writing, staggeringly clear ink, wonderfully resistant paper, the text rhymed in a pleasing manor...on and on and on and on etc etc etc if it was all these things....but said the Koran was wrong...would that make that book correct?

no. It's claims are either true or false based on *evidence* not on if it's presented nicely. It's presentation is *irrelevant* compared to the evidence on which it rests. the fact that you have even mentioned any of the above indicates you are not interested in investigating if these claims are likely to be true, you just care to believe them.

&gt; ""Obviously the religion isn't alive. I feel you're still playing semantics. Even if you want to say humans did science, humans did religion, religion and science didn't do each other, what I'm arguing is that a certain group of humans devoted to a certain religion has a disproportionately huge impact on the development of science.""

again. sure. but not because they where of that religion. but because they had the economic resources to do so. They don't now have those economic resources and so they don't provide scientific advancement as much as other countries.

let me see if I can explain why I keep saying this in this way. you keep trying to imply Islam is right because in history those who where Islamic provided a strong foundation of knowledge for science.
This is incorrect, and for the **SAME** reason as if I where to claim Islam is *incorrect* because those who are islamic now are *not* providing for scientific advancement.

see?

that same implication can be turned back, and it's just as unimportant to the question of 'is islam true' as my hypothetical argument. as to the question of 'is islam useful for science' the answer is ""it's not useful or useless, at best it provides emotional reasons to do it"". 

That's my point. The way I keep phrasing it is so that you can't do that subtle implication which is 1) irrelevant at best and 2) wrong currently.

really? There sure seems to be a *lot* of writings from the golden age of Islam about both Islam &amp; science.

Violence happened, yes even religiously motivated (or I would rather say with some religious influence, usually religion just acts to exacerbate or provide a banner to fight under, rarely is it the sole driving force) but the point is that this was a time of plenty economically, socially, and religiously but the key was not that these people where Islamic, they where, but that they where *merchants* and this fostered most of the behaviors and social customs. There where many places where they had to 'interpret' the rules to accommodate this. 

&gt; ""No, the theological idea of the nature of God and His ominpotence (in Islamic monotheism) necessitated skepticism of the causal principle.""

no...theological discussion of the nature of what these people had decided the nature of god was necessitate skepticism of the causal principle.

This is just as much mental masturbation as counting the angels that can dance on the head of a pin. Once you decide a principle is true *without evidence* then you can think your way out into no mans land if you fail to use empirical investigation to self check.

again. provide empirical data on the nature of god.

"lotro","t5_2rfus","I'm not answering your question, but I also play casually so here's my take on paying for LOTRO.

I also find the subscription model inconsistent with my casual play style. This is what caused me to stop playing other MMOs. I'd feel pressure to play but then my interest would lag, I'd let my subscription lapse and then wouldn't bother renewing it.

Which is why I like LOTRO's pay-as-you-go premium status. I definitely play enough to spend money on it, so I bought a chunk of TP and bought MoM (gametimezone.com) and will use the 1 month VIP to unlock the character goodies, and then go back to premium and buy content as I go.

Since I'm not subscribing, I don't feel silly just logging in and messing around with my inventory for a few minutes, or wasting time farming instead of leveling--although oncogene gives me shit for going up only 3 levels in 2 weeks while he's gone up like 20 ;P

Like Johnathyn, I don't know your budget, but the amount of content and playtime you get in this game for the $ is a pretty amazing value, especially compared to console games, as Johnathyn mentioned or going to a single movie or a single DVD ($10-$15 for ~2 hours).","1301616867"

Just because you saw those 5 dogs doesn't mean they were the ones that shit. Also, you weren't around long enough to determine if those bags got picked up by the owners.

To use a similar analogy:

My neighborhood got tagged by 3 asshats in 12 different places this week.

Some programmers decided to write a program that used IMDB to determine any actor's interrelatedness (to all other actors, not just Kevin Bacon). The person who is currently most connected is the late Dennis Hopper. The average number of steps needed to connect him with any other actor listed on IMDB is around a 2.

I just saw them live last Sunday in Oakland and it was...interesting.  I was a little worried because I was reading reviews, and people were not that positive about the live show.

I can't quite tell what they think about hip-hop.  I know they are making fun of a lot of things, but Sit Down, Man is a record made by people who really love hip-hop.  And on top of that, the opening lineup for the Das Racist show was spectacular.  I mean, I don't know how much DR gets involved with picking the openers (versus the promoters), but they just had stellar, stellar openers, which makes me think they must care a little bit about their show.

The show itself was ok.  Good energy.  Kool A.D.'s parents were there, so maybe that got him going a bit.  Ashok was awesome.  But it was just strange enough that it wasn't a great show (going crazy for this ear piercing eagle noise, excessive mumbling, netbook issues).","1301616919"

Nobody has suggested that Gaza is ""a real luxury"", but I wrote that in response to your absurd claim that it ""is a concentration camp"".

&gt;I heard they tried to have a yacht sailing competition a while back, but the Turkish team was shot dead by IDF soldiers.

You mean the Turks that refused Israel's offer to inspect the ship before letting it through by stabbing several soldiers and throwing them overboard?

&gt;Of course ethnic cleansing should refer to dismantling settlements illegal under international law.

Sure.  it's okay when they do it to Jews.

&gt;Rabbi Yosef is an advocate of peace, as long as Israel is not required to make any concessions to the subhuman Palestinian slave-people.

Did you read the article?  He specifically says concessions should be made if it would save lives.  Please read before commenting.

&gt; Every counterargument you present rationalizes even the most criminal Israeli actions and deflects criticism.

They're only criminal if you've condemned them before you interpret them, as you've shown here.

&gt; you ready to admit that Israel has ever committed any human rights abuses against the Palestinians?

There has been no order from the government (i.e. ""Israel"") to ""abuse civilians"".  Individual soldiers may commit individual acts.  Only in your racist world is such an act by one person or another worth condemning and boycotting an entire state.

&gt; What would your life be like if you were born on the other side of that atrocious wall?

You mean the fence that has been largely successful in keepin terrorists off Israeli streets?  The fence that was made necessary by the Palestinian terrorists themselves?

&gt;Can you imagine feeling humiliated and dehumanized?

Can you imagine being blown to bits in a bar, or in a market, long before 1967?

&gt; The world is increasingly turning its back on Israel, and recognizing Palestinian rights.

Really?  Are you referring to the Egypt that shoots any Palestinian dead on sight if they try to enter the country?  Or the Arab countries that sponsor resolution after resolution but refuse to grant citizenship to any Palestinian that asks for it?

&gt;I don't see Israel as an inherently evil entity, but as long as the government and supporters of this false concept of racial superiority are in power, Israel has no place among civilized nations. I hope you come to realize that treating Palestinians as equals is necessary to achieve lasting peace. Until then, you can live in your own delusion, and watch Israel shrink bit by bit in your lifetime.

Ironically, Israel treats them like equals more than any other country.  They are treated like a people that is responsible for their own behaviour.  You, on the other hand, treat them like children whose only response to perceived land-grabbing and humiliation is mass-slaughter of every man, woman, and child that they think did it to them.

You are the reason this conflict continues - you empower scared people in Israel and the animals that send people to their deaths to achieve political gains.","1301616922"

"skateboarding","t5_2qig3","I don't know if you have heard much from others on getting started, but when you are just starting to learn to skate, the best thing that you can do is to just get comfortable standing on your board. It moves really quickly and can get away from you if you aren't paying attention, so the best thing to do first is to take a few minutes to set it on some carpet and just stand on it. Figure out whether you are more comfortable riding regular or goofy. Get used to leaning and pushing your board down with your heels and toes since that is how you are going to turn. Figure out where you need to put your feet for both riding and to pop the tail..

Once you get that find an empty street or parking, at night if you can so that you don't have to deal with cars, and just push around the parking lot until you are comfortable riding, turning, stopping, etc. You aren't going to be doing anything else until you are comfortable riding your board. I have known some people that have trouble even just pushing at first. If that is you, find a slight incline, stand on your board and just coast until you get used to riding and then start to push once you are a little more comfortable. Balance is the biggest thing. 

Once you get the basics, just ride the hell out of it. Ride it everywhere that you can. If you want to go to the store or the gas station to get something to eat, skate. If you can ride to school or work, do it. You are going to fall. You are going to hurt. It's a fact. Just get back up, figure out what you did wrong and learn from it.

"keto","t5_2rske","I started with a BMI over 35+... way over. I've lost about 25 lbs so far since I started low-carb and about 20 since I started keto (I lose roughly 6-8 lbs every 4 weeks). I started because I was told I had insulin resistance and possibly PCOS and the only way to reverse it was to control my insulin and lose weight.

It took me about 7 days to enter Ketosis. I had a weekend in the city though, which kind of threw me off a bit with drinks and food, but about 3 days after getting home I was definitely in ketosis. I remember being lethargic for the first 14 days, and took afternoon naps, but I was pretty dilligent.

I counted carbs more than calories but my original goals were 20g of carbs and 1400 calories. Most days I couldn't make myself eat more than 1200 calories, but other days I went as high as 1600 (usually weekend cheat days, where I drink alcohol and we usually have a fancy cheese or pate). I probably still only eat about 1400 calories per day, some days I might be hungrier than others, but most of the time I eat a smallish meal in the early afternoon and generally not again until dinner. However, I don't count my calories or force myself into a deficit. I just eat how my body feels it wants to eat. 

You are welcome to do a low-calorie ketosis diet. Most ketosis diets end up low-calorie because a lot of people just don't need those kinds of calorie demands, especially when your body has an excess of energy just jiggling around waiting to be used up. Assuming you've looked into the major role insulin plays and why cutting carbs works for us, you only end up over eating because you're starving at a cellular level. So when your cells are being fed they will tell you they are full and you'll likelt eat a lot less than you do now.

Eating more calories will not put you into a state of ketosis any faster than eating a proper ratio and eating to satiety. You cannot enter a deeper state of ketosis by eating more fat either. You just need to make sure most of your *calories* are coming from fats, regardless of your total calorie count. Eating more will not make you lose more.

Initially you need to force feed yourself fats and protein when your body is screaming for sugar. Than your body will start to convert to a ketosis metabolism and you *should* have a reduced appetite. 

Think of eating as giving your body nutrients, not energy. You eat a variety of keto-friendly fresh foods every week to give your body all the vitamins and minerals and other compounds found in the food we eat. When you eat fat and protein, which our bodies are made of, you are giving it a *variety* of fats and proteins that your body does not make or already contain in itself. Your belly fat, should be your primary fuel source, and your body will use it.

So it's important to eat properly, maintain the keto balance and don't worry so much about calories as long as the food you're putting in your body is a good variety to give it when it needs. This will be the most effective thing in helping your health and likely your weight loss. ","1301616970"

So we started a relationship with him where he’d submit a story here and there and we’d send him random games. This relationship continued on Reddit as it grew in popularity. This was good for us, as we all liked Reddit, but didn’t feel like our content had much exposure on the site. After some time we began to pay him a small amount of money instead of games.
&gt;
&gt;**However, we didn’t know the full extent of how he was achieving success on Reddit.**

Wow.  Just wow.  So the only thing wrong here according to their bullshit, is that they didn't know how the success was achieved?  But paying for submissions was OK?  That didn't ring any alarm bells?  These fuckers are really morality-challenged.  I bet the only sorry they feel is that they're sorry they got caught.

What a way to confirm, validate and entrench the already strong stereotype that all the professional gaming review magazines and sites are sell-outs who can't print an honest word even if they tried.

If *I* ever have kids, it will be when there is a father willing to be there. Not because I believe you need a mommy and daddy, but because I know I struggle with seasonal depression (of sorts) and I will need help raising a kid unless I am much more stable. I also don't want the grandparents to raise them unless... well, I'm dead. Help, sure, but as a babysitter, not a second set of parents.

We must also be financially stable in our jobs and able to afford it without applying for food stamps.

EDIT: I also want to add that if I keep the kid and the father doesn't want it, I need to ensure I can afford it on my own. I find it horridly irresponsible to bring a child into the world while depending on the unwanted father's money. If I can't take care of it in those circumstances, I have no business raising it.

In each scene I noticed footprints in the sand. Sometimes there were two sets of footprints, other times there was only one.

This bothered me because I noticed that during the low periods in my play, when I was suffering from anguish, sorrow or sloppy macro, I could see only one set of footprints. So I said to Day[9],

“You promised me Day[9], that if I followed you, you would coach me always. But I have noticed that during the most intense battles there has only been one set of footprints in the sand. Why, when I needed you most, have you not been there for me?”

Day[9] replied, “The games when you have seen only one set of footprints, my newbie, that is when I carried you.”","1301617020"

"Boxing","t5_2qj0l","Some of these comments make sense but some eh.

The main thing you are doing wrong is your footwork. You are boxing lefty: when you fight lefty and your opponent is righty what you want to do is make sure your right (lead foot) is outside his left (lead foot). this way you have a better angle on them and it lines you up for your cross. 
Another factor is remember your a lefty that means your jabs are not going to be so effective because they are easily blocked by your opponents lead hand. the both of you will always be clashing. What you want to remember is that you dont throw 1s you want to be throwing at least 4 punches. Your cross is very important. you can even lead with your cross.

Remember lead foot outside his lead foot (fight for positioning) then throw the cross more.

*if you get better (you can even use your lead hand to hit away his lead and then go for the jab) You want to be hitting his lead hand a lot but only with your lead hand.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;Unfortunately government has violently prevented alternative justice institutions and social norms from developing, so any large scale non-government response to a murder would currently be suboptimal compared to a society where alternatives to coercive governments had not been violently suppressed. Anyway, my proposal would be that the murderer be held responsible for restitution to the families of the deceased. Also, the murderer should be publicly shamed and widely ostracized.

So the courts should exact blood money from the assailant. Given that, why do you think it's OK to go the extra judicial route in the case of this sign holder? 

I'd also love to know what we're supposed to do if one party fails to agree with the decision of an arbitrator, or why one would expect any rational person to go to an arbitrator for a crime which would require a large portion of their property or their freedom as recompense. 

&gt;Considering that there is no evidence there was any drunk driving, the forewarner was not complicit in any drunk driving.

But if there was he would be. So it would be justifiable to beat up/restrain this man if I discovered that one of the drivers he was warning was in fact drunk, yes? 

&gt;Yes, libertarianism is widely misunderstood in many ways, this being one of them. Many people don't know anything about libertarianism. Also, considering that most self-identified libertarians are for some government, it is a quite understandable misconception.

Of all the species that have lived on the Earth since life first appeared here 3 billion years ago, only about one in a thousand is still living today. All the others, the vast majority, became extinct, typically within ten million years or so of their first appearance. This large extinction rate has had an important influence on the evolution of life on Earth - the population and repopulation of an ecological niche by species after species allows for the testing of a much wider range of survival strategies than the slower process of phyletic transformation by which a species gradually adapts its morphology and behavior to its surroundings.","1301617053"

"CrohnsDisease","t5_2s453","Hey, this may be a little late, but I'll chime in anyway. I just had a small bowel resection w/ open surgery in late December due to a 3cm abscess from a bowel perforation. At the same time they also removed my appendix and also repaired several fistulas on my bladder. The surgery itself went by wonderfully, and the nurses I had made me laugh and joke before I was put under. The next day you'll be really out of it and in a lot of discomfort - but not severe pain. The nurses will make you get up and walk around the next morning - and it'll help heal you quicker. The pain meds they give you also slow down healing because they typically cause constipation... so they'll take you off of them after two or three days, and give you meds only when you request them. Honestly, that day was one of the harder days for me as I thought I had gotten by the worst of it, and without the pain meds it was very uncomfortable. I was out of the hospital 6 days later, and felt pretty good. About three weeks after the surgery I felt about 95% and 3 months after it I feel better than I have in the last 4 years.

While I don't disagree with this at all, I certainly do not think that the proverbial elitist buck stops there.  I would say the rabbit hole goes much, much deeper than a think tank or two (or three).

&gt; I have never seen any convincing evidence that there's one particular organization with the most influence.

Look around for ""911 Facts"" or truths regarding things of the like.  While I also don't think the buck stops with those responsible for 911, they represent a good piece of a puzzle that seems consistently interconnected.

&gt; these organizations don't attempt to control everything, usually just their own slice of the pie.

Like it or not - and whether we *see* it or not - there seems to be something or someone in control of the whole pie.

&gt; Think about environmental atrocities. That's not the result of some massive organization deciding how best to destroy forests or degrade water supplies.

Ever heard of HAARP?

&gt; It's many corporations and investors with the same interests: maximizing profits.

Valid as I agree this may be, it doesn't preclude insider trading, cooperation, and coordination similar to some of the massive, multinational corporations that, for example, own 2/3s of the cereals you see on the store shelves.  You are lead to believe that you have a choice as to where your money goes in purchasing this that or the other, but at the end of the day, all those organizations are owned by one larger monolith that gets your money after all is said and done.  Ever heard of [Serco](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szNLMtgI7hU)?

Imagine, if you could, who *they* work for.

It will be easy for many to disregard what I say and pull the ""Conspiracy theorist!"" card out.  It's a card that often shows itself to be a knee jerk reaction many make when afraid or unwilling to dig deeper and ask further questions about what's actually happening around them.  Not saying this against *you* necessarily.  Just mentioning it in general.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Yes, but relativity answers that extremely well. Special relativity found out that inertial mass was a type of energy. It's a thing that doesn't change for any observer measuring the energy and momentum of a system.

Then General relativity takes one matrix of all the energy of a system called the ""Stress-Energy Tensor"" to determine how space is curved. The mass from Special relativity feeds into the Stress-Energy Tensor. The SET determines how space-time is curved. And when you do physics in a curved space you get the *appearance* of gravity that ends up being determined by that inertial mass from special relativity.

Thus inertial and gravitational mass are both connected via relativity.","1301617087"
"pobweekend","t5_2se6d","::A rather skinny, pale fellow in a silver trimmed overcoat walks up and sits down. He puts down the red leather tome he was carrying and pours himself a cup of the table wine.::

My name is Ovid. I'll keep this short so you can get back to breaking rocks with slightly bigger rocks or whatever it is you do for fun around here. 

I love books. Books are what separates those that are remembered from everyone else. Bards exist to sell you more wine. What's the point of killing my 30th dragon if all I get is a sweet little melody? Aside from the gold and power, nothing of consequence. No word of my accolades would reach farther than the local beer swilling tavern. And really, what does wealth and control amount to if no one has ever heard of you before? 

You see this book? ::Ovid taps on the book twice:: It hasn't been mine for very long now. It's former owner, Barthmi, was a bit of a hermit. This Kingsham mercenary group I was working for at the time had decided they wanted the old coot's cave for a new warehouse. It was only after the 2nd gang never reported back that they finally got it through their thick little skulls that I might be right: don't assault a wizard with a tightly clustered group of minions. 

Another reason you don't rely on bards; your story gets distorted to the point where a bunch of low bred Luskan thugs get the impression they can take things from you.

::Ovid sets a gold coin on the table. He balances a dagger on the coin with one finger and the tip placed firmly on the raised profile of some regional king. His free and flicks the blade and sets it spinning.::

Barthmi was not much of a problem after I closed the distance between us instantly. I saw recognition in his eyes as I re-materialized with this carving it's way through his cloak. ::He waves at the spinning weapon.:: . One more for the Raven Queen.

I took the old wizard's spell book as compensation for years of inadequate pay, parted ways with the company of thugs and made my way here. While they may just be mouth breathers, there are quite a few of them.

::Ovid snatches the handle and tucks the blade out of sight.  He picks up the gold coin and dumps the dust into his hand while mumbling something under his breath.  A bright green fire sparks to life in the cupped hand. He then dumps a very small gold disk on the table and then presses his thumb onto the soft metal extinguishing the small flame.::

Eventually they'll start putting my face on the coins. Until then, you all look like you could use my help.","1301617087"

I see people seemingly every day now in my job who can't speak a word of English but are driving brand new cars and I simply cannot believe all these are legal immigrants.

I'm a 5th generation Texan and I simply cannot tolerate what is happening in my state any longer. Laws change society and legal residents of this state can change the laws.

Are there long term successes? A couple decades or even several generations of wealth would come out of the noise of tens of billions of attempts (lives).  The law of large numbers only works for large numbers; it's irrelevant when looking at a sample size of one.

Also, luck doesn't imply normal distributions nor does dominance imply that it operates in a vacuum.  Obviously network effects, parental wealth and education, and so on have a huge effect on a demographics' mean results (but those are factors mostly outside of the individual's controller, that is 'luck'). Still, I don't think anyone is going to argue that individual variance is unrelated. Intelligence, hard work and so forth are most often necessary conditions, but luck differentiates between the millions who meet those conditions from the hundreds who become billionaires.

Also, I remember reading somewhere that 30-40% of graduates with part-time work go on to work their part-time job full-time, and while I can't find the link but I know that it's true for around 60% of my friends. Although, to be fair mostly have degrees in humanities, but up to and including masters and doctorates. So when I do work, I want it to be in my industry, even if that means I'm fucking broke during the semester because I know I won't be managing a porn store in 5 years.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","There seems to be a a trend on r/atheism where the posts will be anti-God rather than truly atheist, criticizing the nature of the deity itself by characterizing it as evil rather than by pointing out the contradictions of its existence. The problem is not that you should not worship God because it is evil, or anti-you. Many classical religions operated under the assumption that the gods are not necessarily good and that they need to be worshiped on the off chance they decide not to murder you. The problem is that people attribute their problems to the works of a deity rather than to events grounded in the observable universe. You can criticize the Judeo-Christian deity all you want, but a truly atheist answer would be ""God did not massacre the Jews during the holocaust. Instead it was a regime using the people's weakness to fall for generalization and the targeting of scapegoats to rise to power and carry out a racist goal inspired by a misinformed belief about social subgroups. You should all watch the old news reports of the Nuremberg trials, as they embody real-world human conflict regarding the subjectivity of morality and the consequences of ignorance, and they set a precedent to which we should compare the actions of rulers for the rest of human history. God has nothing to do with it, only people, people who can be stopped if we pay attention to them."" ","1301617164"

Climbed out a back window that had broken out moments before the car burst into flames.

As I was stumbling around on the side of the road, I noticed my entire shirt and pants were coated in blood, and then I checked my face in a passer-bys mirror and saw two holes straight through my face into my mouth.

Like waking from a bad dream in which all your family dies and you appreciate them more, not only will God restore things but somehow they will be even better than they would've been if we stayed in the garden forever, sinless, but without free will.

From my understanding, the legal system in the US is labyrinthine (especially regarding business and tax law).

There should be a single federal tax structure. States should have very very limited authority to levy things such as property tax. This would streamline businesses, reduce loopholes and bizarre corporate structures.

Also, have a proper progressive tax system - lower the minimum threshold at which you pay tax, but also increase top taxation rates. Couple this with a slow increase of the minimum wage.

Also, cut subsidies to industries (obviously not all at once), and invest that money in science and research. Any technology would be licensed for commercial production (with money going back to the government) or released for the public good - this would stimulate long term research into technology which has a longer term payoff (eg Thorium, fusion, transport, communication, space)

Financial reform - especially regarding the banking sector.

Health and education - have a national curriculum, government provided healthcare (through optional taxes).","1301617175"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I work in an Adult store. And while most of my regular male customers are respectful, married men, there are some younger ones who think they'll get a date by blurting out a random ""So d'ya have a boyfriend?"" and I usually smile and respond with ""sorry sweetie, missed the boat there. By five years :D"" They quickly back off. 

I don't mind if they hit on me, so long as they are relatively respectful. I have rarely had to evict anyone from my workplace for rudeness which is good.
Our staff is all female, and we have some older male customers who come in on a regular basis to try and chat us up. I'm a bit more of a newbie and recently had this older dude come in and try to hit on me. He started with ""Wow, there must've been an improvement in management or something recently, you're the prettiest one I've ever seen here!"" He leered and me and I simply smiled and went back to my dusting and tidying.

He kept following me around and standing too close, asking me where I was from, if I had a boyfriend and then it finished something like this;
&gt;Oldman - You're so pretty...really exotic looking...
me - Thanks. I really appreciate when people say stuff like that. My surgeons did a really good job with fixing me up.
oldman - Oh! So you've had some work done?
me - Yes, well, when I was a child I was accidentally exposed to a chemical spill and had really bad second-degree burns on my face and neck. They did a full reconstruction.
Oldman - (goes really quiet and doesn't pursue the issue any further)

it was mean, but he was getting on my nerves. Another time I had this really weird man who was a saturday regular until he phoned my work after hours and tried to ask me out on a date. He said something along the lines of ""you mentioned you didn't have a partner so...I was wondering if you wanted to do something after work?"" And I responded that I did. And anyway, how was that any of his business?  He never came back to our store again.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt;My point was to say that if you don't like this thread, down vote it and move on to another thread.

Right, you're discouraging people from voicing earnestly felt opinions.

&gt;If instead you decide you're going to be a troll and stomp your feet about karma circle jerks 

I don't think its true that the people voicing opinions in opposition to these types of threads aren't *actually* annoyed. I think karma circle jerks genuinely bother people. It's not fair to label these people 'trolls' because it is quite possible that they are not voicing opinions simply to get a rise out of people. 

&gt;and that remembering the death of someone so many people were fond of is meaningless

That's simply your interpretation of what these threads are. Other people might interpret posts in these threads as taking advantage of another person's death to draw attention to oneself. That's not necessarily my position, but I think its a valid opinion and I don't think that holding it makes you a 'heartless douche' who 'trolls threads'.

"pali","t5_2sef2","Comparing Pali and Sanskrit is really interesting. Pali had just one ""s"" sound, whereas Sanskrit had three. Parallel Sanskrit/Pali versions of the text we are looking at are available on Wikipedia: [Refuge Wording](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refuge_%28Buddhism%29#Refuge_Wording). As you mention it's written शरणं and transcribed **śaraṇaṃ**, here the ś represents that palatal Sanskrit fricative, which is something like English ""sh.""
This sequence shows the opposition between two /s/ sounds in Sanskrit, an opposition which is missing from Pali: संघं शरणं **saṃghaṃ śaraṇaṃ**, but **saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ** in Pali.

Despite the fact that correspondences like this would appear to be predictable in the direction of Sanskrit → Pali, It would appear that the exact relation between Sanskrit and Pali is complex. For one thing, borrowing seems to have gone in both directions. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali_language#Pali_and_Sanskrit) points out that Pali and Sanskrit words were sometimes consciously converted by what amounted to phonological rule in order to :

:The connections were sufficiently well-known that technical terms from Sanskrit were easily converted into Pali by a set of conventional phonological transformations. These transformations mimicked a subset of the phonological developments that had occurred in Proto-Pali. Because of the prevalence of these transformations, it is not always possible to
 tell whether a given Pali word is a part of the old Prakrit lexicon, or a transformed borrowing from Sanskrit. The existence of a Sanskrit word regularly corresponding to a Pal
i word is not always secure evidence of the Pali etymology, since, in some cases, artificial Sanskrit words were created by back-formation from Prakrit words.
It may be the case that Pali is not a descendent from Sanskrit in the same way that modern Indic languages such as Hindi, Nepali, Gujarati, etc, are. Rather, it may be more useful to think of it as having arisen from a continuum of spoken languages (Prakrits) that existed in parallel to the more literary Vedic Sanskrit, and which had a common ancestor in an earlier Indo-Aryan language.  

tl;dr Pali might originally have been more of a sibling of Sanskrit than a child.

"culturalstudies","t5_2qhwb","I love this thread. Im in undergrad research too and Im writing my capstone on the phenomena of internet communities (i.e. Reddit) in the presence of overwhelming production of information. Thanks for posting this.

1. First I think you loose a lot fo the emotion conveyed in interactions. Its easy to misunderstand someone, overreact, and act immaturally. People aren't held responsible for what they say so theres no limit of how rude or dismissive they can be. On the other hand I couldnt say things are always that way.

2. I think this is genuine. People are just fulfilling a diffrent social contract. When you encounter some guy at starbucks and he asks you how your day is going, you say ""fine"" and carry on. While you might feel like shit, your fulfilment in that place is to move on. On the itnernet, being genuine is similar in that the interactions have expected reactions to certain statements. I do think you loose the sense of authenticy to know if someone is really who they are (IAMA), but just as you get in real life, you can only take from what people say and if people lie, you may not know they are a lier. On the otherhand, you may not know someone is lieing in real life, but if you are able to catch the signals, you can tell. Same on the internet. No one is being duped, its just a mater of how much they care.

3. You determine someone based on how much information yo ucan gain about them. You project what you think the person is based on your understanding of their activities. The more time you spend on reddit and the more familiar you are with the community, the more accurate your depiction of a stranger becomes. Based on someones comments, the posts they link, etc. These things help us identify what kind of user. Typical reddit user was defined in a demographic study a while back. Maybe you can find it.

Unless there is a study looking at the difference between the only information we have to work with and the information you are inferring exists (that there is a higher incidence of PMS at any given time than I am claiming) - you need a study. Mine claims low incidence and supports it. You pointed out there's a hole in it. How big is the hole? I am guessing that it is less than 80% of the population (in the study by Chrisler, women averaged their menstrual symptoms in the lowest 10% of severity)

4. All studies have agendas, they're called ""study rationale"" - they're the reason studies get done, so that they can claim that something is true about our society that hasn't been claimed until now.","1301617236"

I don't know how familiar you are with the CLI, but just for an easy example:

If you, hypothetically, were told to use the command ""sudo apt-get install firefox"", what exactly does that mean?  What happens when you run the command?  Google sudo, read about it, read the man page on apt-get or google apt-get to find out more information, and so forth.

That's the way I learned.

I think that's why you feel ""in control"" using Windows 7.  I'm sure you've probably been using Windows most of your life; most of us have.  It's what you're familiar with.  How to install programs, the layout of the operating system, what stuff generally goes in what folder, such as C:/Program\ Files and C:/Windows, etc.  When you try to use something different, such as Linux, Mac, BSD, etc., it's going to be intimidating at first.  You have so much to learn, which limits what you can *do*.

It's not an overnight thing.  You've likely used Windows for years, and thus, that's why you're familiar with it.  Don't give up on something just because it's ""different.""  Keep at it, and the more you learn, the less you'll probably want to use Windows, and the more you'll see how limiting Windows is - that's how it was for me, anyway.

Bad Journalism does. And it should anyone who doesn't like being talked to like they are a child. I don't like hearing right-wingers call Obama a (secret) Muslim, and I don't like articles that are misleading (intentionally or otherwise).

**WARNING: This is long.** (Some things cannot be expressed fairly in a rage comic.)

**(summary at bottom)**

To anyone who doesn't already have a problem with this article:

No one likes hearing ""I'm more intelligent than you, can't you be as smart as me"". So I'm not going to say this. I'm going to assume that you know the truth about what I am going to say here, and just don't care because you think that the injustice done is justified because it is against the ""bad"" guy, and helps the ""right"" team. **While this isn't a stupid position--OR rather, it isn't an opinion that is only held by stupid people--it still isn't right.**

No one likes getting lectured to. But if you don't have a problem with this article, you need it, and I'm going to lecture away to my little heart's content.

There is a link on reddit to this article. [if you haven't read the entire article yet, please do so, it is short enough] It has a net of 282 upvotes (the upvotes don't really translate to actual votes on a one-to-one ratio obviously, but this is one of the better ranked links, in the sense that it's not just ""something that might make it to the Front Page for a minute or two"" but an accurate measurement of the consensus which those at reddit (sometimes without a sense of Irony) call the ""hivemind.""--the article is the second highest post in their sub-community focused on politics right now, and it was posted 8 hours ago, so one can figure it's probably been on the FP for a while) (congratulations to the author)

Almost all of the top comments are pro- the article, and the ones that are against it are only mildly against it and are ambiguous. [sidenote: even a comment about ""raping MH in the ass until he loves it and then withholding sexual gratification until he cries (could be funny to some--but clearly a joke) are above anything pointing out that the article is misleading.]

So here are my thoughts:

&gt; I don't think a serious human being can want Huckabee to be President. The fact that he might have a chance is scary. (The fact that PALIN might have a chance is terrifying)

&gt; That said. This is clearly a freaking joke. This article is misleading and the author should be ashamed of calling for a ""journalism with gumption"" and then setting an example of the kind of gumption he means.

&gt; Not the kind of clear thinking Journalism that is in fact needed, but a bunch of bullying tactics to misuse the words of your political enemies and try to ""push"" them out of the race.

&gt; Boo to this author.

&gt; Where is clear thought and serious journalism? Where is Christopher Hitchens when you need him? He could have torn apart Huckabee without having to resort to BS. There is even the likelihood that instead of intentionally BSing people he doesn't even think in a serious manner himself and actually believes nonsense like what he printed. Whether he believed it to be true or not. He is either intentionally deceiving others is just a bad thinker, either of these can be justified by thinking it is OK because after all it is done against the ""wrong"" team (if you don't agree, just ask yourself if you think the low blows against Obama were legitimate journalism?---if you don't have a problem with this article, I can guess that you probably couldn't stand those, but not because they weakened the thinking of those who were taken in by them (or even those who had the misfortune to hear them) but because they were against the ""right"" side.

&gt; If Obama--with a wink in his eye; a tinge of Irony in his smile; and chuckles from the audience--had said:

&gt; You know, sometimes I think that what this country really needs is to be forced (at gunpoint--wink wink ) (cue corny laughter) to listen to economics lectures from Robert Reich.

&gt; The reading public would understand that it was a joke and also understand that he meant seriously that the country would benefit if more people understood left economics better--and was not serious about enforcing this ""re-education"" through violence. We would also understand that the audience laughing didn't take the violence remark seriously either.

&gt; Anyone sympathetic with the idea that the country would be better off if more people understood Keynesian economics (say) would readily see the cheap trick played by a ""journalist"" who wanted to drum up fear in his readers, and would not stand for it.

&gt; Huckabee is saying that he thinks that the country would be improved if more people understood the ethical and scriptural teachings of a certain pastor, and while we may or may not agree with this (I happen to think that pastors have far too much influence in our politics), it is downright dishonest to say that he means to set up concentration camps where people will be forced to listen to these lectures.

&gt; No serious person can want Huckabee to be President.

&gt; No serious person can be pleased with trash like this article either.

**Like I said earlier, I don't think you need me to lecture to you like this. You are not dumber than the average American (which would be a quite remarkable feat).**

So the question is:
Why do you put up with it? Why do you not mind when the low blows and cheep, lazy, or sloppy thinking is directed against your political enemies?

My guess is that you don't take dishonesty or sloppy thinking (whichever it may be in this case) to be too serious a problem in journalism. You might think to yourself:

I know perhaps that he (The Huck) didn't really mean it, but maybe he did, and anyway I don't like him. He's not on my team, I want other people not to like him either, so no problem.

2 problems:

* First, you are probably unhappy about the unintellectual nature of the average American voter, and this kind of bad writing is at the same time a symptom and an effect of this condition.

* Second, There will certainly be more articles about Huckabee until he drops out of the race, or someone else wins it. When another unfair comment about him comes up, in the back of your mind you are liable to forget the injustice you capitulated in by sharing or just reading without criticism this non-sense (which was written to you as if you were a stupid child who couldn't see through the trick), and not mind so much if this new bit of info is even more defaming because after all ""its about that guy who wants to set up military re-education camps"".

I am disappointed that anyone would read this and not be upset.

To fix these two problems you simply have to:
1) want to be taken seriously and not talked to like you have never been to a political meeting and you don't have the ability to understand a joke.
2) MEAN IT when you say that you want to see the intellectual level of the public conversation raised and not promote crap like this.

The only way we are going to get better journalism (aside from writing it) is by DEMANDING it. and not putting up with FOX News garbage or stuff of the same quality when it is directed against the people we do not like.

If you don't think I'm being fair: the title of the article is ""Mike Huckabee says he wishes all Americans were indoctrinated at gunpoint.""

Someone might argue that jokes are no laughing matter when ""violence is involved."" Someone even pointed out this:

""It sounds to me like Huckabee was doing something a little different. It sounds like he was expressing (and perhaps exaggerating) a buried desire in order to connect with the crowd, then making light of it. People sometimes call this a ""joke,"" but it's not.""

here is what I have to say:

If the article had said what that person just said, I wouldn't have a problem with it.

I think this person is being completely fair and honest in her/his attack on Huckabee. The author of this article wasn't. Just look at the title, and read the article in vain in search of anything as nuanced or serious as the analysis in the comment above to see what I mean.

********summary:********

Crappy (or dishonest) writing shouldn't be supported by any serious person even if it supports the ""right"" side.

Intelligent people make this mistake all the time, and this error is one of the things that separates good and lasting journalism from stuff that is acknowledged by all to be embarrassing before the next election cycle.

The only way we are going to get the better journalism we all complain of wanting is if 
1) we write it AND 
2) if we demand it

Does that not require an opinion, or a point of view, or at least a presupposition (or two) of your own?

Most people that reach those levels don't go out saying ""I'm an arahant!"" because people would think they're lying. You can tell by how a person talks and acts if they've reached enlightenment. Arahants don't have egos, otherwise they wouldn't have reached enlightenment, they're also very quiet, and everything they say is perfectly thought out, if you're in the presence of one, you would know.

Finding an arhant is rare, there are definitely many stream-winners, it's not that hard to become a stream-winner. Stream winner means ""a person who has eradicated the first three fetters (sanyojanas) of the mind. Sotapanna literally means ""one who entered (āpanna) the stream (sota)"", after a simile that compares attaining nirvana with crossing a stream and reaching the farthest shore. Sotapannaship is the first of the four stages of enlightenment.""

US federal judges aren't elected, they are appointed by the executive branch.  The method to select state judges varies from state to state.  Some are elected, some are appointed.  Some are appointed but subject to recall by voters.

Most criminal court cases are state or local, as are prisons.  In my state the prisons are run by the state, and they're still horrible places.  A few years back at one of them the guards were setting up gladiatorial contests they could bet on, as well as pairing people who would be predisposed to attack each other (for example from opposing racist gangs), again for betting or even just entertainment.

It mostly boils down to the fact that the public just doesn't bother with what happens to prisoners as long as it's not too egregious.  Intellectually voters accept the case that prisons ought not be hellholes, but they done actually *care* enough to do anything about it.

&gt;It really only leaves provision of security and general management, which wouldn't make much. 

I think you're grossly underestimating the cost here.  Keeping people in prison is very expensive, and it's not because you have to feed them.

&gt;All the companies that provide prison services in Britain, four of them, make far more from their other security services, most of which is private sector.

How much they make from other services is irrelevant.  When you're looking at opportunities for corruption what matters is how much they make per inmate.","1301617301"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","But some of them are biological -- it makes sense that women *want* to care for their kids more than men. It's in their biology to nurture them in a way that isn't necessarily the same as men, but it's not a bad thing. I don't find that a sexist thing. I find it more sexist to try to pretend that these differences aren't there, or are irrelevant. We'd do better to play to the strengths of each, as long as people understand that. 

Here's an interesting video I watched a while ago.. it's pretty interesting and plays toward differences in men and women, without being sexist about it.

2. (unavoidable) process variation

#1 gives you current-driven thermal runaway. III-V semiconductors are more prone to this issue.  As temperature goes up, resistance drops (conductivity increases), which increases current, which increases heat generated, which increases temperature, which ....

This is why LEDs require *at least* resistors - it's just current limiting to break the above thermal runaway cycle.

#2 means that putting LEDs in parallel or series even with a single current limiting resistor can still have thermal runaway on the whole set.   One device, due to manufacturing process variation, has a bit higher conduction than the rest so it ""hogs"" a bit more current.  That device goes into runaway and burns out.  

Then the resistor current limiting (for the same current) is distributed on N-1 LEDs so each now *each of the rest* has higher current than before so the next process outlier device will go into thermal runaway.  And so on until all burn out.

This is part of why analog IC companies like National Semi have ""LED driver"" ICs.  They have more sophisticated current regulation that prevent this cycle.","1301617313"

Terrans have been winning pretty much nothing of late. GSL top 4 had no Terrans, GSL May Qualifiers had very few Terrans make it through especially considering Terran is the most played race (and the ones that made it through were pretty obvious candidates who should have been in code A already), the arguably three best Terran players in the world (MKP, MVP, Jinro) are all doing poorly recently, etc etc. If that doesn't convince you, go mass Marines against half decent players on ladder and let us know how it works out for you--there's a reason Terran pretty much stops building Marines in late game TvP (even though the OP of that thread would have us believe they counter Colossi), and Terran has not been facerolling Zerg (in fact, the general consensus seems to be that the matchup is the most balanced non-mirror right now and there are people on both sides of the fence on who it favours--for example, IdrA obviously says Zerg has the hard time, while MorroW claims that he finds Terran weak on the new maps).

You're right that tournaments aren't perfect and if Terran was winning some but not all it wouldn't prove they weren't overpowered, but considering Terran has been performing extremely poorly lately (even though it has some amazing players) and the strategies suggested in the thread you linked don't actually work in a real game I think it's safe to say that Terran is anything but overpowered right now.","1301617341"

1 cup small pieces white bread (torn from day-old rustic bread, crust removed)

2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1/2 English cucumber peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces, plus 8 very thin rounds for garnish

Directions

Stir together bread, garlic, vinegar, and 3/4 cup cold water in a medium bowl. Set aside.

Process cucumber, roasted peppers, and bread mixture in a blender until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl. Puree half of the tomatoes in the blender, and transfer to the bowl with cucumber mixture.

I think being brought up in a poor environment makes you more likely to have drugs take control of your life. Where the rich can afford to get off it or have enough money they don't get desperate. What if people that believe in the drug war believe the poor need more help and they need there drug problems fought harder.

I can't think of a good reason for using __call for a single function or variable, because if you know what names or functions your looking for you'll just make them actual functions and variables.

So given the above, I'd say an exception is more appropriate because it represents an action (dynamically accessing fake functions or variables) that work dynamically and may work or fail based on other conditions. A fatal error should be reserved for things that should never be.","1301617415"

"biology","t5_2qhn7","1. I don't think any PI will expect you to be involved with projects in two months. Instead, I'd draw attention to your experience with a variety of lab techniques and indicate that one of the reasons you're applying to this lab is to get more involved in projects beyond just following protocols at a bench. That said, you should still be able to explain to a fellow scientist what your lab was working on.


2. Have a solid answer for when they ask you what your goals for this job are.


3. You should know how their research fits into your goals, rather than just wanting to do science in whatever lab takes you (make shit up if necessary).

4. Ask what kind of time commitment they're looking for, who you'll be working under, suggestions for papers to familiarize yourself with the project. Mainly, it's just important that you don't answer ""nope"" when they ask you if you have any questions about the job.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I am going to try and respond to each sentence with a question mark :P

I don't think that how we interpret the bible has anything to do with spreading the word around the world. It might affect exactly what this word is, or how we present it, but that's it

I don't see any issue with there not being religion. God didn't ask us to band together under various interpretations, he asked us to love and to believe

I don't think the supernatural parts are taken out of the bible. I think we are advancing enough to understand them in a new way and nothing more. As I said before, I also don't think it's necessarily bad for ""religion"" to fade out. It's only bad if God does. Actually really sad :( God is love is beauty is amazing

If you take away the bible you are left with a lot of wonderful things like quantum physics, philosophy, science, and more that all point to God. God is not a book, and I hate that people try to make him that. The bible isn't even the only texts on God and it is insulting to try and limit him to a book written by man

I think that Christianity can be modernism. I think that fundamentalism is sometimes not true Christianity. I think that atheism can be without mondernism. We are talking God here, existence in all it's totality, this is waaay bigger than if you read a book the right way","1301617426"

My suggestion while you wait for the exam is to use lube (even though I know you said it doesn't work) and a lot of foreplay.  Try using various sized dildos and work up to the size of your partner.  If that doesn't work, hold off on doing actual intercourse until your gyno appointment.

Read up a little and shop around for a while and you should be fine.  I would suggest looking for a Remington 870 Wingmaster with screw in chokes.  Right in you price range and a great addition to any gun collection.  If you end up liking something different you can pass it down to your kids or sell it for very little or no loss.  The 870 Express is a different gun.  I personally don't care for them. 

Walmart also sells a Beretta 3901 that's a little out of your price range ($630 or so after taxes) but I hear a lot about it.  Supposedly one of the better semi-auto guns for the money.

Walmart or your local sporting good store will also usually carry cheap Remington, Federal, or Winchester target loads.  These are about $22 per 100 rounds.  They're everything you need for skeet and target shooting.","1301617463"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Napster. I accidentally downloaded a mislabeled song which ended up being: Chicane - From Blue to Green. I ended up buying the album, if you believe that, and would listen to it in private since absolutely nobody I knew listened to any sort of techno or trance at that time. Fast forward to high school, my taste for hip hop kinda started leaning towards instrumentals like DJ Shadow and RJD2, and eventually towards artists like Jel, Alias, Dabrye, etc... my taste in hip hop also turned me onto a lot of jazz, and by extension the mushroom jazz albums and acid jazz. Now I am a diehard downtempo/acid jazz listener. Still nobody else I know listens to it, they all are into Deadmau5, Daft Punk, different house artists... which is all ok... I just don't like it enough to listen to it on my own. In my opinion, Are You A Killer by Huggotron is better than any Deadmau5 song I've heard. So while everyone is waiting for the new steve aoki mix or whatever they're into... im sitting here silently hoping for the return of Puff Dragon.

2) residual heat reactions that are evidently going on, and given that the ratio of radioactive iodine to caesium [is remaining constant](http://www.theoildrum.com/node/7722/786404), suggests the heat reactions (fission) are not dying away and to quote Mr Katsumata of TEPCO from earlier today, ""[Honestly speaking](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-to-scrap-four-of-the-six-stricken-nuclear-reactors-at-fukushima-plant-2257834.html), work to effectively stabilise the temperature of the reactors has yet to begin"".

3) Further cooling is still continuing two weeks later and will continue for at least several months and until they have some better way to control the radiation - what else do you think they are going to do -

4) entomb the reactor? That the Japanese goverment has just taken control of TEPCO and are considering this possibility suggests to me they are close to running out of options.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Complexity isn't necessarily endemic to fun. Nor is simplicity, but simplicity adds a layer of accessibility. Well designed games express complex gameplay and story with really simple concepts. Shadow of the Colossus comes to mind. 

Modern designers focus on simplicity, plain and simple. Minecraft is a really simple game that has complexity born from that simplicity. Punch an element, it breaks, you have one block of that element. Throw that element in a certain place on that grid with other elements, to create an object. It's simple, but it scales to be complex. But you can still enjoy the game to a full capacity on its most simple scale:  exploration and mining.

The reason that tutorials were focused on recently is because games that have complex characteristics built in, often have shitty ways of teaching players to use the complex concepts. Teaching a player how to use something complex is one of the most challenging things a designer has to do. If Portal had taught you momentum preservation on the first level, rather than had it slowly build as the game progressed, you would have had a lot of frustrated players stop playing the game. Instead, each complex element of portal was introduced one element at a time, in simple, repeatable situations that became obvious when introduced in the later levels. Portal was simply the greatest tutorial ever made, all gearing you up for the last chamber.

And why was it great? Because Valve's designers tackled the tough design challenges by teaching the players slowly.","1301617502"

I looked hard at the graphics card and have never owned an ATI card but the 6950 seems to scale better at higher resolutions (plus 2Gb of memory will be useful should I go full retard and try 3x1920x1080) and I got one at a reasonable price.

So instead of needing to separate U238 and U235 (~1.28% difference in mass), you must separate U232 and U233 (~0.43% difference in mass). The isotopes are separated by mass, a process that is very energy-intensive and requires large facilities. 

With 232/233 the mass difference is ~1/3 that of 235/238! If the separation process is linear, you need 3 times more processing. If it's exponential (which seems more likely to me) then it takes *nine* times more processing.","1301617514"

* it is a reference to an older neighborhood in New York with the same name and similar characteristics.

* a reference to the neighborhood as the ""soft underbelly"" (analogous to the cut of meat) of the city, with allusions to vice and corruption, especially graft.

* the neighborhood earned its name from the words of a New York City police captain, Alexander S. Williams, who was overheard saying that when he was assigned to another part of the city, he could only afford to eat chuck steak on the salary he was earning, but after he was transferred to this neighborhood he was making so much money on the side soliciting bribes that now he could eat tenderloin instead.

* officers who worked in the Tenderloin received a ""hazard pay"" bonus for working in such a violent area, and thus were able to afford the good cut of meat.

* the name is a reference to the sexual parts of prostitutes (i.e., ""loins"").

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Lets  me make this very clear. A union can only exist without force if the people who run the business or company agree to allow the union to organize. Private sector unions are established through contracts and terms mutually agreed to by the owners of the company and the union organization that is established. 

So in the example of a public union, force is necessarily required from the very start due to the very nature of government. They have a monopoly of force on the taxpayers, they cannot simply opt out of paying taxes. You cannot simply say that ""oh well they can move if they don't like it"" Because if you do take that line of argument, you then have to be prepared to support centralized national government because ""if you don't like it, simply move to another country"" 

Nobody has the right to collectively bargain with taxpayer money because taxes by their very nature require the use of force. What don't you understand about that? 

I have no problem with collective bargaining if the money being collectively bargained with comes from the voluntary exchange of money or in the case of a private company, I CHOOSE to buy a product or service. Taxpayers have no choice because governments have the monopoly of force. The public workers who collectively bargain are bargaining with the money of people who were forced by gunpoint to pay. Do you have a right to bargain for a car that was he bought from someone who stole it from me? Of course not! 

&gt;Going back to my example in the above scenario, would you also claim that these people are choosing their own religion or lack thereof, with your money?!

LOL.. by choosing their religion are they forcing me to fund their church? By collectively bargaining, does this require someone to take my  money by force to pay for their wages and benefits of another?

To be more precise, if you have the right to choose your religion, does the belief and practice of your religion require someone to take money from someone by force to pay for your religion?

Is free association a right? Yes.. can someone use force against you to deny you the ability to freely associate? Of course not. But does that mean I can freely associate with someone with the support of a group that uses force to provide me with the things which I bargain for? Of course not. 

If you take your position to its logical conclusion, you hold a position of the advocating the use of force against others. I have a right to my property, does that mean I have a right to negotiate with someone who is going to take property from someone else? Nope

I have a right to my life, does that mean that I have the right to collectively bargain with someone who has the ability to take the life of someone else? NOPE

A right that requires the use of force against others is no right at all. Choosing your religion is a right, nobody can stop you from being a Catholic but that does not give  you the right to collectively bargain with a group that funds your religion by forcing others to pay for it? NO! 

Until you get that through your head, we will continue to argue in circles.

For lifting in them, they work well for pretty much anything.  They're not mind blowingly different from a flat shoe like Chucks, but it's a bit different.  Deadlifts and squats are great, though you've got to have good ankle mobility for squats, since there's zero angle in the ankle like there are with lifting shoes.

I live in a row home at the bottom of a hill, so every two houses, there is a wall that separates the yards, which are at different heights. We borrowed a hand mower from our neighbor two doors up, and after I went to put it back I went to jump from their wall onto my neighbor's yard because it was faster than walking around. My flip flop got caught on the lip of the wall, and down I went, landing a few inches away from a rosebush; a little to the left and I would have been picking thorns out of my wound.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Some stereotypes are accurate though.  And some are just hatred of the out-group.  I think there is some hard science behind the idea that conservatives really do believe the absurd things they are said to believe.  It's been studied by social sciences.

TheCrimsonKing was stereotyping.  Slightly different phrasing doesn't excuse him from that fact.  However, I do believe his view of conservatives is accurate and I agree with it.

What's unfair about stereotypes is when you use your knowledge about the group to make decisions about individuals.  That gives the individuals short shrift.

But using your knowledge about the group to make decisions about the group is not wrong.

So I'll give you an example.  Conservatives as a group are assholes with many psychological problems.  As a group, I oppose them.  But at an individual level people are all different.  Some people who claim to be conservative can be really decent and not fall in with the broader norms of the group they voluntarily associate with.  So I am fine with having some conservatives as my friends as long as they're not total jackasses who confirm every stereotype.  This way I have my stereotype of conservatives and I use it in valid ways without hurting individuals.  The valid ways to use the stereotype is to confront the foundational and doctrinal beliefs that the group espouses quite openly and voluntarily which directly and logically give rise to all the stereotypes about them.","1301617582"

Blir lite trött på den retoriken. Man kan vara en skarp politiker oavsett ursprung, och jag anar den klassiska starke-man-småstadsnojan eftersom Juholt är från Oskarshamn: ""Kan nån från nån håla lösa Sveriges problem?"" Varför inte?


&gt; Om S får ett bra valresultat kan de fortsätta köra landet till fördärvet

Konkret exempel på politik som ""kört landet i fördärvet""? Givetvis har S fört bättre och sämre politik, men låt oss hålla diskussionen sansad.



&gt; Låt han vara fet

Fet? Låter lite som MUF:s obegåvade ""tjockis""-kampanj kring Persson för några år sedan: Det ska, återigen, kommas ihåg den dag M får en kraftigare ledare. Juholt verkar för övrigt relativt trind.


&gt; bufflig

Bufflig? Måhända, men jag uppfattar honom snarare som repliksnabb och som någon som tar för sig eftersom han har erfarenhet och pondus. Om hans karaktär beror på patriarkala gubbtendenser i partiet (antagligen) så är det förstås träligt, men det gör honom inte till en sämre politiker.

&gt; och sträva bakåt

""Bakåt och framåt"" har jag aldrig riktigt förstått mig på inom politiken, särskilt efter ""Alliansens"" Rewind-kampanj... Vänster och Höger, okej, men vad menas med Framåt och Bakåt? Måttstocken ska ju vara om en förd politik kan vara fruktsam för samhället - dess ålder och tidigare applikation är ju bara ett gnabb i jämförelse. Att till exempel frånta kvinnor rösträtt skulle inte i första hand vara fel eftersom det är ""bakåtsträvande"" per se, utan helt enkelt för att det är oacceptabelt i den samhälleliga kontext vi lever i. Skulle man skrota politiska idéer bara på den grund att de har några år på nacken skulle ju all politik bli helt oförbar. Det är ju inte som att Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman etc är direkt purfärska.

Edit: There isn't a statistically significant relationship between murder and religion, no matter how you slice it. You reported a regression w/ murder rates, religion &amp; HDI, so you would only be comparing the variation of murder WRT religion and HDI held constant, but even if you don't control for HDI you still don't get a relationship.","1301617601"

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","Ill be honest, I find people like you fascinating.  I like to study people like you and the world around them that led them to be the way they are.  There are certain things in this world that have some kind of artificial value placed on them..  for example:  what kind of beer/alcohol you prefer, what kind of sushi you eat, clothes you wear, music you listen to, and even transmission choice.  There are obvious social ""Bests"" for these things that seem like they should be 100% opinion.  I find some people are very concerned with their image, and they always associate themselves with what is generally considered the most correct opinion.  ""this type of beer is good, that type is crap."" for example.  

These people seek out and align themselves with what they consider to be socially respectable choices.  But its not enough for most of them to simply be seen making these choices, they feel the need to point it out by looking down on others who don't share the same ""correct opinions"". They have to tell the world that the choices they made are aligned with the socially respectable standards, and the choices other people made are not.  I'm extremely curious what the root cause for this mentality is, the obvious answer of course is insecurity, but i continue to wonder if its more complex than that.","1301617623"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I see you are as ignorant of socialism and Marx as you are of capitalism. 

*from each as per his ability, to each as per his need.*

This means that all your income/output/labor/whatever you want to call is taken from you and distributed to individuals as needed. THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN IN SCANDINAVIA. Taxes are not from *each as per his ability, to each as per his need.* If what you said was true than every country in the world, including the USA, would be socialist. 

Anyway lets take a look at Scandinavian countries and economic theories. The central belief of socialism is, **a theory or system of social organization  that advocates the vesting of the ownership and control of the means of production and distribution, of capital, land, etc., in the community as a whole.** Scandinavian countries do not have this. 

So socialism in Scandinavian countries: X

The central belief of capitalism is, **: an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market** Scandinavian countries DO have this. 


Capitalism in Scandinavian countries: ✓

They cannot mutually coexist. If you have one you do not have the other. Therefore Scandinavia is not socialist. 

*If you have any other way of establishing welfare in a capitalist society I'd like to hear your thoughts.* 

I have a good way. Have a capitalist economic system and than tax people on their income/profit. With the revenue collected from taxes you can fund welfare programs. Wouldn't that be a great system. WAIT A MINUTE! That is what Scandinavia already does. Like I said earlier welfare and taxes **ARE NOT** mutually exclusive to socialism.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","To be quite honest, it doesn't really matter all that much. C#/C++/Java are all quite similar in what they do. I'm about to graduate with my bachelor's in CS and I still have to look up weird syntax quirks between them. It's much more important to know the theories behind the languages than the actual languages. The best thing you can do to be ""professional"" is be well versed. I usually see it recommended that one is familiar with object oriented-language (C++/C#/Java), scripting language (bash, python, perl etc.) and web ""languages"" (php, javascript, database things).

My advice would be to get a linux distro ([Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) is quite easy to install), learn pure C, then once you're comfortable with that move up into C++. Once you know C++, it is really simple to transition sideways into C# or Java

"Music","t5_2qh1u","One of my favorite bands is The Fiery Furnaces. Last time I saw them they said, ""Yeah, we could leave and come back. But let's just play three more songs. And a-one, two, three, four!"" And that was the final set. Pretty cool.

I have seen a few genuinely awesome encores.

The Polyphonic Spree announced that ""This is our last song. But it goes on and on."" I look at my watch and it's been about 45 minutes of performance, and I was thinking WTF?

They left the stage, and after a while, I notice people coming through the crowd. It was the Polyphonic Spree, now wearing their crazy robes, and they played another hour! Total psyche out. I loved it.

Also, there are some venues in my town with an 11:30 curfew. They try to get people out well ahead of that time.

When I saw Jane's Addiction, they left the stage, and the auditorium lights went up half way, like maybe the show is over. It was about 11PM, and some people started to leave.

But most of the crowd stayed, and started clapping and stomping their feet. So, the venue brought lights all the way up, like, ""OK, time to go home."" The crowd wasn't leaving.

We were stomping and clapping, and freaking out for Jane's Addiction. About half of the crowd was gone when the lights started to go back down. Suddenly the band came back onstage. 

Stephen Perkins was wearing only a white bath robe. They tore through ""Been Caught Stealing"" to the delight of the crowd, and at one point, Perkins jumped up from his drum set totally naked! Then they thanked the crowd and left. Good show.","1301617678"

"biology","t5_2qhn7","First off, don't be afraid to say ""I don't know"". If you try to bullshit, they will figure that out and it will look worse than saying you don't know. 

1. Be honest about the experience. If you tell them it was only 2 months they don't expect you to be an expert on the field. Instead just highlight how during that time you were able to build skills necessary to work full time in a lab(time management, communication, attention to detail, etc). However, I do hope you understood why you were running those gels, blots and ELISAs. You don't need to be an expert on the rest of the project, just know why you were doing what you did. They will likely ask questions about your previous projects so make sure you can convey that you understood why you did A,B, and C. But a good thing to stress is that you have picked up a basic set of skills that can be used as a foundation to build on. You probably know how to use a pipette, make solutions, follow protocols, etc which means they wont have to teach you basic lab skills.

2. This is a good start. Just remember to relax, they don't expect you to know everything so convey to them you are a quick learner and will start contributing data ASAP.

3. Make sure you sound interested in the research(you should be genuinely interested anyways) but if they ask you why you applied don't simply say ""It looks interesting"" but go into a bit of detail about how the project interests you and you want to know more about it.

4. Ask them what the work environment in the lab is. Is everyone friendly? Do they help each other out? Ask them about the project you'll be given and the responsibilities required of you. 

5. I wore sneakers with khakis and a button down shirt to my grad school interviews. I don't think they ever saw them or cared. ","1301617684"

My favourite objects are... you guessed it... my computers! I have one named Clark, one named Eve, one named Lobo, and one named Curly-wurly. Curly-wurly is a tiny pink netbook who is past his/her prime (I was never sure on the gender) but I keep him/her around anyway. Clark  is very stern and masculine (probably because he is huge and has giant water-cooling), while Eve is loving and a little spacey, but still very intelligent. Lobo reminds me of a bratty teenager whose voice is in the process of cracking. 

I also really love my mp3 player, Mariella, who is sort of like Eve. My bed's name is James (not sure why) and is very relaxed. My flats/shoes can be snippy but they don't have names. The glasses holder I referred to in some of my posts is called George but I don't feel like he's too fond of me.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Yes, I guess there isn't really a problem with evolutionary psychology in theory, it's just that most people seem to use it in a nonscientific way to say that their pet theory is ""human nature."" 

Using ""behavior X"" as an example, someone will say there are genes that cause behavior X. What they mean by this is that there is a specific DNA lineup (a gene), which creates certain proteins through a process which we don't fully understand. The creation of these proteins makes a certain development pattern more likely through a process which we don't fully understand. That development pattern makes it more likely that the body creates certain physical structures through a process that we don't understand. And those physical structures make a given organism more likely to exhibit behavior X. Again, through a process which we don't fully understand.

It's a lot of speculation, and it's often used to allege some kind of Ultimate Truth along the lines of ""Cultural Norm A is actually biologically determined by the Behavior X Gene, therefore, Cultural Norm A is proper and right, and even if it wasn't, we can't do anything about it, so we might as well accept Cultural Norm A as something that's here to stay!""

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","(wow, this is longer than I thought it would be. Kudos if you actually read it.)

First, I'd get rid of everything in EP1 that happened at Naboo. Instead Obi-Wan and Qui-gon are sent to Tatooine to try to help an in-progress slave uprising end peacefully, and fail miserably. The hutts slaughter the slaves with the help of Darth Maul and Anakin sees his mom brutally murdered by Maul. The Jedi find Anakin as he's trying to unleash some primal dark-side whoop-ass on Maul (and failing) and chase off Maul. In the end the council decides to let Qui-Gon train Anakin because of his high force affinity and the fact that Qui-Gon is a major badass himself (why let a noob Jedi Knight train him at first?).

In Ep2 we send out Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Anakin out to some random planet that doesn't have any Gungans to settle a trade dispute. Turns out the whole thing is a Sith trap and Darth Maul murders the hell out of Qui-Gon (killing both Anakin's Mother and Father figure) and gets away. The whole war thing turns out poorly too as the Trade Federation uses its clone army to form the CIS and Palpatine steps up to rally the republic to war.

Ep 3. Anakin, crushed by the loss of Qui-Gon seeks solace in some sweet sweet forbidden princess booty, but then gets whisked away to war again. Maul kidnaps palplatine, and Obi-wan and Anakin are sent to get him back. They get separated and Anakin ends up fighting Darth Maul alone and gives in to the dark side at which point Sidious pops out and makes him Darth Vader. Obi-wan senses all this through the force or some shit and tries to kill Vader, but fails and flys back to Coruscant to warn the council. When he gets back the Princess finds him and tells him about the baby-mama situation at which point he whisks the kids away to hiding. Vader and Sidious get back to Coruscant and start with the Jedi eradication (with a quick detour for Vader to choke a bitch for squealing to Obi-Wan) and there's a big-ass Jedi fight with Sidious and Vader murdering the hell out of the Jedi, with only Yoda escaping. Ghost Qui-gon pops up and talks to Yoda on Dagobah and Obi-wan on Tatooine (at the same time because that's how force ghosts roll) and says don't worry I gots a plan to handle this shit, just raise these kids in secret and everything will be cool.

This is because, (and this is where a majority of people make massive failings) risk is not borne equally even in first world nations by all people.  The average white, straight, middle-to-upper class redditor in any 1st world country faces a 1 in 170 lifetime risk (meaning 1 out of every 170 whites will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime).  It falls to 1 in 57 for Hispanics and 1 in 22 for Blacks.

So, you see, it is not foolish to 'translate the experience' because in point of fact, you and many other people seem to forget that things like poverty, ethnicity, gender and other factors attenuate the 'low' risk of first world nations, and instead assume that everyone is just equally unlikely to contract the disease.

Not only this but access to circumcision itself is much easier in the United States (I don't know about Canada, with social medicine) in infancy.

"ihaveissues","t5_2s90u","No berating for the lost looking for the way out.

The pattern here is not leaving good ones for bad. You attach too quickly when single, and aren't sustained very long after the honeymoon period is over. You start attaching to others soon after. You are hooked on the butterflies and great feelings of the honeymoon period, and start opening up to others, looking for the same feelings again, when the honeymoon fades. 

This isn't good, OP. You won't be able to establish anything for long with anyone, regardless of how good they objectively are. What you are feeling isn't what most of us feel. It's too intense, and it's too absolute. You can't distinguish. We think our feelings tell us what to do (not always the case), but in your case, they're misleading you.

I can't tell the cause. There's no evidence of insecurity, sometimes the cause. But if your mental problems involve any bipolar or BPD diagnosis, this is a good place to start. You should consider discussing the pattern with your doctor, and see whether it is related to your ""mental problems"". If it is, discuss whether there are other meds that might help even your reactions out. 

Take this the way it's meant, as a possibility to explore. Don't be drawing conclusions just because some disembodied voice on the internet told you so.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have about 30 scars. The most interesting ones are the scar on my upper lip, the scar on my finger, and the scar on my penis. I'll start with the scar on my upper lip.
 

My friend and I were walking through the forest preserve, on our way back to his house. We had been lighting off the sparkler bombs we were testing and had a fire extinguisher with us (these details don't even matter). It had been snowing and we were walking on the frozen creek. I got this great idea in my head to pick up a fairly big stick, and swing it at a tree. It broke off, whipped around the tree, came back and hit me in the face. I was knocked out before I hit the ground, and I had a hole through my upper lip and into my gums. Pretty sweet. He and I made up a story of how we got attacked by wolverines and fought them off. So it seemed more manly and less like I was a fucking idiot.


The second story is the scar on my middle finger. It's not much of a scar anymore as a deformation. During baseball practice we were doing pickle drills, hot box, whatever you want to call it, and I tripped up. I put my hand out and it got stomped on by some metal spikes. It was pretty awesome. Did you know that bone is actually REALLY REALLY white? I went to ""hospital"" (a little physician office that probably shouldn't have handled something like this) and they burned a hole through my fingernail to hold the skin together. It looks weird now.

My final story is how I got a scar on my penis. It's just below the head and on the left side of the shaft. I was hooking up with this girl at the time who had just gotten snakebites, and instead of a round ball or whatever to cap it off it was a spike. She started going down on me and a couple of motions into it **BAM** blood gushing out of my dick.

**TL;DR: I'm a complete idiot, my finger's deformed, and my dick has a battle wound.**","1301617737"
"pics","t5_2qh0u","Beer pong? It's a pretty slow-moving game. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing in the grand scheme of things, but if you get four players who are really novice, it's going to take half an hour to play the game. Plus it seems two beers a team is the generally agreed upon amount, which is one beer per person per half-hour... pretty standard pace if you weren't playing a game.

All I'm saying is a long table like that could be better reserved for large-team drinking games, such as flip cup: a sense of comradery between so many people is a much greater feeling than all eyes on you waiting to finish up your game because someone threw the last ping-pong ball somewhere deep in the bushes and is using a camera's flash to help look for it.","1301617737"

"keto","t5_2rske","Firstly, go talk to your doctor.

Even if you're not eating sugars and carbs, your body *should* be able to regulate its own sugar levels by breaking down protein and fat in your diet. That's what everyone who is currently on keto is relying on to maintain blood sugar. However during the induction part of ketosis, or the transition phase, a lot of people experience mild hypoglycemia effects, but your body's job is to keep it alive and it will soon figure out how to bring your blood sugar back up... given that you don't have a medical condition that prevents this.

Eventually your body gives in and starts to burn and use fat as energy, and your liver will produce glucose via protein break down and glycerol (part of the fat molecule). This should lift you out of a hypoglycemia state.

If you have blood sugar issues, I'm going to assume it's diabetes type 2 related, or pre or insulin resistance. Which are all different severities of the same thing. Either way, hypoglycemia likely happens in your body when your insulin has told your cells to burn up all the sugar in your blood, but your body cells are starving. It's possible that this is what caused your seizure. 

I am not a doctor, but if you decided to go ahead with this, you should experiment. Lower your carb intake, and you MUST increase your fat intake. I don't care what everyone says about fat, you HAVE to increase fats if you lower your carbs. You can gradually ease yourself into it and see what happens. However, continuing to consume carbs can work against you here and simply cause a slower sugar withdrawl process.

The other route is to just to dive right in, be prepared to sleep and be prepared to hypoglycemia symptoms. *Don't do it alone and make sure you've told your doctor that you're doing this.* Make sure you eat a lot of fats and proteins and green veggies and *drink* water. Lots and lots of water. Make sure someone is around you incase your pass out or something. 

There is no way to prevent the shitty feeling of carb withdrawls. The intensity varies from person to person, I personally just slept most of the time. Other people say they barely noticed.","1301617750"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","UGH. I really need to read more so I don't keep quoting the same guy.

But this is the best answer for biblical literalism I've found (below).

So, Norwegian friend, here is an American speaking who is not as ""moderate"" as many Christians on reddit. I'm pretty conservative.

I'm not a young-earth creationist but I'm either a progressive creationist or believe that God somehow guided natural-selection but was actively involved. I don't think it happened all on its own.

Here's a Pastor, also with more conservative views, and his take on biblical ""literalism"". So, here is it: No one is REALLY a biblical literalist. But the bible is authoritative.

Tim Keller:

&gt; I don’t know of anybody who’s really a biblical literalist because everybody says, you know, in the Book of Luke Chapter 1 says, “This is [an] account.  I put together from eye witnesses of life of Jesus.”  So, that’s a historical prose narrative and you read it as a historical prose narrative.  When you get to Psalms, it’s got, it’s strophic in nature, it’s got parallelisms, so we know it’s poetry and so you read it as poetry, you don’t take it literally.  And when David says, “The stars came and fought against the Assyrians.”  You know, we know that that’s poetry.  Then there are some places like Genesis 1, Chapter 1, like the Book of Ecclesiastes, there’s a couple of places in the Bible whether genre is not easy to discern and where people are going to be arguing about whether you take that literally or not.  Obviously, Genesis 1 has a big impact on how you understand evolution and so forth.  So, I would consider myself a person who believes in the full authority of the Bible, and yet even if you believe that, there’s room for debate about what parts of the Bible you take literally or not.  Yet when somebody says, “Are you a bible literalist?”  They probably will still think I am a biblical literalist because I think Jesus actually rose from the dead.  And if some people say, “Well, that’s makes you a literalist.”  Then, I don’t think that’s what the word “literal” means but I’ll go with it.  For example, though, Genesis 2 and 3 I think are written you might say as historical prose narrative whereas Genesis 1 is not.  So, you know, I would actually, if personally, I would say I don’t take Genesis 1 literally.  I actually do take the talking snake literally.  That’s why I… and there’s people around me who have the same view of the Bible who would draw the line on the other side of the snake and there’s other people who would draw it all the way at the beginning and say, “No, you have to take Genesis 1 literally.”  So, and these are all, this is all within the fraternity and the sorority, you might say, of people who believe that you have to take the Bible as the full authoritative word of God.  So I do think [Bill Maher] is missing the spectrum.  It’s a little bit like if you say to a person of a particular race, “All you people look alike.”  That’s awfully insulting, and for [Bill Maher] to look at, say, Evangelical Christians and say, “All you people are literalists,” is just as insulting.
&gt;
&gt;Question: What is your approach to literal interpretations?
&gt;
&gt;Keller:    The essence of the model is in the book “The Prodigal God” because the prodigal god is about the famous story in Luke 15 where Jesus tells that is usually called the Parable the Prodigal Son.  If you read it fully, it’s actually about two sons.  One is the younger brother who goes off and squanders his money on prostitutes, and the other is the elder brother who stays home and obeys the father.  And what I’d look at that as is the younger brother symbolizing, you might say, the secular person who says I can live anywhere I want.  The elder brother is symbolizing the religious person who’s very moralistic and self righteous.  And both being alienated from the father and as Jesus way of saying these are both wrong.  So, that is a great way to explain in one simple, with one simple narrative how our model differs.  I think most people tend to say, well, there is you can go off and live your way or else you can live God’s way, and that’s the two approaches.  And a lot of secular people say, fine.  I’ve seen that the God’s way thing.  It’s full of moralism, self righteousness and oppression, I’m going to go and make up my own mind as to how to live.   And a lot of believers think that that there’s only two ways and I’m trying to show that there’s three and there’s another approach.

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","Thanks! I haven't really shared this story on here before now. Your post really resonated with me - like I saw some of myself in you. It's so hard being depressed, and that one step I took has really made a difference.

As far as the PCOS, I take birth control for it. I asked my GYN if I could do the period every three months thing (Seasonale?) and it is fucking wonderful. They even have generic options available. Taking birth control probably doesn't help with weight management (I've been trying to be more healthy recently and not much luck in getting rid of any lbs) but it has been great for my problem skin and hairiness. Weight loss isn't my biggest concern for the moment, but while you're in the health center, you might want to see your campus has a dietitian/nutritionist. They might be able to offer some good advice and lead you in the right track if you're aiming to lose some weight. /r/fitness is a good starting point, too.

Having those things to talk about with the therapist will really help, especially it you get it down on paper and have them look at it. I was never good at expressing totally how I felt, but if you can get over the awkward hump and ask for what it is you want, they'll be sure to help. Heh, something else I learned in therapy. I also consulted with my therapist about my social life and feelings - she had tons of resources for those too. It definitely takes time and practice to work on developing social and emotional skills - and it absolutely helps if you learn to not give a shit. I did not realize before that I was making up crazy stuff in my head and projecting things onto other people - like thinking they were pissed at me for some insane reason and then getting all depressed about it. [Here](http://depression.about.com/cs/psychotherapy/a/cognitive.htm) are more examples of thought processes that you might be able to relate to. The key is to make a conscious effort to stop thinking about it and replace it with more positive thoughts.

Anyway, it's so good to hear from you again! I wish you the best :)","1301617828"

"energy","t5_2qhkd","Not particularly relevant to the discussion. I am talking about how long it takes the to build the kind of plants used by utilities to supply electricity to the grid, you are talking about nuclear powered navy ships.

You and EYBUDDY are just being cute. Trying to move the goal posts around to distract from the fact that neither of you can address the core argument.

There is a risk that the US (yes, I would rather all countries abandon nuclear power but I happen to live in the US so that is my focus) can not build a nuclear plant that will be able to produce energy more cheaply (using the current flawed cost analysis) than solar power by the time the plant is complete.

The other problem with nuclear power is that although accidents are infrequent they are very costly. Chernobyl cost hundreds of billions of dollars and it is still paying for billion dollar fixes like the new containment structure. We aren't even talking about the land that will remain unusable for over twenty thousand years. Not to mention the human toll. If you think only 53 people died in the accident watch the movie and see if you still believe that nonsense by the time you reach the end. So, the cost of nuclear power if risk is properly accounted for makes nuclear power more expensive than wind and solar already.","1301617837"

"politics","t5_2cneq","In your mind, is there no difference between business costs and personal costs?  You seem to believe that you should get to deduct every single penny you spend, no matter what it's for.  Seriously, what the fuck are you proposing exactly?  That if you spend all your money, you shouldn't have to pay any taxes?  Or that a business should have to pay a 30% tax on **revenue** even if their profit margin is only 3%?  You don't make a fucking lick of sense.  

If you bought your car specifically **for** work, you actually can deduct it.  Same with anything else.  But I seriously doubt that you bought a house for work.  And guess what?  The shareholders of a corporation cannot deduct the cost of their houses either.  So what the fuck is the problem?  **Anyone can deduct anything they want as long as they can justify it as being FOR work/business.**  That applies equally to you as it does to corporations.  And it makes perfect fucking sense because a person who has to spend $900 in order to earn $1,000 is in the exact same boat as someone who earns $100 without spending anything.  You're retarded if you can't understand that.

&gt;That's not true. You should investigate strict liability.

""As a jurisdiction with due process, the United States usually applies strict liability to only the most minor crimes or infractions. One example would be parking violations"" 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_liability_(criminal)#United_States

&gt;Because you, as a shareholder, are GE. It is you who stole from the government. Just because you didn't participate doesn't make you innocent.

No, as a shareholder, I *am a shareholder*.  GE is a company.  A person cannot ""be"" a company.  They are different concepts.  If an individual within GE steals from the government, that does not mean that I stole from the government.

If you donate money to your church and a priest molests a kid, are you liable?  If you donate money to the Red Cross and one crazy individual within the Red Cross deliberately infects people with AIDS, are you liable?  If your boss steals money, are you liable?  If someone in your neighborhood watch group breaks into a house, are you liable?  If you buy a hamburger from McDonalds and they use that money to kill children, are you liable?

&gt;You are really having trouble with this concept of corporations as people. You keep wanting to focus on the individuals in the corporation but that's not how the law works. A corporation IS a person in the eyes of the law. If the corporation goes bankrupt, the corporation is out of money, not some person.

The idea of corporate personhood only exists to simplify things, so that ""GE"" pays taxes instead of a 1,000,000 GE shareholders and ""GE"" gets sued instead of individually suing 1,000,000 GE shareholders.  It is not some grand philosophical statement.  

Corporations have rights simply because they are groups of people.  There is nothing in the Constitution that says people suddenly lose their rights if they organize into a corporation.  The same applies to church groups, unions, etc.  

Yes, it's true that a corporation can go bankrupt without bankrupting its shareholders, but again, that's not some grand statement, it's just a limited liability contract.  If you wanted to, you could start a limited liability company right now.  You could fund it with $1,000 and ask a bank to provide more funding.  Of course, when you tell them that you will only limit your liability to your initial $1,000, you may not get the best rate.  Same goes for corporations.  It is not some ""extra"" right or ability that corporations have.","1301617839"

Just tell the hairdressers to stop bugging you about the haircut and that you just want a root touch up! Don't let them pressure you into anything. 

Also, if they are taking two inches off your hair, just get a haircut every 6 months or something, it'll be like taking a couple of cm off every month.","1301617869"

If you're talking about how *Ignatieff* reacted at the time, I'm not sure that that's relevant, since he wasn't active in politics, and was in a country largely *for* the Iraq war, and being bombarded by ""facts"" saying the war was necessary. As I understand he's since said that he was wrong about his opinions at that time, but *a lot* of people were wrong about their opinions of the war.

Those things are booked solid by various groups wanting to use them.  Kids that play some sport most likely outnumber kids who don't, and almost all of that majority will have a use for a new field.

This isn't even close to being about giving a kid a chance to play pro.  There are thousands of college sports programs out there that can help get kids accepted and a college education, not just the full-ride football ones you hear about on TV. Not only that but there are many employers who give preferential treatment in hiring athletes because they appreciate the hard work and dedication it takes to be an athlete.

Its not like building a new stadium is going to take away the possibility of giving every kid a base education.  The ithica high school isn't going to have to go back to using slide rules instead of calculators simply because of a single stadium.  Both athletics and academics should be funded, they both serve to promote well-rounded development in kids.","1301617886"

&gt; Objects from space that enter Earth's atmosphere are -- like space itself -- very cold and they remain so even as they blaze a hot-looking trail toward the ground. ""The outer layers are warmed by atmospheric friction, and little bits flake away as they descend,"" explains Yeomans. This is called ablation and it's a wonderful way to remove heat.

I tend to disagree.  Messy jobs can pay very well, but it's the dangerous ones you want to avoid.  Plumbing can be tricky, especially if it is old plumbing.  You have a leaky pipe and you try to replace it, only to have the next part fall apart in your hands.  A plumber is prepared for this with lots of spare parts in his truck.  A guy trying to get an extra gig will quickly see his profit go up in smoke with repeated trips for supplies.

Furthermore, I might also suggest saying ""spelling and grammar.""  I think saying ""or"" versus ""and"" conveys a sense that only one of those two concepts should be corrected, when in fact you would prefer to be corrected in both areas.

Finally, your use of the word ""it"" in the final clause of your comma-spliced sentence is a tad ambiguous.  In this case, you're safe because there are no real alternative antecedents aside from the unstated idea of ""corrections by others;"" however, in any situation with more context, the ""it"" has a greater chance of misinterpretation.

Also, my store used to have Hershey Kisses out at each register for customers to take one or two for free. Once, some young guys came up and one of them pointed and asked if they could have a kiss, to which I replied yes, customers can have one for free. His friend asked if he could have one too, and I said sure, since his friend did buy something it was fine.

I was able to know a lot of the crew, got on a name to name basis, and they knew I had absolutely no money (sleeping on a friend's couch at the time) so we had none of that business hanging over us. However, every now and then I could splurge on some bags of food, and they appreciated it.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","In the United States, access to MC is just as much an economic decision as a bioethical one (and the two overlap, really).  Few people who obtain one must pay out-of-pocket, because it is covered as routine postnatal/pediatric care.  In adulthood however, it isn't - it is elective.  Thus, there is an economic incentive to perform MC in infancy.

Not only this, but as I mentioned below, or above, wherever: in states where MC in infancy is not covered by Medicaid, guess which groups are disproportionately affected by access to MC?  If you said poor minorities, you would be correct.  And in which groups are the rates of HIV acquisition risk significantly higher (1 in 22 in blacks, and 1 in 57 in Hispanics?)  Poor minorities.  I don't really think these count as ""tiny"" risks - but to the average white middle class male redditor, of course this doesn't match their perception of their OWN risk, so they apply that falsely to everyone.","1301617981"

Parents with vouchers who want to send their kid to a religious school generally do so because of academic and safety reasons, not religious ones.

Boyer looked great in spring but he's never done that at the major league level.

Parnell was great in his partial season with the Mets last year but he needs to sustain it over a full season.

Carrasco has been a great one-out-righty situational guy through his career, but everywhere he has been they have tried to two-way him like Scott Schoeneweis and he sucks at it.  Maybe the Mets who are suddenly sabermetrically-inclined will figure out that he is a ROOGY and not use him against too many LHBs except where absolutely necessary.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;I actually have done this on a few occasions and no it doesn't.

Okay, professional disagreement.

&gt;Top Gear came up with an estimate that was almost exactly what Tesla got in their dyno testing.

Not any dyno testing I have seen. Source?

&gt;Okay, I guess the Tesla cannot ever, under any circumstance run dead. It's totally possible to get the 240 mile range Tesla quoted no matter how you drive it and no possible way it'll ever run completely dead in 80 miles.

It is indeed virtually impossible for it to be so dead you have to push it.  Unless the driver were idiotic enough to run the battery down, switch to limp mode, and not immediately drive to a charger.  Limp mode is emergency backup power you use to find a charging place. 

&gt;80 miles. Tesla themselves reported 80 miles on a dyno test which is in completely unrealistic conditions at a steady 125mph.

That's almost 50% higher than Top Gear's number of 55.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","You seem to not understand my position. That's only to be expected because I never actually stated a position, I just pointed out a flaw in yours. So this is all getting a little fractured because I haven't actually presented a position for you to attack.

I know you can choose not to use facebook, and in a way that could count as 'control', but it's a bit like 'bald' as a hair colour or 'off' as a TV channel. I think that *because* you don't have control over it if you use it, it makes sense not to use it.

The lamp thing is just semantics, I was just pointing out that the statement that not having control over a product is the way products work is semantically false, because 'products' is a big category, making the statement an over-generalisation. Anyway none of those things are restrictions on what you can do with a lamp, they're restrictions on what you can make others do. You can't return a modded lamp, but they can't stop you from modding it. Apart from the last one, which is a restriction in what you can do, but not a restriction that I believe exists, at least where I live. If you bought the lamp, you can sell it on. You can't sell on the *design* of the lamp, because you didn't buy that, but once you've bought the lamp you can do what you want with it.

&gt; Writing off a whole company, which, let me remind you, is made up of people is unfair.

I'm not writing off facebook, I'm saying I trust it less than reddit. Corporations are made of people, yes, but they're not demographic groups protected against discrimination. They have hiring policies, corporate culture, written policies and regulations. Corporations are structured entities that make decisions according to their ethos and culture. Canonical likes their products more open than Microsoft, Tesla has more environmental concerns than BP. Based on past action and current attitudes, I think reddit is more trustworthy than facebook. I don't doubt there are good people working for facebook, but the actions of the company as a whole show that they don't have a big enough effect for me.

&gt; First off, Conde Nast doesn't need to know how to run the site. It's a collaborative effort.

Reddit's a custom piece of software which was put together over a long time. It's complicated, and as we know, it falls down pretty often. Not many people know it well enough to figure out why it's fallen over and pick it back up again. They need to know how to run the site, or the next time it goes down, it doesn't come back up.

&gt; &gt; **I don't believe** the tech team would allow it to happen. **If** they decided to walk out, they'd walk straight into nice jobs at other companies

&gt; **You're stating you know for a fact** that reddit's tech team is so loyal to its community that they would walk away from their job

...

&gt; On one, you can make a funny throwaway to comment on an article. On the other, it's meant for more personal connections so it's more conducive to one account. And why is this bad?

On one you have the option to post without it being connected to you as an individual. In the other, you don't have that choice. I think it's better to have more choice.

I don't feel 'safe' posting with this username, because this username is my full real name, complete with middle initials. I don't post things with this account that I wouldn't be happy seeing attributed to me in a national newspaper. The fact that you are able to find my homepage is entirely deliberate. But when I want to post something personal, or brutally honest, or potentially embarrassing or incriminating, I use one of several different accounts. I think you know I own a hat, and I will eat that hat if you can identify those accounts. In this way on reddit I am in control of what is publicly identifiable as me and what is not. That option isn't available on facebook. All is identifiable as me, and available to facebook as such.

An example of a harmful scenario might be Facebook handing over nominally private information to law enforcement without ensuring the proper procedures are carried out (assuming law enforcement doesn't have a direct feed, which is paranoid but can't be ruled out), resulting in a bypassing of judicial oversight, and accompanying harm to civil liberties. And if you think that law enforcement is entitled to this information without judicial oversight, remember that facebook is international, and not all law enforcement authorities are as just as yours may be.

&gt;ignore the rest of the laws yourself

So, let me clarify - If you're indicating that some laws are not better than others, then you should have memorized not only the vehicle code but be following the letter of the law in all aspects your life. 

I'll very clearly state my position:  

Going 56 or even 65 in a 55 zone (when road conditions allow for that rate of speed) is 'breaking the law' but not as 'bad' as blocking the passing lane (with no cars in front of you) while travelling 55 while the person to your right is travelling at 55.

Do you disagree?","1301618008"

  Semantic nitpicking, change it to solar panels, or a fusion reactor.  Same idea.  The idea is also so that energy generation has become so efficient that it is about as abundant and available as air.  The replicator can also replicate nanobots, that can harvest nuclear energy from anything.  It goes on and on.  Point is, there is no more energy or goods industry.

&gt;Certainly, we could create an economy where ""scarcity"" doesn't exist in any meaningful sense on the scale of individuals and individual lives (which IMO is really what Star Trek was talking about) but there will always be scarcity in the larger-scale.


That is another reason why the author fails.  He doesn't recognize that while in the star trek universe, every possible need you could have has been eliminated, but there is something that remains valuable.  Star ships they cannot just be replicated, and as the show implies good ones are hard to build.

  It would be considered wealth and a significant human achievement to obtain a starship, or to earn the right to command one.  ","1301618048"

"TheoryOfReddit","t5_2rtff","I will snarkily correct other redditors' spelling and grammar at my discretion, partially because it makes me feel superior and partially because I genuinely want to fight for grammatical norms.  

I think ""it's"" and ""its"" are important to distinguish.  I feel the same way about ""your"" and ""you're,"" ""they're,"" ""there,"" and ""their,"" and a thousand other routinely botched English homophones, idioms, and phrases.  These different words convey different meanings.  These distinctions are purposeful and meaningful.  I feel passionately that we ought to fight for some basic standards of written language, and what better place to do so than a popular website where the overwhelming medium of communication is the written word?  A lot of fellow redditors use English as a second language (or never learned it well the first time around).  Many of those people actively seek to improve their skills here, so I want to play a role in that process.

I don't feel that PMs are workable alternatives.  I'm not just out to correct an individual.  I yearn to improve the language as a whole.  To make corrections publicly both shows others the correct way to use the language, and also more actively encourages others to *proof before they post.*  Obviously, grammar, spelling and the like in posts is not life or death, and neither is formal English, but it's a passion of mine, so I'm not going to stop correcting to spare the feelings of others.","1301618066"

This is why I generally disbelieve others when they claim to know things that I am fairly certain that they cannot know. What happens to your conciousness when you die for instance. I am the most skeptical of people who base their theories on a compilation of books written by a bunch of goat herders who didn't even know what germs are or that Japan exists.

"orangecounty","t5_2rd9x","I agree about the long term stuff. Though I don't think it's because his policies actually had these sorts of long term ramifications, I think it's because they were never completed. Bush Sr. didn't pick up where Reagan left off.

Even with drug policy. I think it would be fantastic if we as a country swore off drugs, alcohol and coffee. I think it would benefit us to do so. I just think without unanimous support, which may have seemed possible in the 80s when hippies were the most hated ""lazy scum"" in our society, it will never happen. I say this as a person who currently supports decriminalization.

Regan's policies in my opinion more closely mirror FDR than anyone else. The republican's obsession with him is similar. He is largely responsible for the economic boom which followed his leadership. He did what was right at the time. But like FDR's policies they depended on a government with total understanding of the nuances involved. They needed to be constantly updated based upon their results. There needed to be no hesitation in removing them when they don't work. Many of the new deal programs have had the exact same effect.

As a current regulatory assistant for a chemical company I assure you the distinctions are as thick as they can be. Regulations are destroying this country. They are ridiculously complex, based upon politics (mostly to please the people and give politicians a cause) and not at all on science.

I'll give you an example. We used to manufacture a pesticide called ""rotenone"". About 30 years ago it found that it can cause Parkinson's disease. We as a company spent a small fortune figuring out how to solve this. In the meantime we kept the registration, but did not sell the product. We finally found a solution in the 90s and attempted to register our new formulation. We were denied because it was known to cause Parkinson's. We were also simultaneously forced to cancel our old registration. Soon afterwards it was re-registered by another company for use as an organic pesticide. Today it is one of the most commonly used pesticides on the market. But it is completely illegal to sell it if it has the Parkinson's fix because that is a chemical process and it is no longer considered an organic product.

You are right that the regulators are being manipulated by big businesses, but the ones that REALLY have them by the balls are companies like Time Warner, companies that own the news sources. Companies that also align most American's ethical compass. The level they are manipulated on is much more frequently on the side of morals and less financial than you would be led to believe.

Politicians mostly really do want to make the country a better place. Because of this, getting them to do anything contrary to their beliefs is very difficult using money, unless they are promised something they view as more important. This kind of manipulation really only accounts for a very small percentage of the total.

The system is more broken, overly complex and bureaucratic than corrupt. Corrupt implies that it is functioning towards a purpose. Our country is so messed up more because it can't build towards anything. It's too busy fighting it self.","1301618143"

add a researchable ability allowing protoss cannons to relocate. Terrans can salvage bunkers, zerg can move spinecrawlers, why can't protoss move their cannons? make it researchable from the cybernetics core (cheap but relatively long research time) to prevent it being abused in early cannon rushes.

make the mothership useful again, give it some kind of defensive ability so it doesn't die in 5 seconds. maybe immune to damage but rooted in place for a few seconds or an instant full heal that costs energy or something. add another researchable ability to the fleet beacon such as the old planet cracker that was removed. make it at least a little faster.

add in dark and twilight archons. i don't care if they're purely cosmetic, put them in. alternatively, give dark archons the dominate ability and a shield/power regen and make twilight archons extremely powerful melee units (remember, you need to tech for both dark and high templar to get a twilight archon).

make the carrier useful again. add a speed upgrade to the fleet beacon, and a more interceptors upgrade. don't force interceptors to return to the carrier after their target is killed if there is another target in range. put a button to toggle whether interceptors focus fire a single enemy or attack similar to other units when a-moved. carriers take a LONG time to tech to and build, they should be worth it.

give warp prisms a passive shield regeneration to all units in range when they're in warp in mode so they have a use beyond drops. 

give protoss a decent dedicated harass unit in early game. terran have reapers, zerg has zerglings. what can protoss harass with? phoenix or void ray maybe, but they're not dedicated harass units in the same way reapers and zerglings are, and require much more tech. plus, you need at least 2-3 phoenix to harass effectively. finally, losing a void ray or a phoenix is a much MUCH bigger deal than losing a reaper or a few zerglings. protoss need something expendable in early game, as it is even losing a zealot isn't a good idea for protoss.","1301618147"

When it comes down to it a relationship is a choice (particularly if you're not married and don't have kids). Everything you do in that relationship should be a choice you make, not something you're obligated to do. What I'm trying to convey is that if she no longer wants to be in the relationship, there's no greater force compelling her to remain in it.

Consider the following infinite sum:

1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... = 1

(powers of 2 in the denominator, and we're actually considering a limit here)

So you can see that a set of an infinite number of possibilities can still contain outcomes that are non-infinitesimal in their likelihood.

When flipping a coin, there are an infinite number of possible outcomes. It could land on its side. A dragon could crash through the wall and snatch it out of mid-air. In a practical sense, there are two possible outcomes that are equally likely.

Just because an infinite number of possible outcomes exist doesn't mean that each outcome has a 0% chance of occurring.","1301618171"
"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt;Except that these are our employees, whose work we pay for. The government is not a private company owned by the PMO.

I would be surprised if similar guidelines are not implemented in other government agencies, such as CRA or any other government agency. For instance with CRA, it seems like you contact the [media relations department](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/nwsrm/md-eng.html) and not the tax auditors directly. 

Yes we pay for their salaries, but we are not considered above them in the chain of command. CRA tax auditors sure don't act like they are my employees, nor do city workers, cops, teachers etc. I'm not saying it's fair, it's just how government bureaucracies turn out.

&gt;And no, it's not that approval takes too long, it's that they are not allowed to speak to the media.

Source? Maybe your body of knowledge is broader than mine but without providing an unbiased source am I supposed take this as truth? The leaked documents said that reports have gone down because a lot of reporters have [same-day deadlines](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:U2mKrMpzHHQJ:thetyee.ca/Mediacheck/2010/03/25/HarpersMuzzle/+canadian+scientist+speaking+to+media&amp;cd=8&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca&amp;source=www.google.ca). This could very well be a method to discourage media contact but to say its outright censorship I would like to see three things: 1) Exclusivity to environmental scientists 2) The rate of requests denied. 3) Average time for approval/rejection

If you ever dealt with government agencies you know they are SLOW. It took me 5 weeks to get the VPD to send me a criminal record check, 8 months for CRA to verify I am a university student. It wouldn't surprise me if approval times are long due to incompetence, as opposed to malice.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Intentionally running a military blockade is not a non-violent protest.

Yes it is, actually.  There is nothing violent about sailing a ship to a port and unloading humanitarian aid.  

&gt;Israel is required to enforce the blockade in all instances or it becomes invalid.

Right, that was the point of the flotilla.  I think the organizers said that was the point beforehand.  If they didn't it doesn't matter, the reason is still obvious.  

&gt;The protesters knew that. Which is why they had clubs and metal poles and knives.

Here you are very wrong.  The only way to break the blockade for good was to get Israel to back down, to let the flotilla through and then have to let the next 100 through as well.  The protesters, minus a small minority, knew that and never deviated.  

About the metal poles and knives, all of that is stuff that is on boats.  A few instigators and a number of other ass holes and idiots worked themselves into a frenzy in the hours leading to the boarding, and then improvised for weapons, used things that lie around on ships.  

Now imagine you are one of the sane people on the ship.  You and the rest of the sane outnumber the insane like 10 to 1.  But are you and the other sane people going to improvise your own weapons and try to stop the thugs?  Sane people don't like to fight, they especially don't like to fight a bunch of thugs with improvised, dangerous weapons.  

This is why I think one can't lump together the intentions and actions of the entire flotilla.  The massive majority purpose was to break the blockade by setting an example.  A small minority wrote the history books, however.  

&gt;The legality of the blockade in general is a separate argument, but that is maritime law.

The relationship between Israel and Gaza has no historical precedent.  International law is formed in response to conflict and designed for that conflict.  The maritime law, the Sam Ramee treaty I think it's called, something like that, assumes two nations at war when it discusses the law of blockades.  

So here's the thing, I can't think of a blockade in human history that did not *precede* an occupation.  A war starts between nations or their historical equivalents, one nation blockades the other as a means of winning the war, and then may occupy the other belligerent.  The order of events with Gaza, war, occupation, insurgency, blockade, does not have historical precedent, there is not really international law on the subject.  Israel's blockade of Gaza is not a tool for winning their war with Gaza, they've given up on that.  ","1301618198"

And as for biological differences between the sexes--yes they certainly exist, however on things we already measure (such as say physical strength) while men typically are stronger--this means the average man is stronger than the average woman.  But, there are men who are weaker than average and women who are stronger.  So in any measure like this the generalization gleaned from study only goes so far to describe actual people.

What bothers me is when evo psych is spouted off as blanket fact ""all men are cheaters""  ""all women are emotional""--even if there is a evolutionary aspect to the behaviours described, the description is not consistent absolutely.

Yes, there was a gaping mistake in letting them set the price. However, charging high prices on orphaned drugs is pretty standard for companies like KV. They take over drugs which are no longer being produced and re-introduce them to the market. The prices boarder extortion, but for those who need it absolutely, they can usually make the payment. 

So the real problem is KV thinking they could do business as usually on a drug like this. I think it was more of a tactical error than anything. In the end everyone is going to forget this happened and it will be business as usual. ","1301618214"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Well, one way to look at the whole locking-of-the-wife-in-the-attic thing is that in 1847, when the book was published, a public mad-house would have been a billion times worse than a private tower with a nurse in an isolated country home. And Rochester knows that he's done wrong and vacillates between feeling that having Jane is his redemption and and feeling it is his right. When he saves his wife, he is acting as a moral man and also trying to keep her (the wife) from committing a mortal sin aka suicide. I don't know--I always saw him as flawed, not bad. 

As a hero, he doesn't really fit the bill. The story is really about Jane. That said, I always found their chemistry in the book to be undeniable. Maybe the attraction to Rochester is that Jane finds him irresistible (to a point) despite his known flaws.

Helpless maybe wasn't the word. I mean that his injuries bring him to experience the kind of psychological and emotional pain that Jane endured as a child/young woman. I think this gives him a depth that he didn't have prior. This shared experience,combined with Jane's new wealth, makes them equal in the eyes of society and also in a more genuine way. 

There's also another way to read the book, which I've read about but haven't fully grasped. Some people read Mrs. Rochester and Jane as two sides of the same woman (or two sides of womanhood). In this interpretation Rochester just provides a fulcrum between each side, with Jane representing repressed, virgin womanhood and Mrs.Rochester representing a kind of wild, uncontrollable womanhood.

Better places to ask would be [/r/askscience](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience), [/r/psychology](http://www.reddit.com/r/psychology), or [/r/depression](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/).

Exercise, improved diet, better sleep patterns, seeing a councilor or therapist (preferably a CBT) and more sunlight will generally improve mild depression. You might want to start out small, just going on long walks and eating fruit/ vegetables, cut back on meat and grains there are better ways to get carbs/ fats/ proteins etc. Bread generally makes people gain weight so that might have something to do with it. Full vegetarian would probably be best but I personally can't give up meat so I understand if that isn't an option just cut back and up the intake of fruits/ veggies. Getting B vitamins especially B12 and Omega 3 fish oils are generally good for brain health and getting vitamin D is especially important during the winter/ early spring specifically vitamin D3.

If you use Firefox, you can fix it so that content from comedycentral.com including the sister sites for South Park, Daily Show, Colbert Nation, etc. will work outside the US.

First, install the [Modify Headers](http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/967) addon to Firefox.

1) In Firefox, Go to Tools --&amp;gt; Modify Headers.

2) From the drop-down box on the left select 'Add'.

3) Into the first input box type ""X-Forwarded-For"" without the quotes.

4) Into the second box put ""12.13.14.15"" without the quotes.

5) Leave the last box empty, click 'Add' to the right of it. Now it's in the list. Make sure to enable it if it somehow isn't, by selecting the entry you've added and clicking 'Enable/Disable' so the marker on the line is green.

6) Click the 'Options' tab, and make sure ""Always On"" is checked.

7) Hit OK to close the Modify Headers box and you can watch videos from all of those affiliated sites.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","There were lots of things which got me through my breakup. The first was realising that I was grieving, and it was a natural process. I could attempt to rationalize it all I wanted (I'm an extremely logical person) but it's emotional attachment, and that can't be expressed rationally, really. So let yourself feel whatever you need to, but don't self-indulge. Don't become the person who feels sorry for themselves.

Another thing was meditating on the bad points of the relationship. I don't hate my ex, and I'm ashamed to say that I have bad-mouthed her to several people. She had her bad points - hence the breakup - but I loved that person deeply at one point and in some ways they deserve my respect. Or part of it. But I realised that what I was grieving was not the loss of the relationship - because think about it; the relationship was toxic - it was the loss of what I once had - happiness - from a long, long time ago. You lose your idealized version of the person or the relationship. You don't actually lose anything of value (or you wouldn't have broken up). See?

Philosophy helped me, too. And the realization that we only have one life, and I'd rather live it being happy, and trying to find the right person for me. No use in being obsessed with what was, or what ""could be"", when you know or knew in your gut that something was not right. I reconsidered my breakup many times, but now I know it was the right thing to do, and I truly doubt I could ever be with my ex, or someone like her, again. At least not without a massive change in her personality, and time for me to see who and what else is out there!

Self-improvement is next. The best way you can get over someone (or, indeed, get revenge on someone (although I try to avoid this emotion)) is to improve your own life and live better without them. Focus on things you need and want just now. In my case it's exercise, business, and trying to enjoy my life. 

Do I still miss my ex? Sure, sometimes. I still see her (online) and speak with her occasionally. But it's not ""painful"" any more. There is no ""desire"" there... but occasionally, I can stop and think ""what if..."" or even compare her to the kind of girls I see now who don't have all of her nice traits. I'm guessing this is natural. Honestly, I wouldn't wish to totally forget her, even with the past misery.

So that was my advice to you. :) Take care, and be happy! ","1301618266"

Then this...

&gt;My point was more that while the faith may have its problems, **things that are utter shit don't get those results.**

Aaand this...

&gt;While I wouldn't base my opinion on Islam on the numbers it generates...

Aaand then this...

&gt;...there must be something about the religion that is benefiting its followers. 

And I'm not just doing this to just nit pick or sound like a ponce but it sounds like you are having your cake and eating it. That is the argumentum ad populum fallacy in it's entirety dude : )

&gt;I will say though that I wouldn't simply point to problems being faced by largely Muslim nations and just blame it on Islam...

[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD0HYqNeHiM) has been running on Channel 4 in the UK recently. I highly recommend it. He argues that a powerful clergy, an aversion to scientific precepts that contradict religion and a refusal or inability of the Muslim world to keep religion out of government allowed the west to speed ahead as the enlightenment took *away* the power of the clergy, allowed science to flourish despite it's  challenges to theological doctrine and cultivated **secular** government. 

The nature of Islam as a religion based on a single, unchanged book that is beyond criticism, having come from a perfect, infallible creator make Islam *more* resistant to change than other religions. I agree with the narrators overall conclusions.

EDIT: To nick islamquestions paragraph. She expresses a similar sentiment -

&gt;""The Qur'an is the center of Islam. To deny the Qur'an or anything inside of it is to say one is not a Muslim. This is the absolute center of the religion. Above hadith, above all else, is the belief that the Qur'an is the word of God and it is unaltered. In that sense Islam is very fundamentalist by nature."" 

.

&gt;The nations surveyed on the page that data comes from are largely from nations that have either been in wars in recent decades or have been threatened by them. 

Lebanon is the huge, blaring outlier on your little hypothesis there. In fact, I have a newfound respect for Lebanon after reading those stats. The Lebanese have been through a shit-ton of wars over the past 50 years, yet they are second only to Turkey in their tolerance. In fact, I would go so far as to say over the last 30 years, [they are the *worst* affected by war and the threat of war on that list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-Lebanese_conflict). Just an observation.

&gt;A lot were also not too rich (except Turkey, which was often the most moderate) and have a fair amount of corruption. 

Well you know the perpetrators of 9/11, the failed bombing in Stockholm and New York, the Madrid train bombings *and* the 7/7 bombings were all either from Muslim families well enough to pay for international university fees at (about $30,000 a year), OR were born into those Western wealthy countries in the first place. Educated and wealthy young Muslims who suddenly feel the need to engage in bloodshed. What unites them? These intolerant, backwards views transcend cultural, racial and class boundaries and *all* have direct scriptural basis.

&gt;There could be many reasons for the attitudes in those nations, the least of which is that they're all just nuts.

There is a reason dude and it's not that they're nuts. It's the idea of the Ummah, a single Muslim brotherhood. Believe me, I felt it. Why did someone born in the west with no connection to Afghanistan feel the need to egg on the Taliban against America in 2001? Or support 9/11 *in the first damned place*? That someone was *me*. Do not underestimate the power of the idea of the Ummah. It is most potent. Is there a logical line to be drawn from notions about holy war + Ummah to setting a bomb off in London even though one was born there? YES there is.

&gt;And I was talking about Islam from a non-Muslim's perspective. If you thought Islam was the absolute perfect representation of God, then you might be a Muslim. 

I assumed you were Muslim. My bad : )

&gt;However, I really don't think that death threats will help spread a faith and keep people in line forever. 

I'd have to disagree man. It worked pretty well for the catholic church and they only lost their grip when society embraced secularism. And it's not just death threats. I don't know if you read the link to that article but it's the general intolerance of dissent and outsiders. The Muslim world, quite frankly, treats it's minorities like shit and any doubters are quickly made to be pariahs. They are ridiculed and intimidated, not served in stores or jeered at. Believe me, questioning Islam does *not* go down well in general in Muslim countries. Could we not agree that a lack of open discourse maintains the status quo? Indeed, stifling the debate is doing exactly what it was designed to do: *maintain the status quo*.

Dude, you feel Islam had some nice ideas back then but if I'm honest, you've heard largely of the Disney version of Islam and not the darker stuff that it bought.

As for evil ideology...an apt observation. That about sums up what I think. This might sound like a strange question but do you study sociology by any chance? Your viewpoint is very sociological. I don't have time to go into why exactly I think that so I'm going to be lazy and link you to a few of my previous criticisms of Islam (sorry ; ).

"guns","t5_2qhc8","&gt; Let's just look at the ballistics. Bullets travel in an arc; lasers are straight lines. You zero lasers to have an impact point at a set distance. That means if you shift the target towards or away from the zero'd distance, you're going to have an impact point higher or lower than zero.

How is this any different than standard sights, or nearly any other aiming device for that matter?

&gt; If you've got a weapon mounted light, you don't need a laser to pin point the target

Are you saying that flashlights are accurate enough to use in place of lasers/sights for aiming? Is this true?

&gt; And that brings up the another point. We find that trying to focus on the where the laser dot is is much slower than focusing the front sight. You should be focusing the front sight anyways for aiming. Night sights in tandem with a weapon mounted light are a much better investment.

Most people suggest lasers for high-adrenalin (self-defense) situations, this may not be true in those situations.","1301618278"

Once you get into college, what you do there is permanent and your academic record there is weighed heaviest of all factors for admission to other programs because it is the best indicator of future college success over all other indicators.

You will not get into a nursing program on the strength of your essay, just get that out of your mind. 

The only thing you can do is go back to school and do extremely well in school starting then and then keep it up. But you need to accept that no matter what you do, you may never be able to make up for your past academic performance.

Talking about turning your academic life around isn't going to carry any weight compared to actually doing that. So do it, then you can worry about the essay because right now, the essay is literally just talk about doing better.

My favorite technique has always been the triangle from knee-in half guard, do you use it a lot?  I've caught a lot of higher belts with it at least once, but then they get wise to my trick...

Any other favorite techniques from knee in half guard?  I've seen a belly down arm bar from there (kick the far leg out, through your knee-in knee over their arm and block their face as you swim down), but I can't get it yet... 

Any half guard tips would rock!   I'm about 155lbs, and i'm not a weenie, but I feel like almost everyone I roll with is stronger than me. I saw your sweep video, I've tried it, but I have a lot of strong wrestlers who don't let me try sweeps from the half guard... ","1301618281"

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","Health-wise, a whole lot of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, with not a lot of meat.  This isn't to say you can't cook some awesome meat dishes.  Just pair vegetables along with them.

A specific thing I did the other day:

Chicken, Boneless skinless breasts. You will need these.  Cloves of garlic, salt, pepper, a bit of chopped onion, all sauteed for a bit, and combined with the chicken, enough water to cover everything, put it on low, a lid on top, and let sit for a few hours.

Take out the chicken when you're almost ready to do the pan thing, and shred it.

Throw onions, garlic, peppers (you'll need to go with your heat tolerance here as to what type of peppers) in a pan and soften them up (by the by, don't add the garlic to a hot pan for too long, or so I hear.  Maybe thirty seconds tops?).  Add the shredded chicken and let it brown for not too long.  Then add some diced up tomatoes.

If you want to get fancy on this dish then roast up your tomatoes (remove the charred skin after cooking), your garlic (leave the skin on while cooking for sure), roast the peppers for sure and take that skin junk off, and roast up the onions.  All that nonsense with a bit of oil under the broiler for a bit will do the trick.  My use of parenthesis may not.  Peppers and tomatoes you might want to throw in a paper bag after cooking to ease the skin removal phase.

Add a bit of the chicken broth you just made by boiling up the chicken breasts to your pan.  Save the rest of the chicken broth of course for later good times.  Add a slew of chili powder to your pan by my estimation.  Add lemon juice for extra madness.  Do not use concentrated lemon juice or I will shoot you in the face.  Let it all cook until it all thickens up.  Stir constantly so as to not dry out the chicken.  You now have chicken.  Congratulations.

Now, in my world at least, you have three choices: enchiladas, tostadas, or tacos.  All are easy at this point but you will need:  tortillas, cheese, and toppings.

Tacos:  I go with fried corn tortillas for the tastiness (""home made"", home fried anyway, because I'm still a dummy and like to clean up crazy messes I make), the chicken of course, lettuce on top, cheese, tomatoes and salsa (I use this term loosely, so use what you like including tobasco sauce if you're so inclined you insane mofos.)

Tostadas?  Beans are a different story, but have a tostada shell and throw some beans on it.  Throw chicken on top of that.  Throw lettuce on top of that.  Throw cojita cheese on top of that.  Salsa of your choice.

Of course do cabbage if you can in place of lettuce.  I have to admit lettuce is tastier though, at least on my end.

Enchiladas:  corn tortillas, wrapped around chicken like a taquito but fatter.  Do this quick as the tortillas seem to break really easy just sitting there.  Or some junk says to fry up your tortillas and that would definitely help with the breaking, but also add a bunch of oil of course.  Smother all that with green chili enchilada sause (or red if you suck).  Look for green chili sauce that mainly has tomatillos and green chilis, not a whole lot of salt and preferably not crazy chemicals.  Or make your own but this is a whole other thread.  Top with cheese and bake at 400 fahrenheit  till it looks good, then bake it 5 mins more so it's crispy.  Enjoy.","1301618301"

Dude: one of these is very likely going to fucking explode soon because of an *uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction.* Are you paying attention here?  Seriously, wake up: this is several orders of magnitude more serious than the earthquake. And that was one huge earthquake. This is a triple nuclear meltdown.

As soon as that uncontrolled nuclear fission reaction hits the water table the shit is going to hit the fan far worse than it has. There will be more explosions. Things are getting steadily worse; you might want to start to pay attention again.

Do you know how you put out an uncontrolled nuclear reaction when everything else fails like it has? *You detonate a nuclear weapon on top of it.* There are no other options to put this out. They are actually discussing encasing the whole mess in concrete now. That will lock in any pressure from steam... thus causing a nasty explosion. That approach worked at Chernobel because there was no chain reaction going on after the explosion there. In this case we have at least 3 reactors completely out of control. Are you grasping that?

"TheWire","t5_2reco","OP, hang in there for two seasons and you'll get sucked into it. In the first season, The Shield suffers from being too episodic. In the second season, you slowly have a bigger picture evolving and thats when you start getting drawn into it, and by the time *the beginning of the end* (you'll understand) happens, you will be completely hooked. The Shield might not be a grand opera like The Wire and the storylines might, at times, require you to suspend your disbelief (Yes, like normal TV shows) ever so slightly. That said, it will expose you to some of the best characters on television played by Chiklis, Goggins, Anthony Anderson, Glenn Close, Forest Whitaker and Jay Karnes. At the end of the 7 season run, you'll find yourself caring for the fates of the major characters a lot more than you thought you would. Oh and if you're anything like me, you'll find yourself describing the finale as the greatest one you've ever seen, the finale of The Wire notwithstanding. 

As for the comparisons with 'The Wire', there couldn't possibly be any  as they couldn't be more different from each other..","1301618322"

Personally I think that they behaved in a rather non-heroic, and somewhat thin skinned, manner towards the villagers, but perhaps that fits their vision of their characters, or their vision of a black and white morality that they want to pursue.

Don't railroad should be the cardinal rule of GM's everywhere.

That said, actions should have consequences, it makes the game world seem more believable.

You tried to work their desire for a keep into things, they passed it by and while I don't think you should be punitive, the story is a collaborative effort after all and they obviously didn't like your plot hook, it would make sense from a story standpoint for either 1 or 2 to happen.

If you take option 2 I'd recommend simply presenting it as part of the unfolding story, rather than some lesson in listening to the GM.

It's hard when the players ignore your plot, or worse just derail it and trample it, but you roll with the punches, that's why you're the GM.","1301618323"

No, it's just that we can go back and forth on different points, countering, compromising until we get to the fundamental basis of our views. I believe that while wealth is necessary for a healthy economy those who have wealth don't necessarily deserve it and should contribute more. They tend to feel that the only way to get wealthy is to work hard and earn it or they take a more Calvinist approach and feel that if someone is wealthy then they must deserve it and therefore should be able to keep all their disposable income. 

Moving forward from there the debate usually ceases to be about politics and economics and shifts toward philosophy and sociology.

So because PERMIT HOLDERS don't commit gun crimes, that EVERYONE should be allowed to have guns????  Is that seriously the point of this idiocy?

Permit holders are a class of people who went out of their way to get a license to carry.  Most of us have been shooting for a long time, and in most cases we've taken classes to ensure we can responsibly handle a gun without being a danger to others.  
This article equates those people with EVERYONE.  All the dumbshits who never took a class or went to the range, the homeboys, the wanna be gangsters who hold their guns sideways.

We pay for a bandwidth rate, a speed at which we're allowed access to this infrastructure. This model makes sense, because Bell is not creating the data... charging a shipping fee per kg is not quite the same as $/GB ;)

How does Bell keep their end of this agreement? Well it's obviously a lot cheaper for them to try and curb usage (UBB/AVP) rather than lay down new lines... 

...well, considering their record profits, fuck em: lay down new lines. The CRTC exists to protect consumers. We're a first world country with third world internet and we're going to cripple that further just as mankind takes its first steps into the knowledge age?

&gt;wires should be run by a public company and sold to resellers at-cost

This would be great! But is it AVP? Is it artificial to break down infrastructure and maintenance costs into data-costs?","1301618356"

ALSO, don't forget that you asked WOMEN (the arguably more-sensitive sex) a question that we assumed you had a lot of emotional stake in... I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that MOST redditors are on the ""more to love"" side of the scale than not, and I'm sure that swayed the answers a bit...

My favorite fuck buddy ever was shorter than me, quite large, and VERY hairy... Not usually my thing, but we just clicked and I thought he was the greatest... Two of my most significant ""real"" relationships have been with tall skinny guys though, and that tends to be what turns my head most often...

It's true that women have their ""ideal type"" just like guys do, but we tend to be A LOT more flexible about that sort of thing. I'm not just saying this to make the guys on reddit feel better, but here is what *I* place most value on in **first meeting** a partner:

**40% Brains** (clever and quick-witted over impressive degrees)


**35% Kindness** (genuine empathy and generosity rather than friendliness and good manners)


**20% His interests and ambitions** (is he passionate about something? Does he have goals? I have a soft spot for the drifters as do most women with a maternal instinct, but I'm wise enough to avoid getting involved with them these days)


**5% Looks** (could I sleep with this guy? True story: I have NEVER met a guy who was so hideous I couldn't sleep with him if we hit it off like crazy in all other areas. Sadly it's true that a tall, dark, and handsome guy might have an easier time engaging in some crazy flirting right off the bat, but I sincerely do not judge him any easier than an unattractive guy when it comes time to analyze just where a relationship with said guy could lead...)

**After dating for a while** it becomes


**34.5 % How much I enjoy spending time with him doing NOTHING**


**34% Sexual compatibility**


**15.5% How we communicate and compromise**


**15% Our shared goals and desired lifestyles**


**1% Looks**","1301618366"

[Newegg Link](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151087&amp;Tpk=750%20seasonic)


Seasonic also makes the power supplies for Corsair. So you're basically getting a AX750 for 170 bucks. WELL WORTH IT.

Also, I would recommend getting triple channel, rather than dual channel startup memory. 

[G.Skill Pi's](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231335&amp;cm_re=g.skill_pi-_-20-231-335-_-Product)

Less bandwidth, but working in triple channel is a higher benefit, mainly because you'll never even hit that 6gb mark gaming or multitasking.

You can make up for that increase in price by getting a different motherboard. Either a: Asus [P6X58D-E](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131641&amp;cm_re=asus_p6x58-_-13-131-641-_-Product) or an Asus [Sabertooth](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131665&amp;cm_re=sabertooth-_-13-131-665-_-Product)(I actually own this board, love it)

Intel i7 960

H50 Cooler

Saberooth x58

EVGA GTX 570

&gt;Or stuff he just didn't want in the game by default.

And that's fine, I have no issue with the modders at all (except that they're kind of letting themselves be taken advantage of). My issue is with the half-assed way Minecraft development is being done these days by Mojang.

&gt; Managing the company and employees rather than coding maybe?

Then who IS coding?  Surely the whole point of taking on employees was to spread the work around a little and take some of the load off of Notch, but it still seems to be mostly Notch's baby and he doesn't seem to want to work on it very often. Oh sorry, no coding today, had to have a nerf battle instead.  

OK, people get burnt out working on the same project for a long time, I can understand that, but at least hand it over to someone else to work on properly and not just leave it to stagnate.

&gt; That was mainly due to lawyer / management involvement.

Yeah, I saw that excuse too. I think a more likely explanation was that the Business Manager Notch took on pointed out they could make lots of money with DLC.

&gt;Bug fixes in other areas seem to be a pretty common thing they are working on currently.

Most of the bug fixes seem to happen just after releases, to fix the stuff that's been broken in the release itself, because it's not been tested too thoroughly. Otherwise, not much seems to be happening. The new content being added is idiotic ""Added cake!""  ""Added cookie!"" ""Sorry, no achievements or stats this time"". 

I'd honestly be really happy if they just fleshed out some of the features that have been added in a half-assed way already, make farming more interesting, provide incentives to explore the infinite world, make locomotives not terrible,  add stuff to circuits to make them more interesting and useful, add mechanical devices (like the pistons!), try to make natural caves as interesting as they used to be before they were made regional.  But none of this stuff is being done and it's being left to the modders to fill in.

&gt; as long as it is things that don't actually affect gameplay at all. Capes, official texture packs, etc

I'm sorry to say it isn't, not even close. The article I read was an interview with the guy who's developing it. I can't find it now but it was at the time they announced it. The game is a  Magic: the gathering style collectable card game apparently, but as a video game. But get this, the game will come with some cards unlocked, but you'll be able to buy more virtual cards via DLC. INCLUDING THE POWERFUL ONES. So in other words, if you want to compete with people in multiplayer the only way you'll be able to do so is by spending more money buying the decent cards via DLC. They didn't say, but it wouldn't even surprise me if the card packs you download had random cards like other collectable card games meaning you had to spend more to get rare cards.

Like I say, it'll probably be depressingly successful.","1301618386"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I never finished college despite 3 half-assed attempts. I worked at a school where everyone had at least a bachelor's. One day in the lunch room my best friend was ranking on an intern and said something like, ""She doesn't even have a college education and she's acting superior?"" Crushed me, not because of what he had said but because it affirmed  my position as low man on the totem pole.

Fast forward. I was 33, baby on the way. My (college educated) wife declared that she wanted to be a stay-at-home mom which I would have loved to have been able to provide. At that moment I realized that my persistent laziness meant that she would have to carry me as well as the baby.

I went back to school on weekends, busted my ass. Many nights I had baby in the rocker next to me while I did my school work, all the while thinking, ""This would have been a lot easier 15 years ago"". I finished my degree, got my master's in straight sets, and now I make a good living. I made my last student loan payment last year, when I was 46 years old.

It scares me to think about what would have happened if I never went back. That baby is now 14 and fucking up his chances at college. He knows my story but, you know, 14.

So, unless you're 14, get your fucking degree. Now.","1301618394"

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","&gt;I can't think of a good reason for using __call for a single function or variable

You absolutely wouldn't use \__call in this way, it's just an example to illustrate my point. 

My actual use case was in an ActiveRecord implementation - using \__call to catch and handle methods that essentially do the same thing but have modifiers such as `Distinct` or `Ignore`, e.g.

    selectDistinct()
    selectDistinctColumn($column, ..)
    selectAll()
    selectOne()
    select()

or

    insert()
    replace()
    insertIgnore()
    replaceIgnore()

Methods like `where()`, `from()`, `groupBy()` etc. are hard-coded

My argument is highlighted when you accidentally call `insret()`. If my active record implementation hardcoded all of the method variations then it would be an error: ""*Call to unknown method `insret()` ...*""

As with any good abstraction, the user should be unaware of the implementation details and rely solely on the interface. Why should the implementation that uses magic methods behave any differently? Both should be an error.","1301618404"

From there I worked various jobs in the industry, everything from custom front doorways to cabinets and furniture. Eventually I just got bored with building uncreative pieces for people with no appreciation for wood or furniture. From there I found a vocational school specializing in furniture making. Did a 9 month intensive, followed that up with some time as an artist in residence. Found a co-op studio space to work out of....here I am.

I'm a normal guy"", your other photos should be saying ""hey, I can have fun"". If it looks like you've taken them yourself, it says neither.

Whilst it's possibly to pull off the old man hat, it's going to be a hard first impression to sell and you're better off without it.

In terms of the written content (I'm only going to point out the bad stuff because it's late and I'm tired :P):

My Personal Summary - Don't open by suggesting that you're indecisive. Also try to avoid labelling yourself so much, if you want to let people know you're smart then do so by writing a (slightly) high-brow profile. Basically don't say, demonstrate. Don't talk about things you don't like, it just comes across as negative. Don't put conditions on things you like doing as in the last paragraph.

What I'm Doing With My Life - Don't talk about the person you want to be unless you can also demonstrate you're on track to achieve it. Otherwise it just makes you sound dissatisfied which isn't attractive. Mental illness *is* fascinating, I suffer from depression myself, but you really don't want to be making any mention of it on a dating profile.

I'm Really Good At - Stick with just the first bit about milk/cereal, otherwise try and think of something more substantial, more funny things are fine too. Saying you can hold a conversation with people really isn't the kind of thing you should need to be saying about yourself.

The First Things People Usually Notice About Me - Youthful looks is a plus, but you manage to turn it into a negative. Limited self-deprecating humour is perfectly fine in the real world, but risky on a dating profile. Maybe think of something completely different here.

Favourite books etc - I'm uncertain on this bit myself so I can't offer anything

The six things I could never do without - Don't say you hate the question, you might be better off leaving it blank for now if you're stuck for ideas.

I spend a lot of time thinking about - It's certainly an interesting answer, I don't know if saying you talk too much is going to be perceived as a plus though.

On a typical friday night... - I actually like your answer for this, it was so unexpected that it got a good chuckle out of me

You should message me if - You're being quite limiting to interested ladies here :p


Obviously others may disagree with me, I'm quite new to this feedback lark.

"technology","t5_2qh16","This is a **perfect** example of why I prefer /r/netsec for this kind of stuff, albeit at a much slower pace of new content (and filled with a lot of duds). Day by day I see Reddit become just as ignorant and quick to accept unvalidated, sensationalistic information as any FOX/MSNBC viewer. What really makes me laugh, though, is how high of a horse Reddit seems to have. Well, that's the impression I get from all the anti-FOX news posts that imply one knows better.

Here's the tip of the day: information isn't to be taken with or without a grain of salt depending on the source. FOX could have an incredibly true story and (obviously) NetworkWorld could publish 2 incredibly stupid, incorrect stories.

**Anybody that wasn't immediately suspect**, turn in your geek card now and never complain about your parents' computer illiteracy. How the *fuck* do you not get suspicious when ONE ""security"" expert uses ONE commercial anti-virus software to find a keylogger with zero follow up (i.e. net traffic analysis, binary analysis, file creation, etc). He didn't even go through the effort of throwing it onto a VMWare image (which takes less than a minute, albeit with its flaws).

I can understand, and I've had guys paranoid I'd leave them for a girl too. It just bugs me that I'm made to feel bad about wanting to look for some fun, as if that makes me less gay or less bisexual because there is a man involved as well.

Some people are going to challenge you and say they don't have mood swings from coffee and they don't get the urge to go pee 4 times in an hour. And that you're embarrassing all coffee drinkers by claiming you get moody and it's just an excuse for you to act out. People who are more optimistic don't have these issues after they drink coffee. Only 5% of people report feeling jittery and so on..
Do you realize how awful that would be to defend? Especially from people who have their own agenda because they must be taken **seriously** and in order to do so they feel they must ""debunk"" anything they feel is making them look silly to others.

After 9 months you will not be playing Chopin. You need to build your technical knowledge and musicianship, you don't have to do grades or exams, but it can be the easiest way to progress, as it's a set curriculum. Talk to your teacher about what you want to play, and set reasonable goals together. Unfortunately, no matter how talented you are, music takes hard work. I've been playing for close to 20 years and I can't play everything! Every piece needs a lot of work, so refer to OnaZ's post about effective practice. 

As it can be gruelling work, have a couple of things you *can* play to play through and enjoy during your practice sessions, it helps to keep morale up. I used to buy sheet music for whatever songs or bands I liked, and learn that on my own time, so I could have things I enjoyed hearing myself play to break up practice sessions.

"ucla","t5_2qscu","Most of the university apartments (and I believe all the undergrad apts) are in the north village, SE of campus. That's the ghetto where most students live and where all the frats are. Everyone walks from there. It takes 15-25 minutes depending on location. There's a shuttle by the graduate student housing that anyone can take, which gets to campus in 15-25 minutes depending on which stop you take and how long you wait before the bus arrives. If you're one of the 25-minute-walk people you probably live near the shuttle. 

5 miles south of campus basically makes you a commuter. Lots of people live in Culver City because rent is a little less.

Live on campus. That's how you'll meet people. I think UCLA houses transfers in the same area. Living in a triple with shared bath is cool unless you're an antisocial dickwad who ""needs my own space."" You'd be sharing the bath with 5 other people. Out of the 6 of you, at least 2 people will be cool and become friends. If you're really lucky, all 6 of you will be awesome and you'll have your bffs with you all the time. If you're an asshat then 2-5 of the people you live with will become friends and you'll be laying in bed watching John Cusack movies on your laptop for the remainder of the year.

Or maybe you think ""But I don't want to be grouped with just transfers because then I won't meet anyone else!"" Sorta true. Most of the 2nd-4th years who came in as freshman already have their group of friends and aren't overly interested in making new friends unless you're uber hott, because everyone wants to be friends with hott people, but they're not really your friends because they don't appreciate you for your personality or your awesome John Cusack memorabilia collection. Most transfers arrive with 0-1 friends, so they'll pretend to admire your baggy filled with John's hair and perhaps find you to be quirky instead of psycho. I'm not saying you won't make friend's with non-transfers, but it's harder to make friends by breaking your way into a group of friends than it is if you're part of friendship-genesis. Freshman are also interested in making friends, and maybe it'd work out for yuo because you just came from HS2 and they came from HS1, but you'll probably turn 21 soon and freshmen can't get into bars because of the [PATRIOT cat.](http://i.imgur.com/KndU0.jpg)

Most transfers get a triple w/ shared bath because most of the continuing students nabbed up all the doubles before UCLA considered you to be anything more than an easy $60 and a rejection letter.

To get a single room you need to request it and hope. The hardest part about getting a single is coming to terms with the fact that you're a loner and so was Hitler. But you're like ""Nah dog, I just need privacy so I can [get some pussy!](http://i.imgur.com/HKl3S.jpg)

Or, ""I'm a fatty w/ manboobs and I'm self conscious!"" You'll be living with people of the same sex and they won't care about your gut apron. ""oh no! Maybe one of them will be gay!"" That's cool too because gay roommates are just secret admirers, and everyone likes those. He'll stare at you and masturbate while you sleep, but you won't know because you'll be sleeping and ignorance is bliss.

Maybe you're thinking ""Why is this guy being such a dick? I just want to know how to get a single because my religion demands modesty and I don't want people to see me nakey!"" **God doesn't exist.**

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","I'm gonna go ahead and play Devil's Advocate on this - while I sympathize with Nightend and I do wish the situation had been different... I can't really hold a grudge against the NASL over it.

It is clear they're (Xeris?) grasping at straws over this, which is kind of amusing to me, but there's an old saying I still feel holds true.

*Necessity is the mother of all invention.*

What this means is when someone needs something, they will find a way to solve the problem and devise a solution.  Whether it is software development or managing a high end tournament, it is very much an iterative process.

You do your best and along the way you will make mistakes.  You figure out what went right and what went wrong, then decide how to improve the situation with the next time.

The unfortunate situation for Nightend was that he was deemed ""high risk"" on the back end as someone who might be a no-show due to international travel and immigration laws that require official paperwork.  NASL didn't mention it and Nightend didn't know it, but I don't think either of them took this into account because they didn't know it would be a problem until it was.

I have a hard time believing that NASL anticipated this issue beforehand and would use this as a way to cherry pick their personal favorites, or whatever favoritism might be construed of this article.  This was probably a ""bug"" that got ""shipped"", so to speak, so... why crucify the NASL over it?

The truth of the situation is StarCraft 2 needs a bigger, better pro scene in North America to continue its growth.  The NASL was born to be a solution to this problem.  The production of it still hasn't even happened yet, so I don't think now is the time to start ""rebelling"" against the NASL because something slipped through the cracks.

Even the GSL, a StarCraft tournament that is widely regarded as the most professional, high-end organization, has a poor solution for sound proofing the player's matches.  (They have a wooden box at the studio and play the StarCraft music loudly through the player's headphones - hardly ""sound proof"", as evidenced by Jinro vs Idra last season)

This isn't the time to start casting doubt and turning against the NASL.  This situation sucks, but we must be reasonable and walk a mile in their shoes.  They're going to make mistakes, and if they become any good at this, those mistakes will see resolution as the production crew get experience underneath their belts.

Now if Nightend is excluded from the NASL next season, even after having proven his Visa issue is a non-issue, then that's a red flag.  But I can't foresee this being an issue in the future as now we know.  And knowing is half the battle.","1301618489"

In terms of IS in general, I think the future is looking good. I am anticipating:

-Hardware playing a much larger role, particularly TPMs.

-Two factor authentication mechanisms becoming widespread, ubiquitous even.

-More formal methods slipping out of academia and into industry as the results become more practical.

-A greater interest in investing in security upfront as the case for secure development lifecycles becomes stronger and stronger (one example: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sdl/archive/2011/03/30/for-your-consideration-the-sdl-progress-report.aspx).

-More advanced sandboxing for highly targeted applications (e.g. anything made by Adobe Systems).

-At a minimum, the beginnings of the replacement of the broken PKI system we rely on for SSL.

-and on and on and on...

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Look at it from the other perspective then, should I have to sync multiple gigs of data to get the latest code? Should I not be able to use distributed development for code because data needs centralized locking?

Data doesn't need centralized locking. The only reason we're even talking about two systems is because the current DVCSes don't handle large files well.

And yes, if you want to test your code, having *all the source* there is very handy. You're suggesting something kin to having some of the .cc files in one repo and some of the .cc files in another repo because for some reason your VCS doesn't work on them.

&gt; They're fundamentally different and need different kinds of revision control.

They're fundamentally identical. It's source that needs to be versioned and tracked and committed atomically. The fact that some of it is text .cc files and some of it is .psds is irrelevant - it's all source.

Imagine you were writing the Linux kernel. Imagine someone came up to you and said you could use a DVCS for everything except the drivers and part of the memory allocator, and a conventional VCS for the rest of it, *or* you could use a single conventional VCS for the entire thing. Which would you choose? Personally I'd go with a single unified VCS - splitting the source into two areas is just going to be a nightmare.","1301618503"

Grocery store pickups were really hard for me more than bartenders / waitresses especially because you only have a couple minutes to make an impression and other customers will be annoyed with having to wait if you try to chat her up.  Out of probably 15 or so grocery store cashiers I've hit on in the last 5 years (I've lived a lot of places) I've only had success twice.  Most of the time, they were in h.s.  Also, my girlfriend in h.s. worked at a grocery store and she would tell me about how all the guys hit on her so they get it a LOT.  Usually it's old men hitting on them so you have a slight advantage.

I remember being successful with a 19 year old girl when I was 22.  I was a regular so she knew me and I built up the attraction/comfort through each 3 minute interaction over the course of 5 months.  I never hit on her but would say one or two things and always make her laugh or let her see me making other cashiers laugh when I went to a different line.  I gamed the whole damn store for months hoping they'd talk about me amongst themselves.  It was a lot of time a commitment when you don't even know if she's single, of age, etc.  Luckily, that's just my personality so it wasn't so bad. :)

One day I spotted IOIs when she noticed I walked in - she saw me come in and head for the produce without realizing I was watching through my peripherals.  She tossed her hair and gave me the ""I'm casually cool, looking hot so check out my ass"" backturn so I knew it was ripe to ask for a phone number once I got to the checkout.  When I got to her line, there was one person behind me but I thought ""Fuck it. I'm game that old dude behind me too.""

I started telling her a story of what had just happened to me (true story) and spoke loud enough and positioned myself to slightly acknowledge the guy behind me.  ""Merging"" strangers into the convo helps with the general awkwardness of hitting on someone in public.

The store had just reorganized so I asked one of the older ladies stocking the shelves where the condiments were.  She was prehistoric old so she looked shocked and surprised and said they were up at front by the pharmacy.  Old lady thought I said ""condoms"" so we had a good laugh.  Cashier told me how funny that old lady is, I said old people are cute, she agreed, I said ""Yeah it's so unfair but you're alright too.  (smirk) Let's get that coffee this Saturday.""  I purposely tried to word it like we were old friends so it wouldn't seem awkward with the stranger old guy behind me.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Exactly. In under two decades, we've reinvented how people interact. 

In five minutes, you can have the world's opinion or a Yugoslavian refugee working as a waiter in London's opinion. Both with the same amount of effort, both with the same amount of data received, both with a level of intimacy that you wouldn't get on any other medium.

You can, at any point, find anyone anywhere to talk about any topic. Broadcast that thread and suddenly you've got /r/askscience and fifteen thousand people discussing that topic. The same forum, the same topic, hundreds of different opinions and the ability to zoom in on any one of them and elaborate on it. 

The language barrier is gone. I can get near-real time translation, and translation that's accurate enough to deduce what's being said, regardless of the level of complexity or number of people speaking in that language. If you have ten thousand people reading Hamlet and two people talking in Afrikaans about footie, both are just as easy to read.

Now every voice is simultaneously the world's largest megaphone and the world's faintest whisper. I'm talking with you about the nature of the internet, a comment that you're likely the only one to ever read, while at the same time talking about peanut butter lids in a thread that 600 people have upvoted and that tens of thousands have likely read. Beyond that, I have threads up for single people, tens of people, hundreds of people, and thousands of people to view and respond to.

I'm rambling. Bless the internet. ","1301618527"

So much of naive ev psych (including published material!) reasons something like this: 1) Behavior X is found in chimps. 2) Behavior X is found in my students seeking a lab credit in Psych 101. 3) Therefore behavior X was handed down from chimps. All the while never pulling their heads out of their disciplinary asses long enough to find that behavior X: 1) doesn't exist in other cultures; 2) doesn't exist in this culture if you actually look back in history; 3) actually doesn't even exist in the present culture if you do your research right. 

My other complaint is actually exactly what OP wrote: that biology and culture are ""very separate entities."" That's the exact attitude that leads to this kind of shit research.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","I think incorporating religious dogma as a method of ending an authoritarian system is not a beneficial idea and could possibly even hinder the process.

However, that is because for the circumstances, religious dogma does not have anything to offer. It's like asking if a calculus problem could be solved with poetry. 

I think it's quite a stretch to claim that all religions believe themselves to be an integrate part of the entire world religious people. That's saying that everyone who is not agnostic or atheist believes in the same things.

While I don't disagree with your main point concerning your view on the original post, I do disagree with your reasoning.

Demonizing religion in a situation where there is no effect formed by religion is a dead-end argument. It's not religion that's causing the inability to solve world problems. Religion is a concrete manifestation of ideological separation, which exists at all levels of society. Again, it's making the separation extreme that's the problem.

Most religious people are fairly ideologically repressed. This repression is formed by the people who claim not that religion is useless to a specific task but instead claim that religion actually hinders these tasks. While in some instances it is true that religion itself may hinder a development, it is almost never the case. 

The ideological separation actually triggers a similar response in the religions, who otherwise would not have had a say in the matter. By forming a distinction like this, and separating those who are religious from those who are not, the ideas of the religious bodies often become more distinct and self-serving to those considered members of the group.

The medical profession, just like any profession, functions based on using methods that have worked the most frequently in the past. While prayer is not a common choice, as there is little objective evidence to show that prayer is a reliable remedy for a malady, there are some institutions who cater to those who seek alternative forms of healthcare. 

That follows the same point, that religion itself, or concrete spiritual beliefs shared by a group of individuals, is not always a pragmatic solution. I do not understand the generic demonization of religion. I do understand the act of refraining from considering religion as a solution to certain problems because of its historical inability to solve problems which it has not been able to solve prior.","1301618564"

Yes, there are sure to be a large majority of the Muslim population who do not wish for the spread of Sharia, at least not openly. The issue is that it seems like in almost all cases regarding religion, there is a pattern in which extreme religion uses moderate religion as cover, only to pop back up and push a new edge. What he may be trying to say is that simply by increasing populations in cultural centers they are creating a mass public that is easily assuaged of the need for Sharia (or some other random religious ridiculousness). This is one of the primary reasons I dislike religion so much. It creates easily herd-able sheep.

No, it's the issue - the difference - is nontrivial - but how humanists define humanist and how atheists define atheism are *easy* to find. Finding out the difference - that's trivial.

Atheism is absence of belief in gods. 

Humanism is a set of principles and beliefs that don't mention gods at all.

Humanism is not dependent on atheism, and vice versa. Some atheists are humanists, some atheists aren't. Some humanists are atheists, some humanists aren't.

It's like being bald *and* a wearer of underpants. Bald is an absence of hair, and underpants are for keeping your genitalia from rubbing all over your clothes.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Your best bet, regardless of what you want to pursue after your literature degree, is to rape every single mark you can. Everybody knows that people fuck up in their first and second years of university, and it's your upper year marks that indicate whether you're suited to pursue further studies or not. If you have serious blemishes early on, but have great marks at the end, you have a chance.

BUT... you also need to have professors willing to vouch for your ability. Reference letters are essentially a way of letting your professors communicate to the admissions committee whether you're a hard worker, naturally intelligent, or just average. 

As for choosing referees, definitely pick profs related to the field you're applying for. But if you don't have enough (3 is usually the common number), then fill the empty spots with your best profs. Considering you're talking about applying into a sciences degree from a humanities degree, you have to prove you can do the relevant work.","1301618605"

"reddit.com","t5_6","To expound a bit on C) from my reply to Indyhouse: isn't there something great about life's little ironies? PETA contracts a company for a service. Company's CEO apparently loves killing some of the most intelligent and emotional animals on the planet (and videotaping it). PETA doesn't know this until he posts a video of such an action. Now PETA, being very principled, decides to move their business away. But they can't ""unregister"" their domain with GoDaddy. They've got to wait it out.

PETA has been forced to become pragmatic, and I find it both a fascinating illustration of the dangers of ideology and, you know, pretty funny. PETA has probably been far more pragmatic in their dealings than they even realize (for example, who knows what the CEO of their webhosting service does to baby seals).

Scott Adams (who can be hit or miss, I admit, but always thoughtful) did [a nice little piece](http://www.dilbert.com/blog/entry/principled_or_stupid/) on principles in general, and I find it especially relevant in light of PETA's unforeseen (and I daresay unforeseeable) snafu.

TL;DR Elephant murderers + PETA = forced pragmatism.","1301618608"

&gt;While most absinthe on the market is based on a neutral spirit, the Leopold Brothers import Pisco (a peruvian grape based brandy) and age it in barrels before distilling it with the botanicals.

So apparently the barrels *aren't* ""absinthe barrels"" per se, but rather barrels used to age pisco which eventually becomes absinthe. So I guess the anise/fennel flavor wouldn't even be present in the barrels. I've actually had pisco before. I wasn't a fan, but I didn't find it terribly objectionable either. Just sort of sweet, and really not very flavorful. I sort of wonder if these barrels would impart any discernible flavor which a plain oak barrel wouldn't.

At any rate, an imperial stout with absinthe flavoring in it sounds absolutely disgusting to me.","1301618618"

It was business that pushed hard to shift away from defined benefit pension plans, posing defined contribution plans as the substitute.

My point is simply that it's impossible to attribute passive investing to government interference in the holy marketplace. If there was ever a wall between business and government, it vanished with the advent of obscenely expensive televised political campaigns that only business can fund. Passive investing was the market's way to accomplish one purpose--destroying the pension system--and now the market is simply dealing with that decision's unforeseen effects.","1301618628"

"sports","t5_2qgzy","&gt;With that said, no my points about the Mets being seen as a joke in markets completely outside of New York has more to do with losing their must-win final game of the season two years in a row, losing a game on a dropped pop out, etc. then it has to do with the poor-me attitude of far too many Mets fans.

2007 was about more than a must-win final game, it was a final 2 1/2 weeks in which they lost something like 15 of 18 games.

2008 was a lot different -- they really had a team that didn't even deserve to be on the same field with the Phillies, then toward the end of the season they lost Wagner.  And even with that, with a bullpen stuck together by spit and duct tape, they made it to the last day with a chance to win.  I thought it showed a lot of heart, despite losing.  But then again, we actually follow them for 162 games -- as opposed to listening to anti-Mets sound bites on ESPN, which is what people ""in markets outside of New York"" are basing their opinions on.

I think the quality of sports reporting has declined so far in the past 20 years, thanks to sports talk radio and ESPN, that any time a team comes close and doesn't win, it's a choke; just like any time a reliever fails to close a big game, or a hitter doesn't get a hit in a big game, he has some kind of mental problem.  Just a shitty, lame-ass way to approach sports analysis.","1301618661"

Another slot in ad agencies you seem to be overlooking is media buyer. They buy the television time, or newspapers pages, or web eyeballs. They have to be able to run the numbers, demonstrate to the client that this placement is more efficient than that one. They also have to have negotiating skills, because it is their job to talk down the media companies rates.

Media team tends to work longer hours than the rest, but they get the most perks. Because the people they are buying from are always trying to ""thank"" them, with tickets to sports games, or taking them out drinking, or even on cruises.

If you've primary skillset is talking, I'd recommend client handling, account executive path. Their primary job is figuring out what the client wants and can afford, and then clarifying that to the creative team. It doesn't sound pleasant, but most people I know who do it, like it.

If you look at the past updates on the forum, he's been complaining about the fucking 2GB memory limit of his 32-bit DAW for the last 3 years at least. And I think that was 2 computers ago. On an update within the last 6 months, he stated that he got an advance from the studio to buy new computer equipment. Honestly I think he's just blowing smoke. I built a 64-bit DAW 5 years ago for under $1,000, and even with 5 year old technology I could handle 50 tracks with plenty of VST's at 192 khz, 24 bit recording.

I just bought a PC for my Dad from CostCo for $500 (64-bit even!) that far exceeds the specs of that DAW I built 5 years ago. Throw a firewire audio interface on it, and bam, instant DAW.

Basically, I see two options. One, he's such a control freak that he needs to be 100% responsible for every aspect of the project, AND he is totally incompetent with computers.

Or Two, he's just lying about the whole thing, doesn't have any material, is stringing his label along for cash, and he will end up cancelling all his shows like he did last year.","1301618699"

What courts?  Government courts or non-government courts?

&gt;Given that, why do you think it's OK to go the extra judicial route in the case of this sign holder?

The sign holder that was aiding the murderers?  I was okay with force being used to apprehend and prevent his aid of ongoing murders.  Once that has been done, in an anarcho-capitalist society he would probably be charged in a private court and the proceeding from there would not be extra-judicial.

&gt;I'd also love to know what we're supposed to do if one party fails to agree with the decision of an arbitrator, or why one would expect any rational person to go to an arbitrator for a crime which would require a large portion of their property or their freedom as recompense.

Glad to hear that you're interested.  [*Machinery of Freedom*](http://daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf), [*Practical Anarchy*](http://www.freedomainradio.com/FreeBooks/PracticalAnarchy.aspx), and [*For a New Liberty*](http://mises.org/rothbard/newlibertywhole.asp) put forth some good answers.  I highly recommend those books.  If you're left wanting more perspectives, there's also [*Chaos Theory*](http://mises.org/resources/3088), and [*The Market for Liberty*](http://freekeene.com/files/marketforliberty.pdf).  Every book I've mentioned is freely available online.

&gt;But if there was he would be. So it would be justifiable to beat up/restrain this man if I discovered that one of the drivers he was warning was in fact drunk, yes?

No.  Drunk driving is not initiating coercion against anyone and thus coercion is not a moral response.  However, if the drunk driver was driving on a private road where drunk driving was prohibited, the drunk driver would be guilty of trespassing and it would be permissible to use force against him if it was necessary to get him to leave.

&gt;Could you please show me some numbers that demonstrate these claims? I don't think it's a misconception at all.

Numbers that demonstrate that libertarian is widely misunderstood?  Numbers that demonstrate that many people don't know stuff about libertarianism?  Numbers that demonstrate that something is a understandable misconception?  I don't know how numbers could demonstrate such things, except maybe the results of a widely distributed quiz on libertarianism?","1301618729"

In the IPv6 address space, take each one of these 4.2G addresses of the Internet and put an entire Internet into it. Yes, basically each of 4.2G addresses expand to more 4.2G addresses, making a total of 4.2G × 4.2G. But wait, this is still not the size of IPv6...

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I've never seen that work from Duchamp, kind of cool (and creepy, the figure is made from pig skin). I agree that artists aren't obliged to follow trends, and that makes me really want to see the students game on the internet, because it is a new way to experience art, and having it accessible to everyone on the internet would be unique. I feel that by having it stuck in a gallery, it diminishes the game's intent of being art based in a new media, video games. Also art use to be presented to a large audience. Up until the late Renaissance, art was usually a public object, either found in churches or placed outside. For example, Michelangelo's David was placed outside the Palazzo Vecchio where everyone could see it. I guess what I am arguing is that this is a new type of art, and it shouldn't be thought of the same way as something like a sculpture. Also, the student could really get his name out there if he put the game on the internet, a lot more people would see it, and he could potentially make some money or get a good job through this, but he is limiting himself.","1301618758"

I'm happy to expand on this. Privatisation of prisons has been going on for decades, and is working extraordinarily well.

You have to understand that the prison has very little control over the length of stay of the prisoner, for obvious reasons.

The one metric that really matters is reducing re-offence; if private contractors manage to do this while maintaining health standards, they're doing better than the government has, and providing financial incentives simplifies central administration significantly. Having worked first hand with all grades of offender, this is something I would love to see introduced.

Movies have just in the last 5 years or so started using [Global Illumination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_illumination) as a standard lighting method.  However, all graphics render engines used in Hollywood use cheats at recreating the real world light transport through a scene, and not perfectly modeling it.

Software can now simulate real world physics pretty well, but it cannot capture every nuance of the real world.

Now, that is not to say you can't create some VERY realistic visual effects shots.  There have been and will continue to be shots that look 100% real, even 50 years from now.  Shots to me aren't simply a matter of ""look good for the time"".  They either look real, or they don't.  

There are shots in Avatar that look 100% real, and they will look just as real 20 years from now.  However, there are also shots in Avatar that look fake, and always will, even if they are ""good"" by today's standards.  I'm not saying anything against the artists that worked on it, sometimes you just run out of time, and you have to deliever the shot even if you'd like to take more time to make it look more real.","1301618780"

In the inf file, there are 4 sections that basically list the hardware ID's. The list is the same for all 4 of them. The sections starts with a commented line with the "";"" character. I belive they say ""bluetooth (something) x86"", ""controller (something) x64"".

Basically, you copy any one line with a hardware ID, paste it to the bottom of the list. Then change the last part to your current BT hardware ID.

"spain","t5_2qhd6","I lived in Spain for a year and used Yoigo for phone/texting but not internet, but they were by far the cheapest that I looked at. I just checked their website and it looks like they offer 3G for 3 euro/day (3.54 after fees) up to 100MB per day.

If you go [here](http://www.yoigo.com/tarifas/internet_para_llevar.php) and click on the ""Tarjeta"" tab, it gives you the details. The terms essentially say:

&gt; Doesn't include phone, text, or roaming

&gt; No P2P or VOIP

&gt; Fees use calendar days, mainland time between 12:01am and 11:59pm

&gt; If you have any problems click on the links there 


If you need to know what anything else on the website says you can ask, if I'm not around to respond I'm sure someone else will be.

Other companies that I know of in Spain are Vodafone and Orange, you could look into them too. I'm pretty sure their sites are in English.

Edit: Just checked again and there are no fees with them on the Canary Islands so while you're there it will be 3 euro/day, not the 3.54.","1301618786"

That is your problem. It is incredibly tough on friendships to try to be roommates. I'd advice moving to your own place. Especially because you are a couple living with a third wheel. I'm a bit surprised that situation worked at all, much less this long.

I tried rooming with a best friend from when I was younger and had to move out after 3 months. That is a lot of stress to put on a friendship. After the initial blow up of the move out, it took a few months to heal. Now we talk again and are at least capable of spending time together.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; child ""inherits"" the father's sect. This child is then seen as 100% a member of that sect, there are no ""halflings"" in Islamic sects.

Does that mean the child in inter-sect marriage also inherits father's last name (like it's fairly common in ""West"")? That would have the side effect of mapping last name to sect.

Hypothetical question: is conversion from Shia/Sunni to Wahhabi, or a Saudi Wahhabi man marrying Shia/Sunni woman ""better"" than converting to another ""heavenly book"" (e.g. Christianity)? I'm asking because Shia/Sunni and Wahhabi do not exactly ""like each other"" (from what I've read; though the ""dissonance"" is understandable)

&gt; Converting within Islamic sects is frowned upon and generally viewed in distaste, but is much much more favorable than converting from Islam to another ""heavenly book"" religion (Christianity and Judaism) and EXTREMELY heavily favored over converting to anything else (especially atheism).

People are generally afraid of change to something they don't understand and religion is not the true reason. I live in one of the [most atheist countries in the world](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Religion_in_the_Czech_Republic#Religion). Reasons for conflict are just different - substitute religion for communism or any other ideology - equation stays the same.

The point I am trying to make, it does not matter whether it is officially called Shia vs Sunni, Christians vs Muslims, leftwing vs rightwing vs communists vs neonazis... The *""fear of difference"" is exploited* to turn some groups against others which is the standard modus operandi to keep general population not deal with what's really going on in politics.

(I have to admit I have been teargassed only once at a legal action in the last couple of years, so it's not nowhere near Bahrain's level - ""developed regimes"" just get smarter about crowd/damage control and intelligence operations.)","1301618805"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","C# is a really nice language to code in; it makes it very easy to use ideas from functional programming languages.

In functional programming languages, there is often a function called `map`. `map` takes a collection of items (e.g., an array) and a function as arguments and applies the function to every item in the array. For example, in Haskell I can write `map (*2) [1..5]` and it returns `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`.

Collections in .NET don't have map built-in. While you could use a LINQ query, let's say you wanted to write a map function yourself. This is all it takes:

    static IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; Map&lt;T, U&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; sequence, Func&lt;T, U&gt; f)
    {
        foreach (var el in sequence)
        {
            yield return f(t);
        }
    }

Then to use it: `someArray.Map(val =&gt; val * 2)`

I chose this example because it highlights three neat things that C# can do easily that Java can't. The first is *extension methods*. An extension methods let you add methods to a class without overriding it. As far as I can tell, it's just a bit of syntactic sugar (`someArray.Map(val =&gt; val * 2)` instead of `Map(someArray, val =&gt; val * 2)`. The second is the *yield* keyword, which a) makes writing iterators easy and b) makes it pretty trivial to do *lazy evaluation* (lazy evaluation means that a value isn't calculated until needed). The third thing that I find real nice about it is making real easy to write lambdas/anonymous functions. Java can do it (and Google's wonderful Guava libraries make it pretty easy), it's not as clean or as elegant as having language-level support.

As far as which language to learn, start with C. You're learning Visual Basic, so you have a grasp on a high-level language and the fundamental concepts of programming. Learning C lets you get closer to metal; there is a much closer relationship between what you code and what the computer is actually doing under the hood (e.g., memory allocation). 

Another language that I like (as do many other people on reddit) is Python. Python has a lot of wonderful little, intuitive things that takes away a lot of the drudgery that you can get with other languages.

Earlier, I mentioned functional programming languages. You might want to try picking one of those up. Haskell and Scheme are both good places to start. I'd lean towards Scheme because of the great (and free) [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).

Something to keep in mind: assuming you're learning VB.NET, learning C# should also be not too hard to pick up: the .NET libraries are the same, you just need to remember the new syntax.","1301618807"

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","Scrap everything. The setting is too different in nearly every respect from the original trilogy. The Old Republic should be a distant memory. The backdrop should be the Clone Wars. Perhaps there's an Imperial Republic. The Clone Wars (which have raged for decades now) are a threat large enough to keep the Emperor from total domination (while still forcing the more freedom loving members of the galaxy to work toward the same goals as the Empire).

The Jedi Council doesn't exist. That's old republic hoo-doo. There's no centralized Jedi power structure. It's a belief system and moral code. Individual Jedi travel the universe somewhere between a wandering monk and a marshall in the Old West.

Anakin is a freighter pilot with aspirations to become a great war hero. Freighting's dangerous enough work and he finds himself embroiled in a battle. He's forced to dump his cargo and crash land on a nearby planet/asteroid/macguffin where he sees another ship fall from the sky. He treks out across the jungle/desert/ice to see if there are any survivors. It's a small fightercraft piloted by a brash Jedi named Obi-Wan Kenobi. Kenobi conscripts Anakin and together they use bits of the crashed freighter to repair his fighter.

Some action scenes on the ground. Obi-Wan's knocked out. Anakin takes over the fighter and they escape by the skin of their teeth. Anakin's piloting skills and latent force abilities save their ass in a brilliant space battle. Obi-Wan begins to train him.

Blah blah blah. Throw in some overarching plot about the Emperor slowly taking more power, or some shit. Just no big political scenes. 

In a nutshell, I'd like to have seen the creation of the (nearly) all-human Empire. No little kids. No Naboo. Save the love story arc for the beginning of act 3 and continue it into the second film.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I will tell you how to time it, but before I do that, I will highly recommend NOT having unprotected sex. Please at least use plan B.

A few key concepts
- women are able to get pregnant for about 24-48 hours after they ovulate
- sperm can live for up to 5 days
- women ovulate 14 days before they get their period.

This means you should figure out when your girlfriend gets her period, and count back 14 days. That should be the day she ovulates. Having sex 5 days before this day and 2 days after it is when it is MOST LIKELY for her to get pregnant. If you're really going to have completely unprotected sex, doing it on her period will be the best bet in terms of her not getting pregnant. Hope this helped.","1301618814"

However, it can still function in the song - you could play a B7 as a secondary dominant, you could use it as a subV, set up a quick change with it - you get the point. Think less about the notes in the chord itself and more about the function of the chords and their resolutions - the reason we play crazy chords that aren't in the key is to create tension, to lead the ear away from the tonic so that the ear desires resolution.","1301618816"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Your first sentence is wrong.  You CAN claim a 0% probability of some things without knowing everything.  For example, logical contradictions.  If I pick a number out of a hat of integers, there is NO chance that the number you pick will be both even and not even.  You can make this claim even if you don't know how many numbers are in the hat, whether they are all integers or not, or even if you don't know whether pieces of paper in the hat have letters or numbers written on them.

Now, on to the less trivial mathematical truth, which is what I think the OP refers to.

The set of real numbers is continuous.  The rigorous mathematical definition of continuous can be a little bit confusing for the layperson, and I really don't feel like explaining in terms of epsilons and deltas, so let's just say that a set being continuous basically means that given any two numbers in that set, you can find another number between them (this is actually not sufficient to claim continuity, but it gives you the basic idea).

Anyway, take an interval, let's say the interval from 0 to 1.  As you may know, the numbers in the range of 0 to 1 are infinite.  We can assume any continuous probability distribution with 0 to 1 as our support, but for our example, let's assume a uniform distribution (all numbers between 0 and 1 are equally probable).  If you are to draw a number at random from that interval, the probability that you draw a number less than or equal to 1/2 is 1/2.  The probability that you draw a number less than 1/2 and greater than 1/4 is 1/4.  The probability that you draw a number less than 1/2 but greater than 3/8 is 1/8.  However, the probability that you get EXACTLY 1/2 is 0.

As long as we assume that the possible number of supernatural configurations is a continuous distribution (in as many dimensions as we like), we can safely say that Bob's current religious beliefs have a probability 0 of being correct.

However, if we were to make the claim that, say, Christianity can cover some open interval on that distribution of configurations, then statistically we can't rule out the possibility that there is one definition of Christianity that is completely correct.

That's the problem with the statistical argument; we know nothing about the distribution of supernatural configurations.  All it can tell us is that ""Bob"" is wrong about at least something, but not what he's wrong about, nor how close/far away he is from the truth.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","I thought you might still disagree, I wasn't expecting a Damascene conversion :)  

Obviously I am just going from the English translation but I think the possible translations you offer of ""destroy"" and ""complete"" fit with my interpretation even better than the existing ""abolish"" and ""fulfill"". From what you've said you have knowledge of the 'original' Greek but presumably this sermon would actually have been given in Hebrew or possibly Aramaic. Given multiple translations, lack of contemporary record and potential scribing errors before the gospels were amalgamated and standardised it seems impossible to be truly sure what Jesus really said or meant.  
  
Back to the passage in hand though and sticking to English it seems hard to imagine that anyone listening to that sermon for the first time would get the impression that it's suddenly OK to abandon all their old laws, given to them, after all, by an all-knowing, all-powerful God.  
  
One last thing, as an aside. Do you worry about the intellectual rigour of Christians when interpreting passages such as this? As an atheist I don't have a vested interest in taking this passage in a particular way but for people who want to live by the bible aren't they more likely to value interpretations that make that easier to do or fit their existing viewpoint? Nobody is going to take Matt 5:18 to mean all the old laws are still in effect if that would mean they now have to follow them(and I'm guessing Christians have a less than literal interpretation of passages like Matt 5:29 and Matt5:40).","1301618822"

The final goal is obviously helping people realize the truth of the lack of God through the lack of observable evidence.  I also agree on your point that the issue has nothing to with reasons, one may or may not worship a higher power.

Regardless,  I still believe that this clip from the movie still has a powerful and helpful message.  Religion, especially the modern incarnation of Christianity, have made their God to be an all loving, benevolent God.  So when they are presented with the truth of atheism,  many will refuse to acknowledge this truth because they enjoy the myth of the ""God loves all""  mantra.

With these type of people, it is often a fruitless endeavor to present them with the ""There is no God""  straight on.  It helps to explain what the bible actually says about their God and the true nature in which he is presented.  Through this the contradictions can begin to surface.  If they feel that their god is not what the church is been telling them, it can be easier for them to move onto the harder truths.

TLDR; the ideas in the clip aren't inline with atheism, however it can be useful to show how the bible really presents God/Yahweh.  If the true nature of the Yahweh character is presented, it becomes easier to accept the hard truths that there is no God.","1301618833"

My calves get REALLY tight at mile 3, like someone shook up a bottle of soda and they feel like if you stick them with a pin they'd burst.

I researched forever and it looks like what everyone is mentioning, acute compartment syndrome...kinda...only mine goes away after a few miles. 

Stretching a lot, before and after, and foam rolling helps a bit, icing after.. but not 100%. it will still happen on 3 out of 5 runs. 

I've tried trigger point acupuncture and that helped a little more than stretching/foam rolling...

people have it much worse and need surgery, I think mine is just from overtraining/running too much without being at all athletic before I started running. 

If it makes you feel better I ran a 50 mile ultra marathon 2 weeks ago....the month leading up to it, every run, I'd go numb and calf would blow up tight...leaving me to stop and walk/massage it out. The day of the race, I started feeling that little tingly feeling, and had prepared for it to hurt the next 3 miles or so, but it never did!  

Take it easier, run a bit slower, relax, stretch, ice, roll. ","1301618841"

Each node has a left and right node and whatever data you want it to hold. So something like this:

    public class Node
    {
        Node nLeft = null;
        Node nRight = null;
        int data = null;
        public Node(int data)

No, most traps do not. Cage traps work independently as do stone fall traps and weapon traps. Only the upright spear/spike needs a trigger.

Check your logs.. most likely the enemies are just dodging the rock or aren't injured by it. They have to be manually reloaded after one use (unlike weapon traps) and basically they suck.

Edit: pro-tip. Use cage traps instead of stonefall ones. The cages can be easily made out of wood and capture the enemy instead of damaging it. You can then use the enemy later for combat practice. When you've got some production capabilities later on start making giant trap components for weapon traps (If I recall correctly the giant circular blades are more or less the best for this)","1301618853"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Here's why they're pissed off, Reddit, because apparently a lot of you don't understand why somebody could possibly be offended at something you don't find offensive:

Treating women in this fashion is tied up with old, misogynistic attitudes toward them that were rife for hundreds of years - that they weren't in control of their emotions, that sometimes they deserve to be hit, that they were merely a trophy even to the point of being traded as a commodity.  Having a game where you slap women is a callback to those attitudes.  It'd be like having a game where you shout abuse at gay people or beat black slaves for points and then claiming ""it's all a joke!"".  It's not just objectifying women - it's physically abusing them, and the physical abuse of women is something that happens today far more often than you think.
Capture the Babe doesn't have any artistic merit.  They're not trying to 'say something'.  They're just promoting this old, outdated attitude under the guise of it being funny.  You might not find it offensive personally (probably because you're a white, middle-class male between the ages of 16 and 35 and have never been marginalised in your life), but you must understand that there are people who would.

And don't bother linking to Penny Arcade.  Penny Arcade are not the lone voices of reason in a fucked-up world.  Take a moment and *think for yourself*.  Do you *want* a mode where you hit women?  Is there any reason for you to desire that?  If so, why?  Why is an artless, arbitrary, unfunny multiplayer mode in a game important for you to defend?  This is a difficult issue, and cannot be dismissed by saying ""Well, you can kill people in Call of Duty!""  One counter-example does not bring down an entire argument, and it's worth bearing in mind that the comic is entitled ""One of many possible responses"".  The PA guys are not stupid, and they know it's not as simple as that.

Are women's rights groups correct to demand a ban?  I don't know; probably not.  Do I agree with everything this group says?  I don't know; probably not.  All I'm asking is for you to take a minute and ponder why on earth someone might be offended by a mode where you slap women to get them to 'calm down' and 'stop being hysterical' that exists for no reason other than that men find it funny.","1301618859"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Okay, so I just want to clarify something here, I'm a Mechanical Engineer, graduated from one of the best schools in the US (hey look it is all in my username), so I know a thing or two about energy, work, etc.

**This is really long it will give you a better idea of energy and what constitutes each form it usually takes in the body, but if you don't want to read all of it go to the line break near the end**

Yes, if you are moving quickly, your mass has lots of energy. That doesn't mean you need to consume more energy to stay at that higher energy state.

Your bodies total energy will be stored in various forms namely: kinetic, potential (chemical, elastic, and gravitational) there are more but it wont do any more good explaining those. 

Kinetic is pretty straight forward based on your reference frame `E=.5*m*v^2` where ""m"" is your mass, and ""v"" is your velocity with respect to your reference frame (ground, train, what have you). 

Chemical Potential Energy is where your food intake and fat and muscle stores comes into play, I'm not a biochemist so the exact pathways here are a little less known to me. But as you alluded to earlier TEF is basically your bodies efficiency to turn one form of energy into another, so for your protein example, it is roughly 80% efficient in turning protein calories into usable energy, those other 20% still exist, but will be exhaled or transferred by some means to waste heat, thus the ""thermic"" portion of TEF. 

Elastic Potential Energy will be any part of your body that is under load and wants to go back to its rest state. So lets take the bottom of straight legged deadlifts. Your hamstrings and their associated tendons are elongated and want to go back to a neutral state so they would have a higher elastic potential energy than in their rest state. The equation for this is `E=.5*k*x^2` where ""k"" is the spring constant of whatever is being stretched and x is the distance from equilibrium the spring has been stretched. You may ask, ""well if I stretch something out and back again I've done no work"", while indeed the total change in energy is 0, you have done work, the energy you transferred into the object has just become a different form of energy namely heat. Do this, take a thick rubber band, stretch it out and back again 50 times, place it on your upper lip, it will have be warm.

Gravitational Potential Energy is another ""relative"" state of energy based upon your reference frame. The formula for this is `E=m*g*h` where ""m"" is again your mass, ""g"" is the acceleration do to gravity, and ""h"" is the the height of your center of gravity above your reference frame. I've already gone into an example of this one.

So if you add up all of those, you have your body's total Internal Energy at a given instant. If no forces or other forms of energy transfer are done to your body, your body would stay at this energy state for ever, period. This of course doesn't happen in the real world, your body is constantly transferring heat to its surroundings, perspiring, inhaling, exhaling, excreting waste, etc. But that energy has to come from somewhere and go to somewhere.

To increase your internal energy, you either have to intake energy, humans do this mostly by taking in food, or have work done to your body.

Lets say your body weighs 100kg, you are in a high speed train, but it isn't moving, your total internal energy is 1,000,000 joules (yes, I pulled that number out of my ass). The train speeds up to 100 m/s (220 mph), your body is now at `1,000,000+.5*m*v^2` joules which is 1,500,000 joules (side note, I love the metric system for their ease of units). Again your body will stay at this level of energy unless something acts on it, you don't need to consume more energy just because you are at a higher state of energy, the train put you there on its own the energy is spent by the train, not you. For your 20 story building example, you either spent the calories to put yourself up at 20 stories or an elevator did work to your body to put you at the higher energy state, you don't need to do anything after you are already there to stay there.

To decrease your internal energy, you have to either do work on something else, in our train example you are traveling at 100 m/s your internal energy is sitting at 1,500,000 joules, you slow down to a stop, your body is back at 1,000,000 joules (this is assuming you haven't transferred heat but again you aren't transferring any more heat than if you were sitting still in your dinning room just because you are going 100 m/s). Those 500,000 joules didn't just disappear, they went from your bodies internal energy and got transferred to the brakes of the train and are now heat.

----

So another way to decrease your total internal energy is to go for a run, lets say you start off with our 1,000,000 joules again. You start running and end up at 4 m/s (9 MPH) your body increased its kinetic energy by 800 joules, so you are at 1,000,800 joules... but wait, where did that energy come from? It started out as chemical potential energy, and ended up as kinetic energy. Lets say your body is 40% efficient at doing this, if it was 100% you wouldn't get hot when running and wouldn't have to sweat since there would be no waste, but there is... and there is a lot of it. So lets start from the beginning you take in carbs your body is only 90% efficient in turning that into fuel. Then your muscles take that fuel and propel you forward at 40% efficiency (made this number up but it is probably close), you end up with a system that is 36% efficient from start to finish. But since I'm assuming you didn't eat while running, it actually took 2200 joules of intake to increase your kinetic energy 800 joules, so your net would be: `1,000,000+800-2000= 998,800`. Lets now say you continue to run at this pace, and you are constantly fighting gravity (since you are pushing slightly up every stride) and friction you would now need more calories than the guy just sitting on his duff all day, because YOU are doing work and expending the energy to fight the forces that are wanting to slow you down. In the train example the train is doing all that for you.

Google has recently been putting a lot of work into making search results localized for people, so it will be very important to be somewhere in the first 3-4 results on Google for searches like ""*your city* construction"" or whatever kind of construction you specialize in. Google webmaster tools can give you this information and more.

"reddit.com","t5_6","We used to treat our athletes like indentured servants, with no guaranteed contracts, signing bonuses, or even healthcare. It did not end well. I can only assume because of your title that much of your frustration is borne out of the current NFL labor-owners dispute. If you want to know who the bad guy in that situation is, read this excellent Bill Simmons [column](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/110304). In the case of football, players are ""whining"" about longer seasons because playing more games would result in a massive increase in injuries, particularly concussions, and the average lifespan of an ex-NFL player is short enough as it is. Read about Dave Duerson, who was so affected by post-concussion syndrome that he arranged for his brain to be studied by concussion specialists, and then shot himself in the heart. Happened this year; absolutely haunting. The League has consistently and deceitfully buried medical research about exactly how brutally damaging the sport of football is on the human body. The players are trying to protect themselves; their official negotiating stance is that they are willing to compromise on revenue sharing, the rookie pay scale, and other economic factors, but they are absolutely committed to keeping the season at its current length and improving health benefits for current and former players. If you want to be mad at a whining, posturing group of people, be mad at NFL owners. And for that matter, owners in other sports aren't exactly angels either.

I can agree with you that perhaps athletes are a bit overpaid, but that's mostly a function of how important the escapism of sports is to American society. If people no longer want or need to see sports, players will no longer be paid so much. But honestly, I believe sports are a lot more important than you think they are, so I have no real problem with these men, who very frequently come from desperately poor backgrounds and are generally charitable with their wealth, earning what they do.","1301618869"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There are 2 scars which make an X on the outside of my left ankle.  Each line is about 3-4 inches long.  

I ""broke"" my ankle after twisting it repeatedly.  The fracture is called an [Avulsion Fracture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avulsion_fracture) which is kinda like a torn ligament, except instead of the ligament tearing, it hangs onto the bone on both ends, and the bone gives out.  I walked on it for about 18 months before it was correctly diagnosed, and fixed.  

After the surgery, my ankle was itchy while it was in the cast, which was odd because I was told it would be scoped.  

They tear open the cast, and I'm staring at this horrible, gross nastyness with stitches and glue and scab.  I ask the doctor, ""What the hell is that?!""  

""Oh, that's your scar.  When we got in there, it was pretty messy, and we had to cut you open, put in some pins and get it right.""

Several Weeks ago, several co-workers and I went to Red Robin, and one of them had the Red Royalty card. He ordered a free appetizer, and we ate it.

After the lunch, he presented the card to the server who informed us that it was past the two week limit, and he couldn't get the appetizer. We were in a hurry, and didn't get a chance to speak to a manager.


On March 31st, my wife and I visited Red Robin for lunch, and I also had this card. I vowed that I wouldn't fall for the same trick.

We asked the waitress *waitress* if she could check the card to see if we were applicable for our free appetizer. She replied ""oh it should be fine"" with a wave of her hand.

We ordered the appetizer, and ate it. At the time of payment, the waitress informed us that we also were not applicable.  We asked to speak to a manager.
The manager *manager* informed us that corporate instituted the Red Royalty program, and that no one really knows anything about it.
She declined to compensate us for the appetizer that we were tricked into buying, and lost a lot of good will in the process. 

Perhaps corporate headquarters should train their employees on the current promotions, and make it easier for customers to know that they are eligible for the benefits of said promotion.

There are lots of places to eat here, and a good number of them don't dupe their customers in this way. I will think twice about suggesting Red Robin as a destination the next time my coworkers and I are debating where to eat.

1. 3"" scar (required 10"" stitches) on forehead from falling out of my high chair as a kid

2. At 5 years old I was running down the hallway while my dog was chasing me. I was looking backwards at my dog the whole time and giggling. Finally I turned my head into as I hit the edge of an open door at full speed. Knocked out cold, woke up in the hospital to 15 stitches - had a nasty concussion and still have a deep 4"" scar that crosses the other one - basically a crucifix on my forehead!

3. At 6, I tripped in the forest and fell face-first onto a branch sticking out from a log. It went through my cheek and into my mouth... cringing thinking about that one!

4. At 8, my friend and I thought it would be a great idea to set up the old steel slide he had in his backyard so that we could go down it and end up in those little plastic wading pools that you play in as a kid. We were having a blast until I decided to do this ""trick"" where I stuck my legs out to the side and then pulled them in at the last second. I managed to get the right leg fully in, but the left foot wasn't all the way in... only 3 out of the 5 toes made it into the pool. I found out at this moment what a giant papercut in between two toes feels like, only with 1mm thick plastic instead of paper. I managed to split the webbing all the way down to the joint - stitches put made my toes the normal length again.

5. A razor sharp lid from a can sliced through my kneecap to the bone while I was walking a garbage bag into the dump (this was before recycling) - 5 stitches...

6. I couldn't find a bottle opener at a cottage so I decided it would be smart to use the edge of some aluminum tubing on an old lawn chair. My aim wasn't so good - I bounced the bottle off the chair and one of the rivets from the bottlecap worked its way 5 inches down the back of my hand, acting as a carrot peeler on my skin. I ended up with a nice 5"" spiral of 1mm thick skin on the ground and a massive groove in the back of my hand..

7. We had some old roman candles at the cottage and decided to shoot them from the hip. I was handed one that had fallen in the lake earlier that day, but had since dried. I guess this completely messed up the insides of it, because instead of the 8 or so balls coming out one at a time, they decided to explode all at the same time. This shot the candle back with such force that the edge of the cardboard tube ripped my skin open through my hoodie and l was left with a scar of the letter C (which was convenient since 2 of my exes had first names that started with C :)

8. A month ago I managed to chop off the tip of my finger and a portion of my nail+nailbed while cutting vegetables. Rest assured that if you do this, it WILL grow back!","1301618890"

That's what I did on [this cabinet](http://i.imgur.com/C1lqy.jpg) which is all MDF except for the face frames and the rail/stiles on the doors (and the crown molding of course).

"reddit.com","t5_6","The problem is that the two statements do NOT rely on the same exact logic. Showing that 1/9 = .111... is a matter of doing long division. It is no different than saying 1/4 = .25, 1/8 = .125, etc. No one would doubt that those fractions could be converted into the corresponding decimal. Get out a piece of paper and do the long hand division if you have to.

But saying that 1 = .999.. is different however. The number 1 can be expressed as the fraction 1/1. If you write out the long division for 1/1, you will get the decimal 1.0, not .999.... That's where a proof is needed, to show that numbers 1.0 and .999... have equal value.

Agreed. Such claims are obviously false.

I don't have any disagreement with you, since you appear to be rationally evaluating new information and ideas.

However, as I already said and proved, feminists have a worldview that is at odds with evo-psych. Thus, they dismiss all of its claims regardless of evidence. That is what I take issue with.

Money is a draw, assuredly. Not having to scrimp and save and watch every expense.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I can understand you disagreeing with my comparison, but I’m going to have to strongly disagree with your logic.
Let’s write it out:

I say: Defacing money is vandalism (A = B)

You say: Vandalism is illegal (B=C).  If we assume that A=B and B=C (as we should), we have to accept that A = C, but we cannot (because you don’t agree with A=B).    So, we cannot conclude that A = C.  

Next, you say that “Defacing money is only illegal when it makes the bill unusable” which is A = D.

So, we have:
A = B (me – defacing money is vandalism)

B = C ( you – vandalism is illegal) – we’re not going to conclude that A = C here, because you don’t agree with my premise.  

A = D (you – defacing money is only illegal when it makes the bill unusable)

In other words: you wish you could go from A (Defacing money) to D (Only illegal when it makes the bill unusable).  Unfortunately, you cannot – it’s logically unsound.

The ""testing"" of his wallet symbolizes the ""test"" that Americans have to go through during the rough economy. Note how he only used on bill in the video instead of many; the single bill reveals that  Americans no longer have enough money for the extras, but just enough to get by. He further emphasizes this by wearing a thin, brandless jacket. 

The fact the currency isn't American is showing our dependence on foreign countries for our deficit and debt, and that if the trend continues, the US dollar can become irrelevant. Him putting it in the wallet and sealing it shows that our fate too might be sealed; it might be too late to reverse the damages done to our economy. 

Also, him not showing his face makes the video a bit more personal. Without an identity, it makes it easier for viewers to see themselves and their own economic problems in the video, adding a nice personal touch.

There is nothing new about genetic selectivity. For centuries, if not millennia, humans have taken seed from their best (healthiest, most productive) plants and used that to plant the next crop. Ditto for animals (animal husbandry). Genetic selectivity in that sense predates discovery of genes and their functions.

To me, genetically modified refers to actual modification of the genes, which is a laboratory process - genetic engineering, the introduction of genes that would not in nature (except perhaps for some freak mutation) find their way into an organism.

At that point the game need only the ability to support any resolution your computer is running, which basically is every game from around 2000 and newer. Only a few games you will run in to that only support the resolutions the game ships with, and even then there are usually work arounds.

I looked at my left foot and saw nothing there but then blood. Then I looked at my right foot. I couldn't see anything through the sheer amount of blood. The medics came up, it took them 10 minutes to slow the bleeding because alcohol thins your blood. Then I could see three holes in my foot.

My bottom teeth jammed straight through my bottom lip. Blood was everywhere. The other kids stared in shock as I stood up shakily, promptly blushed and escaped under the slide in shame.

Recess ended. One of the kids finally pulled a teacher to find my huddled form. She paled as by then I was literally sitting in a puddle of blood, and my face was all bruised and cut up from the sand. She tried to pull me out, and as my mom reported later, I refused, fearing that Ron would gain bragging rights.

Not too bad though, as far as damage. My bottom teeth were destroyed, but they were babies so were minor collateral damage. My lip healed perfectly fine from the outside, and now I just have a weird looking scar if you actually look into my mouth.","1301619023"

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","I still don't see anything convincing re pre marital sex actually being bad (and needing to be banned?).

* STD - solved by education
* Teen pregnancy - again, solved by education and making sex an open subject (some of them actually want the baby, and I agree with you that they probably aren't mature enough for this)
* Teenage girls will get taken advantage of - This is really weak. It's a specific case, and really it's part of life experience. Teenage boys will get taken advantage of as well, just in a different way. Same emotional trauma though. Even platonic relationships are vulnerable to this, e.g. being friends with the rich kid cause he's got all the cool toys.

Are there any positives to waiting?

On the other side I see some positives as: removing the effects of pent up frustration on our actions/emotions; healthy sex is far better for a person than masturbation; sexual compatibility is at least some part of a relationship, so good to find this out; and, well, it's just fun.

Basically, the tiny risk of contracting an STD or getting pregnant while practising safe sex equates to not driving in order to reduce the road toll. Too many deficits, not enough benefits.","1301619051"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; Twice as many complaints by prisoners are upheld at private prisons compared to state prisons.

Could this suggest a difference in the fairness of the complaints procedure between private and gov't run establishments? Yes, it could.

&gt; From an investigation into those 10 state prisons in 2007, 4 scored the lowest rating of any prisons in the country. No private prison got the top grading, which many state prisons did.

This tells us that privately run prisons are never run as badly as state ones.

&gt; But they were a failed experiment. This government is wrong to try and expand them.

The government is right to try and expand them, they are a glowing success, and incentivising reduced re-offence rates is a great idea. The government is wrong to build large prisons distant from families in order to house more prisoners; this only reduces the chances of effective re-introduction to society.","1301619057"

Sims are a way to emulate experiences that I'd otherwise never have- ie., being a combat soldier (I don't kill bugs) or being an Airbus pilot- and realism is the key to a good experience.

Give me every sound, sight, smell, thought, and physical sensation that I'd get in the real thing. Make me get lost in the game, completely absorbed in that character like I get when playing Splinter Cell and only realise that I've been holding my breath to avoid being detected when spots appear. The key to a good simulation isn't bullet physics and fuel consumption- I don't know and don't care how much fuel I have as long as I have it. The key to a good simulation is emulation, and if there's something to simulate pain- or even [make you think you're experiencing pain](http://jp.physoc.org/content/early/2010/02/26/jphysiol.2009.183038.abstract), then it's a step in the right direction.

"reddit.com","t5_6","To those who have failed to ""grasp"" there existentical significance of this video, here it is in short.  

The obvious question one asks when viewing this video is this - how does one test a wallet? The quesiton seems absurd. The reason it is absurd lies in the breaking down of the definition of the ""test"" itself. Implicit in the idea of a test is the suggesiton that, 1) the object of the test has a function 2) the object in quesiton can fail to perform this function 3) it is possible to determine if the object has failed to perform the function through the action of a ""test"". What the tester fails to grasp, in philosophical jargon, however, is that ""existence (of the wallet) preceeds essense (it's function as a container of money)"". As the astute viewer sees clearly, the function of the wallet is implicit in it's form. In his final proclamation, that it ""works"", the tester suggests the existence of some deeper unexplained reality - the idea that the wallet, perhaps, is some sinister technological marvel which may consume the notes put in, or through some defiance of physics cause the notes to fall out from the other end, or something equally senseless to happen. It's clear to the viewer that the wallet is nothing more than a plain wallet, and not a kind of devious ""trick"" - and lacking the reason to believe it is a fake, there is no reason to do so. Therein lies the absurdity - that he fails to grasp that Reality is vastly simpler than he percieves it to be! This is the crux of the video. The viewer looking at this video asks himself a similar quesiton. First: ""What is so special about the wallet that it needs to be tested?"", and ""What is so special about this video?"". The answer to which, to both, - is nothing. Any percieved ""specialness"" derived from the video is purely a projection of the viewer, (as this whole essay is). This generalizes easily. Ask yourself too, the next natural question in the series - ""What is so special about my life?"" The ""Function"" or ""Meaning"" of life, like the wallet, is not in it's existence alone but in it's essense, and therefore the ""search for meaning"" is an endevour no more Syphlian and absurd than the testing the wallet! ""Life is a wallet"", the video suggests, and the poor kid putting the note in is consciousness forcing structure and meaning upon it, in the form of absurd tests, for which only hilarity can result. And yet, do you not too realize that we go through life performing similar ""tests"" in anticipation of something, or in preperation for something to come, and all that, for what? There is no need to test wallet - there is only the need use it. There is no need to test life, there is only the need to live it. Therefore, forget the test, and start living life to the fullest!","1301619064"

"religion","t5_2qh39","that's blatantly misleading. murder is only one small piece of the pie in terms of how violence is expressed by humans (probably the smallest). it completely ignores the countless wars and various other means of violent oppression that takes place in the name of religion.  usually religious people are not killing their fellow citizens in the name of religion, but religious leaders are using it as a justification to commit different acts of violence (wars) against others.

it is my impression that when people say ""religion causes violence"", that they are more often than not, talking about this phenomenon rather than crime rates in countries that consider religion important.  using ""murder rate"" as an ultimate indicator of violence is so cheap. it should have been so incredibly obvious when you wrote the title ""no link between religion and violence"" that your facts could not support this claim.  that makes me think that you were targeting for this specific outcome, because you were so thorough and scientific about every other detail but didn't say in the title ""does not increase crime rates or murder rates in a country"".  in short, your conclusion is totally flawed.

how about normalizing data from historical wars and comparing wars with 3 different levels of religious component: ""none"", ""some"", and ""exclusively religious conflict"".  i would bet that the category where religion played no role in the war would be rather small compared to the other two categories.

or maybe more interestingly you could write a thesis on ""wars or violence prevented by religion"". i'm willing to guess that it would be a rather brief piece.","1301619081"

It just seems like he thinks that he thought he could get away with that.  Yesterday when he did it again, I excused myself, called my mom and told her that I was freaking out, that I wanted to leave and then went back and told him that if he didn't apologize I was leaving. I told him the next time he did it I was going to have no problem leaving. I looked him in the eye and he apologized kind of like he didn't want to. I was furious so I made him tell me specifically that he wasn't going to say bitch to me anymore and reminded him of how I have been making an effort not to call him an asshole. I think part of that sunk in and I can only hope he doesn't put me in the situation again, because I will *have to* be true to my words and leave, for myself.

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","As an avid track enthusiast I rarely use the clutch, even on downshifts. (Although the slipper clutch helps that)




Here is a good article from 600rr.net

Once its fundamental theory is understood, the skill of clutchless upshifting is typically mastered in a matter of minutes. For first-timers, snicking slickly through the gears without the clutch brings a smile of wonderment, as if they just learned a new magic trick.

Surprisingly, the last time this shifting trick was discussed in these pages it brought about a storm of controversy that continues through Sport Rider correspondence to this day. It's actually a time-honored technique that I first read about in a Motorcyclist story about Eddie Lawson more than two decades ago. After that story was published, Lawson earned four Grand Prix world championships, all before the rider-aid wizardry of electric shifters, which, by the way, use the same basic principles discussed here. Anyone who still doubts the advantages of clutchless upshifting is welcome argue with Mr. Lawson, though last time I checked he still isn't one to lose at anything.

Though it's difficult for many to initially accept, upshifting without a clutch is in many ways simpler than the conventional pull-the-clutch-in-while-rolling-off-the-gas, shift-up,let-the-clutch-out-smoothly-while-rolling-back-on-the-gas method most of us grew up using. Instead, simply preload the shifter lightly, then quickly let off the throttle slightly and then back on and-presto-you're in the next gear. Done correctly, a clutchless upshift sounds and feels like that of an electric shifter, and no, it's not abusive to the transmission; countless years of the SR staff racing their personal bikes stand witness to this. The key qualifier here is the phrase ""done correctly."" Fortunately this is as easy to feel as it is to learn.

First, understand that while accelerating, even mildly, you're able to lightly lift (preload) the shift lever with your toe without causing the transmission to shift or pop out of gear. By lightly, we mean perhaps two to four pounds of upward pressure for a moment before your desired shift point. Then, as the tach sweeps past the desired rpm, simply crack the throttle slightly off, then instantly back on, as quick as a blink of an eye. Don't fully shut the throttle; only close it enough to momentarily reverse the acceleration load on the transmission before returning the twist grip to its original position. Remember to release the pressure on the shift lever after the shift to allow the mechanism to ratchet back and index the next gear.

As Kevin Schwantz teaches at his school, clutchless upshifting doesn't have to be under full-throttle acceleration and, in fact, is best learned under moderate acceleration at partial throttle. Once mastered, however, you'll find that it works at any speed and any rpm. Initially, it takes a bit of trial and error to get the timing and feel for it, and different bikes may require slightly different amounts of throttle change or quickness of movement, but you'll know when you hit the right combination. The shifter should snick into gear with a smooth movement and no notchiness. The bike's acceleration between gears should be virtually seamless.

All this clutch-free shifting business isn't just to impress your friends or passenger, however; there are several tangible advantages as well. As a man who earned his living (and the '93 world championship) wrestling savagely unsophisticated two-stroke GP bikes before the days of engine-management software, Schwantz is able to demonstrate that a well-executed clutchless upshift upsets the bike less than a conventional shift. In my 26 years of experience, I miss fewer shifts when I shift without using the lever on my left handlebar. Exiting right-hand corners with my body hung off to the inside (I'm talking track riding here, since, for several reasons, I do not hang off on the street), it's far easier to just snap back the throttle for an upshift than to make sure my left forearm is in position to allow my fingers to properly manipulate the clutch as well. It's simply one less thing to do, one less thing to think about and one less thing to go wrong.

We're not saying you should forget about using the clutch entirely; there are plenty of situations where it's likely to be to your advantage. But at the same time, clutchless upshifting is a skill worth learning. Don't get discouraged if it doesn't come to you on your first, second or 16th time. Practice it in a parking lot, or on a remote stretch of straight road, at moderate speed in an environment that allows you to give this novel technique your full attention and, by trial and error, varying the quickness and amount of throttle movement, it will come to you. When the situations warrant it, using your new shifting skill should give you all the satisfaction of pulling a rabbit out of a hat ","1301619102"

* Turnstiles are never 100% successful. We'll still have fraud -- whether through pass forgery or turnstile-jumping. 

*We'll be paying far more for this security system than the security system will ever save us. 

*Using an honor system on mass-transit sends a very positive social message (it's a very public reminder that the vast majority of us gladly co-operate, and pay our share). By saying that we're all untrustworthy, we lose something immensely valuable. 

Translink already spent $25 million putting the electronic fare dispensers on buses - to deal with fare evasion that was again entirely minor. At the same time, they bitch and moan that they don't have money to keep the buses running.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Previously, I had only heard about perineum tears due to child birth, but this does seem to happen to women.

Before your doctor's appointment, I'd take note of any current medications you're taking. Depending on a health condition or medication the walls of your vagina may have thinned leading to tears. This could include things like hemorrhoids, menopause, specific birth control pills, yeast infections etc. If the tear is visible, I also might consider taking a picture, so you can show it to your doctor during the appointment.

With any open wound around the genitals, there are risks. This includes greater chance of catching an STD/STI. If you haven't already done so, I'd go for STI/STD screening with your partner. Also, be sure to specifically ask for a Herpes test, as not all standard panels test for it. Another risk is possible infection. Try to be mindful of your hygiene without overdoing it, and ask you partner if there's any unusually strong odors or tastes as that could be a symptom that there's something wrong.

Obviously you've tried lots of lube. Have you tried different sex positions, changing the angle of penetration? Depending, that may help things and cause fewer tears during intercourse. If it happens every time, you might want to restrict activities to oral until you see your doctor. Also, just to cover bases, you might want to make sure your partner's fingernails are cut/filed, that you avoid rough sex, and that you aren't using douches, or rough toilet paper.

I'm in no way a medical professional, so you should definitely try and see your doctor as soon as you can. I do hope this was at the very least a little bit helpful.

"food","t5_2qh55","Something I often make and people love is/are mini-stuffed potatoes.

I don't really do recipes... but here goes... 


- Buy as many mini potatoes as you want/need.
- Wash and halve each potato.
- Place all potatoes on plate and microwave until cooked (I forget how long it takes... more than 5 and less than 10 minutes on high).
- When they come out- LET THEM COOL (I've made the mistake of rushing this step).
- Take a spoon and scoop out the inside of each potato leaving an intact potato shell with a little potato on the sides. Put the ""inside"" potato in a bowl.
- When the potatoes are all scooped out, turn your attention to your bowl of cooked potatoes. Your mission is to make the most delicious mashed potatoes ever. I like a blend of salt, pepper, garlic, fresh basil and cheddar cheese, but it's open to interpretation. I've done caramelized onion before too which is awesome.
- Mash preferred ingredients into lovely potato mush.
- Scoop lovely potato mush into potato shells so that they are slightly overflowing. You may or may not want to add a little shredded cheese on top.
- Bake for about 10 minutes right before serving.

They are so delicious and relatively easy... a bit time consuming on the potato-scooping, but not too bad. These things will fly off the table.","1301619117"

 . Medical screening.
 . Fingerprint check.

"Rift","t5_2s4an","Well, I played for a few hours this afternoon, and I was able to gauge it all myself.  I put all of the points back in that I was using (mostly Sab, 10 point nightblade) and did some quests.  Here's my evaluation:

The damage is down to about 1/2 of the mob's health on an initial blast of 5 charges (most of the time).  Therefore, instead of needing 2 or 3 to finish them off, you need at least another round of 5, sometimes more.

After playing with it and using my other talents in combination, I settled on a method that works without me having to drink every single time.

* Set mines
* Set charges
* Set a trap
* Set a timebomb
* Throw an adhesive bomb
* Blow charges

Once the mob starts running towards you (most mobs are HtH), it will hit the adhesive trap, then your mines should be right after the adhesive trap.  The mines blow the mob right back into the adhesive trap giving you more time to finish it off.  If you still haven't finished it off, the trap helps, but you should be backing up all of this time (assuming you have the room).

Now this works for 1 mob, but if you get multiple on you, you're toast.  I died 5 or 6 times on things that I wouldn't have died doing previously, and that most other classes would be able to do, so you are extremely weak.

I think the problem lies in the fact that there's really no CC for a Sab, and if the damage is gone, well, we're generally SOL when there are multiple mobs.  Sure, you can sap one, but what about areas where there are roaming mobs and more then 2?  The ranger pet is only good up to level 30, and none of the other trees have any low hanging fruit that helps.

All in all, I was saddened to hear we were getting a nerf, but from what I had seen of everything else Trion did, I had faith that they wouldn't totally destroy the class (plus I could tell we were a bit overpowered).  In this instance I'm not saying they completely destroyed it or they won't tweak it in the future, but I'm going to have to mothball the saboteur as it's just far too much work to competently take down a mob, and too much dying overall.  The immense fun and spontaneity of the playstyle has turned into a life or death struggle at every opportunity and pretty much ruined it as a main soul.  It is my suggestion that you guys use this soul as a support role for something else. ","1301619120"

"architecture","t5_2qhae","I took 2 minutes to correct some of that sloppy space planning.
[Here you go.](http://imgur.com/ZDWBf)

 I love the warehouse aesthetic, and it's not a terrible conversion (here is me trying not to sound prissy), I don't even think it's worth pointing out the little spaces that were neglected in the design. But I have to point out (yes, have to, that's how much it bothered me!) that the space planning for the two secondary bedrooms is absolutely terrible. 

First, I get that whoever designed this wanted the doorways to land directly in front of the arches, but you have a bathroom door opening up into the dining room, facing the dining room table no less. 

Second, rather than having to walk the entire length of the house to get to the secondary bathroom through the lower bedroom, the designer could have placed the walk in closet where the secondary bathroom is, and vice versa, giving that bedroom (which has more privacy anyway as its door does not directly open into the living room like the other one does) the walk in closet and adjacent bathroom. This way you center both restrooms, each bedroom has easy access to each of their respective restrooms, and you eliminate the need to extend the chase wall the entire length of the space. It took me 2 minutes of looking at the plan to figure that out, I'm guessing the designer did all that just to give the bedroom with the windows the closet and its own bathroom. It's kinda silly that the main bathroom should be closer to your own en suite bathroom though.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","Why is the city here?  That, mostly, determines all the subsequent questions.  Cities exist for a reason, and at low tech levels sustaining them requires certain geography that you just don't get everywhere, sometimes including places where a city would be really handy for other reasons.

Cities tend to spring up at the intersections of natural trade routes (river junctions, deltas, etc).  They either require lots of fertile land, other food resources (seafood especially), or easy and quick transport from places with lots of surplus food.  

In most fantasy settings roads do not count as quick or easy transport.  Rivers and canals were pretty much the only method of inexpensive and useful transport that existed for most of history.

Beijing, to take an example, depended on the Grand Canal to bring enough food to support its population from the more fertile southern lands.  The city existed prior to the canal, but was much smaller.  One of the indications of a weakening dynasty was that they neglected the Grand Canal (which eventually stretched all the way south past Shanghai to Hangzhou, over a thousand miles) and as a result famine fell on the poor of Beijing.

In general if there isn't a river, or a canal, or some other quick and cheap method of shipping food no matter how strategically important an area is, or what resources exist that can be extracted, only towns or smaller can exist.  And mostly that's all that's needed to lock down a strategic area, or sustain a population of resource extractors.

As an example, take Sekigahara.  It was a critically important mountain pass, it's hard to get more strategically important.  But it was isolated, there was no way to get supplies there but by oxcart, and as a result there wasn't even a fortress, just a tiny village.

Obviously a combination of valuable resources (or strategic importance), **AND** easy shipping of food is going to get citified very quickly.

Moving goods by oxcart, especially food, just doesn't work for distances much past 60 miles.  By that point the teamsters and their oxen will have eaten all the food they're shipping.","1301619134"

Your hypothesis would necessitate that a person from another country who lived his whole life without ever hearing of Jesus Christ will either be allowed into heaven without having accepted Jesus, or it means God condemned him to hell from before he was born and never gave him an opportunity to choose salvation.  There are other problems with your hypothesis too, but these central-tenet violations mean it's already dead in the water.","1301619142"

There is always someone who can really spot me, in school, college and in the office. It's usually a smart person who has been conned over by someone before. The tricky part is making sure ALL your bases are covered and your alibis line up.

Right, but running a blockade is an act of aggression regardless of what the end goal is.

&gt; Right, that was the point of the flotilla. I think the organizers said that was the point beforehand. If they didn't it doesn't matter, the reason is still obvious.

So you acknowledge they intended to make a scene and have Israel stop them.

&gt; A few instigators and a number of other ass holes and idiots worked themselves into a frenzy in the hours leading to the boarding, and then improvised for weapons, used things that lie around on ships.

Yeah I'm not saying everyone was in it for violent reasons. That wasn't the right word. But they surely all were antagonistic. All but one were boarded and inspected peacefully. 

But the one that did attack the soldiers as they were coming down got what they asked for. You cannot gang up and stab or beat a soldier with a gun and expect not to get shot.

&gt; Israel's blockade of Gaza is not a tool for winning their war with Gaza, they've given up on that.

The blockade of Gaza is a tool Israel uses to prevent Hamas from arming themselves. Winning the war in Gaza means stopping Hamas from doing damage to Israel while simultaneously trying to kill as few civilians as possible. Not an easy task when Hamas fires rockets from schools.

"Freethought","t5_2qhzx","There's flaws in the system, yes. It isn't perfect and I've often been frustrated with it. Even very frustrated. Ex: learning things by heart isn't a good way to learn and understand things. Chances are you will cram cram cram and then forget about everything two weeks after the exam. But at least you were exposed to those things, at least once, and know they exist. And chances are you being in school is in the interest of the system and the power. So yes, there is cons. But there's pros too. I think you're biased because your teachers were rather narrow-minded and haughty and you're maybe generalizing. It can very well be in your own interest to go to school too. Although sometimes I question my decision to go to university, I can definitely see where it's been beneficial to me. Actually a lot of teachers were down to earth and many teach a lot of stuff that doesn't exactly fall within the interests of the higher powers. I've learned a lot of stuff about critical thinking, and learned to develop it. I was exposed to Marxism for example, and philosophy, and to many ruses and control methods of the system... These are all things I really might not have learned by myself, because we're very selective of information we expose ourselves to and absorb. We look for and retain info that falls within our interest and beliefs and tend to ignore or reject what doesn't interest us or fit within our beliefs. That's how people are, it's psychological, we can't help it much. So what I learned might not have interested me upon first impression. But then it was imposed onto me. And now, I'm enlightened on the ways of the world. So, being in the system is what made me see it, acknowledge it, understand it better, and therefore able to criticize it and liberate myself from it's power. Knowledge is power. It's exposed me to all kinds of other things I probably would have never wanted to expose myself to, such as math, which I actually do need in life though. In general, it has helped me see how I think, what I like, what I'm good at, and maybe what I'm not so good at. And on the smaller spectrum, is what enabled me to write this out and communicate it to coherently. (Well, even if it was a bit of a rant. I hope it was semi-coherent, and you understand what I'm getting at.) Anyway, we also have a certain level of choice. I did say a certain level. Once in high school we can choose between a couple different classes. Then if we want to pursue post-secondary, we can choose our area of study, and then classes we take. Well that was the case for me, I know it wasn't for you. And I know that's a reason for your opinion on your schooling.
Anyway, lastly, it also pushes you and challenges you in some way as well. We're all capable of doing physical activity and getting in shape on our own. But many choose to get personal trainers, because we need that something or someone who's pushing and motivating us to go beyond what we would do ourselves.
So that's a bit of my take on it. I know there's cons, I know there's limits, and I know not all teachers are interested in actually helping the expansion of minds, or self-development, or independent thought. That is frustrating. But on a grander scale, it's also beneficial.","1301619155"

Try John 3:36, for example:

&gt;  He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

(In other parts of the bible Jesus describes fairly explicitly what the *wrath of God* will involve)

On the other hand these utterly explicit and clear statements are nevertheless contradicted by other parts that say  different. Like always, with the bible.

We should collect as many as we can, and post them everywhere on that day. Facebook, twitter, spam, graffiti, t-shirts... whatever you're into, use it to spread the message that on May 22nd, another prophecy has failed, as have all prophecies before it.

On that day we will accept all those who were fooled. All those who made a mistake, by doing what so many of us humble, human creatures are apt to do....

believing.

We will accept them and their flaws, and teach them grander things than they have ever known. 

We will respect those who lost the most. Those who gave-up their lives chasing a comet's tail, or leaped off a ledge, hoping some spirit would carry them higher. On that day we will not mock or scorn them, on that day we will let them rest in silence.

But we will **NOT SUFFER APOLOGISTS!** 

If someone approaches you on that day, and wants to explain why their particular prophecy failed, you owe them no courtesy. Treat them as you would any fool; my suggestion is to walk away and leave them talking to themselves. 

And though, somehow in it's very nature, this is a cause for the atheists, this shall not just be for biblical and religious prophecies. Sloppy science as a divination tool can be just as damaging as fables and fairy tales as a historical document.

You think you are saving a word by completely changing the definition? What you are doing is taking the word Anarchism and saying it means something completely opposite it's essence.

I see nothing wrong with this.

&gt;and now most of the world considers it to be synonymous with chaos and death for a very logical reason

You must be referring to the propaganda campaign spearheaded by capitalists.

Simple probate?  Most attorneys that handle probate/estate planning etc. could probably handle it.  Get referrals from a few other attorneys, though, because some attorneys are lazy and don't follow through on the paperwork.  What should take 3-4 months sometimes takes much longer.  A basic probate is like a basic personal injury - Just about any attorney could DO it, but only some could probably do it competently.

If you want a ""living will,"" aka durable medical power of attorney - go to a reputable forms shop where you can pay like $20.  An attorney would charge you a few hundred for this, for essentially the same form.  Follow instructions on form.

General power of attorney, forms shop.

Revocable living trust, forms shop.

Complicated stuff such as irrevocable living trust, ""on shore"" trusts, tax planning issues - go to someone who advertises in the yellow pages in this area or someone who specializes in this area.  This is about the only time you need someone who REALLY specializes in this area because a pretender attorney will fuck it up but the fuck up won't be apparent until 20-30 or more years later.

'Prostitute' is a loaded word, but I think you're in the wrong subreddit if you think you're going to unearth some kind of misogynistic hatred of sex workers. I object to the characterization of me as a prostitute not because of some misguided moral apprehensions about sex for pay, but because, as I have already explained, I'm in love with my spouse and I am not being paid for sex, so it's dismissive of my love and denies my reality. If the title had been worded 'Are Women Only in Relationships for Money?' I would *still* object, even sans the word 'prostitute.'

If the author had meant to say 'all relationships require some give and take', the title wouldn't have included the words 'women' or 'prostitutes', because he would have been referring to non-sexual give-and-take as well as sexual (which prostitution leaves out), and he would have been inclusive of homosexual relationships which do not involve women.

Depending on the style of headphones, you'll either have one cable that goes to one ear and bridges over to the other side, or two cables, one going to each ear. 

1 Cable: Inside the cable will be 3 wires, a left signal, a right signal and an earth. 
2 Cable: Two cables each of a signal and a ground

Strip back the coat about an inch to reveal the inside cables, and strip about 5mm off the end of them to reveal the wires. Plug the jack in, get some sound going, and probe away to try and figure out which one is which. Rest assured, you can't really do any harm here. Once you've figured out which one goes where, solder away.



By learning to solder now, you'll win the hearts of many a young woman when she needs a car stereo installed ;)

"reddit.com","t5_6","1. suppose your right, people developed drugs before the FDA, however exclusivity=teh mad bucks=incentive for new/rare stuff. also if they were to ""keep the formula a secret"" they run the risk of A) losing the patent on the chemical for testing and b) someone else discovering it. both of which cost the company millions (it costs about $800m over the course of 7 years to develop and approve a new drug) and they get nothing for it. 
and using my argument THE SAME computer software would not be able to be developed during the time of exclusivity (this relates to brand v generic drugs)
also the government protects patents on all kinds of things, not just drugs. just ask the RIAA!

also i think you misunderstood my reference to clonidine...it was derived from a plant in the early 60s and has been used since then as a prescription drug. its been generic(cheaper) forever but never actually got FDA approval (it was grandfathered in with a whole ton of other drugs) a single company just got it FDA approved and its going to be exclusive (i think other companies are allowed to sell out their stock but can't make more). But the FDA didn't go back on that one...just fucking over patients who need their meds.","1301619230"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have one on my chin in the shape of a Y on its side (about the size of a 2p actually) from when I was about 7. I was riding my bike and looking behind me (being chased by an older student). Cycled straight into a stone post, over the bars and slammed my face right on the corner. The blood was there for weeks. Older student scarpered.

Then there's Gary the Gash. I got him after falling and putting my arm through a window. I put a bandage on and didn't think anything of it. Later on my friend Jack comes over with some beers. After a few drinks my blood starts to run thin and the bandage begins to drip. I remove the bandage to have a look and the 1 inch scar turns out to be far deeper than i'd first thought. It also still contained a large shard of glass. My dad drives the two of us to hospital still drunk. While waiting I draw a pair of eyes on him and start using the gash as a mouth to sing 80s pop hits. Got a lot of looks.

Most recent one was received yesterday after an op to move my ulnar nerve (trapped at the elbow). It'll be a few weeks before I get to see it but another redditor compared it to a 4 inch zip along the forearm.

Everything that she's done in her life, and everything that she will do, will be to find happiness.

If she's happy and healthy then you have no reason to be jealous.

Most rational people look at the facts presented by the witnesses, listen to what people say, and work with their statements.  They do not decide right off the bat that everyone is lying, no one can be trusted to say what they really mean, and whatever it is you believe to have happened, despite any evidence to the contrary, is what really transpired.  The fact is, no one knows for sure what really happened but the two involved in this situation.  You can play ameture detective all you want, it doesn't change the fact that you are just making things up, based on a very, very clear desire to paint all women as perpetrators and all men as victims.  Which, I believe, a major gripe most MRAs have against feminists, is that they attempt to do the same thing, only painting the women as always being the victim, and the man no matter what is always the perpetrator.

One class they asked us ""If you could be reborn, would you prefer to be a girl or a guy?"".  Every. single. girl strongly preferred to be reborn as a girl.  ""Why?"" they were asked.  Because their lives are incredibly easy.  They have no pressure on them to work, to support their parents, to carry on the family's name.  The common ""joke"" in Asian countries like Japan is that the male works and the woman spends the money.

Your claims about discrimination against women being worse than men are completely baseless.  In family courts in the US men are discriminated against massively.  Police will also treat (white) women in a  disproportionately lenient manner.

In business wages are lower than women for a variety of reasons, including the risk of training and hiring women who then leave to have children.  Women are often far less likely to devote their career and lives to their job, making it far more difficult for them to climb up the corporate ladder.

In academia you see a keen disinterest among college women in certain fields such as physics and engineering.  It's not like schools are telling them ""No! You can't join!"".  Women just don't have any interest in those fields.","1301619263"

Yep. You pretty much just get used to the fact that it's always going to be raining. Or at least that there's always a chance of it at any time. Like you mentioned with the ease of walking around though, we usually just get a light drizzle. What I'd consider to be ""real"" rain is pretty rare. 

&gt;Can I use that word in Portland, ""y'all""?

I am confused by this word, and my fear would probably prompt me to burn you as a witch. Which we can't do because of the rain. So it'd be pretty awkward all around. :(

&gt;How far do you have to drive to find sunshine in the winter?

You're right that it's not going to happen all that much here. On the plus side, we have what I'd consider the perfect amount of snow. It'll probably happen in the winter, but also only enough to be an amusing novelty instead of an annoyance. 

&gt;Anyone else have experience moving from Texas to Portland?

I haven't, but I'd suspect the biggest thing would be the temp and the lack of sun. Simply because when I've been in texas, I feel like I'm going to either melt or combust. If you find that enjoyable, the weather here might take some serious getting used to. I think most people adapt to it pretty quickly, however. ","1301619302"

And if we sang Just whole heartedly Without copying Another singer And if we sang Without worry Everybody, who knows Maybe would sing
Si cantabamos en espanol Como los de el Guadalquivir O sobre la Costa del Sol Everybody would see it means nothing If we sang without the Eu é un hum un une an on consonnants If we sang while laughing Eh ah ha hi (Firmin !)

If we sang without melody It'd be the same but different We'd be the new frenchie scene Like Biolay in more depressing If we sang near the mic It'd satur'rate surely If we sang far from the mic I can't go much farther ? Aaaaaahhh !

Chorus

If we sang without lyrics

Hum-hum yeah we'd get bored, y'see ! If we sang without Mister D We could create harmonies Without wrong notes or vulgarities, (I screw you !) We'd finally be united as a group (you too Firmin !)

Chorus

And if we sang (Jeanne : we could sing like Jeanne Moreau) Whole heartedly (Jeanne : Jeanne Moreau phone home) Without copying (Firmin : And if we sang backwards) Another singer (Monsieur D. : Yeah, it could be nice (Firmin : ach euch euch ess auch et ich ass eff og) And if we sang (Oldelaf : And if we sang while repeating, And if we sang while repeating, And if we sang while repeating, And if we sang while repeating) Without worries (Firmin &amp; M.

The issue here isn't whether Huckabee was funny or not.  It's whether politicians should be held accountable for fostering an atmosphere where forcible conversion at gunpoint becomes the punchline of a joke.  That is extreme.  That is a dangerous precedent.  Pretend to live an vacuum and hide behind faux libertarianism all you want; it's no excuse.  If you can't distinguish between Christians who want to spread what they believe to be the truth from Christians who find the thought of spreading their religion at gunpoint to be funny, you're simply not trying.  

Something tells me if Huckabee were an Imam speaking to a group of fundamentalist Muslims in Iran you wouldn't hide behind the pedantic excuse that rhetoric is part of politics.  What if he were a radical Imam in the US?  Words have consequences, even in America.

Volunteering while unemployed is one of the best things you can possibly do. Often times volunteer coordinators get wind of your situation and think so highly of you - they may offer you a job (or at least offer to write a superb letter of recommendation).

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","Married guy here, 52. 

Cute guy appears to be shyish. You aren't friendzoned yet, and aren't even close to drifting into it. Shy guys tend to be more sensitive, and the sensitive need time to establish an emotional bond before they get physical. Two or three dates won't do it. 

More broadly, you are stuck between #1 and #2 because of the same misunderstanding. You interpret ""slow"" and a bit shy as ""uninterested"" or friendzoned, so you miss the good-but-shy ones. You react to forwardness and a bit of aggressiveness as masculine interest. It is, but too much is also consistent with controlling or other possessiveness.

Deal with this by expecting to go far more slowly than you are use to with the ones that aren't forward or aggressive, and stay away from the latter. Slow includes perhaps less texting than you are use to. If you aren't comfortable taking the initiative in romance, you don't have to take big steps. Just take little ones. On dates, sit close occasionally, make jokes, touch him now and then. Don't get discouraged because any given date didn't end in clarity. Don't get discourage because any given guy isn't the one.

As an example, if I'm looking for a new Honda Civic and see that a 'friend' used Autotrader to find it, but they don't have any local inventory, I don't really care that they found their Ford Focus there.

There's a company called Digital West that's rolling out fiber to businesses on Broad street near the airport, but its a slow and laborious process. There's some rumors that Digital West will get a federal grant to run fiber along the railroad tracks to Shell Beach to provide residential fiber.

Also, there's been some discussion of hooking Cal Poly into the loop at the Los Osos fiber vault to allow students to do experiments with latency across large distances. The basic idea is to bounce packets to Japan and back to teach some sort of lesson about global network traffic.","1301619379"

As you can see I went through a very awkward phase and at around 11 I was already about 5'8 so definitely stood out. But I like to think it all worked out fine after a couple years.

My point with all of this is you're still young and you'll still mature. A big part of ""looking good"" is about how you perceive yourself. You can wear the best clothes out there but if you don't feel confident in them it'll be apparent to everyone around you. My advice for this is not to worry so much about your external appearance and work on developing your personality first as it forms the basis of who you are as an individual. External appearance is easy to change - trust me, you start going to the gym on a regular basis and after about 3-4 months you can be very cut and physically fit. I don't suggest doing that right now though, at least wait until you've finish puberty completely (~ 18).

Hope this makes you feel a bit better. Good luck!","1301619388"

We were sheep killing buddies for about two minutes, and he stumbled off a few steep inclines, yelping occasionally. ""Well, he seems to be pretty durable,"" I thought with relief. 

Then I climbed a giant tree to axe it down from above. Six axe-strokes in, and I see my wolf has teleported up to be with me. Aww. How cute.

Then I accidentally cut the branch beneath him. I'm unable to prevent the second blow, which hits him as he's falling. He yelps in mid-air. I watch him fall to the ground, he yelps again, then I watch him vanish with a puff of the dust made from my shattered dreams.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I totally fucked up the first couple of years of my undergrad and had about a 2.0 gpa going.  I was suspended and decided I needed to get my shit together.  I enrolled at a tech school for a semester and made sure I took classes that would transfer to a better state school.  I barely got my gpa high enough to transfer and started a new program.  At my new school I got involved in a few clubs and eventually became president of one of them.  I also started hitting-up professors for research opportunities (I was a fisheries major).  I tried to get some rather broad experience within my general field and was able to get involved in some aquaculture, population dynamics, and population genetics projects.  Some were volunteer and some were paid positions.  I was able to graduate with about a 3.5 gpa and had some very solid letters of recommendation.  I'm currently working on a Master's degree at a respectable institution (which I was able to get a research assistantship for) and hope to graduate this summer.  

It can be done, but you need to get your shit together.  Don't be afraid to admit your mistakes.  When I was interviewed for my grad program my major professor asked about my previous shitty grades.  I told him that I was more interested in chasing women and partying than I was about my coursework at that point in my life.  He laughed and said that he understood.  My more recent activities and grades showed that I was actively trying to make up for my mistakes and that I was capable of taking the next step in my education.

You can do it.  Just start kicking ass.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt; Nobody has suggested that Gaza is ""a real luxury"", but I wrote that in response to your absurd claim that it ""is a concentration camp"".

Umm, you used the word ""luxury"" twice when referring to Gaza, and never once did I call Gaza a ""concentration camp"". I guess you found those quotes up your ass, where you get the rest of your sources. I am not making any attempt to compare Israel to Nazi Germany. No comparison is necessary. However, I stand by my characterization of Gaza as a giant prison. It is a heavily guarded, walled enclosure from which the free movement of goods and people is not allowed. I used the word ""giant"" because it is larger than your typical prison, which at most, will hold hundreds of inmates.

&gt; You mean the Turks that refused Israel's offer to inspect the ship before letting it through by stabbing several soldiers and throwing them overboard?

Yes, Israel's version of the event is very credible. Especially since they refused to cooperate with an independent inquiry. 

&gt; You are the reason this conflict continues - you empower scared people in Israel and the animals that send people to their deaths to achieve political gains.

Haha, you are pathetic. Yes, I am to blame for the Israel-Palestine conflict, even though I live half a world away. Yes, I am to blame for terrorism against Israelis, even though I have never advocated violence. 
As stated before, I believe in an organized movement of divestment, sanctions and civil disobedience to combat Israeli occupation. This is one of the strengths of a nonviolent movement, it prevents Israel from using security as an excuse to violate the rights of the Palestinians. I truly feel pity for you.

There's the RISD Art Museum which is pretty rad if that's your thing. I'd also just go downtown and check things out... Empire/Washington/Westminster Streets are where there are interesting shops.  There is the huge mural designed by Shepard Fairey on Aborn St that's pretty cool, too.   Best coffee is either Seven Stars Bakery on Hope Street on the East Side or Broadway on the west side, or Coffee Exchange on Wickenden.  Blue State coffee on Thayer is great too.  If you like pizza check out Bob and Timmy's on Federal Hill, which is basically Providence's Little Italy, or Nice Slice on Thayer.  If you want a killer Gyro, go to East Side Pockets on Thayer.  If you want to hang in a park, go to Lippitt Park on east side or Dexter Training Grounds next to the huge Armory building where the militia used to train on the west side.

If you can get through all that, you've had a nice tour of Providence.  Hopefully others will chime in.  Have fun!  Let me know if you have more questions :)","1301619450"

I think it's brilliant what you're doing- you've entered an empty niche (or rather created one) that is sustained by the many students willing to pay for their grades.  How far removed is that idea from paying for your degree and the amount of prestige that goes along with it?  What does it mean to be a graduate of an ivy league school anyway?  Anyway, if you weren't doing it, someone else would be.  

So my question: As controversial as this job is, is there actually any legal ramifications?  Do you lie about your company to new acquaintances?  Has any big business every put in a bid for your company?  What is the employee turnover like?

Just because I evaluated my other options does not mean that I valued those potential offers as better. It just means I wanted to see what other companies were offering. If you aren't evaluating competing offers you're not giving yourself a fair shake. You keep assuming that because people don't immediately accept your offer that you aren't the first choice. That just simply isn't true. 

There are also a ton of different areas to ""be first"" in. One company may have the best work environment, one may have the most fitting job, while a 3rd might be offering significantly more money than the other 2. It's situations like these that cause people to hesitate on offers, because without all three offers in front of them they can't accurately evaluate which is their first choice. And before you go, ""Well, I would never want someone if they only took my offer because it was more money,"" you should evaluate why money is their primary motivating factor. If it's a fresh-out-of-college student he either A) doesn't realize how critical work environment and company culture are, or B) is completely in it for the money, in which case your evaluation would be right. On the other hand, if it's a middle-aged guy with a wife, a mortgage, and two kids to send to college, it's a totally different ball game. One of these options is likely to quit after a short period of time while another is likely to work his ass off.

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","OH MY GOD YES.

Last summer I was about to start an internship in a new city.  Well, I'd been struggling with terrible, chronic diarrhea (and accompanying stomach pain) for about a year at that time, and in the few days before I left I ended up getting my appendix out.  While they were in there, they found a bunch of scarred bowel loops and were worried that I might have a constriction.  I was on a liquid diet for at least two weeks, and I dropped a significant amount of weight.  I hadn't been heavy to begin with, so I looked *sick*.  So sick that you could see where my ribs connected to my sternum and my wrists were tiny little pencils.

The first thing that happens when I (finally) get to my internship?  I'm explaining to the other girls why I was a little bit late and one of them chimes in with, ""I wish I could be sick like that.""  After failing a semester of college due to sickness, the liquid diet, the constant and daily suffering--I almost force fed her some of my feces right then and there.

I know that it's hard, but you have to realize that most of the people who talk to you have no idea what you're going through.  They're just doing the best they can to relate to you.  What's one thing that every human being can identify with?  Weight struggles and self image issues.  In their shallow, self-centered, ignorant, oblivious way--they're just trying to look on the bright side.  Don't waste your valuable time disliking them.  Realize that they're sick too: they're sick with terrible self esteem issues.  They have wonderful, healthy bodies and they can't even appreciate them.

And if you do mention that they could get it from eating your feces (which is totally not true in either of our cases), you should see the look they give you.  ","1301619462"

Also, there is no disadvantage to the opponent of someone who misses their MULE timings--those Marines would have been out anyways, and they would have been out earlier, which means more time in which they were a threat to you (when you presumably had less units).

I can't really think of anything else to say other than pointing out the fact that mass Marines is not viable in any matchup as demonstrated by the fact that it's incredibly obvious and yet nobody does it. Marines are a very strong unit and lead to some excellent unit compositions (such as Marine/Tank/Medivac in both TvT and TvZ) but the strength of those compositions revolves around the interaction between the units within them and taking any one or two units and using them without the rest is usually disastrous (as it is with pure Marines, for example).","1301619476"

In Matt 22:36-40 and Luke 10:25-37 Jesus said that the second of the two greatest laws was to love your neighbor as yourself. In the Luke text, Jesus is specifically asked what is necessary for eternal life (verse 25) and after Jesus references the two great commandments, he says ""This **do** and you will live"" (verse 28) -- showing clearly that salvation is related to works/deeds/actions, however important faith might be to motivating such behavior. Note further, that in the Luke version, this was illustrated by an example, the parable of the Good Samaritan, which was used to define ""neighbor"" very broadly, to include enemies. The Samaritan (the lowest of the outcasts) is the one who exemplifies this broad definition, and who provides the example of one who is saved by their compassionate actions toward their enemy. Yet the Samaritan is not even a believer, not one having ""faith"" and not one who has accepted Jesus as savior, yet this is who Jesus chooses as the example of one who gains eternal life, which is what the lawyer specifically asked.

Another time during his ministry, Jesus taught that the people who would go to heaven (be saved) must be as little children (Matt. 18:4-5; 19:14; Mark 9:36-37; 10:14-15; Luke 18:15-17), while Paul wrote that maturity demands us to forsake the things of childhood (I Cor 13:11).

Thus, Jesus teaches us that the kingdom of heaven will be filled with those who lived their lives in active compassion and childlike innocence, while Paul envisions a heaven of crusty, serious ""mature"" grouches who merely have to profess ""acceptance of"" or ""belief in"" Jesus without ever actually performing a single kind, compassionate, cheerful or childishly playful deed.

In his last teaching before going to the upper room for the Last Supper and the ""beginning of the end,"" Jesus described in Matt. 25:31-45 the final judgment as being based solely and entirely on behavioral responses to internalized compassion. And Jesus makes it very clear that those who **do** express universal compassion in behavioral action **will be saved**, and those who **do not** will **not** be saved. Period. There is no other qualification.

&gt;2. Then we're to have faith in Jesus for what exactly? To give us a little extra ""umph"" on our way to the ""good works"" finish line?

You are catching on. Jesus promises to beat under performing Christians in heaven. (Luke 12:35-48)

&gt;As illogical as ""faith alone"" may sound to you

I am simply pointing out what Jesus actually says.

&gt;the idea of works based salvation is infinitely worse.

Jesus taught that works are a component, a condition, of salvation. Not the only condition. But a condition nonetheless.

&gt;And even then, who decides? Does God decide? 

Oh come one. You know Jesus decides. Jesus is the judge of the living and of the dead.

He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. (Acts 10:42)

&gt;Is it dependent on cultural custom or is there a divine standard?

Acts 10:42

&gt;At what point do the scales tip in my favor?

Lord knows.

&gt;If ""I'm a good person"" is the answer, then we are all left clueless, crossing our fingers and hoping that we did enough.

Try harder.

&gt;we are to trust in that work and not our own makes more sense to me than arbitrary guesswork.

You are a follower of Paul.

Putting together the compromises from several different bills (which is what the gang of six did, at least according to wikipedia) isn't the same as authoring.  A better question I could have asked would have been who wrote the bills that were on the table when the compromise was being decided.  

I asked a simple question originally, since I did not have the answer to it, expecting someone with knowledge and common courtesy to possibly answer it.  Instead, I get increasingly rude responses from someone who clearly should stay in r/politics, where vitriol is welcomed and applauded.  I did not ask a loaded, political question, I didn't express any political viewpoint, yet somehow your reply also included irrelevant information what some politician said, then your next comment again, was political about why some democrat is actually a republican.

* you get a certain size of pipe (5Mbps, 100Mbps, whatever)
* you then get a bandwidth commit (is: 2.5 Mbps in 95% transfer, 2 Terabytes in total transfer, etc)

when i download something i appreciate that it will come down the line FASTER than ( $MYBANDWIDTHCAP / 31DAYS ). you want to be able to burst to as fast of a speed as possible. 

you *aren't meant* to totally cap out your connection 24/7, that is a relatively new phenomenon with things like torrents.

anyways, flame away, but that is the thought process behind what shaw is doing. getting an unmetered connection (aka ""max out my bandwidth as much as possible"") is relatively rare and unpopular in north america. 

i'd rather have a 350 Gigabyte limit on a 100 Mbps line, than a 1.09 Mbps line unmetered.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","The cost in dollars and cpu cycles to implement TRUE positional 3d audio is still pretty high, and if its not supported directly in audio hardware, developers prefer to use the CPU cycles for things like AI and rendering/physics. (I'm not talking about simple left right audio stereoscopy... that is done in almost all modern games.)

Another hurdle is that many games programmers primary focus is graphics/gameplay/physics, and they are not very well educated on the nuances of audio programming... so they implement left/right stereo, and distance attenuation, and consider it done.



Some games implement the transitions between different soundscapes differently. Some do smooth transitions between regions, ramping the various effects smoothly, and some don't.
It's a decision based on where the developer wants to focus their engineering effort. Do we want to spend time tuning the transitions between soundscapes, or do we want to spend time optimizing our character shaders so that we can render more characters  at a time without slowing down gameplay?

The correct solution is to have some way of detecting the distance to which the player has penetrated a certain audio region, and attenuate the effects based on that value, and indeed some games do a pretty good job of this.. but historically graphics have been the focus of the gaming experience so audio most often takes a back seat to the ""low hanging fruit"" of optimizing rendering, rather than improving the auditory experience.

But these are all known problems, and as CPUs/multicore get better and badder, and some of the pressure of optimizing CPU usage eases off, you will start to see more focus given to the areas of game audio.

But the un-told story of ""Peak Oil"" is that we are nowhere near it. Why? Because the ""proven reserves"" are measured at a cost-to-extract, and that cost is set at about $30 a barrel.

What that means is that as the price rises (and it will!) the oil which was never listed in reserves, suddenly becomes economic to extract.

Then there are the next-generation shale extraction techniques which use steam and don't rely on  hundreds of miles of settling ponds, and don't rely on tearing the land up to extract it. This technique and others like it are economic and viable at prices well below $100 a barrel.

However, the oil companies are not stupid: they extract the lowest cost oil whenever possible, while spending vast sums to ensure that the ""non-economic oil"" becomes more economic over time.

Believe me, the vast majority of cars in 2040 will still be running on petrol, and oil will still be under $200 a barrel - because there is untold quantities of oil available at that price.","1301619672"

Honestly I think the Mets are in far better position than many people are giving them credit for. Our pitching staff, even if Santana doesn't come back, at least has two young pitchers with very little history of injury in Pelfrey and Niese(his leg injury was a freak incident, not something to be highly concerned about going forwards, and he has never had elbow or shoulder issues) and R.A. Dickey. While thats not a dominating top 3, it should be a reliable one. Our 4 and 5 spot pitchers aren't exactly terrifying, but they should benefit from pitching in Citi Field, and we actually have a staff of triple A arms that provide both solid depth, and some upside in Mejia.

we won 79 games last year despite the fact that we rarely had a 25 man roster, regularly carrying injured players and/or Oliver Perez, without Bay for much of the season, with Reyes getting his spring training in April and with Gary Matthews Jr. on our opening day roster. How can Mets fans expect to be worse this year?","1301619682"

I have not been arguing against anything that you said.  That you think that I am disputing you leads me to believe that you aren't following what I did say.

Let me try summarizing it one final time.  If you still don't get it, I give up.

The original person I was responding to was comparing revolvers to pistols.  He was defending revolvers in the following quote by pointing out a ""weakness"" that he supposed only pistols were susceptible to:

&gt; Gun don't shoot//roundchambered/work slide/magazine in battery? - check; etc. ad nauseum. Even a Block Glock is subject to no-round-chambered and battery failures.

I took that to mean that you could fail to load a Glock, such that you think it's loaded (and thus ready to go in a self-defense scenario) when in fact it is not.  I was pointing out that this ""flaw"" is by no means exclusive to pistols, that one could just as easily mess up with a revolver and mistakenly think it was ready to fire when in fact it was not.

Then you proceeded to go on a long irrelevant tangent about how self-defense guns need to be loaded (duhh).   I was saying the same thing all along too, yet you seem to think I was saying the opposite).","1301619699"

"politics","t5_2cneq","There has been a blurring of the facts and the law since the inception of the Constitution. Let me assure you, the establishment clause absolutely does mean exactly what it says and if one thin dime of that public money is used to fund a religious school then it is very likely a violation of the Constitution.


You will get all kinds of arguments from the ho hum wishy washy arguments designed to blur the issue and raise doubt to the aggressive and arrogant that will boast claims of the Constitution being derived from the divine, being based on religious principles, and even the absurd ""the words separation of church and state are no where in the Constitution"".


But don't take my word for it, take the word of the architect in [James Madison, Detached Memoranda](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions64.html).


&gt;Is the appointment of Chaplains to the two Houses of Congress consistent with the Constitution, and with the pure principle of religious freedom?
&gt;
&gt;In strictness the answer on both points must be in the negative. **The Constitution of the U. S. forbids everything like an establishment of a national religion.** The law appointing Chaplains establishes a religious worship for the national representatives, to be performed by Ministers of religion, elected by a majority of them; and **these are to be paid out of the national taxes. Does not this involve the principle of a national establishment,** applicable to a provision for a religious worship for the Constituent as well as of the representative Body, approved by the majority, and conducted by Ministers of religion paid by the entire nation.
&gt;
&gt;The establishment of the chaplainship to Congs is a palpable violation of equal rights, as well as of Constitutional principles: The tenets of the chaplains elected [by the majority] shut the door of worship agst the members whose creeds &amp; consciences forbid a participation in that of the majority.


This quote from the writings of James Madison also references another important clue. There are some who would have you believe that Thomas Jefferson is in no way an authoritative reference concerning the first amendment and had nothing to do with its writing or meaning. Reality is much different from their views.

Before the First Amendment outlined the separation of church and state in the establishment clause there was the [Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Statute_for_Religious_Freedom) written by Thomas Jefferson.


In part the statute reads...


&gt; to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical;
&gt; ...
&gt; our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions any more than our opinions in physics or geometry
&gt; ...
&gt; Be it enacted by General Assembly that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief, but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of Religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge or affect their civil capacities.


It may be that these private religious schools restrain themselves from teaching their religious beliefs or allowing those beliefs to diminish the scientific, historical and philosophical lessons that contradict their religious teachings, but by their very nature of being religious schools places them under a heavy burden of doubt.

- No Jar-Jar. 
- No podracing.
- No lightsaber fights consisting of bad actors jumping around and pirouetting like ninnies.
- Redesigned ships (really, fuck the Naboo fighters). 
- No droids as bad guys, that's retarded, a droid unit complimenting Separatist soldiers sure. 
- No fucking Anakin as a child and if so, make it brief.
- More lightsaber battles, it's a fucking Star Wars movie.
- No Amidala. Fuck her, seriously.
- Keep Lucas out of the studio until the movie is released.
- Less CG, ruined the movie for me when *everything* is CG.
- No Greedo, no 3CPO, no R2D2. Maybe a reference to Jabba (just a single line acknowledging his existence).
- Cut all scenes with Padme.

**Episode 2**

- Don't show any of the Fetts'/clones' faces. Boba Fett was awesome because he was mysterious.
- No full-CG sets.
- No lightsaber fights consisting of actors jumping around and pirouetting like ninnies.
- Redesigned ships (really, fuck the LAAT/i), that gun bubble ship the clones use is moronic.
- No stupid clone trooper armor, we get that it's the predesessor to the Stromtrooper armor but is SWEU history is any evidence *every fucking army* used that white-armor theme (see: Star Wars Old Republic). Give them something original.
- Fuck droids.
- Cut all scenes with Padme.

**Episode 3**

- Just scrap this entire movie. Make Grievous more badass.
- No lightsaber fights consisting of actors jumping around and pirouetting like ninnies.
- Redesigned ships (really, fuck the LAAT/i), that gun bubble ship the clones use is moronic.
- Don't kill off Kit Fisto, Windu, Ayla Secura (*hot*) or any other Jedi Master just because, the ones with the clone troopers would have seen it coming (they're fucking **Masters**).
- More Anakin struggling with himself, make the scene where he kills the youngelings more heart wrenching.
- The Jedi actually showing some intelligence and knowing Palpatine was a Sith, do this around... 20 years before the first movie. No Sith is *that* good at hiding himself when in an open position like that.
- Cut all scenes with Padme.
- Have the Padme/Anakin love story be secondary to the main plot.

Also have Palpatine utter this mantra at some point in the movie to Anakin:


**Peace is a lie, there is only passion.**

**Through passion, I gain strength.**

**Through strength, I gain power.**

Alcohol is a nerve poison and some poor fuckers cop it worse than others.

It does sound to me like it's nervous exacerbation on top of general anxiety and possible minor personality issues (which everyone has in their own way).



There is a **lot** of propaganda about alcohol- a whole mythology that isn't always true and if you find that you're not enjoying it, then don't do it.

&gt; Hmmm. You date a little bit, but don't have time for a relationship right now. You have ""play friends"", and an FWB. You live alone now, and try to visit your parents on Sunday mornings?

I've got a very nice girlfriend, but I do live alone and try to do my parental visits on Sundays (evenings though!)

He's a good person and like i said 98 percent of the time he's the perfect boyfriend, I just think it takes him a while to realize how insensitive and hurtful he's being towards me when he's angry or frustrated. I'll be honest, I know there's some emotional neglect going on, but I don't think he's doing it all on purpose. I don't wear my emotions on my sleeve so it takes him a while to realize how upset I am, usually when I start crying out of frustration. I'm still at a loss. I don't know whether to move out or to just cross my fingers and hope.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Yes, children always inherit the father's family name in Arabic cultures. More specifically, they inherit the father's name. That is, if your father was named Mohammed Ali Jamal Noorudeen Thawadi, your name would be &lt;first name&gt; Mohammed Ali Jamal Noorudeen Thawadi. You can trace back ""grandfathers"" in this way. Mohammed's father was Ali, who's father was Jamal, who's father was Noorudeen etc. Thawadi in this case would be the family name.

Technically, Wahhabis are Sunnis, they're just generally more extreme. Converting from any Islamic sect to the other is universally a better-received move than converting to another ""heavenly book"". That doesn't mean it's not thought of as generally a bad thing to do, it'll just get you a whole lot less grief than if you had converted out of Islam entirely. That is, you'd still be hated (likely) but not hated as much as if you had converted out of Islam.

&gt;The point I am trying to make, it does not matter whether it is officially called Shia vs Sunni, Christians vs Muslims, leftwing vs rightwing vs communists vs neonazis... The ""fear of difference"" is exploited to turn some groups against others which is the standard modus operandi to keep general population not deal with what's really going on in politics.

I completely agree. The Sunni/Shiite divide in Bahrain is not genuine. It's a clear split that the government has used to turn portions of its populace against each other. In day-to-day life, there is absolutely zero animosity between Sunnis and Shiites, and no one really cares about which sect you belong to (it's mildly important for marriage, but even then it's no big deal). It's just a divide and conquer tactic, really.","1301619787"

[Here is a map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_map_of_Energy_consumption_2001-2003.svg) of world energy consumption from Wikipedia commons (also empirical), and [here is a link](http://apps.who.int/bmi/index.jsp) to WHO's stat-mapper-jiggy. 10% of Norwegians are obese according to the WHO link, and 33.9% of Americans are obese. It is simple logic as a result of that measurement that Americans are, empirically, fatter than Norwegians.

If you wish to say that an empirical trend is incorrect because one person fails (you? Maybe somebody you're thinking about?) to satisfy it, then you either (A) have no desire to be correct, or (B) do not understand what empiricism is.

It is not hate to call a spade a spade, or to call America the fattest industrialized nation in the world, it's just the fucking truth.

It's just that, in my almost 10 years of dealing with Martial Arts subjects on the Internet, I know there are going to be people who'll read all the posts, watch all the videos, and consider themselves satisfactorily skilled on the subject. 

Then they'll get a mudhole stomped in their ass because they should have sought proper instruction, in person, from someone who could evaluate one of the thousands of little things that said person was doing incorrectly.

Granted, in many of the cases like that, I'd be hoping someone got it on video so we can see an epic ass beating.  But there may very well be one or more cases in which someone *genuinely* needs to learn to defend themselves, be it from being raped in a parking lot after a late shift, or from being a victim of violent hazing.

We've got a couple of technique forums on my site, and about 95% of the answers there over the years are prefaced with ""what did your instructor show you?"".  

So I really do appreciate sharing knowledge.  But it needs to be framed within the proper context.  And that context is ""you're really not going to learn anything about fighting unless you're getting in-person instruction"".  That said, there's always room for beginner's discussion; as long as that discussion itself is prefaced with ""well, what did your instructor show you?"".

This site is also offering free shipping for $40+ orders, so have three friends go in on it with you.

1. go to [Simon's Stamps](http://www.simonstamp.com/)
2. click ""Custom-Made Rubber Stamps"" and pick the ""BETTER"" set
3. click the 4912 Printy
4. change ink color to red
5. line 1: Federal endorsement of a deity or religion
6. line 2: violates the United States Constitution
7. make each line bold 7pt Helvetica LT Pro Condensed (condensed really helps in this tiny space)
8. go to the border tab and check ""border on"" and ""border fits text""

If you'd rather use a wood hand stamp you'll need the 1/2"" x 2"" model for this design.

This selection should result in a chunk of text which barely fits inside the open area around ""In God We Trust"" (which on the bill in front of me is roughly 2"" x 3/8""). You can stamp on top of the text rather than crossing it out.

It stays in tune fabulously with the stock tuners, but your luck could have gone the other way.  

For the tuners, don't buy the fender ones unless you have your heart set on them, and I recomend the [Sperzel](http://www.sperzel.com) they are on the other tele in that picture above. Shielding, cap value tuning, and pickups are the things that really made this tele mine.

Reddit has a definite ""percolation point"". If something gets ~150 upvotes quickly, it'll make it to the front page, and then the sky is the limit, people will just see it and upvote it.

If you look at a histogram of post upvotes, you'll see that 99% of them are 0 or 1, then there is a hump right around 100 votes, and then another around 1600 votes. That demonstrates the percolation point. If you can understand these things, you can do consultancy work for advertising and PR firms, like I do, and make a 6 figure salary just by knowing the reddit API, knowing scripts and databasing, and understanding the bandwagon psychology that most of reddit follows, and exploiting it.","1301619808"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Hi, Ben. 

You, Tom, George and the other guys did a damned good job in creating America. Your revolutionary concept of a limited government and individual liberty was wildly successful and is the model for free peoples all over the world. Standards of living have never been higher ... even our poorest people have microwave ovens and air conditioning. 

Our economy is the envy of the world, and women are half the workforce. 

We were one of the first nations to outlaw slavery (cf, horrible civil war) and to give women the right to vote ... true, women could vote in New Jersey back in your day; mad props for that. No, women still can't vote in lots of countries, nor can they own property or sign contracts. Yeah, it blows when you're not an American. 

When totalitarian anti-capitalist dickheads tried to take over the world in the 1940s, we basically saved the entire world. Well, the British helped after we saved them, too. 

Every year millions attempt to migrate to America from all over the world, so we're doing something right despite what the naysayers in this thread are boo-hooing about. 

Thanks, Ben. ","1301619817"

The main target audience is probably people developing websites or web designs, who want to be able to quickly demo a prototype from their laptop without having to go through the hassle of deploying their work to a remote server.  I dunno if that describes you or not. :-)

Think about the hoops you'd have to jump through to expose a personal website running on your laptop to the global Internet.

Yes, you could use SSH, but then your site would have a silly port number in the name. Yes, you could use SSH *and* configure Apache mod_proxy to do name-based forwarding to avoid that, but that's already starting to get complicated. Now try do the same thing for HTTPS... and suddenly the tools don't even exist. :-) 

It's also going to pretty unreliable, as SSH doesn't automatically reconnect or otherwise adapt to changing network topology, and mobile devices change networks all the time. So ideally you'd need wrap your SSH commant in some clever scripts... and now you're starting to reimplement PageKite. :-)

PageKite reduces all those things to one (or two if you run your own front-end) simple command lines. Making a new web server visible to the Internet becomes a mere matter of knowing your username and password with the front-end provider you are using (which could be you, or me, or some ISP).  That's a far cry from the hassles of SSH forwarding or router reconfiguration.","1301619849"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Hubby and I gave up having our hair cut.  We both wear our hair in ponytails.  For our sons, though, we've had the best luck at the least expensive chain store in our area.  The stylists barely speak English.  We point, say yes or no, drag out pictures (they keep books on hand) if needed, and only one time did my son get the wrong haircut.

Unfortunately, the poor kid has absolutely gorgeous bronze hair, and when he wants it cut short, he has to be insistent.

Other than the one time, though, it was all good.

We've taken them to other stylists, including expensive ones, and we always come away wishing we'd gone to the cheap salon.

The one exception to this is the one time one of my kids wanted his hair cut, while we were in Las Vegas.  He loved this barbershop that was in the casino/hotel.  So we went (I had misgivings, but it's his hair) and he actually got a great cut!  Of course, we learned, while the barber was chatting with us, that he was retiring in a few months.  :(

I'm afraid this all goes even further. The occupation that took place 1721 - 1918 couldn't really be comparable to the Soviet Union because all administrative, legal and educational matters were still left to be handled by Germans. Something that they used to be doing since 13th century. Also, we accepted capitalism quite enthusiastically between those periods (1918 - 1939) as before WWII our GDP per capita well exceeded even Finland's. 

So my only real theory is that this stigma was created after 1941, when Germany retook us from Russia (1939 -1941). At the time, we also knew what we were up against, as over 30,000 Estonians had already been deported to Siberia in 1941, and so most Estonians thought they could regain their independence through aligning their forces with German army. Although the mentality in those forces was pro-Estonian, it never was pro-Nazi (UN later on acknowledged that). In 1944, Russians came back and that was that.

I just can't see how this all translates to contemporary world where we've once again accepted capitalism, and we even have growing support for a party that is leaning heavily towards Scandinavian social-democratic model (I think that's a first among post-soviet countries). Could it be that the Kremlin is just trying to shift focus from it's own innerproblems to us, just because, well, we fought ""for"" the Nazis in the WWII, and is basically looking for a scapegoat?","1301619870"

It seems crazy.

Still, I know this, and I know the risk, but it seems silly to piss on money they could have now for money they might not get 4 months from now.

I'm angry because even though they are turning me down in every way from body language to actual verbage, they still want me to put in deposits or ""administration fees"" and file an application to be on a waiting list until I'm gainfully employed.  Not finding a place is frustrating, but not surprising.  But them asking for money anyway for nothing in return is salt in the wound.  It's unconscionable.

As I said, I'm just ranting.  It'll pass, and I certainly have more important things to do than just roam around and waste gas anyway.  I'm just mad....for the moment. 

Edit - I'll add that while I understand the risk, it's silly to me that they would turn down 3 months rent when anybody living there could lose a job in the interim and be just as high risk.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","It's all empirical.

When Michaelson and Morley demonstrated the invariance of the speed of light in 1887, it shook everything up. Suddenly physics — mathematical physics, in particular — had to contend with the fact that all observers, regardless of how they were moving, would see light cross the same distance in the same time.

It wasn't that hard to come up with an algebraic model for how this all worked, by scattering square roots of one minus *v/c* all over the place.

But it was Poincaré — who is not nearly as famous among the laity as he should be — who first saw the hint of a geometric significance hiding beneath all the messy algebra. He realized that there existed a non-abelian isometric *group* — now known as the Poincaré group — that perfectly reproduced all the empirical observations that cascaded off the invariance of the speed of light. Onto the obvious translations and rotations in space, Poincaré tacked a new group of isometric transformations called *boosts* that are both similar to and distinctly different from rotations. If you study the transformation matrices of the Lorentz subgroup sometime, you'll see the parallels, as well as the peculiarities.

But in order to make it all work out, the essential nature of the time coordinate had to be different from that of the space coordinates. Poincaré originally used complex numbers for this, considering a vector in spacetime to be

*x***x** + *y***y** + *z***z** + *ti***t**

by analogy with representing a complex number as *a* + *bi.* This created all sorts of complications, like ambiguities over whether what Poincaré called *apparent time* had any physical significance or not, and it was a bit of an elegant, promising mess.

Meanwhile Einstein was working on the same problem independently, and he got *almost* all the way up to where Poincaré had left off, except he never bothered to include that factor of *i.* He just worked through it all from first principles and ended up with

*x*² + *y*² + *z*² = *ct*²

as an invariant relationship, which if I remember correctly appears *once* in *On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,* almost as an afterthought. ""Oh, by the way, this is a thing now,"" he seems to say. Then he goes back to working on coordinate transformation equations again.

A few years later Minkowski entered the picture, and he basically synthesized the ideas of Poincaré and Einstein, and gave us the geometric interpretation that we all know today to be true. He realized that if you consider the Poincaré group to be the group of isometries that satisfy the condition

*Λ^T η Λ* = *η*

where *η* is a constant-valued metric tensor field with eigenvectors *(1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0), (0,0,0,1)* and eigenvalues *–1, 1, 1, 1,* then suddenly it all just *made sense.* Which is why we call the geometry described by such a metric *Minkowski spacetime.*

And here we are.

Of course, somewhat after that Einstein wondered whether the metric *had* to be exactly *η* everywhere, and then he started studying up *real hard* on his differential geometry, and then he solved gravity. So that was nice.","1301619872"

Agreeing that these songs aren't that experimental or alt.  I don't think this is an issue other than a bit of description correction.

I find the lead vox to sit in an awkward place.  Sounds like the singer wants to punch it up emotively - it's raw - but not convincingly 'big raw'.  Nor is it clean/professional enough to sit comfortably quiet/within limits.  Like I said - awkward.  Gotta give'r, son.  Go for it.

I find the instruments well separated but the overall sound a bit thin.    But I always want to put things at 11 so take this with a grain of salt.

Band is a little loose.  I wouldn't mind some tightening.

That all being said - I thought it was pretty good.  Bit 'immature' - the band has room to develop.

Vox tone is my top issue.

But, if you arrest someone they're innocent even if found guilty because the cops framed them, unless it's a Wall Street case, then it's solid.  Your daily goal is to see how many people you can get to taser, it's a competition among officers to see who can zap the most people each month.  Shooting or tasering a dog is double points.  It's not like cops ever caught a criminal, saved someone from getting badly injured or killed, risked injury or death to protect people, or simply helped someone out.  That's just silly talk to the reddit hivemind universe.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think that one of the most important lessons that schools and universities don't teach you is that schools and particularly universities aren't supposed to teach you everyday skills that morons can do. 

&gt; Income taxes

Are complicated and ever changing. Shouldn't this be taught by someone with a much deeper understanding of your personal context? Like your parents? 

&gt; buying a home

Buying a house is easy. Debt management is something else all together. Another thing that should be taught by parents. 

&gt;  the cost of raising a child

This is already taught in schools. The problem is that just because it's taught, doesn't mean it transfers into knowledge. This should be supported by parents. 

&gt; leasing an apartment

o.O you think schools should be teaching you how to lease an apartment? 

&gt; networking

It's hard to teach networking (with people) as a subject. It's generally much better to simply give kids opportunity to network. Which, really, is the major point of school. 

&gt; office etiquette

Are you fucking kidding me? This is what school is, every single day, doing the same bullshit for someone who has some sort of moral authority that you don't understand. 

&gt; things universities and high schools should teaching but aren't

Universities are supposed to teach some field of science. Not hold your hand and be your parents. ","1301619885"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was in 8th grade, my class took a trip to the now-defunct Six Flags Astroworld and, despite being terrified of roller coasters, was conned into riding this ride coaster called the Viper. It had a single loop, and the cars had lap bars. The friends that had just conned me into riding abandon me to pair up, and I'm left the odd one out. Determined not to pussy out, I climb into the last car left and a little Dominican Sister climbs in beside me. She looks *stoked*, I try not to pass out.

The ride goes alright until we're at the top of the drop, wherein power to the ride fails and we are left dangling down the drop. I'm scrawny and the jerk of the car stopping made me slide out from beneath the lap bar. My sweaty hands can't get a grip on it and I end up sliding almost entirely out. Somehow, I manage not to lose it until the Sister busts out her rosary and begins to pray for me. Instead of, you know, grabbing me and trying to pull me back into my seat.

This lasts maybe 15 minutes or so, I'm in hysterics, and I *still* have to ride the entire fucking ride halfway out of my seat. Haven't been on a roller coaster since.","1301619890"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt; Whatever the correct translation may have been, the passage still says that ""not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until""...""heaven and earth disappear"".

&gt;If heaven and earth have not disappeared then the law engraved in letters on stone is still in effect.

Did you miss the part of my post where I explained this? Where I explain that Jesus is the embodiment of the Law? Where, in his life and death, He represents the totality of the Law? 

It's a pretty integral part of Paul (and Jesus') positions and if you don't understand that, none of anything I've said or will say makes sense.

&gt; But what ""law"" is Paul talking about? Start reading four verses earlier and you will see...

Read a little further back into Romans 2 and you'll see that Paul is talking about both law (in general) and The Law (specific.) Again, I explicitly went over this in my post above. 

&gt; In Romans 3 Paul is talking about a new law, a new covenant. He is not talking about upholding the old law. He is talking about upholding the new covenant, ""the law that requires faith"". Paul is not talking about upholding the ""the law that requires works"".

The reason Paul is not talking about upholding the law that requires works is because he spends Romans 1-2 and the other half of Romans 3 explaining that no one actually does this. In the latter half of Romans - the one we've been quoting from - he explains how we fulfill the law *at all.*

Here's how I tie it together. 

In Matthew 5, Jesus says that he did not come to destroy or abolish the Law but to fulfill the Law. 

1) **Jesus = Law** - where the equal sign represents fulfillment, or the *works* done by Jesus.

In Romans 1-2 and part of 3, Paul says that we failed the Law (of works) test…miserably. We can't get there. 

2) **Man =/= Law**

In Romans 3:21-26 - which is one large allusion to the brick and mortar Law - Paul states that we are ""justified"" (a Law term) through Christ by the ""propitiation"" of his blood (another Law phrase.)

3) **""Man = Jesus""** - where the equal sign represents faith. 

This, in effect, fixes #2, so that in Christ - who acts as the link - we uphold the law of works through the law of faith *(a play on words, btw)* which is what Paul is saying in Romans 3:31

4) **Man = (faith) Jesus = (fulfills/works) Law**

However, if the Prophet (*saw*) has informed us of something about Allah, e.g. if we say, ""Allahus Samad"", it's the Allaah's words about Himself verbatim. There's no way you can say it is not an absolute truth claim, or that it is only a truth claim about a perception.

I think just reading about the Names &amp; Attributes of Allaah swt would set you straight here, not so much about them individually, but the nature each one of them has, e.g. no beginning/end.

edit:: (for further support of that previous statement - Jesus has to be God, whether the bible says it or not, in order for these 2 things to be true at the same time: ""For it is written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."" and ""no one comes unto the father but by me.""

The good news is that you have the neural programming for the exercises intact and so you should quickly be able to recover your lost strength.  Is it going to take time?  Sure, but it won't take anywhere near as long as it took to get it the first go around.

Now here comes the cautionary bit:  You are weaker than you think right now.  When I recovered, thanks to some experimental steroids, I went straight out skiing the next weekend and tried to do what I did before the sickness.  The result was spraining both knees and tearing cartilage in one;  I simply didn't have the muscle mass to support the level of activity I could do before I got sick.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","First off, getting into a free-fall at low altitude is just plain crazy. But anyway, try to create the maximum surface area possible in the direction you are falling and relax, relax, relax. Get your body flat and spread out. If you have a partially open chute (and no reserve), jerk the risers a few times to see if you can pop it. From low altitude, time is not your friend.

With no training, your natural instinct will be go into a fetal position. If you do this, you'll flip over and fall back first (and die).

If doing a military jump, lose the ruck quickly (the extra mass counters the effect of maximizing your surface area).","1301619953"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Preface: I have an identical twin and he accidentally hurt the shit out of me multiple times. 

First scar location: 
in the middle of my scalp, about an inch long. 5 stitches. 

Story: 
My brother and I back in the 4th/5th grade filled a balloon with a lot of water. We then put the balloon in the freezer overnight. The next day after school we removed the balloon and were left with a huge ball of ice. We chopped it in half and each used screw drivers to carve a design into the ice halves. We were carving on the steps on the front porch, my brother a few steps higher than I. He thought it would be a good idea to scare me by throwing the iceball over my head and having it smash in front of me. Needless to say, he did scare me, and that was evident by the inch long gash in my head and blood pouring out and pooling in my shirt. 

The worst part: 
Actually getting the stitches. By the time I got to Urgent Care, the wound was pretty numb and it didn't hurt that much. I received numbing shots directly into my scalp...probably 4 or 5 total, which were excruciatingly painful, and the sites actually bled pretty bad. My mom and brother had to leave the room because blood was spurting out of my head. 

Second Scar Location: 
The inside of my bottom lip. 3 stitches. 

Story:
My brother and I were in the 6th grade. We often swam at the apartments pool, and one day my brother found some slate rock that looked like it could be an amazing skipping rock, so naturally he decided he wanted to try it in the pool. He wanted me to catch it, and at the time I saw that as a challenge, betting him that I could infact catch a rock skipping towards me in the water. I also wanted to have a nice view of it, so in the water I lowered my head to where my lip was just at the water line. He skips the rock (and he was right - this rock was badass), and the rock skips right into my face. It was too fast for me to even react. My lip was bleeding pretty bad into the water, and I ended up getting 3 stitches. My lip was twice the size for a couple of days. 


Third scar location:
On my forearm halfway up. Two stitches. 

Story:
Again, my brother and I....we were playing cops and robbers in the 3rd grade. My brother arrested me by taping my hands together with tape. My grandmother thought this was too harsh as the tape was very tight - so my brother grabbed some scissors to cut me free, except that he wasn't quite in tune with his cutting ability and cut into my arm. 

TL;DR: Thanks, bro. ","1301619956"
"gaming","t5_2qh03","I am a long time SOE player, I was there when EQ1 launched. My account has all the uber veteran rewards.

I am a masochist.

The games are Gems, they are 100% pure awesome in ""Raw"" form.

Then a jeweler comes along...a developer...and he is going to sculpt this beautiful gem into something great.

So he carves it into the shape of a steaming pile of shit.

This isn't what we want with our gem, so they fire that developer...and I learn to love our steaming pile of shit gem...cause after all its still precious to us...its still a gem right?

Then another guy comes a long...I can fix your steaming pile of gem shit. Only to find out he has carved your steaming pile of shit gem down into a mouse turd, and hands it back to you.

The cycle repeats...we keep loving our shitty gems, but sooner or later we realize all that is left is gem dust. Those are the memories of great adventures through a land of ""What-Could-Have-Been"".

p.s. SOE is a company out for money, they do not control what gets released, the developers do. They have been hiring and firing them like crazy for years because they are all complete fucktards.

It's also a known fact that companies routinely negotiate animal treatment with PETA in advance in order to preempt protests, which has in some ways given them more de facto direct control over animal welfare in this country than even the government exercises.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I read it and found it unenlightening and largely unrelated. 

I wonder if this explanation of the LTV would suit you. I've read this piece and still find the same flaws in the theory. http://www.marxist.com/marx-marxist-labour-theory-value.htm

The only rebuttal against the gold in a desert example is 

&gt; If we want to understand the social division of labour imposed by the market, we need to understand how an expansion of demand calls forth a capital inflow and an increase in the supply of the vast bulk of goods that can be increased in quantity by human effort. That bourgeois economists spend so much time contemplating the situation of people seated beside abundant springs or dying of thirst in the desert only shows how remote they are from the real production process.

Which amounts to ""well that's outside of the normal sphere of production and consumption, so it doesn't count"". This is, of course, bullshit. We can find many examples where labor is a far worse predictor of value than utility within the sphere of production and consumption. In fact, one of the greater criticisms of capitalism is that it produces product fetishism and results in irrational booms and busts in product values through fashion. On any given day a pair of jeans made by Calvin Klein will be roughly equivalent to the value of a pair made by Levi. Both use similar materials and take the same amount of average time to produce. In the course of a single night the value of the CK jeans can double, and remain that way for years, due to a particularly effective advertising campaign, a celebrity wearing them, a TV show featuring them, etc. The value of the CK jeans is now 2x that of the Levi jeans, despite the fact that the labor input in both is identical. To claim that this only captures the short/mid term value of the item and that in reality the long term value is identical explains nothing. In the course of another two months all jeans could fall out of fashion, making the jeans of both companies essentially worthless. The jeans may never come back into fashion, and their value vis a vis other products will be permanently degraded. This is true, mind you, while the labor value in the jeans has not changed a whit. The LTV is only a good predictor of value outside of reality. In economics we look for theories that explain how products actually come to be valued, and the LTV is inappropriate, worthless and wrong. ","1301619997"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This takes place at Schlitterbahn in Texas last year, on the ""raging rapid""s portion of the lazy river.  So go with a group of friends and get on and I'm thinking this is not going to be ""raging"" in any form of the word.  So I hop on a raft with my friend and we're going and as expected it wasn't intense at first, and then we hit this patch of ""white water"" and because of the way we hit it we both got chucked off the raft and into the melee of water and people.  

Now, you're probably thinking okay this is 3 feet of water max (correct) and on a ride that's open to kids (correct again) she'll be fine!

So at first I am slightly frightened (I was taken by surprise), and a little confused and REALLY embarrassed, and a little amused.  But then as I reach for the raft again and try to get back in, I realize I don't see my friend and I'm being sucked under the water.  So down I go.  I did
manage to get a breath so I'm not too concerned, until I lose my raft
and my friends (we'd all gone down in a group) and I'm sucked under
and spun around once again.  So now I'm actually starting to really
freak out.  Like panic had started setting in and just as I'm thinking
holy crap I might actually drown at Schlitterbahn on the ""raging
rapids"" I feel the hand of a lifeguard grab me and pull me to the
surface.  So once again I am super embarrassed and super grateful and all I manage is an ""OMG thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","&gt; Masters League ""theorycrafting"" is anecdotal anyway.

Moreso than the lower leagues? I doubt it.

With sc2 requiring less mechanical skill than sc1, players with a better understanding of the game and general strategy can do well. You can make masters with less than 80apm. Therefore masters players(and maybe high diamond) have a much more dynamic understanding of the game than the players in the lower leagues. A better understanding leads to more than just comparing X and Y(and ignoring A-W) and leaping to the conclusion:

&gt;I was wrong, it seems marines, at least on levels where intense micro is unable, are unbeatable unless you completely out micro your terran foe and can waste a ton of resources on mass sentry, HT, or mass Blings. 

Masters players are also more likely to realize where they go wrong in a game, unlike some lower league players who blame their loss on external factors (balance). They have seen most builds, and tested numerous counters, they have a much better understanding of their matchup. Not to say that lower league players can't understand how intricate balance is and consider that before making statements, but they are far more likely to misunderstand the multiple dynamics of the game(like the OP did) and make false assertions.

/r/photography

There are wonderful subreddits that fit the niche of different images. If people think that /r/pics should just be one thing or the other, then they can go to another subreddit that specializes in that type of photography or photo.

My point is that this post is not about a picture, just like how an jpg that is just text isnt a photo.

Not a signle bit of the discussion here has anything remotely to do with what this subreddit /r/pics is about. In fact, at the top of the page is says ""Please, no DAE posts. There is a subreddit for that.""

This is a DAE post even if that isnt in the title. The picture is just the title of the show.

I think that belongs in /r/entertainment.

Also, saying enjoy it or GTFO is pointless. A community changes based on who is there. It's an active river.

I am perfectly within reson to complain about a DAE post when there is a sticky at the top of the subreddit saying DONT DO THIS. Seriously. Telling me to GTFO for echoing the rules of the subreddit... that's funny.","1301620032"

I know a number of people in my department that are in therapy now because the stress is overwhelming. Additionally, the job market for a lot of (but not all) Psych PhDs is horrible.

Make sure you go into graduate school with a clear idea of what it is that you want to do (as a job) when you graduate, and a clear picture of what you need to accomplish to be hired (How many 1st author pubs? How many clinic hours? How many symposium talks?)

The bottom line is, you need to figure out what it is that you want to do. Not just what you like to do (not just ""I want to help people"", or ""I want to do research""). Spend some time figuring out a job, be precise, and ask people with that job what they did to get that job and do that. 

Graduate school is a tough 2-5 years, but if/when you realize that what is waiting for you at the end of that time is a job you don't want, and can't get because it is too competitive, then those years seems like an eternity in hell. However, if you know you want it, and fight to get it then grad school can be a great choice.","1301620045"

At the end of the day, Fukushima hasn't been a 'natural' disaster but a man made one. An archaic reactor design failed to withstand events at a level that have been documented on multiple historical occasions along the same coast.

Add in an operator with a culture of secrecy, denial, compliant regulators, and poor planning and response to events and you have what will be known as the textbook level 6 event on the INES scale.

At the very least, TEPCO shareholders have lost 4 reactors, and are now liable for a very expensive containment and cleanup operation. If you have been following the JAIF press releases, you would know that a neighboring plant has 3 out of 4 reactors at a level 3 incident status.

Adjusting for spin, there is a high likelihood that those additional reactors, and units #5 and #6 are either a write off or at the very least face a long interruption to service. 4 reactors destroyed, and 6 additional reactors that may never run again. No reactor, no power, no profit.

And all this is not even considering the cost to people who lived in the area around the reactor. People, especially those from the US, have no idea how small Japan is. The US is over 4000km, coast to coast, but Honshu, the main island of Japan is 200km or so across the Fukushima region. Japan is an old world country, where towns and cities were laid out when foot travel was the predominant form of transport for the population. Villages and communities are close together and tightly knit. Draw a 30km exclusion zone around any point and you cut the heart out of the country.","1301620062"

Because these high/low distinctions there are subsets of each. The levels of these lipoproteins are determined by a multitude of factors (with dietary cholesterol being an insignificant part of the equation). Cholesterol is absolutely essential for every cell in your body along with the production of key hormones. Your liver produces a certain amount every day way above your dietary intake and adjusts its production on the fly based on dietary intake.

That's only a thin slice of what architecture can be. 

I never studied art or design and entered straight into architecture. It's a programme that requires interest in anything and everything if necessary. you have to be interested in the philosophy of planning, towns, archival, construction, memory, place if the brief demands it.

portage seems to be more of the general family town where people live and commute to work in kalamazoo, i dont go there much except to hit up Treasure Quest once in a while cause they have old games/systems. idk bout the middle/highschool systems tho, didnt attend em and dont have kids.

"Health","t5_2qh9z","We had a totally unregulated system here for quite some time. The problem in allowing entirely unrestricted markets in medicine is that there is insufficient information for markets to be efficient. Efficient markets require a large number of participants both as buyers and sellers, and requires approximate parity on information. Since any individual physician cannot do rigorous studies of every medication available, probably not even a single one, the supplier holds all the cards. If you look at markets in the third world where regulation is minimal, you'll find that medicine is extremely cheap. At the same time, counterfeits are rampant and many things that do not work are sold alongside real medicine. Since it is impossible for consumers to differentiate between very good, okay, and outright useless medications, there is no incentive for innovation. You can't sell a new medicine when it's no more salable than snake oil.

As you brought up, the question of trust is huge. While the FDA often approves things it turns out it shouldn't have, and often fails to approve other things that look good, individual physicians are at least as susceptible to corruption and industry influence. The pharmaceutical industry has been spending fortunes selling medicine to doctors, every year for decades. They're smart people - they wouldn't keep doing it if there was no influence. We can infer from the continued massive spending that there is proportionately massive influence on prescribing preferences.

We also have virtually no regulation on dietary supplements. When you visit a drug store, you'll find that they sell a huge number of fully ineffective homeopathic ""medications,"" as well as many totally unnecessary vitamins. Some, such as inhaled Zicam, are even harmful. ","1301620087"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; Surely any technology will cause ethical issues to some extent. That's not a useful prediction.

Moor predicted the specific mechanism for this.  You haven't looked at my other reference, have you?  *sigh.*

&gt; Instead, people made predictions like ""robots will cook our meals"" and ""people will drive flying cars to work"" and ""people will live on the Moon"".

That is a trope.  People have been making accurate predictions for years.  Again, *simply because you have never been on the inside of that phenomenon is not a reason to believe that it has not occurred.*  You only think that because you are imaginationless, and apparently quite stupid.

&gt; A valid prediction would be ""entire encyclopedias will be contained in a handheld device"".

Your criterion for ""valid"" is hopelessly precise.  When phones were developed, phone companies knew *everyone was going to want one* so they invested in the technology.  Cellular technology didn't appear out of thing air--people had the idea back in the 70s and said ""Y'know, if we could make a wireless phone, it would be fucking massive!""  They did the research, engineered the devices, did the marketing, the whole nine.

Once *again*, simply because *you* cannot predict what will happen does not mean that *other people* are not doing it, or that it has not been happening regularly.

&gt; So I made a spelling error, and you failed to come up with a single valid example of a technology prediction.

You have also made errors in logic, critical thinking, basic reasoning...I think we're finished here.  You are beyond help.  I wash my hands of you, dumbass.","1301620098"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","C++ is usually seen more than C# simply because C# is Microsoft's baby, and was borne from C++, which was in turn derived from C. C++ is openly available to anyone, C# not so much. But if you're already doing VB.NET, the transition to C# may be easy to do. I've never done much with any .NET technology, but that's not anything against it, it's just not what I'm familiar with.

As far as hours estimates, I have no idea. The equivalent of a 1-semester course should be enough to grasp the basics of C, and maybe another semester-equivalent after that to get a firm grasp on the extensions of C++. But you will never ""know"" everything - there's always things to see that you've never come across before.

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","I stopped drinking myself about 2 months ago.  it wasn't that I was drinking way too much, but the steady usage of it to achieve relaxation meant that I weakened my own power to control my own state of mind and mood.  that little pool of chemicals was always waiting to splash into and call it a day, give up, erase.

mindfulness training is about being able to control your own mind. to not let impulses and childish responses take over.  buddhism also encourages release from troubles, attachments, stress and desire.  (release in contrast to the initial tension you get from trying to learn how to concentrate.)

I've become much more malleable and I'm able to steadily improve my mindfulness and then address the deeper issues that are holding me back. and of course those are the things that would cause me to want to let loose with drinking.

with even light drinking and especially if I drank a lot, it would take days to get back to where I was, and so I just wandered further and further away from being in control of my own emotional state.  less control of self ... more drinking... more wandering off.

so I said that I did it because it interfered with my yoga and meditation.  I like addressing things in positives.

Exactly.  I am saying that funding under a voucher program, even where 80% of them are religious, has absolutely NOTHING to do with the the actual principle of separation of church and state.  The first amendment's text, ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,"" is not effected at all by the funding of a voucher program to schools.  This is especially true due to the fact that, even if the voucher programs beneficiaries tend to attend religiously affiliated schools, there is not a unified or endorsed religion here.

Take for example the horse slaughter ban in the United States.   Terrible thing for horses.  Unwanted horses were being turned free and starving to death because people couldn't feed them and they couldn't take them to a sale for HUMANE SLAUGHTER (HEY DOGS NEED TO EAT TOO).   Do you think this horse slaughter ban saved all the horses????? Do you think HSUS started taking care of all these ""saved horses""???? Hell no.   Eventually American Horses are still going to slaughter.  They are sold at sales and now taken to Canada and Mexico to be killed.   The worst thing about Horse slaughter has always been the transportation process where they are jam-packed in unsafe cargo trailers.  Now they just have longer to go...... WAY TO GO HSUS!   This is just one example.   
I am also a dog show person.  I like purebred show dogs-- which HSUS wants to end all planned dog breeding.  When they couldn't do it Nationally with the PAWS Bill, they decided to go after dog breeders State by State.  Which Fuck them.  It is my right to decide if I want to breed my own dog, or ""adopt"".   I don't tell people that they MUST adopt children.   Don't tell me that I must adopt a dog.   HSUS IS THE DEVIL. ","1301620124"

Why are the quotes/testimonials bulleted? It makes zero sense.

You should look into using some kind of grid for layout, nothing is aligning here on any side. Lines align with each other, but each section is just all over the place in relation to each other.

Line space between the large ""Back Pain?"" heading is waaay to large. 

The logo on the ""Back Pain?"" side is way too close to the right edge of the page. 

The script font is completely inappropriate for this application, it does nothing for the tone of the piece.

You should hang bullets in a bulleted list (there shouldn't be text directly under a multi-line bullet point) - like so:
 
    • This is a bullet's first line
      this is the second line

You have a really bad widow (single word from a sentence being bumped onto its own line)


That image of the doctors abruptly ending at one of their shoulders is just painful. It just creates some really awkward space to the left

So, genetic counselors are a resource usually found at a hospital, in maternal-fetal medicine (MFM), or working with a company like Genzyme. They work with couples/people/whoever who are either pregnant or want pre-conception counseling to help them determine the risks of certain genetic diseases. A lot of the work is based on detailed pedigrees as well as testing the parents (for diseases like Tay-Sachs, etc) and then using chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis (depending on gestational date) as well as maternal blood tests to determine the presence and/or probability of a problem with the fetus. From there, the counselors job is to explain the probabilities (also informed by maternal age and ethnicity and ultrasound results) in a way the patient(s) can understand. And from *there* it is a counselor's job to help the patient(s) decide what to do, whether it's to go on with the pregnancy or terminate or find resources like other parents whose child might have the same genetic issue. 

[This](http://kidshealth.org/parent/medical/genetic/genetic_counseling.html) site has a pretty good (read: better than mine) explanation of the job.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Okay, so you know the basic mechanics of the game. Here's a bit of basic strategy.

Let's say that [this](http://i.imgur.com/d5szu.jpg) is your initial configuration. So you know there are going to be mines [here](http://i.imgur.com/QvFRx.jpg) because the 1s are in the corners. Easy, right?

But now, think about what you've done to the board. All the 1s that are touching those flags are now essentially 0s because there are no unfound mines touching them. Likewise, all the 2s that are touching a single flag now behave like 1s. Using just this information, you can now add [these](http://i.imgur.com/zNAMw.jpg) flags to your board. Also, just like the 1s in the corner, that 4 only has four available squares, so we know they are all [mines](http://i.imgur.com/YBYnb.jpg).

Any square that is touching a number that we've reduced to 0 (from this point referred to as a functional 0) is safe to click. Also, you can hold your mouse over a functional 0, hold the right button down, and click it with the left button. This will reveal all the un-flagged squares surrounding it. Now our board looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Gm0H1.jpg).

Using just this basic method, you can clear much of the board. However, as you play more, you'll notice a few configurations that always have the same outcome, such as this [1-2-1](http://i.imgur.com/DQ03u.jpg). if there are 0s on one side of this configuration (such as in our example) the outcome will always be [thus](http://i.imgur.com/uM3ZP.jpg). Also, any time you have a [1-2-2-1](http://i.imgur.com/jbYmR.jpg) configuration, the outcome will always be [thus](http://i.imgur.com/mAsOq.jpg).

These hints may seem very situation specific, but they also work if your configuration contains functional 1s and 2s (ie, the actual posted numbers are 2-3-2, but they are all touching one bomb. Sorry, but that would have taken to long to get randomly).

I really hope this helps. If you need any more tips, just ask.

TL;DR Just read the fucking thing, I spent a lot of time uploading those visual aids.

edit: for that 2-3-2 example, it would be like [this](http://i.imgur.com/QYgu9.jpg). (Sorry for the terrible MSPainting)","1301620143"

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","May I suggest helping some one else?  I've found that helping others makes me feel better about myself. Maybe join a volunteer organization of some kind. 


When I've felt this way in the past, it has been when I was alone. In my case, being married gives me someone to care about and someone who I think cares about me. It makes a big difference. Since you are probably still very young (anything under thirty is ""very young"" to me ;-) because you mentioned school, get yourself a live-in girlfriend/boyfriend. I've read that even having a pet helps. Not knowing your specific circumstances (gender, age, etc) makes it impossible to make specific recommendations, but I think that most humans are not ""wired"" to live alone, and yet I know several (older) people who have ended up living alone and only one of them likes it that way (my 87 year old aunt). 


The problem seems to be the ""no feelings towards anyone"". You need to find some one or some thing that you *do* care about, but you already know that. Try to find something inside yourself that *would* make you care about someone else -- preferably of the opposite (or desirable) gender and then seek out someone like that. Treat it like a homework assignment and attack it objectively since it will be very difficult to get yourself emotionally motivated to do it. I think humans are naturally social or ""tribal"" creatures and that living alone creates this feeling of immense apathy. 


I know it's small consolation, but consider that (apparently) you have a home and ample food, clothing, etc. There are a vast number of people who have neither. ","1301620141"

being boy scouts, we knew all about flint napping and how to make sharp edges.  we promptly broke into a flint fight, where we would pick up two stones, smack em together at an angle, and then throw the now-razor-sharp rocks at each other.

the scars are from repeatedly using my arms to block an incoming stone.  funny thing is, none of the cuts was deep, and none of them produced more than a few pinprick drops of blood, but 14 years later, i still have scars from it.","1301620149"

To say that conservative ""thought"" is the enemy rather than the 'partisan' propaganda based on misinformation and disinformation?  Just expose the truth, over and over again.  Keep exposing the problems, keep learning, keep bringing attention to the rot.  But don't make your neighbors your enemies.  It's dumb.  It's ""Us"" and ""Them"" politics and given a long enough timeline, I know that in Us and Them politics I lose autonomy and freedom. 

I'm lower-middle class in the US.  I've worked in non-profit fields my whole life.  I recognize that any real change is going to be based on local resiliency.  If you want to do something, grow some food, curb your consumption, research your choices. Stop feeding the corps.  Start learning how to take care of local needs locally.  Build power-with, not a new form of power-over. 

There's this underlying assumption among a lot of people that we need to start killing bankers.  I don't think that this is a good idea.  I don't think the violence will end at bankers.  I think it will be used on a wider and wider definition of ""them"".  We'll get a leftist totalitarian bullshit world then and I'll be dead fighting the new ""them"".  

The bankers can't hold their shit together any more.  It's falling apart.  If you want to kill the bankers, get a list of the 1,000 richest people in the world, and get everyone to give every bit of their currency to them.  That way, the endless greed of the top 1/100th of one percent is actually fulfilled in a way that makes it meaningless. 

That's a reset button.  We need an economic reset.  We don't need a war against the rich, because they'll use a fucking ton of declining resources to fight the poor.  We need to just call 'em on their game. ","1301620151"

Use alcohol (90%+ isopropyl) and a cloth to clean the blades carefully. This takes time and is a PITA, but imo, it's worth it. You use Alcohol instead of water is because alcohol evaporates in a matter of minutes. Wear gloves if it's really nasty. 

Alternatively, if the fans are pretty cheap to begin with, you could just throw them away and buy new fans. Imo, if the fans are really gunked up, I would just buy new fans and keep them clean from now on.

Regardless: She has poor body image, but won't exercise to change it--so it's obviously not OVERWHELMING her. this is a problem in her head, that she has to fix--it's about self esteem. If YOU fix it, she's dependent on you to solve issues, and her self esteem won't change. This will sound  bad, but if this doesn't resolve itself, this poor self esteem will take a toll on the relationship.

Continue to be supportive, and always tell her she's beautiful, etc. Don't tell her constantly, but when appropriate, and if she asks. That makes your opinion valuable to her. If you tell her over and over, 8 times a day, whenever she wants it, she'll dismiss it, and no longer have that support. 

In addition, maybe get her something to be proud of in general--a new hobby or talent, perhaps. it'll increase her self worth, and at least get her mind off things.

(A): It was not God's intent that the sexual organs be used for self-enjoyment. God designed sexual organs for the use of procreation. Masturbation is unnatural to God's intent.

There are individuals who through no fault of their own can not stop this behavior, it is a psychological problem that may have originated in the individual's youth due to rape, incest, or childhood sexual experience with other children.

Some advice:

* Generate from pairs of words instead of single words, it's much more readable though you need a bigger input corpus
* Get a bigger input corpus. Don't just use the last 200 posts from reddit every 300s, write them to a db so your input grows over time
* Get a smaller input corpus. Trim the oldest entries from the db from time to time so the markovs can still be generated quickly. I had a cron job that would delete anything more than a month old from the dungarmatic db, which kept it trimmed to about 1 000 000 words of input most of the time. If I let it get much bigger than that it became laggy, but at that size humans wouldn't notice the generation delay.","1301620265"

"OneY","t5_2s5ni","&gt;My mother (in so many words) told me that I am, sexually, a brutish opportunist and that my testes would make me rape

That makes me so sad. I've encountered a number of men who have grown up ashamed of their maleness and ashamed of their sexual desires.

I love men, and I love the sexuality of men. I love the way men look naked and erect. I love the richness of their lust, their bodily attentiveness to my own body. But so many men fight with this in themselves—so afraid to hurt or degrade, wistful with sense of lost innocence, and burdened with deep-seated guilt borne entirely of this definition of ""innocence"" that requires self-denial.

It depresses me to imagine the men I've love in my life living like this. I spent so much of my younger life struggling with the shame of my own sexuality—trying *so* hard not to masturbate, and feeling guilty for days after losing my resolve—but at least I understood that it was only on my own head. I was not afraid that my sexuality was *also* somehow injurious to those I cared most for and had these sexual urges toward.

I have now come to accept that there is purity and honesty in sex. It is an expression of love and reciprocal trust like little else two people can do together. Sex is a part of who we are, and the most innocent of us, unblemished by external guilt, would enjoy it more freely than the rest of us can bring ourselves to. I *love* sex, and I try very hard to show my partner how much it means to me—that, in my eyes, it is not a service I *allow* him, but a gift he grants me.

I wish I could give your younger self a hug. No child should ever be raised in self-hatred; *that* is how innocence is destroyed.","1301620272"

hears a bad interpretation of the dream seen, one finds himself overwhelmed
by the thought that he is going to be hit by some misfortune.
And it appears in Hadith that Allah Ta'alai said: (Arabic) that is, 'I
am with the opinion of My servant about Me.' In other words, 'whatever
a servant of Mine believes Me to be, just that I become for him.' So,
when one ends up believing that misfortune is going to come from Allah
Taaii, then, true to the customary practice of Allah, the coming of that
misfortune becomes due against him.","1301620296"

In my mind the big difference between an all-in and cheese is that cheese happens from the get-go, whereas all-ins can happen at any point in the game. All-inning is usually more of a response to how the game has progressed to hopefully *save* yourself, whereas cheesing is designed to shape how the game will play out, hopefully *not* screwing yourself. Under these definitions I'd say that cannon rushes are indeed cheese. You could also argue that a lot of responses to cheese (particularly late or non-scouted) end up being all-ins (pretty much anytime you *must* cut workers to survive).

semantics, lol. =P

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","To my knowledge, protein supps. are useful to repair muscles and make gains in size and strength. The amount of protein needed for size gain is about the weight of lean muscle x 2.75 and that'll give an estimate of the amount of protein in grams you should consume a day. Most people can't get this amount of protein in a day through regular food, so that's where protein comes in. Your body is very efficient, so the extra protein that you take are either converted to fat (protein are also sources of calories) or broken down into amino acids that all your cells uses. The only situation I can think of where you piss out the amino acid is if you consumed a ton of protein at once (like a 75-100 g protein shake).

Is protein worth it? I'd say so because it's convenient and a cheaper way to get your protein. My protein shake has 30 servings, and each serving has 21g of protein, and each scoop cost less than $1 (the tub cost around $22). I'd be spending more money getting the same amount of protein if I were to get it from fish/meat/poultry.","1301620303"

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","A little more detail to story:

I'm a pretty broke/poor college student- working two jobs, paying for everything on my own, etc. etc. Even the smallest amount of money is helpful to me. So, I'm at the gas station today and a lady comes up to me, her brother sitting in the passenger seat of the car, and begins babbling nervously. She is dressed in army garb and explains that she is heading on her way home(about 30 miles away) from taking her brother (also military) to his physical therapy sessions in my town. However, they've ran out of gas and she realizes she's left her purse at home. She repeatedly tells me how embarrassed she is and how she's really sorry. I tell her that it's alright, that it will be alright, and that I have a $10 bill that she can have, the only cash I have on me that I really can't afford to give away (rent, bills, etc.). She once again babbles along at how grateful she is, how she doesn't know how to repay me,and how she is so thankful for it. She even tells me that it is the most appreciated 5$ that I've ever spent. Then I tell her, ""Mam, don't worry about it... Today you, tomorrow me."" (The perfect opportunity arose, I had to say it!!) She then wells up in tears and whispered thanks and got back in her car. 


Reddit, I know I didn't have money to give really, but it feels so damn good to make a small sacrifice to benefit someone else in need. Yeah it wasn't much, especially with gas prices these days, but that lady's gratitude made me feel awesome and I'm happy I was able to change her bad day into a better day.","1301620305"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","I couldn't agree more. In 2005 I was making $8.00 an hour. In 2009 I finally broke through and make ~65k. In 2010 I hit 6 figures.


How? I worked my fucking ass off. School was 10 hours per day on a light week plus weekends excluding Friday night. I paid for it all myself. I moved across the country to an area where I knew no one.


I went from a college grad with very little experience to directing 25k/week worth of engineering technicians on contract work.


Out of all the people I know that have a similar amount of income at my age (27) I would say that half did it my way and half just had it handed to them one way or another. I don't know many though so my numbers don't mean that much to me yet. It seems like as the dollar values go up, the percentage of people who got their money from entitlement goes way up. I mean... 400 people own half the money in the USA.


Usually the real help that wealthy people get is this: BUSINESS CONTACTS. I had none when I started. Zero people in my family are useful to me in any way career wise. I don't know very many colleagues who wouldn't say the exact opposite. I guess I got the shoulder the burden of bringing my family line out of steerage.","1301620308"

The original assertion to which I am responding to is this:

&gt; It's all about calories in vs calories out - it's the First law of Thermodynamics!

Now, see.... this assumption is asinine because it assumes we're a closed system. Hell, do you know that melanin in your skin can generate heat from UV-B rays? But that's beside the point. If we assume that, for the sake of argument, humans are closed systems that obey the laws of thermodynamics by way of only two variables: physical energy expenditure, and caloric intake.

If we assume this, that MUST imply that the conversion of food energy due to a chemical process, into biomechanical energy is 100% efficient. **This** is precisely where the Second Law comes into play.","1301620310"
"gaming","t5_2qh03","That's called a laser boat. You take a medium mech like a Shadowcat, strip it bare, install a large engine, load it up with heatsinks and jumpjets and fill the remaining slots with medium lasers. Fucking leg 100 tonners with one shot and you were fast as hell. The downside was you couldn't take any hits yourself. It's almost like playing Quake with a railgun.

A lot of people traded off engine size to allocate that weight for extra weapons, but I felt that anymore than six chained M-Lasers was just overkill, so I would put the largest engine on that bitch and run circles around other boaters.

I also would forgo a few heatsinks for maxed anti-missile systems. I discovered a tactic where if a missile boat (some guy loaded up with LRM20s) unloaded on you, reverse the mech and hit the jumpjets. If done correctly you made a reverse arc away from the inbound missles that maximized the distance and time your AMS had to destroy them. A Swarm of forty rockets could be mitigated to 3-5 1 hp hits with a little practice. That really surprised one opponent I fought who couldn't hit me for the life of him and decided to outfit his mech with missiles for the autotarget. Yeah that didn't work out as intended.","1301620310"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","What?  You are claiming that men, who are not these young girls fathers or in any way or shape influencing their lives, are TRAINING these same young girls?  How does that work?  I am pretty sure that your answer will be the typical feminist one about women getting validation from older men due to their looks or something similiar which just tells me that women are more cognizant of beauty being their main manipulating tool than most men are.

There is a good South Park episode on this, where one of the girls sprouts breasts and all the boys turn into apes.

You can claim whatever you want but women trend towards older partners while men don't.  This is found in almost every culture on the planet.  This is due to what women find attractive in men and what men find attractive in women.  I find it interesting how you and another poster both mention johnny depp.  I don't doubt that women find men physically attractive as well, the main difference is that men, for the most part, aren't willing to bang and date a pruny old hag even if she is rich and powerful and high status.  

I have seen the opposite my entire life though, girls in middle school wanted to date high schoolers and high school girls wanted college age guys and college age girls want graduate school or older guys.  Hell, I was even friends with girls in middle school who were fucking guys in their 20s.  These girls weren't the victims, they bragged about it to each other and were the ones chasing the guys.

You forget that women are the sexual selectors in the mating game. You disagree with their selection and moralize it and project it onto the male and then claim it is some kind of rape.  Now I actually don't think that young women should be with older men but the laws around this are all sorts of fucked up.  Also, just because many women chase older men doesn't mean there aren't men who are predatory towards younger women.  Also, why should I give a shit?  Female hypergamy combined with their bitchy nature screws over many men and then after treating men like shit you expect those same men to be white knights and protectors....it doesn't work that way.  Also, psychology is bullshit and so are studies done by feminists.","1301620345"

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","Couple of nights back I was riding home from work at night, there had been a light rain shower so the roads were greasy. Going round a roundabout a little too fast for the conditions, went through a long pothole while leaned over. Back end was all over the place. There wasn't a lot I could do about it, I just kept the throttle steady and rode it out.

On the same ride, before going home I decided to fill the tank. My local petrol station has 24 hour pay-at-pump service and it's great going at night as there are no queues. I was very careful approaching the pump as I expected the wet conditions plus the usual spilled fuel and oil would be dangerous. After stopping I tested the ground with my foot and confirmed that it was indeed quite slippery. As I was leaving I passed a car that was by the kerb, engine off but lights on. As I pass it the driver sounds his horn repeatedly, so I brake a few yards ahead. I skid a little, put my foot down, my foot slips but somehow I stay upright. I look back wondering wtf the guy wants. After a few seconds the car moves forward and I wait for him to pull alongside me and tell me what the fuss is about. Dude just drives past and vanishes into the night.

The next morning I saw a moped nearly lose it as his back slid out going too fast around a corner in wet conditions. To his credit he didn't panic, he rode it out and accelerated as soon as he regained traction.

Today was quite windy. Not the worst I've ridden in but less than pleasant. A side wind with gusts of about 40mph. My little bike was getting blown all over the road. Coming the other way there was another small bike, looked like some kind of dual sport. A big gust hit us and we were both swerving like mad as we fought to stay in our lanes. As we passed we gave each other the most understanding ""I know the shit you have to put up with, I put up with it too"" nod I have experienced. A simple head movement can sometimes convey a lot. A few seconds later I nearly got blown under a lorry and my response was to start laughing maniacally and open the throttle some more. Fuck nature.","1301620364"

"apple","t5_2qh1f","It's definitely worth getting an SSD.  A hard drive is the slowest part in your system and is generally the cause of any perceived slowness of a computer.  SSDs are literally an order of magnitude or two faster than any hard drive, especially in random performance which is what makes a system feel 'snappy'.  

But don't buy from Apple.  The next generation of SSDs is hitting and they're much faster than even the best from the last generation (which Apple's lags behind).  The one I'm getting is the OCZ Vertex 3, which should come out in a week or two hopefully.  And the latest Macbook Pros even have SATA3, so you could take full advantage of it.  And it's no big deal to replace a hard drive in a Macbook.

On the other points, others in this thread have good advice.  I'd seriously consider saving the $500 elsewhere and popping for a Vertex 3 though (less than that if you only need 120 gigs).  Oh, and on the Cinema displays - they're fairly priced if you need a huge, color-accurate, beautiful monitor.  Otherwise, there's far cheaper for almost as good.  The size and resolution change (from 30 to 27 inches) was because of the industry's annoying change from 16:10 panels to 16:9 panels - it lost height but not width.","1301620382"

Yep.  I work with a woman who dropped her iPhone 4 in the bathtub.  She then took it apart and punctured the battery trying to pry it out.  She took the pieces to the Apple store expecting to buy a new one but instead they swapped it out for a brand new one.  Another guy in our office who was trying to decide between an iPhone and Android went out and bought an iPhone that night.

My ex was talking about how he was in the locker room and some of the guys made him feel bad. It's not like he looked, he just noticed that one of his friends was really big while flaccid, so he must have been huge! I laughed and explained that there is no correlation between the size of a flaccid penis and an erect one, and the only real way to know if he was bigger was to judge them side-by-side erect. He refused, obviously.

I've also had to explain to another guy what a circumcision was and that he was indeed circumcised.

I just want it out of the business of making a small number of people fabulously rich with my tax dollars and *borrowed* money.  But picking and choosing which subsidies to end won't work - it'll just put more lobbyists in Washington making a case for why *their cause* should be supported.  So ideally you end *all* subsidies.

The federal government should be limited to doing the basic tasks outlined in the Constitution, not subsidizing corn/sugar/tourism/etc.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Those are top statutory tax rates. One of the biggest tricks people use to criticize US corporate taxes is to refer to the top possible rate, which no one pays. The effective corporate tax rate--what corporations actually pay--is 25%, which is lower than the 26% average corporate tax rate for developed nations (and that's not including the VAT that almost all other developed nations have). [KPMG report](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kpmg.com%2FQA%2Fen%2FIssuesAndInsights%2FArticlesPublications%2FDocuments%2FCorp-and-Indirect-Tax-Oct12-2010.pdf&amp;ei=nCWVTdrEDMmjtgfBo5H9Cw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEkus_iju-fPj0QoyY_3R16lHIXBA&amp;sig2=p5gEaxu7L2aENVm-k5jOuA).

"education","t5_2qhlm","This campus is the least expensive in a good distance. Which some people think ""Money = quality of education"" which is not the case. However, studies have shown that money does have a part in students who excel in school. Low income households tend to stay low income through lack of education. We have also found that only 10% of graduates who attend our campus received financial aid. 90% of the low income students do not graduate, but usually remain students for a long time.  

If a parent wants their socially inept kid out of the house, they will choose a cheap daycare. Sometimes I feel like I work at a daycare. Another fun story...

A student (who was a student when I was a student, but still is a student) has been living on campus through the funds of the state and his grandmother. He has never had a job, bank account, or really any responsibility outside household chores. His girlfriend and him decided to have a baby because they would get a bigger pel grant and more assistance from the state. As well as a larger place to live. We can all be happy they did not succeed. 

One of the other instructors and I tour other technical schools from time to time. We are astonished at the amount of respect the students show their instructors, as well as how much constructive criticism the students can take. 

I realize how outrageous this may all sound. During my time at this campus, I have come to realize that this campus is by no means a normal college. Due to being state funded, we have some strange rules. New instructors are always very confused the first months.  ","1301620463"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Theres a dude on there with multiple accounts, immediately down voting libertarians' postings down to -1 or -2. I think he's also upvoting his own posts as well. Wholly bizarre. The tactics being used to destroy any rational conversation is distressing, and it'll make you go bonkers.

edit: for example, NoLibrarian posted in here and it was voted up to 3, even tho it was a link to a mocking song. Heck, you can look at their comment history. These folks are super dedicated to spewing bile all over libertarians. I think a libertarian must have pissed in their cheerios or something.

edit edit: other characters here to troll us include, NoNoLibertarians , jcm267, Herkimer (damn shame they picked that name too :( ) , and of course our old friend facehammer.

As they arnt willing to engage in any reasoned, rational exchange, and instead extend into personal attacks, lies which have been long discounted, etc, they arnt even worthy of replying to. Tom Woods recently wrote about how to have a quality, productive conversation, and that its simply not even worth your effort to engage with the attackers. They are jackasses and should simply be shrugged off like the worthlessness they are. Focus your efforts on the truly curious and willing to engage.

The folks who are religiously anti-libertarian are too mental to bother with.

edit edit edit: this might be worth analyzing as classic attacks on libertarians and libertarianism, how to identify them, etc. Perhaps its time to take this as a basic learning experience and we can apply it as such?

"travel","t5_2qh41","I volunteered through an NGO in ollantaytambo, peru which is outside of cuzco.  The website is www.awamaki.org if you're interested.  They don't do any orphanage work, they do some help with the hospital and school there but there main focus is supporting the local weavers but you can read more on the website.  I found them on idealist.org and they set me up with a family to stay with. I had an amazing experience there mostly because of the family I stayed with were really awesome people.  The NGO is a bit unorganized, but they generally did a good job at keeping people busy and were really flexible if you wanted to leave on short trips.  

 You'll find that a lot of the volunteering programs are scams that ask you to pay like 3000 for 2 moths or something ridiculous like that.  Definitely stay away from these and look for smaller organizations to do it through.  Awamaki was $300 a month when i was there, i think $100 as a donation to the org and $200 that went to the family, but think they were getting ready to increase the donation amount when I left.  

 Finding a place where you can contribute is definitely a challenge. Your best bet might be to just go to the city you're most interested in, stay at a hostel at first and try to ask around about NGO's that work with orphanages in the area. This way you don't have to commit to something before meeting the people and scoping it out.  I know first hand there's lots of NGO's in Lima and Cuzco.  Bolivia is also a great place to volunteer.  La Paz, Sucre, Cochabama, and Santa Cruz are the major cities there and I'm sure there's NGO's to volunteer with in each one. 

Also, Here's some websites i remember looking at when i was traveling that might be helpful.

if you do the math and find that you are getting enough protein then you're probably OK w/o the shakes.

You *can* always just ask if she wants to be kissed... may seem silly, but if she's not ready, it's less awkward than going in for it and being rejected, right? And if you don't want to ask, just watch body language! 

If you don't want to tell her she's your first ______, you don't have to. That's not, like, mandatory information or anything. Though she might be able to tell if your kissing is obviously amateur; regardless, if she's worth a damn, she won't care.

Heat management becomes super important since weapon fire generates 3x as much heat as normal. (Heat scale is tripled as well but you can still only get rid of as much heat as you have heat sinks for per turn)","1301620615"

Kurt Vonnegut signed a lot of books over a lot of years... let's find something closer to the probable date of this one.

Like, for example, exactly the same edition:

It's exceedingly similar in all the areas you mark. Here's another:

I hope Agudelo develops into the complete striker we've been needing, but it's still too early and he's still pretty raw.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've talked about this with many people before and one of the most interesting things I heard was from two different Indian academics who were both in arranged marriages.  Their opinion was that the whole notion of true love and falling in and out of love was at the root of why America has such high divorce rates.  All we see on tv and in movies and romantic books is about that amazing feeling of being in love.  Then, when we no longer feel that amazing feeling anymore, we feel it's time to move on and find someone that will give us that feeling again.  The difference with the arranged marriage approach is that it is more about the companionship and learning to love and support the one you are with.  Of my two friends one had met his wife twice before the engagement and the other had met his wife once.  Both now profess to deeply love and care about their spouse.

The reason I mention this is not because I'm an advocate of arranged marriage, I'm not and think that idea is deeply flawed.  I mention it more for the idea that marriage should not be based solely on feelings and romantic attraction.  As someone who has been married almost a decade I sometimes still feel the romantic attraction that we had when we were dating but I always feel a deep love and caring for my wife.  When my wife and I approached marriage we went into it essentially as to a room with one entrance and no exit.  No matter what we would make it work. That knowing that you are both that committed and will always be together is what marriage can give you that monogamous dating is unable to.   ","1301620661"

Google reports 70 000 sites with the exact phrase
""Glenn Beck raped and murdered a girl in 1990""
While Bing reports the phrase shows up a whopping 10 400 000 times.

So if we estimate the combined number of pages... 10 400 000 times 70 000 gives 728000000000.

That was true until 2 or 3 years ago; new autos are extremely aggressive in shifting for fuel economy, and they're starting to have more gears than manuals.

"wallpapers","t5_2qhw4","Whitefang's post up at the top has the link to the website where you can download the program.

After that, you need what are called skins. Skins are what Rainmeter displays directly onto your desktop. [deviantART](http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&amp;section=&amp;q=Rainmeter) and [Customize.org](http://customize.org/) are both excellent places to find some skins. Note that most skins are .zip or .rar - winRAR or whatever you use to unzip things will do you good.

After that, you're going to place your skins in the My Documents/Rainmeter/Skins folder (Rainmeter will automatically set that up for you). This will allow Rainmeter to see the skins you've downloaded. At that point, you're ready to go into Rainbrowser and activate your skin. Once the first skin's up, you can right-click on that skin to pull up other skins. You can drag skins around by left-clicking them and moving them wherever you want.

From there, I have a few pieces of advice: 

1) Find a wallpaper you LOVE. I love changing wallpapers as much as the next guy, but constantly finding new skins for new wallpapers is a huge chore.

2) Don't be afraid to fiddle with things. Change the fonts, change the size of things - do whatever makes your desktop look good by you.

3) Clear the screen of shortcuts. I cannot stress that enough. I've yet to see a good desktop that has shortcuts on it.

4) To that end, consider a program like [RocketDock](http://rocketdock.com/). RocketDock basically gives PC users a Mac-like application launcher. You can customize the icons to fit your theme, and it's very straightforward to use. Wholly worth your time.

5) Don't run this on a slow computer. This is from painful experience with my last computer. It's not a very intense program by any means, but it will slow an older computer. 

Hope that helps!","1301620720"

"food","t5_2qh55","More complex organisms (i.e. organisms that are higher on the food chain) require more energy to live, survive, grow, and reproduce than simpler organisms (i.e. organisms that are lower on the food chain). Eating meat is less efficient than eating plants because an animal uses about 90% of the calories that it intakes in order to live, survive, and reproduce. The remaining 10% of the calories are used to produce biomass, i.e. grow. You can only eat the biomass. Thus, if you give your bread to human livestock, you're forfeiting 90% of the calories in that bread in order to keep that human alive. If you just ate the human as is and then ate the bread, you would have far more calories at your disposal.

If you look at the total biomass of each level of a food chain, you'll find that the ratio is generally about 10:1 for each successive level.

Since we're talking about a situation in which resources are scarce, it seems prudent to preserve as many calories at possible, since the threat of death from starvation is more imminent than the threat of death from, like, scurvy.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The separation of church and state, as codified in the first amendment, is intended to restrain the federal government from establishing, promoting, or banning religion. It is *not* meant to keep religion out of public life entirely. 

Its been challenged many times in the courts, and it has consistently been ruled, and supported by the ACLU and The Institute for Justice, that religious activities cannot be banned in public schools. The reason being the right to free association and free speech cannot be infringed upon.

Secondly, Ron Paul has never endorsed or actively promoted the teaching of creationism in school. Ron Paul himself has stated he is not a ""Young Earther"" and has accepted the fact that there has been ""billions of years of evolution."" As a federal poltician, Ron Paul takes the anti-federalist stance, and doesn't believe the federal government should be micromanaging schools. 

The only reason evolution, creationism, abiogensis, and religion in general are such hot political topics is because the public sector has expanded in to the personal lives of americans. If there were no public schools, you would have no basis to object what a teacher teaches a student on private property. As it is now since public schools exist, the courts have ruled that the federal government cannot discriminate against the religiously inclined parents and students. If students and parents wish to have a prayer club at school, and if they wish for their kids to be taught creationism, Latin, bible study, or whatever then that decision is in the hands of parents and the local school, *not* the federal government, as it should be.

I'm going to repeat myself, the federal government cannot legally ban the practicing of religion, and that includes in the public realm. They cannot actively promote it either, which is a conundrum for the public schools, which is why such constitutional challenges have been brought before the courts. And the courts have decided, the right to free speech and free association trumps the separation of church and state as written. As I said before, the separation of church and state is designed to keep the federal government *out* of religion, not keep religion out of public life.","1301620739"

In your case, the Porsche absorbed all the energy. So, it's not so much that in a low speed collision that you are better off in an old classic, but that in any collision you are better off when the other car is modern than when it is old. That is, if it is modern it will absorb some of the energy of the crash. Two modern cars can safely absorb more energy than can one modern car and one classic, that pair can in turn safely absorb more energy than two classics.","1301620741"

Maybe now is a bad time to mention it, but...

When I first began using the computer right after assembly....back when it still worked...I ran it for about two days before I realized that i hadn't put the CPU fan on all the way.

A loofah will just apply soap differently, more lathered.  I actually try not to 'wash' my face with soap because that will just dry it out more.  I have a really nose and dry inner cheeks.  A loofah will not help this...

I believe people with this problem (including me) are expecting some kind of simplistic answer or product recommendations.  For me, I don't wash my face instead I try to wash my body, rinse off, then my clean hands can use the shower water to help lightly scrub/rinse face's oils off and allow the hot water to set-in my pores.  After press-drying my face with a towel, I will later need to splash a little more water on it after it naturally dries and this seems to help most... but it is timely.

Natural resources are of equal importance to every single living being on this planet. But instead of having every single living being benefit from these, the resources are now controlled by the ones with the most money. Who in turn only use them to future satisfy their ambition for power and wealth.

In a true socialist society 20 people would help out 20 people, the fact that the reasonings of one person appeals more to you doesn't means it automatically earns more support than any other idea. 

The whole intention of society and its people would be totally different when people act with an ambition based on social values instead of an ambition based on the value of money. 

Only in the latter money and power as a reward for accomplishments is important, since one's status is defined by such. 

When I'm refering to equality, I mean equality as a whole. A healthy, young person can give 100% of his abilities to a society/cause/job/project or whatever, so can an old, blind and crippled person.

&gt;there would be a lot less of those commodities around

So? Supply should be based on a demand that is defined by a balance of need, consequence and outcome, not based on a ""no matter the consequences, I'll shove it down your throat anyway so I can make more money"" attitude.

&gt;...if you want to be pedantic...

I wasn't, merely giving an example of the choices and priorities one can set and still live a certain lifestyle without having plenty of money.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","They have the ability by law. Just like I have the ability to collect more unemployment benefits than I paid into the UE system. If I pay 5k in taxes and get 6k back, I am not breaking any law, I can spend that money however I see fit. But that doesn't make it a right in the sense that the government should be able to steal that money from others in order to pay me. My basic point is that people have no right to something that was taken from someone else by force. Its all about the law.. just like slave owners by law were able to buy and sell human beings and put them to work. Did that mean that they had a right? No, they were given the ability by the government. Taxation is immoral just like slavery is immoral because it denies people or takes away by force the rights of others in order to provide them for someone else. 

The ends do not justify the means, that is the argument you seem to be making. As for your argument about funding for a church, does that mean if I work for Company X and that company pays me 500 dollars a week that if I spend that 500 dollars for a prostitute that Company X is paying for my prostitute? lol no

The taxpayers are paying for the wages of the public workers. What they do with that money is up to them. If I pay someone to mow my lawn, and they use the money earned to buy a knife to kill someone, did I pay them to kill someone? Of course not. 

You have to look at it from the start.. you can't fast forward to the end. So where did the money come from to begin with? In the case of public workers, that money came from the taxpayers. From the very beginning it was stolen from them by force. 

I understand what you are saying, that the problem is the government, not the public workers. I fully understand that. But my point is that those workers have absolutely no right to pay someone else to be the middleman in the theft. The government steals it, the unions lobby government to get a larger portion for those the workers who rely on the union to collectively bargain on their behalf. 

Does that make it a right? No, it makes it a legal means of stealing from others. So we have to look at the source of the problem, the government. And as taxpayers, until we can eliminate government entirely we have to be able to fight for our money, we have to be able to get proper representation from our government. And if that means eliminating the ability for other people to bargain with OUR money, then that is what needs to be done. 

Because after all, that is our money. It was stolen from us.. Public workers have the ability to continue bargaining with taxpayer money, but it is not their right. Once again, a right is something that you cannot be denied by someone else. And a right does not require the use of force against others. 

Its like the argument of whether paying someone to kill your ex gf would make you legally responsible. After all, you never pulled the trigger, why should you go to jail? ","1301620774"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","You're looking at it the wrong way, like somehow there should be a balance between the two. Ask yourself why you're asking this question in such a way?

Instead you may find hope in realising that God gave us free will, and in this means that some may choose to refuse God forever. The reason why God removed Adam and Eve from the garden of eden (seemingly) was that if they ate from the tree of life, then they'd live forever in their sin. As you have seen from history and your own life experience, sin is a poison and affects everything around it, and if that sin were to be allowed to perpetuate forever, then the negative effects would too. 

God didn't want that, so He gave us a limited time. If we were to continue to choose anything other than our Creator, then the natural consequence would be to bear our own sins, instead of let Jesus take them for us. This ensures that our sin would stop at some point, and preserve others from the weakness that we would have become so proud about. ","1301620788"

"glutenfree","t5_2qx1l","First, I would suggest finding out which specific tests were done to diagnose you with celiac disease, and what those tests showed.

How long have you actually be fully gluten free?  From your post, I can't tell if you are saying you've been gluten free for 6 months, or it's been six months since your tests, and now you're going gluten free.

It can take time for your gut to heal, especially in the beginning.  It's likely you've made some mistakes in the beginning.  And if you do have dairy/lactose issues, they could be compounding any problems you have.  Though my guess might be that if you are having lactose problems, it's because the villi in your small intestines aren't healed yet.  You might want to avoid dairy for a while, and then slowly reintroduce limited amounts to see how you feel.

And if you do have celiac disease, even if you don't feel the direct effects of eating gluten, you are still doing damage to your body, and you might not pay for it now, but you may at some later point in ways you might not even realize (decreased fertility, increased chances of certain cancers, increased odds of developing other autoimmune diseases, etc).","1301620797"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Regarding your initial commentary upon my physics analogy, it was erroneous for you to have taken the analogy as literally and part-for-part as you did.  Also, I wouldn't give us human societies so much credit.  We're not as chaotic and difficult to predict as one might think.

I'm no  brainiac or scholastic genius capable of pin pointing right here for you the vast mass of evidence that does indeed exist indicating a consistent pattern of nefarious activity that has been going on for many, many decades.  There *have* indeed been others that have done this very thing, however, and while I admit I did not memorize their names or the names of their documentaries, I am very confident indeed that you will find a wealth of information confirming what I'm saying.

&gt; What team to [sic] they play for? How do you know?

Again, I am indeed not certain who and what is pulling the strings.  I would be in denial, however, if I were to attempt to assert that strings are, therefore, *not* being pulled just because I am not aware of the mechanism involved.

&gt; When you looked at history, what kind of scrutiny did you apply to it?

Not enough to commit it to the kind of memory that could spout out immediate and referenced responses to questions like the ones you're asking.  Just enough to know that, since the information was there and easy enough for someone like me to find, then a *lot* of other people should know about it too.  Perhaps I was mistaken in that presumption.

&gt; Is that selfishness so strong that nobody has ever seen fit to expose this conspiracy? Nobody casually mentioned this to a friend? Said too much while at the bar? People are horrible at keeping secrets, and if we're talking about some sort of huge conspiracy, there must be massive amounts of people involved.

The word ""conspiracy"" has had such a stigma attached to it as to cause immediate disrepute to any subject it is associated with.  This seems no accident, as it allows for many a valid but clandestine and often criminal act to be disregarded by many members within the very group which the act is being perpetrated upon.

&gt; This, of course, implies that I am in possession of some special information that is not available to all others.
Obviously, you must be. Else, how do you know this is happening?

Much of it is a ""dot connecting"" ability that perhaps you might be right in implying that not everyone has.  Those who do not have it tend to cry foul over those who do, often leaving those who do with little choice but to shrug their shoulders and walk away.

&gt; The word belief is used as the epistemological acceptance of a statement as truth.

[Epistemology](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/epistemology) - The study or a theory of the nature and grounds of *knowledge* especially with reference to its limits and validity.

[Belief](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief) - The psychological state in which an individual holds a proposition or premise to be true.

[Knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) - Expertise and skills acquired through experience or education.

Belief is, by many, NOT an ""epistemological acceptance of a statement as truth"" as you said.

&gt; [regarding ""belief""] It can be used as belief without evidence, but does not have to be.

Seems generally regarded as such in my experience.

&gt; If you were to wager a guess - how reliable do you think the information I'd find would be?

The process is often like looking for a needle in a haystack.  You're going to find a lot of hay (lies and misinterpretation) and not a lot of needle (truth).  However, one would A) be incorrect in surmising that there *are* no needles because there is so much haystack, and B) entirely miss the point of a good deal of what seems to actually be going on in this planet by succumbing to the admitted weight of the inaccurate information in existence.

&gt; Otherwise you're just telling me that my options are to gtfo or read stuff until I agree with you.

I wouldn't go as far as to be *that* antagonistic.  However (and re-read my above response as a further reference here) while saying ""What?  No links?  No proof?  This guy's full of shit then."" might, perhaps, be a common response, it won't get you any closer *to* the truth . . . if there IS any truth right?  It might be a croc.  I might be entirely mistaken here.  Wouldn't be the first time.  I'm certainly not infallible.  However, not researching because you weren't provided with a link seems not a great reason to not investigate.  Just saying.","1301620838"

His writing skills and poetry are insane but just need to be updated with the modern lingo. e.g. Escalation, LMR, cockblock etc etc.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Do you mean writing the FE or just learning the stuff in general? I agree with the ability to write the FE, but the learning from somewhere sketchy is kinda frowned upon. In Canada, a school can't give you a degree in Engineering unless it is approved by the provincial board. There have to be certain courses everyone takes, that HAVE to teach you everything the board dictates (at a bare minimum). It's simply too much information to manage on your own, so you need to do it course by course. But then, the course needs to be approved by the board. 

Originally I thought it was a little over the top, but then they kinda gave us a reason. Pretty much, before engineering was regulated in Canada a group of engineers fucked up a bridge and tons of people died, so they are making sure that every screw is tightened when it comes to their degrees so they can't be held responsible (and you know, make sure nobody gets hurt. Sad that I thought of that after). Who will be held responsible though is you :(","1301620894"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","As is pretty evident from the replies on here--it's a bleak outlook. As an English major who's realized this and headed into the sciences (having wasted a few years), I speak from personal experience. Primarily you are suited to teach, which may or may not be considered ""academic"" in your mind (especially if it's teaching high school). Other than that, you have a slurry of low paying and dead end jobs at your finger tips. Unless you are highly motivated to write, or go into law, or teach, or etc., there is really no reason to be an English major.

I speak from painful personal experience when say that unless you are going into a jobless field because you are very sure it is what you want to do--do not do it. Personally, I went in with the vague notion of teaching. But then I actually learned the difficult/miserable ins and outs and no longer saw this as an option. Because I'd counted out this profession, I'd backed myself up into a stupid corner, as with an English degree, if one particular job doesn't suit you, you can't shuffle over into a related field given your experience and background knowledge (as you could, say, with a degree in chemical engineering). If you've set your sights on teaching, or publishing/writing, or sandwich artistry, you are kind of set down that path (I know this is an exaggeration, but generally it holds).

And so my primary advice would be to know what it is you want to do, why you are doing what you are doing now, and what kind of lifestyle your present actions may preclude in the future. That is--why are you getting a B.A. in English? If it's because you find English enjoyable, how is that degree going to help you later? 

I know this feels like it's in some distant future, but it's a very real thing, and once that future arrives, there is no easy getting out of it. I would suggest that you heavily consider and reconsider your motivations and plans. There is a reason so many humanities majors bitch about the worthlessness of their field and the hopelessness of their economic situation--because it is a real and shitty reality. And, chances are, they are a not-unlike image of what you may be in four years (you'll be copy/pasting this post to the next college freshman). 

Grow as a person and pursue your interests on your own time. College gets your foot going in a professional direction. You'll probably put in a solid 40 years of work in your eventual profession(s)--you don't want to be making sandwiches and pumping gas.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Wow, this is really awesome.  Thanks for your response.

This is more directed at individuals who have specific views (i.e. homosexuals are bad) because of religion.  They assert a very specific guideline:  one must believe in a man in the sky, believe that homosexuals are bad, believe that Jesus was the one true son of god, etc. in order to believe exactly what they believe.  

When people believe in a god, they aren't saying the believe that the word ""god"" can be defined; they're picking a very specific one that they can answer yes or no questions to.  In this way (this is more directed at Schpwuette now) they aren't continuous variables.  

Therefore, the only belief that one is rationally entitled to is the lack thereof—that is, there is no specific gods or god.  This starts to fall in the realm of the atheism vs. agnosticism debate, which is completely fine; but the disbelief in a certain god is not an assertion.

However, instead of using it as a basis to get rid of abortion rights entirely, I think it is just all the more reason for abortion for any reason to remain legal and freely accessible.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Public schools exist because education is a public good. If the public spends a dollar on education, it can (at least hypothetically) see far more than a dollar in return on those investments. Crime rates go down, productivity goes up, goods and services are cheaper, the government pays less for goods and services it needs to consume. More people are employed with better paying jobs and pay more in taxes. Education leads to more ingenuity and a stronger society, and so on. 

Private schools are often great--sometimes they offer the best educations available, and many do so without any indoctrination even if they are ""religious"" schools. The problem arises if taxpayer money funds these schools at the expense of a public school system. At least two major complications happen.

First, the ""lobby"" for public education shrinks. Imagine 80% of parents are now sending their children to private schools. They may believe they have no vested interest in funding public education (we already hear this argument; it is false but never mind). Some of our country's most successful and important programs are those that make sure (nearly?) _everyone_ has a vested interest (and knows it) in maintaining the program, so that its political ""lobby"" remains strong. For example: social security is popular among both the very rich elderly and the very poor elderly; if it were means tested that would not be the case. 

If the lobby shrinks, it will be easier to whittle away at the program and it will suffer as a result. 

Second, a public good is being entrusted to a private entity, with no strings attached. Private schools could, hypothetically, choose to get fat off of huge public subsidies for a few years and then completely close. They have no obligation to stay open or maintain certain standards that publicly regulated schools do. 

So imagine public schools shrink by half because we start subsidizing private schools, then private schools fail or close or move or become abusive or whatever else. Now, we're facing a crisis because we need to suddenly shove twice as many children into a shrunken and crippled public school system. 

Education is too important to ""privatize""--strong private schools make a great (and important) alternative but they should not be the taxpayer funded model of education, because they're under no obligation to the public. This is the same problem with privatizing other social goods. Where would we be if GWB had privatized Social Security, and on top of bailing out the banks from the market crash we also had a crisis of senior poverty facing us for _decades_ because people mismanaged their personal finances, or were lead astray by the same banks that cheated us on other assets? If we privatize schools, what happens if the ""private school industry"" crashes, as is hypothetically possible? What happens if voters legitimately want to influence the schooling system? 

The arguments on this topic always focus on whether religious schools are indoctrinating children or on whether voucher programs correlate to better quality of education... and those are important questions but I feel like they're dwarfed in importance here. We have a serious problem if people don't recognize what a public good is, and understand why the entire population should want to maintain a robust public program to supply that public good.

*There's you're problem* &lt;/adamsavage&gt;

Atheism is a description. You don't *insist* that you're bald, you don't recite ""I'm bald"" until you believe it, you *notice* that you're bald. Atheism is like that.

&gt; Basically everything that the Atheist community believes in 

what's that? What's everything the atheist (*small a*!!) community believes in?

&gt; Thats when I decided that I would spend a month as an Atheist. How?

&gt; Every time I had a thought about God or about an underlying purpose to my whole life (besides the personal purpose we all create) I would just shake it off and say to myself. ""Yeah but thats a lie, I'm an Atheist""

You. are. doing. it. wrong. 

Start with the first question on our FAQ

&gt; I guess I'm a narrow Atheist considering I am against religion

No, that's not atheism, that's antireligion. Atheism is absence of belief in gods, a belief which you have had the entire time - you were never for a second an atheist - saying ""that's a lie"" to yourself doesn't change your beliefs. *Realizing* that it's a lie does. OH and atheism DOESN'T necessarily mean you think it's a lie - you just have to be unconvinced.

This whole thing is, frankly, dopey

I'm glad for you that you're undogmatic, but you don't seem to have much of a clue about atheism.

Oh, and: stereotypes exist because the human brain needs to shortcut sometimes. Our ancestors couldn't stop and think about whether the swaying long grass was a tiger or not, they just had to RUN and then work it out later. And likewise with people - you build up stereotypes about other people based on learning and experience, so you can react appropriately to similar situations in the future. It's an inefficient use of our time to start from scratch with every encounter.

So as bad as it is, if I'm walking the streets at night and I see a person walking in my direction who has a certain gait and is dressed a certain way and, yes, has a certain skin colour, I'll instinctively think about crossing the road.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Therefore, the idea that there was a ""Palestine"" that Israel ""destroyed"" is invalid. Interesting enough, that has nothing to do with what I wrote.
Jewish immigrants displaced the indigenous population. How you word it doesn't change the truth. You're arguing semantics.

&gt;Not sure what world you refer to; I seem to remember quite a number of successful nationalistic movements (and quite a staggering number of nation-states) existing before the late 19th century.

Certainly not in the middle east and the rest of Asia. The idea is European in origin and did not spread to the rest of the world until after the advent of colonialism, the rest of the world consisted of multi-ethnic empires that began to disintegrate at the turn of the century, and ultimately ended after WWI.

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism#Origins

The 1920's saw the nationalists coming to power. A smart fellow would be able to realize that without the Arabs being self-aware of their ""Arab-ness"" there wouldn't have been a Revolution against the Turks led by Sharif Hussein and upheaval that have swept the levant prior to the war and after. 

What Weizmann might've said in 1905 bared no relevance to the Arabs when the British did not even rule the land let alone giving it to European immigrants. The Balfour Declaration carried much significance because at the time it was perceived that Britain was in a position to actually enact such a promise, and they did.

Let's cut to the chase by stating what your real argument is: that palestinians did not ""declare"" themselves so only when Jews immigrated to the land. And this is supposed to somehow justify the settling of a land already settled by another group though ethnic cleansing. Come up with a better excuse, but keep fighting the good fight.

&gt;Now everyone go away and let us be in peace.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Right, but running a blockade is an act of aggression regardless of what the end goal is.

How deep down the rabbit hole will you go?  Can you accept the existence of the strategic logic of non-violent aggression?  The civil rights movement, Gandhi, etc.  Hundreds of millions of people will hate you, just a warning.  

&gt;So you acknowledge they intended to make a scene and have Israel stop them.

No, they hoped Israel would choose not to make a scene, would cower in the face of their non-violent aggression.  The major majority of protesters had hyped themselves up in a different way from the thugs who fought the Israeli Navy.  They'd all gone to meetings, clucked around like chickens, about the virtue of MLK, Gandhi, whoever.  

&gt;Yeah I'm not saying everyone was in it for violent reasons. That wasn't the right word. But they surely all were antagonistic. All but one were boarded and inspected peacefully.

Let's take your point from above, that running a blockade is always aggression.  I submit to you that boarding and inspecting a boat is always an act of aggression as well.  So peacefully is not the right word to use.  

&gt;But the one that did attack the soldiers as they were coming down got what they asked for. You cannot gang up and stab or beat a soldier with a gun and expect not to get shot.

You have left out a lot of events.  First they shot water cannons at approaching IDF navy boarding parties.  Then as some boats got through they cut and otherwise disabled ladders.  A few minutes of no attempt at boarding went by while the IDF prepared their helicopter.  A line was lowered down to the boat, it was tied off to a part of the ship in an attempt to crash the helicopter.  The line was cut (for lack of a better word, there was some sort of simple mechanical mechanism at play for sure).  

Now, to re-quote you just to be clear,

&gt;You cannot gang up and stab or beat a soldier with a gun and expect not to get shot.

You cannot lower a second rope without expecting to shoot people.  

&gt;The blockade of Gaza is a tool Israel uses to prevent Hamas from arming themselves.

Exactly.  It is not a tool for winning a war.  Israel has admitted defeat.  It is only a means of minimizing the harm that losing the war over Gaza does to Israel.

"PS3","t5_2qhhw","Hey np, I love it when I can tip someone off to a new title that may have slid under their radar. I was actually just reading about DHA earlier today on the PlayStation Blog and when I saw it had a confirmed 4 player count and randomized dungeons I got a little giddy I'm not gonna lie lol. 

*Outland* really took me by surprise when I saw it on the floor at PAX East, the art style really caught my attention but as the booth host explained the game mechanics to me my jaw about hit the floor. Not only does it feature the type of side-scrolling exploration platforming that made me fall in love with the older Castlevanias but it's actually somewhat of a shooter, and that light/dark mechanic works it's way into combat in the form of energy absorption and damage avoidance. Basically by tapping L2 you can switch the character's energy to either light or dark which allows you to either absorb or be unharmed by projectiles of a matching type. 

I actually haven't gotten a chance to play the new Castlevania, I tried the demo but I had just finished Darksiders and it felt too familiar for me to dive into another game of that type. I was intrigued by the voice talent and of course Kojima's involvement so I may have to pick that up later on down the line.","1301620973"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I had this same kind of issue when I first started out, 23 years old for me. I thought maybe my masturbation was an issue as well, turns out it really wasn't the issue. I had a bad problem with nerves, and it only made it worse every time I tried because I started thinking the same way: ""Come on, just stay up!"" and it was really odd with the GFs ""helpful attitude,"" it just felt demeaning.

I started working on some meditation techniques, just the ""clearing the mind"" one. Trying to make everything go away and just enjoy the feeling of it. Soon enough the GF couldn't stand it anymore and just made me try and try and try, which was actually really hot. That combined with the meditation...she created a monster. 

Just remember, no you aren't broke. If you can tug the snake to some porn, just think of some porn while you start. You may even try to find out if your lady friend likes porn and maybe watch one together. 

Just remember man, if she's still with you, then it means she likes you more than just this little hiccup. When everything turns around, it will make your relationship that much stronger.","1301621002"

You mention that the portal that you found is one way, so my theory is that you died in the Nether in a place closely corresponding to the real-world location of the portal that you already built (you were searching for dogs near home after all).

Interesting side note: due to the long distances involved in my single experience with this occurrence, the portal in the Nether located near my death site did not appear until *after* I went through the *real world portal* that the game created upon my death.

edit:

What do you mean by moisture damage? Pics? 


edit 2:

Pro tip from a modder: 

On your next case, if you are talking about something like salt water(air?vapor?eh... what ever) damage, you probably should buy a can or two of automotive clearcoat and apply that to the inside/outside of the case. If the inside of the case is not painted, consider doing this BEFORE applying the clearcoat on the inside. Again, use automotive paint. Doing this on a steel case (ie Antec 900, R3,etc) is a really good idea imo, as steel rust quite easily if exposed to salty air/water. 

If you have access or can buy it, marine grade paint should work better than automotive paint (Note: I have never used marine grade paints, so you will need to look in to this). I use Duplicolor spray paint and it cost about $5-10 per can and work MUCH better compared to the normal spray paint you buy at a place like Lowes, Homedepot,etc. ","1301621013"

404 - Outrage not found. 


- Encounters with rogue elephants in Africa and African farmers usually end with either a dead farmer(s) or a dead elephant.

- Elephants aren't endangered in the part of Africa this guy was in and he even paid the villagers to rid them of their problem.

- The dead elephant was then butchered for meat which helped feed the villagers and the farmer who lost crops.

Yeah so everyone needs to relax and chill because not everyone has the pleasure of living in a urban area which has the benefit of all potentially deadly animals having been already killed or driven off. Or the luxury of living next to super markets stocked with food. 

Edit: For those who will says, ""There are more humane ways to deal with this situation, yadda, yadda, yadda."" well where was PETA or anyone else with such ""concern"" to take care of this problem elephant, replace the destroyed crops by paying the farmer and feed the villagers, etc?","1301621031"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","&gt; this assumption is asinine because it assumes we're a closed system

You don't need to, the laws apply to open and closed systems.

From wiki:

&gt; In open systems, the flow of matter is another energy transfer mechanism, and extra terms must be included in the expression of the first law.

Also, do you know what an Open system v. Closed system is?  Closed just means no mass flow it doesn't mean that energy can't enter or exit.

&gt; If we assume that, for the sake of argument, humans are closed systems that obey the laws of thermodynamics by way of only two variables: physical energy expenditure, and caloric intake.

Your assumption isn't needed so your example is invalid. Also, you conclusion of the process needing to be 100% efficient is also incorrect. If it was less than 100% efficient it would just create heat and heat up the system. 

If your 100% conclusion were right the laws couldn't apply to ANY energy transfer since no system for transferring energy is 100% efficient. That would mean that the 1st law could not be true for any system if the 2nd law was true. Is that something that you want to contest?","1301621037"

Finally, third example: c = .1.  Again, in Python 3, if you ask for the value of c, you get .1.

We had just gotten our dog, and the cat was not a fan of this. I was hanging out with the cat on the couch in our living room when the dog comes into the room. We have hardwood floors, so the cat heard the dogs nails on the floor as she entered the room. This freaked the cat out, and the only way to get out of the room was to climb over my head.

My mom must have heard my shriek, because the next thing I know she's in the room with a look of horror on her face. She takes me to the emergency room, where I I had to be strapped down in a papoose board to get stitches and a tetanus shot.

"reddit.com","t5_6","When I was a young child, my father was a car salesman in Darwin, in the Northern Territory of Australia. He worked for Toyota and had a long standing relationship with the Aboriginal community - due to having run a safari company years earlier which would pass by their in-land communities.

Once every year, the Australian government would give a large payment to each Aboriginal family who lived on ""Groote Eylandt"" - they called this ""Clan Time"".  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groote_Eylandt

My father would go over there because each year they would spend this money on new vehicles – cars, motorbikes and a shit-ton of alcohol..  Aboriginals being relatively detached from the ideals of both money and western living didn’t use banks or hang onto money – their lives revolved around family and other such traditions.

They would drive these vehicles all over the island in a party that would rage on for a month or so, all of them completely shitfaced drunk and doing it literally for fun – once the money had run out to keep putting fuel in these cars and motorbikes, they would torch them.

One year, when I was 9 years old, my Father took me to Groote Eylandt for clan time – he was going there to sell them Toyota troop carriers, the only 4wd rugged enough to withstand the harsh conditions whilst fitting an entire family in the back.

We flew there, upon arrival we travelled to one of the larger communities to talk to the clan leaders.  Once there, I hung out with some of the local kids whilst my dad talked Business with the elders – myself and a rag-tag gang of 7-8 other Aboriginal kids loaded ourselves onto 2 different 600cc Honda quad-bikes, and literally flew around some of the Islands shanty towns at full speed, 4 to a bike, taking turns as to who was riding.

I had quad-bikes at home, so was able to keep up the manic pace the other kids were setting, to the surprise of the Aboriginal kids on our bike – we didn’t speak the same language, but we all knew what was awesome and what wasn’t – and *we* were awesome.

My father said at one point he looked out to the horizon to see us whipping along through the high-grass, the bike completely out of sight leaving what looked like 4 boys hugging each other running along at 80km/h across the top of the grassline.

After doing this for a few hours (possibly 5 even , it was fucking fun) – I really needed to take a shit. Really bad.  So when we got back to the village I found my Dad and asked him where the bathroom was. He motioned towards the only immaculate looking building I’d seen on the whole island – a church on a perfectly square patch of equally as perfectly green grass. 

It was kind of surreal now that I think back to it – whether or not noticing this place in pristine condition amongst a setting of complete disrepair shaped what would later become my own Atheism, it definitely struck me as odd even at that young age.

I walked myself over to the Church and found the bathroom, a separate building to the Church itself. As I tried to enter I noticed a large lock on both doors, so I went inside to see if I could grab a key off of someone.

Inside there was a solitary Minister, I asked him if I could use the toilets and he said, word for word *”Oh sure young man, we only lock them to keep the natives out! But you’re not a native!”*

I immediately felt bad, I didn’t know why but I knew that what he said didn’t seem fair – so I asked him where “The natives” went to the bathroom.  *”Oh, they’ll go anywhere and everywhere, but their toilet block is over there”* - he pointed out into the middle of this desolate field, with one solitary building that looked like an abandoned hut - in stark contrast to the green patch of heaven we were standing on – this place looked like something out of documentary about some kind of slum or favela.

I stuck to my conscience, and walked over there – dodging broken glass bottles and sharp pieces of metal off-cuts along the way, it was as if there had been some great construction effort yet with nothing actually being built.

I found the entrance to the hut, walked in and was stopped dead in my tracks by both the sight and smell of what I was experiencing.  There was shit, or “shits” as I thought in my young mind – everywhere.

Up the walls, on the floors, pegged into the ceiling..  it was absolutely shocking.

I knew the minister would be sitting in his church, looking out the window and waiting for me to come running out, possibly with the key to his toilet in hand grinning smugly, so I decided to fight on, to experience what the kids I had been riding with have to endure every day.

I tippy toed through the mine-field that lay in-front of me, holding my nose and trying not to wretch from the stench, it was so powerful. I, stupidly, went around to see if the situation was any better in the cubicles, it to put it simply, was much worse.

Starting to fret about where I was going to take a dump, I noticed for the first time what looked like a brand new pair of shorts, made out of parachute pant material.  Parachute Shorts I guess you’d call them.  They looked perfect, and were sitting there as if someone had just let them drop to their ankles, then walked off into the bushes completely naked.

I pondered for a moment, then decided I could use these parachute shorts to clean one of the toilet bowls enough for me to sit on it, maybe saving a leg to clean my ass with as there, not at all surprisingly, was no toilet paper that I could see anywhere.

So I tippy toed over to where the shorts were, and bent down to grab them – I gingerly raised them from the ground by pinching at them with my thumb and index finger, once they were about 20cm off the ground, my world stopped dead.

Underneath them was the biggest, most disgusting shit I had ever seen or would have thought could exist, even in the animal kingdom.  This thing was as big as a decent sized Tupperware container.

I vomited.  Everywhere.

Fighting on, I almost lost my balance a few times – falling over would have been the end of life as I knew it because there was no space on the floor large enough for my body to fall without it being riddled with shits.

I escalated my plan ten-fold – hovering over the bowl, I did my business, used what tiny part of the shorts I could convince myself hadn’t come into contact with the almighty overlord of turds, and got the fuck out of there.

When I walked back to see my Dad, he said *“What’s wrong with you, you look like you’ve seen a ghost!”.*

I didn’t tell him shit.

"Rift","t5_2s4an","I agree warriors did need some slight nerfs and changing of how certain mechanics worked. Think some of the nerfs were a bit excessive. Cut some things down by 50% not 75%+ on some things. Rogues and mages have good healing abilities for offspecs much lower in their trees for leveling builds. Have to invest deep in BM or the nerfed Reaver for any kind of decent healing that really limits your options for builds.

You've never played a warrior and have no idea how bad they were nerfed but are embarrassed they are all out of line in their behavior? The amount of people who have no idea about warriors or how much they were nerfed and trivialize a majority of what they say really bugs me. Or quote the 5% of the worst warriors complaining meanwhile a big chunk of the rest might have some valid criticisms.

Main reason they were nerfed was cuz of all the QQing by every other class over PvP. All the other classes going into the Warrior forum after the patch and talking shit and rubbing salt in I thought was embarrassing. 

I think some of the nerfs in addition to fixing the armor bug was a bit much. Fix the armor bug see where they at then give them some slightly smaller type nerfs. They were ""balanced"" for 4 months in beta without fixing the armor bug. Then given a hefty nerf on top of fixing the armor bug. Sure they are still playable. I'm sure you could nerf a lot of souls of the other classes 20% or whatever too and they would be ""playable"" also. But not near as fun.","1301621094"

But to be honest, you can make W2K slim and work too, and lock it down pretty well. I know, I know, but I have Thinkpad 600x's that work with w2k faster with youtube and hulu's flash than with linux and have a 70mb boot footprint. I do not do that, but people always want youtube. :( It's the only thing that's bad with using a slim linux build; everything loaded is memory-resident and fast, so they presume *everything* is going to be fast.

I can get CF-to-IDE adapters cheap with a 4 gig card (266x) and works well enough; I can take a picture of my next batch for you if you want. I have 12 ready to go (batteries are shot) with 1 having a suspected IDE bus issue, so USB flash boot works fine.

But Puppy is the easiest by far, just has problems with some Dell laptops w/first-gen speedstep before tweaking.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I know a little bit about the medical marijuana act recently passed in Arizona. In about 2 weeks, they will start accepting applications. Your case would certainly qualify. Using Medical MJ for pain relief is a thousand times better than taking oxycodone. MJ does not cause things such as liver failure, constipation, etc. It works for pain relief not only as an anti-inflammatory and painkiller, but also by giving you psychological methods for dealing with pain.  A high-CBD strain (see those from ""Project CBD"") would do wonders for your pain relief, and provides very little intoxicating effect. In fact, these strains (which differ from traditionally high-THC strains) tend to make one more focused. CBD acts as a painkiller, anticonvulsant, antianxiety, and as an antipsychotic - so it alleviates many of the ""weird"" effects of marijuana use such as confusion and paranoia. I have had several close friends use MJ for chronic pain relief and they have a much better quality of life than when they used drugs such as oxycodone. Since you can grow your own plants once approved for a card (since dispensaries won't open until late July-early August), you can order some of these seeds and try it yourself. High-CBD strains have an amazing potential. CBD is becoming more medically viable than THC as research on the chemical grows.

Additionally, it may benefit you to try mindfulness meditation. This would work as an option if you cannot experience relief from other medical methods. This would work by giving you an objective viewpoint from which to view your pain, lessening it by examining which parts of the pain are purely physical, and which parts are exacerbated by your own mind. It is amazing how pain works - your mind, stressed from the physical pain, can produce more pain. This is especially true if you are taking an addictive drug like oxycodone. Your body will continue to trick you into believing you have more pain than you really have, continuing the vicious cycle of drug dependence.","1301621100"

He knows he is under threat of death of getting gluten in anything else and is VERY mindful of where he puts things and to not cross contaminate things like butter, peanut butter, etc.

can't say much w/o knowing your goals and your stats. 
protein is not something that is specifically/only related to excersize. 
Its a food..you don't eat food ONLY when you excersize do you?
that being said it is quite beneficial to have the shake immediately post excersize so that your muscles don't break down.

you need protein everyday.not necessarily a shake but def. protein.
you're eating protein constantly throughout the day right? 

DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness). Happens when your body encounters work its not used to. If you train the correct way you shouldn't be hitting the same muscle more than 1nce a week so i don't know how to answer that?
don't know what plan you're following so...?
yes you should still drink protein post cardio light or otherwise. 2 miles isn't light to me but maybe you're a runner or something?

After some investigation it was determined that these guys were morons and in way over their heads.  Turns out they stopped backing up Exchange because they didn't know how to. Seriously.  Then they also were manually deleting transaction logs as well.  Basically they made a bad situation even worse.  

I came in and after setting up dial tone connectivity, which these clowns never even heard of, sent the drives to Kroll On Track for recovery. These are the guys that can recover from burned or smashed hard drives.  

It took Kroll almost 2 months to recover about 60 percent of the email and none of the contacts and calendars.  Some users lost everything.  The DBs were THAT fucked up. 

The amateur services provider is on their way out with a lawsuit pending and I'm designing an highly available and backed up Exchange system.  

Costs?

Final bill from Kroll: $180,000

Bill for myself and a storage consultant for just the 3 month recovery: $210,000

Total:  $390,000

Total cost of the HA solution I am designing: $24,000

Which one would you rather pay???

I for one am celebrating this day for just this reason.

Height is voltage.

This analogy also works perfectly with KVL [you end up where you started, at the beginning of the ride] and somewhat with KCL when there are two paths for the log to take.

Don't have a great way for the physics definition V = -kQ/r, but the circuits analogy might help with the understanding of the voltage of point charges.","1301621145"

To say ""Virtually all of their money goes to lobbying in D.C. And of course their own salaries. Almost none of their funds go to actual animal shelters.""  is just a string of outright lies.

How exactly is $878,266 out of $121,725,153 ""virtually all""?  That's 0.07%.  Where'd you learn math, homeopathy class? Sorry, somebody had to find a way to make this topic even remotely relevant to this subreddit.

To see salary info you can view my other comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/gfqlj/congressman_tells_hsus_to_shove_it_refuses_award/c1n92bd).  It is a substantial number, but I do not know what the normal amounts are for a non-profit so I can't say whether or not it's valid to call it too high.  It might be.  But it is most certainly not valid to claim it is nearly all.

At least $27,141,761 (22.3%) went to direct response and international assistance, with more (although I didn't do the exact breakdown) in the form of grants paid to other groups, and the ""other"" fees.  I'm not sure which number contains the costs of the 6 sanctuaries they run, or how much of the educational material goes to educate or help groups that do directly care for animals on a local level.  While I can see an argument being made for those numbers being too low, to call them ""Almost none"" is completely inaccurate.","1301621183"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Sorry I'm not sure what your point is about the Soviet/Eastern Front casualties. The Red Army did not sacrifice large numbers of troops to spare the Germans, the Soviet leadership did what it saw as necessary, and the Germans fought a war of annihilation. If you have a couple of nuclear bombs, then perhaps you DON'T have to 'lose some to win some'.

Of course the US was not too pleased about Stalin declaring war in the last few hours (he had to keep fighting after the surrender to get the territory he wanted), but the history shows the decision to drop the bomb had already been taken.  It's actually more the reverse: the impending use of the bomb hastened Stalin's move in Manchuria.

As for the casualties, the numbers are not the whole point. No American president was going to keep having Americans killed because the Japanese sense of decorum didn't allow anyone at a meeting to say 'well, we''d better think about surrendering, guys'.  The mass use of kamikaze weapons and and suicides of Okinawa civilians, the sheer unity of the Japanese nation, would have made it very difficult to sustain the notion that the A-bombs were too terrible a weapon to use.  The very hopelessness of Japan's situation, generally used as an argument for sparing Japan the full horrors of war, was in fact the reason to spare them nothing.

What annoys me about this whole argument is that while questioning American motives, nobody seems to mind that Japan's leadership, their war plan in ruins from June 1942, just blundered on, happy to destroy the nation.... and the Emperor and many others were never made to answer for this.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;For instance, both after the Civil War and when FDR took the US off the gold standard, the US govt repaid debts it had explictly promised to repay in gold with paper money of less value than the gold promised. If any private business or individual did this, it would be ""default"" .

And then i August of 1971 when Nixon unilaterally ended (technically he claimed to only be ""temporarily suspending"") the gold-exchange standard under Bretton-Woods -- that was in essence a complete default: a clear statement that the US would no longer pay ANY gold promised (at ANY exchange rate, period), but would ""float"" the value of the dollar relative to all other currencies (which themselves were tied to nothing either), in effect promising to redeem checks only in the form of additional checks.

So in point of technical fact, the US already *has* defaulted on not only all of it's debt, but it's entire currency (and thereby has ""defaulted"" all other currencies as well) -- only the world has shoved it's collective head up it's arse and lives in active denial of it.","1301621186"

Is it fair to discourage an idea like ""anonymity"", which surely has been utilized ""correctly"" far more often than ""incorrectly"", just because a few people ruin it for the rest of us? These measures don't even stop the spam and trolling!

Anonymity allows my message to be evaluated based on the merits of my message, free from the biases and distractions of *who* posts it (usually. There are times when people expect ""credentials"", which is fair. Who else better understands the plight of a old, homeless woman than an old, homeless woman?) 

Attaching personal information allows people to take my ideas less seriously because I'm a (man/woman)/(too old/young)/(single/married)/(Democrat/Republican)/etc. Seriously, take a look at [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gfj3s/just_got_woken_up_in_class_by_this/c1n79al). For some reason, even on an ""anonymous"" forum like reddit, people put unnecessary importance on the sex of the poster. It is a big deal for no reason other than to be a deal, and how people judge me is not something I have control over!

Consider the number of websites that have the Facebook comment box, with you already logged in, and allowing Facebook to connect a real name to a person's supposed internet activity.

Unfortunately, I don't want the possibility that my comments/posts will be taken out of context by a potential employer or someone of personal significance. I do my best with regards to privacy settings and what I post on my Facebook, but it's not like Facebook has the best track record for privacy.

We started to drive away and then he suddenly parked and got out of the car.  I got out and he asked me, ""do you remember what happened here 5 years ago?""  I said, ""Yes, this is where you asked me to be your girlfriend officially.""  Then he said, ""Well now, (knees shaking, he gets down on one) I'd like to ask you to be my wife.""  Then he reaches into his jacket, that I was wearing, and pulls out a case and shows me the ring.  Years before, he'd asked me to show him what I wanted in a ring if he ever wanted to propose so we had one digitally rendered and he had the ring custom made for me.

- Expand asap, if you don't, you're probably fighting an uphill battle against someone on +1 base

- Upgrades are mandatory. Also low-level opponents will often/always overlook them when estimating the outcome of a battle, so you may get more unexpected favourable exchanges

- Scouting is mandatory. You need to know when their push is coming and what it consists of if you're going to stop it. Sac an overlord, use a scan, or get a nice and early robo.

I should point out that I am a Zerg, so that probably colours my suggestions somewhat. As other people are saying, macro is VERY important. I would not try to teach them, say, a Void Ray rush, although it might boost their wins and spirits. Giving them a solid foundation (eg: for ZvP, just 15 hatch 15 pool) from which to play a macro game will help them most. Sure they will get cheesed but that is all part of learning.

&gt;At the voter level, the Tea Party is a movement that purports to be furious about government spending — only the reality is that the vast majority of its members are former Bush supporters who yawned through two terms of record deficits and spent the past two electoral cycles frothing not about spending but about John Kerry's medals and Barack Obama's Sixties associations. The average Tea Partier is sincerely against government spending — with the exception of the money spent on them.

Yes, there's a lot of clowns involved with the whole Tea Party thing. There's a lot of clowns everywhere you look, really.

&gt;This candidate, a man ostensibly so against government power in all its forms that he wants to gut the Americans With Disabilities Act""

Where did he ever say that?

&gt;..was unwilling to reduce his own government compensation, for a very logical reason. ""Physicians,"" he said, ""should be allowed to make a comfortable living.""

Yes, apparently it is harder and harder to find a doctor who takes Medicare or however that works.

http://www.aarp.org/health/medicare-insurance/info-12-2009/finding_a_new_fl.html

People like Rand Paul think this has to do with how little they get paid for the work.

&gt;Those of us who might have expected Paul's purist followers to abandon him in droves have been disappointed; Paul is now the clear favorite to win in November. Ha, ha, you thought we actually gave a shit about spending, joke's on you.

http://campaignforliberty.com/materials/RandBudget.pdf

Well, there's those drastic cuts in spending he was talking about.

&gt;The elder Paul will object to this characterization, but what he &gt;represents is something of a sacred role in American culture: the principled crackpot.

Haha, what?

&gt;the money went to homeowners, many of whom were minorities, who were close to foreclosure.

Yawn.

&gt;While the big bank bailouts may have been incomprehensible to ordinary voters, here was something that Middle America had no problem grasping: The financial crisis was caused by those lazy minorities next door who bought houses they couldn't afford — and now the government was going to bail them out.

This is the first I have ever heard this. Why would anyone be mad at minorities for buying houses they couldn't afford? It would be various banks' fault for giving out a bunch of bad loans. Why would a bunch of banks give out a bunch of bad loans? For the heck of it? They wouldn't, unless they were sure someone real powerful had their backs. I'm curious about how many of these bad loans and foreclosed houses even belonged to minorities. So far, I haven't seen any statistics or anything.

&gt;Oath Keepers (a group of law- enforcement and military professionals who have vowed to disobey ""unconstitutional"" orders)

Why is unconstitutional in quotation marks there? 

&gt;Every single one of them was that exceptional Republican who did protest the spending in the Bush years, and not one of them is the hypocrite who only took to the streets when a black Democratic president launched an emergency stimulus program.

Why is there so much race-baiting in this article? It's embarrassing. While I'm sure some racists don't like Obama because he's black, that's no different than someone not liking Bush because he was white. 

&gt;But the champion of champions has always been Rand Paul, who as the son of the movement's would-be ideological founder was poised to become the George W. Bush figure in the Tea Party narrative, the inheritor of the divine calling.

Yes, it's so necessary to draw comparisons to an unpopular figure.

&gt;Paul was transformed from insurgent outsider to establishment stooge

This is funny, considering what we're posting about.

&gt;And Paul's anti-interventionist, anti-war stance was so far out, it made MoveOn look like a detachment of the Third Marines. ""Our national security,"" he declared in 2007, ""is not threatened by Iran having one nuclear weapon.""""

I don't think that's a crazy idea at all. A threat to our national security is them seriously threatening to use that nuclear weapon on the US.

&gt;we will have an army of armed EPA agents — thousands of them"" who would raid private homes to enforce energy-efficiency standards. ""

Although it seems a little far-fetched, the EPA does have armed agents that conduct raids. So does the IRS. I don't think they do it for energy efficiency standards though.

Even the Department of Education is strapped.

&gt;saying the leaders of the two parties ""don't believe in anything"" and get pushed around by the New World Order types.

While I wouldn't necessary say they get pushed around by Hollywood Hulk Hogan, why is it that everyone that has been in power in my limited lifetime has been eerily similar? Why is it that Bush and Obama's presidencies are nigh-indistinguishable? Why would someone renege on a bunch of campaign promises, alienate voters, and in general appear an entirely different person than when they were a candidate?

&gt;where he made a big show of joyously tearing off his pseudolibertarian underpants for the whole world to see

Pseudo?

&gt;Paul also went on the air with Fox News reptile Sean Hannity and insisted that he differed significantly from the Libertarian Party, now speaking more favorably about, among other things, judicious troop deployments overseas.""

No quotes or anything like that, that's giving this article too much credit. Once again funny, considering what he's said as of late.

&gt;""Staff members tell me Rand Paul recently visited the [creationism] museum after-hours.""

OH NO.

&gt;""no-government theology of Rand Paul""
&gt;""Angry white voters""
&gt;""The country is becoming more black and more Hispanic by the day.""
&gt;""village idiots and Internet Hitlers""

Yeah, they didn't try too hard.

As for the second part, Luke 14:25-26
&gt;""Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said: “If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be my disciple.""



Do you think he literally meant that you had to hate everything about your life and family? He's trying to illustrate that, to follow him and achieve eternal life, you must be **willing** to sacrifice anything asked of you. Wealth is not a barrier to heaven. Wealth is not evil or negative in the eyes of Jesus. Greed is, and the avarices that are commonly associated with wealth are. However, if a wealthy man follows His teachings, accepts Him as his savoir, and leads a life according to the commandments and His will, he will be saved. Wealth is not negative, there are just many negative things associated with wealth.


Saying Jesus was anti-wealth is just twisting the words of the bible to suit your own views. Just because wealth will not **help** you find salvation does not mean it will **prevent** you from finding it. 


And a billionaire giving up all his wealth while he is alive is wasteful. You have much more capacity to do good with the means of a rich person at your disposal. Wealth is not evil.","1301621206"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","1) a) So you're looking for examples of fly speciation?  If so, I can provide examples of that. (Meffert and Bryant (1991), Soans, et al. (1974), Hurd and Eisenberg (1975))

So speciation can occur.  We've personally observed inherited changes in chromosomes and genes.  We have fossil and DNA evidence of common ancestry in line with what evolution predicts.  The ball is in your court to show these small changes are not cumulative.

b) Science [isn't like that](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200811/common-misconceptions-about-science-i-scientific-proof) (haven't read this, but it looks right); it only gives us what is *likely* to be true given what we know.  I'm not sure what else to say.

4) I am afraid I can only repeat what I've already said, only using different words: rationality is necessarily/inherently justified.  The question doesn't make any sense.

6) You're still arguing the truth of a book by the style it's written in instead of comparing its contents to the observable realm.  However, the claims of the Bible sound ludicrous to me.  I personally [think of it as fiction](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=009_1198085630).  You don't.  You have to show why.

---

13) Hierarchy has no part in *some* forms of Christianity, but I gave two examples where it was ([here's](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%2011:3&amp;version=NIV) a third).  But regardless, to say the claims of Scientology or Christianity are false because there is a hierarchy is fallacious.

Here are three examples of how to show Scientology is wrong:

* The proposed age of the universe in Scientology versus the observed age.
* The lack of evidence for claims regarding the existence of thetans, which apparently interact with the human brain in a measurable way.
* Lack of evidence for the idea of thetans creating the universe.

You're welcome to use these, but we're looking for something that can't be applied to Christianity.

14) We already know eye witness reports aren't reliable.  When the only evidence of eye witness reports are in books, that adds another layer of unreliability.

The New Testament has been in [constant revision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_New_Testament_canon).  Add to that the fact it's been poorly copied for centuries, and you understand why many Muslims cling to the idea their holy text has had fewer non-divine changes than yours (or none at all).

In their $2000 build, they use two 6970's with Crossfire. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-sandy-bridge-build-a-pc-overclocking,2876-16.html As you can see, the GPU load rises from 300 to 436 (and 6970's use slightly more power than 6950's), an increase of 136W. 

These figures are very rough estimations, but you can see that in the $200 build, even when using a 2600k (which requires quite a bit more power than 2500's), the CPU+GPU voltage reaches only 583.

That should be a great base for you.  You can add an SSD of your choice.  As far as peripherals, a LOT of that is personal preference.  I love mechanical keyboards, some people hate them.

Edit: Forgot the HDD.. whoops

I might have went a bit overboard on the PSU, but you have an extremely large budget and modular + 750W is gonna be pretty expensive.","1301621241"

The gist of it as I understand it (and I'm not a lawyer/LEO) is that LEOs can use deadly force to prevent harm to themselves or others, but with a broader range than what would be legally possible for a civilian. The difference between LEOs and citizens, AFAICT, comes down to 1) much broader legal authority for LEOs; 2) it's their job to respond, whereas citizens may run away.","1301621243"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","You found it to be unrelated because it's actually specifying Marx' labour theory of value (which is a facet of his larger theory of value, as the post makes clear), and not just repeating the cartoon Ricardo bullshit you're ""refuting"" with your water in the desert example. Again, if you don't understand something you read, either the text doesn't make sense, or you're a bad reader. Since the text makes sense to me, I'm left to think the latter of you. 

Anyway, we can't argue about it until you know what we'd be arguing about, so I'm gonna leave that there.

What I will do is refute your implied claim that utility is adequate as a theory of value. Nothing could be less useful to me right now than the Dubai Hippodrome. I don't enjoy betting on horses. I think it's generally vulgar, and would prefer to forget it existed. It has no utility to me whatsoever. By your theory, if I wanted to buy the hippodrome, it should be free. Strangely though, It's not. Why? Because value in capitalism has a social dimension that is (a) largely independent of me (though I'm obviously not independent of it), and (b) tied up with labor-time dominated by the telos-less accumulative logic of capital. And if you want to get into commodity fetishism, you'll find far more serious and compelling theories in Western Marxism (see, in particular, Horkheimer and Adorno's ""Enlightenment as Mass Deception"" -- edit: or Adorno's [""The Fetish Character in Music""](http://elenarazlogova.org/hist452w07/adorno.pdf), this one's really fun) than you will in any works by the heirs of Mill.

This is the headset I use and have been using for a looong time. I had the previous generation of this model, and used it for probably around 4 years+ before I broke them. I got new ones, and have been using these for about 1.5 years now. 

They're incredibly comfortable (though I have a small head), the sound quality is great, and they're inexpensive. The only downside (perhaps) is that it's not USB, though I think they have a USB version for a few more bucks. But that didn't really matter for me.

I don't think he's actually homeless, but that's just his title - JP The Homeless Guy.

The real reason he's famous though is because he's covered in pins and buttons... for anything and everything, and when he's high enough he gives them away to people he 'feels a connection with'.

My first encounter with JP the Homeless Guy was when I was in high school, riding my bike downtown.  I wiped out and he helped me up, and he gave me an Obama 2008 pin... even though we're in Canada... I still have that pin actually.","1301621268"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This happened to a good friend of mine named Alecia. She went to Disney World at around 8 years old and, despite her fears, was convinced to ride MGM's ""Rockin' Roller Coaster"". For those unfamiliar, this is a famous indoor coaster which begins with blazing acceleration and follows through with many loops and corkscrews.

The harness was the usual over-the-head one which buckles between one's legs. The ride operator advised parents to ensure that their children were safely fastened as a couple other workers went around and quickly checked each seat. Alecia was having trouble buckling hers down because her jeans were in the way or something, and her mother, sitting next to her, was unable to reach due to her harness already being locked in place. She proceeded to wave her arms to get the attention of one of the helpers. Unfortunately, she failed. You can probably see where this is going. Needless to say, the ride started.

Poor Alecia started screaming and crying as soon as the ride started, being completely unbuckled and holding the loose harness uselessly to her chest. And then the loops came. Thankfully, the G-force of the loops was sufficient to hold her firmly in her seat, believe it or not. As the horrifying ride ended, Alecia's mother proceeded to yell at the workers for their carelessness before leaving with her crying, terrified little girl.

Years later, Alecia's aunt twisted her ankle on some little ride and sued for a million dollars, which Disney uncaringly handed over to her like pocket change. WTF.","1301621286"

I agree with you.  I'm simply saying if you hit rough luck in your placement matches it can be a rough road from there.  Not saying you won't get to your destination.  Also not everyone is saying they should be 1800 or some shit.  Some people simply feel they are @ 1200 when they should be 1500.  Even if they are that doesn't mean they can carry every damn game.  Again, I'm not saying there's an elo hell.  But there is luck, especially when few games are taken into account.  Since placement matches are only 10 games, you could get bad luck and start w/ a lower elo than you should.  You will win more than you lose, and you will make it to where you should be, but it sure as fuck is very frustrating.","1301621308"

"canada","t5_2qh68","Assuming the NDP and the Bloc keep their combined seat total (36+47+(2 Independent)=85), that leaves 223 seats for the Libs and Cons. Currently, the count is 143-77 in favor of the Conservatives. That means the liberals have to grab about 30 seats from the conservatives to form a minority. 

Where are they going to grab all these seats? 

* I don't believe they can make any gain east of ontario (Non-English Quebec hates them and the Maritimes are saturated). In fact, i'm pretty sure Newfoundland will partially turn conservative.
* In BC, the left vote is headed towards the NDP and rural ridings are out of reach. (maybe they can gain 3 seats in the province at most)
* There is no hope in Alberta and Saskatchewan (maybe they can take 2 seats?)
* In Manitoba, there is a possibility of about 3 seats.

So, they'd need to take a minimum of 20 seats from the 51 conservative seats in Ontario.

I was about to go into the army in June/July and initially I thought nothing of it until this relationship. She promised to wait for me (couple of months of basic training) to get out. Now that this relationship is over, I don't know what to look forward to when I get out of basic training. 

It's hard to get my mind off her. I'm not very sad (not enough to cry at least) about the relationship ending. I'm not exactly in pain either. I guess I'm just being lonely after getting out of my first relationship in my life. Now I can see why people need rebound relationships. They're afraid of being alone and want company until the next best thing shows up. But it hurts the rebound person.

However I obviously can't park my bike with one wheel on the path so if I parked at 90 degrees I'd be sticking much further out into the road than cars.

What is just shy of that?

What about implying serious harm OR great misfortune not involving harm is coming/happening to an unconnected party? (I'm thinking similar to convincing someone that some popular conspiracy theory is in fact true)

What about convincing someone of something so absurdly horrific/unfortunate it should appear impossible?  Is sheer absurdity a loophole around this?  (much like absurd racism being interpreted as irony as opposed to bigotry)

"socialism","t5_2qjii","To be fair, I think a deeper study of all these things would be really helpful, as opposed to forming opinions based on punctual issues. Even reading a Wikipedia article about these things would be a more reasonable start. Nevertheless, I will take a stab at it. Keep in mind that there are several different brands of socialism, so I might be exposing one view, where other socialists might have a different view.    
1. Both capitalism and free market capitalism are market economies, that is, they are founded on principles of private property of the means of production and on the rules of supply and demand. Free market capitalism is a somewhat utopian perspective, not yet proven in real life, that a completely unregulated, modern economy would generate best results, whereas in practice, most forms of capitalism dominant in today's world have varying levels of governmental regulation and interference, especially concerning services that some people consider basic rights, ie. safety regulations, health care, environmental regulations, minimum wage, and other components of a welfare-state.  
2. I think most socialists, who don't see welfare-state capitalism as socialism, would say that the capitalist idea of a state doesn't apply under socialism. You could say some socialists think a socialist society as stateless, or if there is such a thing as a state, it wouldn't resemble the governments of western democracies that much. Socialists see production in all it's spheres being planned and controlled by the workers, including distribution, of which price is a factor. The idea is generally that this would be done according to need and use value, rather than suppply and demand. What is needed and what is useful would be decided democratically by the workers. In other words, socialism is a form of democratic control of production, and you could say the prices would be set democratically directly by the worker's councils.  
3. This has been addressed more or less in the last point. Production is distributed primarily on the basis of need. I think one socialist ideal would be that everyone would get everything that is deemed basic for a healthy development of social functions and work, meaning being properly fed, clothed, housed, employed, with access to education and culture. Other than that, by eliminating the alienating production regime in capitalistic society, workers would be more free to develop their creativity and individual projects, or otherwise work on their own free time and reap the benefits of their own work. The means of production would be collectively owned though, so the excess productive force of these means and the goods produced would be subject to the democratic will of the workers. I think it is generally accepted that those who work more get more stuff, but within very reasonable limits.    ","1301621352"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Great question. This is a really important point that the Bible makes, which is often hard to understand. I've seen several pastors and authors talk about this dichotomy (including C.S. Lewis in Mere Christianity and Dietrich Bonhoffer in The Cost of Discipleship), and the concept has become one of my favorite. After all, how can one have a light burden (Matthew 11), yet be ""refined by fire"" (1 Peter 1). How can the ""peace of God which transcends all understanding"" (Philippians... 4?) be paralleled with denying one's self and carry their cross to be crucified with Christ (Luke 9 &amp; Galatians 2?). 

I'll be excited to hear what other people say, and certainly don't take my opinion for scripture. But IMHO, I think we are looking at two different aspects of the Christian faith. If we look at the scope of Biblical human existence we have creation, fall, redemption and restoration, in that order. Salvation is a moment that happens at redemption which marks a fundamental change in the self. This fundamental change is about going from one state of being to another. This is the yoke is easy and burden is light passage. Our sanctification is the process of moving from redemption to restoration. Certainly it is Jesus who move in and through us (Philippians 2:13), but our discipleship is our response to the salvation we've received. 

Passages such as ""my yoke is easy, and my burden is light"" refer to our regenerated state of being. Because we've been redeemed, we no longer strive in vain, but have been justified by God through Christ. No longer do we have to appease God by our own works, but we've been freed by slavery to sin. In this most fundamental sin, his burden is light. 

Now because we've been freed of the intolerable yoke of slavery to sin, we're free to find our way to sanctification. But this is the process which refines us by fire. For us to stand face to face with God, all of our sin must be burned away, which is the biggest hell we'll ever experience. Jesus has allowed us the opportunity to burn sin and idolatry away, and he is the one that does so, but it hurts. Certainly we need to take up our cross daily and crucify our sinful nature. This refining we experience is only tolerable because we are fundamentally secure in Christ. If not, we would be exchanging our idols for emptiness, which could arguably be literal hell. 

And so to speak more directly to your passage about the narrow gate, we find that Jesus is that narrow gate. If we begin by looking at the gaping chasms (sin) on either side of the path, we've already lost. It's only when we look to Jesus as the one who has already forgiven us and trust in the Holy Spirit that we're able to cross the path. How otherwise could we be perfect as our Heavenly Father is perfect (Matthew 5:48)? 

tl;dr Matthew 7 refers to our arduous sanctification, Matthew 11 to our free gift of salvation. ","1301621362"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I'm replying here to another set of comments you left deeper in this thread. You seem to have a huge axe to grind with feminism, the term making appearances even in your briefest comments.

Down below, in response to someone who told you ""I deny that any significant population fits with your strawman vision of feminism"" you said:

&gt;Then you are a fool.

That is a *very* compelling argument, Celda. However, as I will establish, you're not exactly an authority on feminism or feminist thinkers.

&gt;Feminists will tell you that they agree with what I have said here:

I'm a feminist and I don't agree with that; certainly not the slipshod and un-caveated way you phrased that. I suppose I just proved you wrong there.

Men and women have biological differences. But these are differences that are mediated, interpreted, and ushered about by culture. Put another way, it is our nature to nurture. For example,

&gt;Carol Tavris, in The Mismeasure of Woman, uses psychology and sociology to critique theories that use essentialism and biological reductionism to explain differences between men and women

Essentialism and biological reductionism refer specifically to asserting all visible gender differences are *essential* to males and females; we are born with x, y, and z and nothing can possible alter or change that. So, that is to say, for example, boys are born with better spatial reasoning skills than girls and that's just a fact, plain and simple. Except that anthropologists have shown that girls raised in societies that were more gender equal in child rearing practises had spatial skills that matched their male counterparts'.

Another feminist insight into biology is that it is not *static*. What we are born with is subject to tremendous change as we live out our lives. This isn't to say biology has no role or influence, but that it is not a simplistic, determinist force ineluctably acting on humans. There's a more dialectical relationship present wherein we influence our own biology and it in turn influences us over our life course. The latter distinction is critical: our bodies change over the course of our lives, and the ways in which we can be influenced by them or by our environment are quite complicated and themselves evolve as we live out our lives.

To say that biology influences us is not to say that it *determines* us. What evidence we have suggests that people can be born with certain inclinations- these inclinations sometimes cleave along male/female lines, and many times they do not. But how those inclinations are managed, whether they actualise themselves into anything or fizzle, what specific shape they take, and so on... does depend a lot on our culture. Culture also shapes our bodies in very real, and sometimes very lasting ways.

So, no, it's deeply tendentious and simplistic to say that ""feminism"" en toto, full stop, all-inclusive believes that one sentence you wrote. There's a question of degree, and above all there's a question of whether or not you've listened to what feminists are actually saying. It is a good deal more complicated than you're making it out to be.

&gt;However, as I already said and proved

You didn't prove anything, really, and are ignoring research done by people who call themselves feminist that scientifically disproves specific evo psych-influenced theses. They played fair; fairer than you are in this argument, to be sure. So, in sum, when it comes to accusing others of ""intellectual dishonesty,"" well, mind that rather delicate looking glass house you're throwing those stones from.","1301621363"

1. Tethering. No, ATT, I'm not giving you $20 a month for something my phone does without your ""help"". Especially given that I only need it very occasionally and that I don't get any more data with it.
2. Messaging. Not just biteSMS, but email, IM, and SMS. With lockinfo, I can see notifications for all of these things at a glance, even if I get more than one at a time. I don't have to unlock my phone to see the last email that came in, etc.
3. Native support for Google Voice. Saves me money, and it's a lifesaver for a dozen other things as well. With PhoneGVextension, and SMS GV extension, I can use the regular Phone and SMS apps and have everything work like it should.

There's quite a few other little tweaks I like (autosilent - profile manager for the iPhone that automatically silences certain alerts or all based on your preference) and Folder enhancer, and Winterboard so I don't have to deal with the stock SMS tones anymore.

Anyway, I don't think I could deal with a stock iPhone anymore. I keep my iPad stock and my old 3G that we use like a Touch, but for my actual phone I feel like I need these capabilities. If I had to give up jailbreaks, I'd probably get a blackberry and an iPod touch.","1301621363"

Frequently, confidence and self-esteem are excessively enlarged, and grand, extravagant ideas are expressed. Behavior that is out of character and risky, foolish or inappropriate may result from a loss of normal social restraint. The frequency of manic episodes varies, but on average, manic episodes occur every 2–4 years.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Whenever someone told me they were getting money for a place to spend the night, I'd point them towards a homeless shelter or a church.  The response is, ""No, I need cash.""

I've been asked for bus fare outside the complex where I live.  I gave him five dollars (bus fare is $2.00)  On my way back out, he told me he'd been begging for bus fare all day and still didn't have enough for a ride.

I was coming back from the grocery store and I offered a bag of bagels to someone who was asking for food.  He asked if they were sweet.  They were onion bagels, so he wouldn't take them.  Not sweet enough.

The last time I talked to a homeless person, I did so just for the conversation.  I listened to his story, and he told me that he was thinking about mugging people for money.  When I told him that's a bad idea and that I'd help him find a shelter that will help him with food and get him on his feet, he told me that if I didn't give him money he'd take it from me next time we met because ""people like you need to have your teeth kicked in to realize that twenty bucks isn't that much.""

The story is called [How to Stop an Insurgency](http://books.google.com/books?id=msD-op7xi6YC&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;ots=aQ3TcvbKw0&amp;dq=ajahn%20brahm%20thai%20government&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) and that link should take you to page 84 of his book.

Its just... not very well thought out, its an impulsive act and relies on threats.  Discipline does NOT have to take this form. 

I wrote what I did because I just wish more people would THINK about discipline going beyond punishment and threats. The best discipline is that which is effective even when parents are not around, and this kind is the type to fail because it does not draw on internal motivation or natural consequences (consequences enforced only by parents are only superficially effective in the long run).  

""For fucks sake, they're teenagers!""  Why do we accept that somehow, kids are going to get to being 16 years old and have no concept of the value of hanging up clothes they tried on, or why can't we expect that a quiet word alone in a way that develops empathy and shows respect for the teen, would be just as effective.  Yes, sometimes teens may need to be reminded of things or shown the realities of someone else's life... but to me, mom screaming at them and threatening them is poor quality parenting. ","1301621368"

I could almost never get hard when by myself with a guy... if he was very persistent giving me head I could sometimes get partway there for a little bit, but never for long and I never came. A lot of the guys, they liked the fact that I was straight and didn't get hard. *shrug*

As far as when the wife was there, it was VERY arousing and while I wouldn't get off while the guy was there (something about him being there just kept me from getting into that head-space) it would almost always lead to awesome sex afterwards with just me and my wife.

The first time I ever ""handled"" a cock it was kinda weird, but my wife and I were blowing him together so it was still pretty hot because I was fondling her the whole time. It's kind of hard to explain, but it was almost like interactive porn.

This state trooper pulls over this sports car. The driver of the sports car is acting quite nervous. The trooper can smell his fear so he asks him to get out of the car for a search. The cop starts rooting around the car and bingo he finds a large bag full of powdered cocaine. Piggy gives the guy a smile, takes the bag and lines up a huge rail on the hood of the dude's car and then blows it. Suddenly the cop goes erect and completely stiff, his head faces the sun and his eyes open towards it. His face takes on a look as if he's seen god. He then collapses and dies. The guy jumps back in his car and pulls away. 

The troopers find the cop dead on the side of the road and watch the video taken from his dash cam. They call for a toxicology report and find he had ripped half a gram of LSD.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; The personal attack is because you get upvoted and nobody tells you what you should be hearing. Rather, they reinforce your false and misguided beliefs. All I can do is be honest and hope that you get the message, whether you agree or nor.

If your ideas have merit state them clearly and concisely as I have done.  By resorting to personal attacks you have conceded that you ideas lack merit.  


&gt; Your talent only enriches the undeserving? If you and your friends are so deserving why haven't you started your own company? Why haven't you enriched yourselves? Those ""undeserving"" folks took risks and chances, and put themselves on the line to get there. 

I have, twice in fact.  Once successfully and once unsuccessfully.  And like most small business owners I was no where near the top 1% earns.  Small businesses and small business owners are not the problem in our society.  


&gt; Maybe some got lucky, 

And that is one of my greatest objection to our system.  In my experience you need three things to be successful in life:

1. Talent

2. Hard-work

3. Luck

It is my contention that the measure of a meritocracy is the third.  In a true meritocracy your success is strongly dependent on your hard-work and talent and weakly dependent on luck.  Unfortunately the declining social mobility in our society is evidence of the decline of meritocracy.  

&gt; Your talent only enriches the undeserving?

Where did I say my talents ""only"" enrich the undeserving?

&gt; Our society benefits from the rich.

I agree with this point, I never claimed otherwise.  However society also benefits from the common workers.  The key question is: how does their contribution compare with their compensation.  I think the top 1% are being grossly over-compensated for their contribution while the average worker is being under-compensated.   

This is my greatest objection to our current economic system: it rewards the wrong people.  Namely banks, wall-street and executives.  Traditional the stock market has been an engine for distributing wealth to the most deserving.  If a company is well run and beneficial it will profit and its stock will rise.  This is fundamentally what makes our brand of capitalism work.  Unfortunately the deregulation of wall street has transformed it into a casino.  Stock prices are determined by mathematical models rather than value.  CEO's sacrifice long-term viability for illusional short-term profits.  This gamblers mentality has made the economy more volatile and reduced the market's effectiveness as a wealth distribution system.  In other words their contribution to society is decreasing while their compensation increases.  

&gt; The rich don't proportionately benefit from our society.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Motorcycle accident.

I came off my bike at the top of a mountain road in a state park. I ran too wide on a corner. I dislocated my shoulder and I'd done something to my knee, but wasn't sure what it was. 

I put my shoulder back in place, picked my bike up and rode down to the Ranger's station to get him to call a medic. When I got to the door, I realised I'd left my glasses at the accident scene, so I saddled up and rode back up the mountain to get them, before returning.

Back at the Ranger's station, I called an ambulance and took a seat. I asked the Ranger if I could park my bike in his compound and he said:

&gt; ""Well you're walking, so I reckon they'll be able to patch you up and you'll be on your way""

When the ambulance got there, they pulled back by jeans to reveal an unsightly red mass where my knee had been. 


&gt;""How are you feeling?"" the medic said

&gt;""A bit pissed off"" I replied

&gt;""Why's that?""

&gt;""Well, I've got this awesome wound, but my no camera to take a photo of it to send to my mom""

&gt;""What's your cell number?"" he said


And took the following [picture](http://imgur.com/GYvXr) after a bit of clean up (NSFLunch).

With that being said, I'm well aware of the fact that UT is the better school. However, two things are making me consider UH:

First, from what I've heard (from various people, including med school students), where you go isn't very important for med school. It's more about getting a good GPA and getting a good rec letter from a professor or maybe even the Dean. 

Second, the current situation I'm in makes staying in Houston a bit more favorable. My dad passed away in my freshman year, so the cheaper cost will put less of a financial strain on my mom, and me being able to come home on weekends will be helpful to my family since at the moment I'm the ""man of the house"" if you will.

It would've slowed down significantly if it was pea-sized (as the article states) and would probably be traveling at it's terminal velocity, which, for a pea-sized piece of space rock, would be much, much less than 30,000MPH.

Oh, and if it was traveling at 30,000MPH, there's no way he would have even seen it falling.

In the Chitil-Erdi compositional type inference, the `GeneralType` is really a `MonomorphicTyping`, for reasons that I don't comprehend yet.  A `MonomorphicTyping` is `(MonomorphicTypeEnv, Type)`.

I used it to establish context.  Establishing context is necessary.  I'll point out later were you failed to establish context, and are less intelligible because of it.

&gt;sarcasm and hyperbole 

If you can't tell the difference between the level of methaphor involved in me writing ""rapid"" once per post, and your use of 50 hyperbolic words, two of which were ""fuck"", then I don't think I can teach you the difference.

&gt;believe it or not, the 'f word' is not necessarily a great indicator of anger and or rage.

How am I supposed to know that you choose to take certain words with non-standerd meanings?  More people swear when they're angry than for no reason, and when your use of the words is in the context of ""insignificant fucks"" and ""fuck you"", I have more than enough evidence to justifiably believe that you used them in anger.

&gt;while this may be the case sometimes, it hardly seems true for this one.

You didn't establish context, and I have to struggle to find you intelligible.

&gt;context and another on parent brings everything into view.

I still haven't found the other discussion about this XKCD comment you keep bring up.  I found people discussing Idocracy, but I still haven't found anyone else discussing the comic.  Link me?

&gt;the 'reddiquette' link, it probably needs more obvious placement than it currently has

Considering how many people have probably used the link, I have to agree.  The site's designed to have all the meta-content at the bottom though, so I guess it goes against the design ideology.  I wish it were more prominent too.

&gt;why anyone would look at the help section

I know I used to refer to it pretty often to help me with the commenting [syntax.](http://www.reddit.com/help/commenting)  I didn't know anything about Markdown before using Reddit.

&gt;it's a comic

Yeah, you're right.  I'm not really bothered by the comic.  I'm more bothered by the people that don't find anything wrong with it, and who celebrate it without questioning all the logical issues.  It seems like plenty of otherwise intelligent people fall into the logical and rhetorical tricks that Randall uses.

&gt;he isn't obligated to 'show his work' on his strip

You're right, and I wouldn't expect that.  I do expect for him to have some small reason, instead of having the man in the hat essentially say ""you're wrong"" to propositions that are highly defensible.  If nothing else, that isn't funny for any reason beyond absurdity.

&gt;thanks for the suggestion

Is this about Uppers and Downers?  Again, context man =)  Even if you don't care about seeing how many upvotes and downvotes different comments have, it also inserts really useful vertical lines that help you follow threaded comments better.  Can't recommend it enough.

&gt;i still don't see how web validation should ever affect someone's life

What I was trying to express was that I don't recieve web validation at all by being upvoted or commented on.  I just wanted people to use reddit as it should be used, and engage me in the conversation.

&gt;thanks and will do.

I think I get the context of this one, but I did have to check back on it.  Not like it's a big deal, but this is where quotes have utility.

&gt;it seems fairly common that people explain their edits

I was trying to express that no one'd think less of you for the dropped ""a"".  People do explain edits like you do, but if they wanted to they could explain something small like you did and actually whitewash.  Not that you did this at all.  But explaining edits that small is often less confidence inspiring than leaving the small mistake.

&gt;i don't truly believe that people have trouble telling when a sentence begins.

This is actually a major issue with modern communication.  The purpose of capitalizing in a modern context has nothing to do with identifying the start of sentences, and everything to do with providing anchoring points for users who are scanning the text for one reason or another.  By quickly visually identifying the starts of sentences, proper names, and the pronoun ""I"", it makes it a lot easier to re-read posted text.  It's one of the core text ideologies in web design.","1301621456"

"politics","t5_2cneq","So I downvoted this. Where to start. 

First I will start with the objective approach. Many of you would take the word of a climatologist, because he's studied the climate. I'm a lawyer so, so take my objectivity of laws with the same respect. let me tell you I wish I could convince the world of this because it would make everything run smoother. Legal analysis is a science, it wasn't something that was just made up one day from haphazard whimsical opinions of the masses. The current law of ""Separation Church &amp; State"" is the Lemon Test.  A law does not violate the separation of church and state clause of the constitution so long as the law (1) has a secular purpose, (2) has neither the effect of advancing nor prohibiting religion, and (3) the law does not result in excessive government entanglement with religion. Even the most firm, but objective, atheist would see this as reasonable.

Next. The application of Federal Funds for religious schools. So, the article is biased, it has an agenda. So it doesn't really break down how the money is being spent, which is crucial to any legal analysis. For Example, buying bibles or buying secular textbooks? Many charter schools have religious affiliations, the way a lot of charter schools work is through a lottery system, a parent can choose either the public school in their district, or to what is usually a better charter school that has religious affiliations. The controlling law is that a scholarship given to a student, who may attend either public or the charter school, but decides on the charter school, who has religious affiliations does not violate the constitution. (This was a 5/4 decision) so it is arguable, but I, subjectively, believe it's the correct decision. 

so we've objectively taken out the analysis of Separation of church and state and pointed out the bias of the source by its omissions of relevant material to get people to hop on the bandwagon as opposed to providing important information.

Now I give my subjective diatribe. Science is hard, science is good, and I will NEVER argue against science. But science's application is always limited to the HOW question, and never the WHY. WHY is addressed by religion and philosophy. How life works vs. why we are alive. If you are dogmatic, you might say that science has shown that one answer to the why question that science actually gives is CHANCE, but of course never science points to DESIGN. If you're on the chance train, then I can't argue that. It's a valid position. I've chosen otherwise... to think that there is more than chance, essentially because I like it better. I see it as leading somewhere (See Tolstoy's Confessions). 

I'm 26. I don't believe in a father-figure Christians Creator God. But I believe in more than just chance. Where does that put me? Fuck if I know. I consider myself a ""religionist."" I see my role as defending religious beliefs, but I live always in socratic doubt. Certainty is the human attribute that has led to war and the holocaust etc. Certainty is one of my least favorite characteristics of a human. I also find it unintelligible as it fails to recognize humanity's size in the face of time and space. 

Atheism and Agnosticism is very very very trendy for us [in the west]. It's like the Fight Club of worldviews. It's essentially been presented and sold to us much like any pop song or mainstream music video. There is no one who is intelligently articulating a religious worldview. I attempt to do that, but you will NEVER see me tolerating injustice and oppression, those who use religion to justify their oppression of other people don't deserve a defense, other than that all humans are flawed. It wasn't the religion that made them hate gays, it was their stupidity. 

According to the short time and minimal effort, I hope some of this made sense.

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","That is one weird dream. haha. My dreams are rather weird too though so no matter, that's what dreams are.  The marriage counselor bit is a spot of brilliance though. 

I actually had one about River Song, though it was far more mundane. It was the night before last I believe.  I was watching the Doctor and he met a blonde woman with a hairdo less curly than rivers, but still long and wavy at the ends. This woman looked to be in her very early 20's and had no clue who the Doctor was or what he was doing, but she seemed friendly enough and interested in him.  

The dream was more like I was sitting on the couch watching an episode, though much larger in my vision than a television screen. I was still an observer though watching Doctor Who, not in it. The Doctor was curious about this woman but soon seemed to have a moment of realization about her and agreed to take her adventuring with him.  I realized as well at this moment that I must be seeing River's first encounter with The Doctor, though unlike the current state of things, the Doctor seemed extremely knowledgeable about her, as if they had been on many more adventures than we are currently up to now.  He had known her for years or possibly decades of his time, but she was just meeting him, and he let her come on as a companion because he knew where it would lead. 

That's the end of the dream, I can't remember if it was Matt Smith or a later Doctor in the dream, possibly even an old man looking Doctor several incarnations down the line.  I think this would be an interesting plot point though if the [""best man she ever knew"" that she supposedly kills](/spoiler) would be the Doctor. She could do it before she even knew who he is and would only regret it in retrospect when she learns what a good guy he is.","1301621474"

I was down at Waikiki, and occasionally there's guys with parrots that let you hold one, take a picture with it, etc.  
My dad told me to try and hold one, so I figured why the hell not?

The parrot owner was instructing me on how to hold the parrot, but instead of it hopping onto my hand, it bit the fuck out of my finger.  
Yada yada, dad flipped a shit, cops came, parrot owner dude ran away somewhere. I don't remember the details, but I do remember the cops finding the owner's car which was filled with parrots.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Well, yes and no. On one hand you've just unlocked the ring of +1 sexual adventures, wielded by the mighty wizard Mok'thor and his affinity for gumjobs, but on the other hand you sort of limit your possibilities. 

Personally, I'd come clean at this point. ""Darling, you're beautiful and amazing, but you're too young for me. I need a real woman, a really old woman"". She'll cry, you'll cry, she'll hug you, and you'll be able to force the air out of her lungs by lunging up into her diaphragm, knocking her out instantly. Break out the Legend of Zelda soundtrack and grey hair dye, it's adventure time.

The first thing you'll need to do is age her. One method to do this is just knock her out every time she wakes up for the next thirty years, but I don't have the time for that- I have communists to kill. Alternatively, steal heatlamps from McDonalds and leave her under one for 83 days or so. If they can ruin my chips in two hours, they can ruin her DNA in two thousand. 

With her hair dyed a subtle shade of ashen grey and her skin somewhere between turtle vagina and Ethiopian soil, it's now just a matter of teaching her to become old. Feed her drugs by the handful (if you don't know which to get, just find a black dude and say ""one drugs please"" with a dollar in your hand) so her memory goes to hell, fill her head with stories from 1920, and explain knitting in a way that makes it sound like the new oral sex.

Now you've got a thirty year old ninety year old girlfriend. Beyond the obvious sexual element, you have many new games to play. Given her senility she won't be able to report you to the police for gross abuse, allowing you the ability to make her do whatever you want however you wish. Some ideas:

- Pack animal. It's like having a donkey that gives you gumjobs. Make her build a pyramid in the backyard by carrying limestone blocks on her wheelchair. Make her cart you and your friends around in a wagon with pirate hats, pretending you're on the HMS Smells Like Faeces and Butterscotch Candy. Hook up China and make her drag it to South America for April Fool's Day. 

- Gumjobs. If you've ever wondered what fucking a slimy caterpillar is like, gumjobs are the Willy Wonka of perverse sexual misdeeds. Again because of the senility, you can remind her every five minutes that she's not gave you one since 1953 and guilt trip her feeble mind into sweet, bloody-gummed relief. 

- Stealing nice things. Nobody's going to stop an old person from stealing things, especially if you make her slightly retarded first by pumping pure oxygen into her room as she sleeps.

- Smuggling things. Whether it's for cartel obligation or pleasure, old people are border cop-proof. If I had a vagina, the first thing I'd do would be smuggle fresh fruit into a cinema so that I could have a healthy snack as I watch my movie. There's an idea.

- Gumjobs. Just in case you forgot. She did. Capitalise on that.

- Hard candy. You know you love it. She has it. You don't know where she got it, but it's in a glass bowl shaped like a frog that plays melodies from biblical times if you open the lid and you'll spend hours trying to circumvent whatever demon machine does this because there's nothing better than a piece of hard candy that's halfway carbonised.

- Advice. Sure, she's technically still thirty and is stupid enough to go to Montenegro with $500, but every old person has sage advice. Degrade her brain further, get her to develop tourette syndrome, write down the shit she says, and become an internet millionaire. 

- Scooter wars. I love those scooters that they have at grocery stores. It's like having your own personal battle mech and licence to kill. Outfit hers with a katana, yours with a broadsword, and tape her hand to the forward button so that you can joust without her backing out like a little puss. Make sure her katana is capped off with something soft- old people are prone to hurting themselves.

- Lifealert. Remember those ""I've fallen and I can't get up!"" adverts that were so funny? Get her to reenact them by pushing her down stairs. She'll forget you did by the time the police show up. Use this time to get a gumjob.

There's just an endless variety of fun things you can do with your girlfriend now. Your relationship is revamped, the spark is there again, you might even regret shortening her lifespan by 40 years, but remember one thing. She brought this on herself with whatever she did when this thread started. I completely forget. Still a cunt.  ","1301621499"

Well, let's say that brevity is important.  For the sake of brevity you begin omitting more and more information.  As you omit more and more, you begin to rely more and more on context and connotation.

That's one relationship.

Second reason I thought of length is that my proposed title is longer than the original reddit title.  There might even be a title length limit built into reddit which my proposed title exceeds.  I just wanted to address that issue up front without waiting for it.  I guess I should have just waited for it to arise and responded to it then.","1301621504"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Here is one passage where Jesus clearly claims to be God.  

&gt; Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me. Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word. Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.” “You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!” “Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, **I am!**”  (John 8:56-58)

Jesus is clearly claiming to be God.  'I AM' is the name God gave to Moses.

&gt; Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?”God said to Moses, “**I AM WHO I AM**.This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘**I AM** has sent me to you.’” (Exodus 3:13-14)

But maybe this is a translation thing? After all John is written in Greek not Hebrew. Nope, this explanation does not fit the context.   

&gt; “**before Abraham was born**, I am!” 

Clearly, the Jews understood what Jesus was claiming.

&gt; At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.  (John 8:59)

The apostles also clearly taught that Christ is God. To quote a few more verses.

&gt; ""to them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen."" (Rom 9:5)

&gt; ""Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever."" (Hebrews 13:8)

I think you are misunderstanding Luke 18:19.  Jesus is *not* denying that He is God. He uses a rhetorical question to challenge a misconception that the rich young ruler had. 

&gt; A certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 

The rich young ruler thought that he had obeyed God's commandments *perfectly* and that he could earn eternal life. Christ immediately challenges this misconception.   

&gt; A certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
“Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God alone. You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’” “All these I have kept since I was a boy,” he said.

&gt; When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was a man of great wealth. Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?” Jesus replied, “What is impossible with men is possible with God.” ","1301621541"

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","Think of it by looking at the forces acting on the gearbox. While you're speeding forward normally, the engine is obviously pushing the gearbox in one direction, and the wheels the other. The engine is ""winning"", because you're accellerating.

When you let go the accellerator, suddenly the forces being supplied by the wheels are ""winning"" because the bike is slowing down.

The idea of clutchless upshifing is that by only lightly preloading the shifter, you're using very little force. At the instant that the forces acting on the gearbox go to zero [ie, as the engine and the wheels are applying the same force through the gear box, for a net total of zero], the gear snicks into position because there are no forces acting on it. Then rolling back on to keep the torque being delivered to the back wheel the same stops anything from jerking around. Correctly upshifting without the clutch significantly reduces wear on both your gearbox and your clutch.

FWIW, The mistake I was making when I was learning was that you have to roll off and on quite fast. I read Parks' book and tried it, but it was only after going on youtube that I realised I wasn't rolling fast enough.

If you draw the typical chart of torque vs RPM, you'll see that nearer the higher end, a change of RPM has less significant of an effect on torque, wheras lower in the range, there's a higher torque difference for the same-ish drop in revs.

This is why if you shift at while your RPMs are higher, there's less fighting of the back wheel; it's big sudden changes in torque that cause problems.

Of course, having said all that, I'm sure someone smarter than me will tell me why all that's wrong. If I am, I'd love to update my mental model to be correct.","1301621546"

Or that, even if you were 100% correct, it wouldn't give you the right to mock anyone who disagreed with your statement or presentation. The mentality you're talking about is, in fact, flawed. That hardly means any disagreement with reasons backing that observation is so obviously unfounded, and that kind of thinking is exactly what results in such flawed ideas being held as absolute truth.

At any rate, condoms protecting both partners should affect your theory, as it makes STD transmission largely irrelevant. I feel the idea of STD transmission affecting ancient mating beyond the early death of the infected is largely without merit. First, there is the presence of the far-above mentioned theory explaining the case. Second, in an era with little knowledge of disease, let alone the nature of an STD or HIV, taking the time to carefully observe a prospective mate for a specific sickness seems absurd. As well, the factor of males being less at risk for STDs should be factored when considering that a male should care less.

There was going to be a lot more response and a lot less summation, but suddenly much of the text on Reddit has gone tiny, and I can't fix it.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I am going to keep this brief, since you are obviously an ideologue, and the only conversation you are willing to have is the one where you convert your interlocutor. I write, to paraphrase Timothy Williamson, not to convince you, but to win over unaffiliated readers.

(1) I am aware than Rand considers herself an empiricist (at times; sometimes she claims to transcend the rationalist/empiricist debate entirely). Her epistemology and theory of concepts directly states that all knowledge is derived from sense-experience. 

(2) Despite this avowal, she also claims that existence, identity, and consciousness are *a priori* and cannot be rejected without being used in the course of rejection. They are not susceptible of proof: they are required for proof.

(3) Her writings have no empirical content. They are metaphysical, through and through. She conducts no study and cites no science. I identify her arguments as being in the deductive mode since the conclusions are purportedly *necessary* consequences of axiomatic premises. The definition of deductive is that the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusions. In Rand's case, the fundamental axioms bring one from 'reason' to 'rational egoism' to 'laissez-faire capitalism'. At no point is the deductive structure lost; otherwise you would have no admit it was possible that the premises true and conclusion false under a certain counter-factual circumstance. But since the conclusion is 'necessary,' there is no such counter-model for Rand. Ergo, her argument is metaphysical and deductive, and not empirical and inductive. That her epistemology is allegedly empirical has nothing to do with this.

(4) If we had bother to bring in inductive argument or scientific research, we would quickly see how her primitive empiricism collapses. The evidence for innate knowledge is overwhelming. The only question is how much, precisely, and how this manifests itself in our concept-formation.

(5)  Her ethics has been criticized, rightly so, as question begging. She merely *affirms* a naturalistic and teleological orientation and proceeds from the 'obviousness' of this thesis. Many who do not find her characterization plausible or attractive might be deemed 'irrational' for, ironically, basically Kantian reasons: consistent rejection of self-preservation for other goals leads to death (i.e., the universalization of the non-teleological goal is a negation of life, and life is required for value: hence the only ethic is a self-preservative one). 

(6) In any event, it is a biological commonplace that survival of the individual is not a necessary facet of 'life' as we know it on Earth. An understanding of genetic transmission bears this out, even if one does not subscribe to the extreme Dawkins-ian 'selfish genome' view. That she claims to have solved the is-ought problems on largely these grounds is risible.

In conclusion, my dear Ultimate Philosopher, while your constant defensiveness is oddly endearing, I must cut our conversation short. You will continue reading Rand and the objectivist literature churned out by her foundations as a Rabbi reads the Talmud: that is to say, knowing it is right beforehand, and then figuring out how to interpret it to ensure this happy situation continues. I, meanwhile, will carry on with serious philosophy and, with some luck,  to a long and prosperous career in academia. This is where our paths diverge. Enjoy your downvotes.","1301621551"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Here's the process. Deviation or jumping ahead won't work, in fact, I suggest getting your state's **LLTA** prior to step 1 now that I think about it.

1) Give the management co. **written** notice of a violation of the lease. In this case, the heat. The heat is substandard/unhealthy and provide as much detail as possible, like ""We set the stat to 69 degrees and waited three hours and the temp was still at 55."" 

Explain that this is unacceptable per the terms of the lease (I'm assumming the lease states a. who **provides** the heat= LANDLORD (I assume) and b. who **pays** for it . . . doesn't matter in this case. This is standard info within a legal lease. 

*******From then on, **document** *any and all* communications. Names, dates, subject, etc. etc. ******* 

Ask them to please repair it in a reasonable amount of time (24 hours or less), otherwise, you will consider them in violation of the terms of the lease and you will excersise your right to terminate.

2) wait and see

3) If, after 24 hrs, the heat is still inadequate, give them written notice that you will terminate the lease agreement on the grounds that they failed to comply. 

4) If they give you shit and try to tell you ""you're doing it wrong"" or say it doesn't work that way, be cool about it and 

5) Go home and look up your state's **""Landlord/Tenant Act""** online. The LLTA is an interpretation of the laws of your state provided by the state and serves as the defacto ""LAW"" for stuff like this unless, and until, it makes it into an actual court of law. 

It is very easy to read and understand. There should be an entire chapter outlining the very scenario you are currently in. 

6) Readjust your position based on the LLTA if necessary and proceed.

It basically breaks down like this. The _actus reus_ for the crime was met, because she wasn't consenting. It doesn't matter for the purpose of the _actus reus_ that she didn't say anything. However, from the point of view of the police, they may have believed she was consenting. Therefore, there would not be a requisite _mens rea_ for the crime -being guilty of rape requires _knowing_ that the other person was not consenting, and that is hard to prove if the complainant never said that they didn't consent. However, due to the fact that they had guns, there were several of them, they were authority figures, they were intimidating, it may be possible that a reasonable person would have understood that she was not consenting. This is an issue for trial.","1301621580"

No, I didn't ""demand"". Your original point didn't mention that there was a synagogue, church, temple and mosque within 1 km. You mentioned a temple, but that was 3 mi away.

Furthermore, you seem to have conveniently ignored the point I made repeatedly that this houses of worship existed long before the ones you mentioned in the US. So I personally think there is something unique in that.

Σ is a set of type equations, it is usually the input to the unification functions.  It is generally implemented as `[(Type, Type)]`.

`mgu` is a function that takes in one type equation, then outputs either a substitution function (to be composed with other substitution functions) or a further set of equations, or errors.

----

There doesn't seem to be any decent algorithm for handling subtyping.  For example, I might want to define integers in my language to have a very specific range (e.g. `Int 0 31` for a 5-bit binary vector).  Of course, `Int 0 31` is a subtype of `Int 0 63`, as it is possible to put any `Int 0 31` into an `Int 0 63`, but not vice versa (at least without losing data).

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","In parking, as in most things, I follow [Wheaton's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wil_Wheaton#Wheaton.27s_Law).  Don't be a dick.  In parking lots, you can usually find a spot that's not technically a parking spot, but also doesn't block or interfere with pedestrian traffic, the operation of the business, or other parking spots.  *Stay away from handicapped spots*.  I would caution you to make sure that your bike is VISIBLE to the idiot cagers that aren't paying attention.  I've had some people almost run over my bike because they think they can whip into a parking space.   I've also had people almost back into me when entering or leaving street-parking (especially when they're parallel parking).

One other thing I'll touch on, as I haven't seen it mentioned...  Make sure you can safely re-mount your bike, and safely enter the flow of traffic.  As a new rider, I damn near trapped myself a few times.  Either the bike was leaning a lot, or I was wedged in somewhere where I couldn't see traffic.  Also remember when parking next to other bikes to leave enough room for the other riders to re-mount and leave without banging handlebars, pegs, etc.  There can be a tendency to cram many bikes into a small area, especially at gatherings, which can make exiting difficult.","1301621623"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","The difference between parents and God, and the reason your analogy falls apart immediately, is that parents aren't perfect.  Even the best parents sometimes resort to physical discipline because they cannot conceive of a better way to protect and educate their children.  God, however, operates under no limitations.  If god exists, then we are living in a world specifically and minutely tailored to his exact specifications, and the only conclusion one can draw from this is that a legacy of human suffering is part of his master plan.

How much suffering are you willing to blindly concede as part of God's plan?  Read Revelations for an utterly chilling account of the extent to which God is allegedly willing to go to ""punish"" his children.  God hasn't just ""punished"" people, though--he's repeatedly committed genocide.  How much is enough?

&gt; Authorities have every right to impose pain on those under their authority if the authority determines it's for their own good.

Do you not realize how utterly outrageous this sounds?  I'm tempted to invoke Godwin's Law, but instead I'll just give you the benefit of the doubt and believe you are merely ignorant.

&gt; I never said that God had to use suffering in order to accomplish his purposes. All I said was that it was his choice to do so.

But God doesn't have a choice.  He must be perfect and good at all times.  Therefore, he apparently *has* to use suffering, or else he is not perfect.  If he doesn't have to use suffering, then he must either be evil or have an unknowable reason, which requires special pleading.  This is what I've been trying to tell you over and over.","1301621634"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","*Thank you effgee*.  This story is patently implausible.  Although I'm no expert on the subject, from my basic understanding of physics, by the time the meteor reaches sea level, the atmosphere has slowed its velocity to suborbital (and probably subsonic) speeds, with atmospheric friction reducing it greatly in size.  However, it is still traveling at lethal speeds.  A meteorite the size of a baseball would have killed you outright.  Something the size of a golf ball would have taken your hand off.  As counter-intuitive as it sounds, a pea-sized meteorite would have bounced harmlessly off of you because it is aerodynamically unstable and will have a very low terminal velocity.  There is a very narrow range of size and speed the meteorite would have had to attain to leave a wound like that, and allow you to live and tell the tale.  I'm not saying it's completely impossible, but a lot of things can leave wounds like that (the scars seem consistent with some electrical burns I've seen) which are far more likely to happen to children.  Occam's razor tells us we should seek a simpler explanation for those wounds.

The Community Reinvestment Act was used to force banks to make trillions in loans in low income communities as part of a plan to empower low income individuals:

[The Trillion-Dollar Bank Shakedown That Bodes Ill for Cities](http://www.city-journal.org/html/10_1_the_trillion_dollar.html)

&gt;Howard Husock

&gt;**Winter 2000**

&gt;The Clinton administration has turned the Community Reinvestment Act, a once-obscure and lightly enforced banking regulation law, into one of the most powerful mandates shaping American cities—and, as Senate Banking Committee chairman Phil Gramm memorably put it, a vast extortion scheme against the nation's banks. Under its provisions, U.S. banks have committed nearly $1 trillion for inner-city and low-income mortgages and real estate development projects, most of it funneled through a nationwide network of left-wing community groups, intent, in some cases, on teaching their low-income clients that the financial system is their enemy and, implicitly, that government, rather than their own striving, is the key to their well-being.

Government sponsored enterprises meanwhile massively increased their intervention in the sub-prime sector starting in the early 2000s, considerably contributing to the sub-prime bubble:

[Fannie Mae Eases Credit To Aid Mortgage Lending](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/30/business/fannie-mae-eases-credit-to-aid-mortgage-lending.html)

&gt;Fannie Mae Eases Credit To Aid Mortgage Lending

&gt;By STEVEN A. HOLMES

&gt;**Published: September 30, 1999**

&gt;In a move that could help increase home ownership rates among minorities and low-income consumers, the Fannie Mae Corporation is easing the credit requirements on loans that it will purchase from banks and other lenders.

&gt;The action, which will begin as a pilot program involving 24 banks in 15 markets -- including the New York metropolitan region -- will encourage those banks to extend home mortgages to individuals whose credit is generally not good enough to qualify for conventional loans. Fannie Mae officials say they hope to make it a nationwide program by next spring.

&gt;Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.

This article explains how government intervention caused the financial crisis:

I'd offer some of my personal understanding, though I'm open to discussion about it and could be wrong.
In genesis it says that God spoke and things came into being. Later in proverbs it says that Jesus was the masterworker. In John it says the word was made flesh, whose word? God's word. So.. putting these texts together, is it a stretch to say that when God created the world, Jesus was the words that came from His mouth? 

If you understand it this way, you still recognise that there is only one God. You can see how they can be separate yet very much one. Imagining it visually is always going to be a problem for us, at least until the end.

&gt; ""And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is God."" It seems pretty clear that the two are separate.

Jesus could very easily be saying here that He is God, don't discard that strong possibility. I think people get most mixed up when they think that Jesus prayed to Himself and stuff like that. I believe the Father was who He prayed to, while not being the Father Himself, He is part of God, and so is God. ","1301621677"

Here's an example:

I just started my yearly re-read of Roger Zelazny's *Chronicles of Amber*.  They're pretty old books (my dad started reading them when he was my age, and subsequently introduced me to them when I was 13), but they haven't aged at all, really.  They're still superb works of art, and no matter how many times I read them, my enjoyment in them never dulls.

To sum it up, I think a truly ""classic"" SF book (or any book, for that matter) is one that you not only continue to enjoy throughout your life, but that you could recommend to the next generation so that they may have a similar experience.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","I explained how it works. The tax rate is 35% but corporations can write off a lot of ridiculous things like loss of projected profits. It would be like you having a 25% tax rate then being able to bring it to 0% with deductions and get a full refund because you made less than you thought you would, bought a new car, new house, new dog...ok two of those four things actually do have tax credits. 

The biggest culprit is being allowed to write off loss. Look at Range Resources Corps. they've been writing off ""losses"" they accrued in the mid-90's for the past decade and a half. If you got a pay cut at work wouldn't you like to be able to write it off? How about getting laid off and taking a year to find another job then be able to write that year off over the next 5?

Here's a real example from a business my dad started about a decade ago. He was allowed to write off something like $3,000 in fuel use. Basically he totaled up how much he spent in gas, saved the receipts and got a tax credit for all of it. The government paid for his gas. That along with every deductible he got meant he went the first 3 years without paying a dime in taxes. He finally had to after that because small businesses are almost as limited to what they can write off as people.","1301621701"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Apparently you missed the part in the above post that states exactly the opposite of what you claim here.

""Pumped storage is also only a partial answer at best : it relies on geographical features that are not easily to find.""

No, that's just plain wrong. What relies on geographical features that are hard to find in some areas is conventional hydroelectric that is dependent on gravitational flow of water that forms as snow atop high mountain peaks and flows by force of gravity to lower elevations. That's fairly rare in many locations but that is NOT what pumped hydro requires. 

The difference is pumped hydro has a . . . wait for it. . . a pump. 

See that tricky distinction there? Instead of a natural gravitational flow, pumped hydro uses a pump to place the water into position. That means you can use pumped hydro in places that are otherwise completely dry. The only thing you need is an altitude rise. The system doesn't even have to be visible on the surface, the water pipes and the reservoirs can be buried. 

The fact that people search so hard to find problems with a system that clearly works in virtually any location and is green and sustainable shows the real reason why we're struggling so hard to make the green transition --lack of political will. 

All this bullshit about how expensive green tech would be a hell of a lot more convincing if it didn't require discounting the immense costs of the status quo. Oil is cheap? Tar sands? You call that shit cheap? You think cleaning up nuclear fuck-ups is cheap? ","1301621716"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to do a hundred pushups, but take it from this old gym rat, I've spent my entire adult life in the gym, and a program like this one can do more harm than good.

If you only train one part of your body (and that's all a single exercise like pushups is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for injuries down the road. I've seen it a hundred times.

It's like putting a powerful engine in a stock Toyota Tercel. What will you accomplish? You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine.

Push-ups basically only train the chest muscles and to some extent, the triceps. What you really want to do is train your entire body, all the major muscle groups (chest, back, abdomen, legs, shoulders and arms) at the same time, over the course of a workout. And don't forget your cardiovascular work!

I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers! Falling in love with exercise, eating right, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make.

But do it right, okay?

My advice, find a good gym, with qualified trainers who will design your programs for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for physical fitness. Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is).

And don't worry about being embarrassed or not being in shape the first time you walk into the gym. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway.
Now get out there and do it! :-)","1301621717"

Also, all the people with the gas fields are on the other team.



So far I feel like the major analogies would be:

Minerals &lt;--&gt; Money
Gas &lt;---&gt; Oil and irl minerals, lumber

Workers/SCVs &lt;--&gt; Borrowed money *

Supply Depots &lt;--&gt; Homes

Marines &lt;--&gt;  Citizens


The housing crisis would be simply making too many SCVs, devoting too many resources to investing, making loans on loans, but there's not enough real money to go around, so you can't actually build anything useful.  You end up with too many Supply Depots, but no minerals to make units to fill them.

*ie, you spend money but it mines more than it cost to make, ROI


  Shit, this would be absolutely epic if someone could come up with a really thorough explanation.   However somehow I feel that would be worthy of a book (or even a paper for an Econ class ... god now I wish I was still in school).

  Maybe I'll write some more once I can be sure people will actually read it.
