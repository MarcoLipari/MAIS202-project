Every time I looked at it, all I saw was two people standing underneath a sheet. The taller man is looking down at the woman as they stand by one another. 

One day, in the car, I mentioned this to my father, when the most incredible natural phenomenon occurred. My father, with only the faintest flicker of a glance at my brothers, communicated with them on some ethereal plane, ordering them to stay quiet. 

""That's right,"" he told me. ""See, the founder was Jewish, and they're only allowed to make love once a year underneath a sheet. One year his wife told him if he wanted to make love to her that year, he'd have to have a successful restaurant chain first."" He then paused, and my eldest brother added, ""Well, you know how Jewish women are!""

I was in my mid-twenties before I realized my father had trolled me in a terribly racist way. About a year after that, I began to think of all the other times in my life I'd mentioned my theory, now expanded to include an angry Jewish wife, and how NOBODY have ever corrected me.

Pay attention to their skills and how they utilize them, if you go within a certain range, will they attack? If so, think about a way you can counterattack them and take the least amount of damage.

A good example is lanewick, the only way he can wittle you down to low health is to q you and run away.  You won't be able to harass this champion effectively so your best method is to freeze the lane under the turret.","1333238405"

Losing my income (even though it is minimal) and spending however much a year going to community college would be a pretty big hit financially. 

Even then, an Associate's degree isn't exactly worth a lot and I'd probably need to go to a 4-year university, so we'd have to move. If my fiance gets a job teaching at a university of his choice that'd be great, but if not, I'm not going to ask him to quit his job just so I can try and fix some of my past mistakes. It's not fair to him.

Even though I'd like to have a career, I need to look at the bigger picture. Life isn't perfect and I can't have everything I want. I'd have to give things up. 

In the long run, I doubt it'd be beneficial financially. A GED won't look good on a college application and even though I'm a hard worker, I'm kind of stupid and won't do well on the ACT/SAT/any tests I have to take despite studying, so it's unlikely I'd get into a decent college.","1333238406"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt; but I don't think I would enjoy doing those actions

That's the point, though. Many women are propositioned in public places, even ones not typically aimed at meeting partners. This is ok, but then if you say no, you get a tirade, yelling, even threats. Does this happen to men who don't return the advances of a woman on the street or in a shopping mall? when it does happen to those men, are the women in a legally secure situation? I think you'll find the kind of sexual entitlement men experience is far, far less public and possibly even less pervasive. 

The quote is a little over the top, but in the context from which it was taken--a character screaming about what a male character did *in her house*--it's fairly reasonable. Still, I think there's enough merit to it outside thats situation to provide some thought-provoking discussion on sexual entitlement and gender, and the appropriateness of courtship and propositioning based on locatoin.

And yeah, I was thinking that a lot of things could also be only happening in Abeds imagination. Look at last episodes ""continuity error"" of Jeff and Annie changing clothes, etc... 
 
 
My rudimentary theory, somehow pieced together from some other comments i made here: I actually thought the last shot in last episodes ending clip would first show the Vice Dean, but then in the last frames, may be reveal him as evil Abed, but even without this fact, maybe revealing the way Abed deals with his conflict with Troy, replacing his own behaviour that caused Troy to be mad at him with intrigues by the evil (as implied by his goatee) Vice Dean because he is more able to cope with something not being his fault.... We know this is somehow established canon for Troy and Abed and present in their minds, since Troy explained about the evil-Goatee concept in 'Advanced Gay' (""but evil Inspector had a moustache and was kinda rapey""), so what if the Vice Dean (maybe even being revealed as an Incarnation of Evil Abed, hence the moustache) driving a wedge between them actually poses as some sort of sublimination (right term? dunno) for Abeds ""evil side"" which he cannot accept: his 'insufficient social skills' and his behaviour that caused the fallout with Troy, which was actually the reason for their friendship breaking up. I don't think EVERYTHING that happens in the series happens in Abeds mind, but certain aspects might be altered in his point of view to diminish his fault... 
 
Do I make any sense? It's kinda late here in Germany...

yes, exactly, thank you, i have been searching a whole week for this sentence to know/describe how i feel, but i couldn't come up with it on my own, the other feeling i was sure off is what have experienced your self, being Free, not being judged has never been so amazing, i got judged by people due to several stuff in my life but i always knew how to deal with it, and never let it bother be, but having that done to me by her was killing me without me knowing it.

&gt;I drink milk out of the carton, I pee with the door open, I stay up until 2 am.

these things have never been so enjoyable for me even though they are not new, i felt really bad every time i did any of them, or watched a funny meaningless  video on youtube, are something alone, etc; every aspect of my life and habits were being watched and judged for no good reason.

I really don't understand why would a person judge another person that they ""love"" on such small things, they are just differences and people are different, why can't people just accept that ? maybe it's part of the controlling behavior, maybe not, but it's definitely not easy.

&gt;I haven't found a perfect potion to cure it. 

right now am not thinking about the perfect portion at all , all i want to have won from this is not to regain my confidence and spirit and to know how to avoid such a person that will treat me in such a way in the future, which i hope that you do for yourself as well.

So, I stuff it back under the air bladder and keep going.

When we're kids we generally become fans of teams for arbitrary reasons, or of the teams that are most visible on TV (aka the winning ones). When I was very young I adapted the Hornets (despite having a local team, though one that was never that good or on TV) as my team because I loved Muggsy Bogues because he was short. I stuck with the Hornets until the end of middle school (the Baron Davis/Jamal Mashburn years), when I realized I now actually had a local product worthy of supporting (2001, when Kidd was traded here).

Sounds a bit like bandwagoning as well, but I view it as getting over my childish fan ways. People that say ""well I've been a Cowboys fans since as a kid even though I live in Philadelphia"" don't get a pass from me. At some point you have to grow up in a way (again, speaking to people only in regions with teams) and realize that your reason for rooting for a team as a young kid no longer holds water as an adult.

"startrek","t5_2qixm","First Contact creates a causality loop and not a grandfather paradox. 

In Yesterdays Enterprise Tasha travels back in time aboard the Enterprise C. Doing so alters the timeline and allows her to also die on Vagra II before the Enterprise D ever encounters Enterprise C. For both Tasha's to exist two separate time lines had to have at least briefly existed in parallel with each other. Yesterdays Enterprise doesn't deal with the Grandfather Paradox: If Tasha died on Vagra II who went back in time with the Enterprise C? It actually doesn't have to because it proves my point. The timeline that Tasha comes from in Yesterdays Enterprise is vastly different from our own timeline. It is an alternate version of events; an alternate timeline; an alternate reality. The only thing that is tricky in Yesterdays Enterprise is Guinan's realization that things ""aren't right"", but this is tricky in either case and Data postulates that we can't know how Guinan's race perceives time because we know little about them. In fact Guinan could be sensing the two realities splitting.

You set forth two rules:

&gt;When you go back in time, you get to exist there, even if you wipe out all the future, and your own parents, etc. Because you already went back in time.
&gt;
&gt;Everything you change effects your own time line.

Let's look at this from a scientific perspective. You set forth these rules as the undeniable laws of physics of the Star Trek universe. This would make them laws of Star Trek physics. They are in fact not laws but theories, and good ones based on observable phenomena. For them to be laws we have to know without a doubt that they not only explain the way things have always worked in the past but that they also explain how things always will work. We don't know that things have *always* worked that way and we certainly can't prove that they always will.

I don't even refute your first theory. I only alter it slightly in order to explain why it works:

&gt;When you go back in time, you get to exist there, even if you wipe out all the future, and your own parents, etc.*, b*ecause you ~~already went back in time~~ *have created an alternate reality*.

When you say:

...because you already went back in time.

You are essentially saying ""just because"". You aren't attempting to suggest how it is possible that you can travel back in time when your point of origin no longer exists. I have built upon your theory to suggest an explanation.

As far as what shall now be known as ""onyeartrip's second theory of time travel"":

&gt;Everything you change [affects](http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/affect-versus-effect.aspx) your own time line.

I don't see any proof that this is ever the case much less *always* the case.

My argument is that your rules are arbitrary and your own, albeit based on some observable phenomena. I have taken it a step further to suggest a reason for your first theory and to refute entirely your second as based on no observable phenomena and only mere conjecture.

You also seem to think that saying those who control this universe have agreed with my theories is invalid. I argue that it is not. They have went out of their way in both the structuring of the plot of the new Star Trek and their explanations afterward to not only imply but to state emphatically that the Prime Universe still exists. What reason do we have to doubt them? The only argument that you put forth is that time travel in Star Trek ***always*** works a in a certain and inexplicable way. You have disregarded other more logical explanations because of your personal beliefs. Others (myself, Orci, Abrams, and Memory Alpha to name a few) have painstakingly went out of their way to explain why these beliefs are inapplicable. You refuse these explanations because of the way you *want* the Universe to work. I have attempted to explain an alternative to the way you adamantly insist that everything must work with my best understanding of science and logic. As you have said you are free to see the Universe in any way that you deem fit until ""canon proof"" exists to the contrary, and even then you can * personally* believe whatever you wish. I grow weary of the discussion and this has been my closing argument. If you chose to respond you will have the last word and I will read and consider it but will no longer respond in kind as I feel I have expended enough time on the subject. I feel as though we have come to an impasse, but I thank you for the discussion.

**EDIT:** Upon further thought I might alter onyeartrip's second law thusly:

From your perspective you usually seem to alter your own timeline.

Chevy is and has always been a dick.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Lol, is this the onion? 

I'm probably going to get down voted for this, but let me go ahead and explain why I think this statement might not be so bad. 

I played mens volleyball in highschool on a couple of travel teams. It was in NYC, and the population of kids interested in seriously playing volleyball was small- so pretty much everyone knew each other. There were two guys we always knew were gay- we'll call them 'G' and 'C'. We were all fairly cool with them being gay (changing/sharing hotel beds with these guys made some guys uncomfortable, but nothing more than that). However- most guys seemed to be FAR more comfortable dealing with 'G' than 'C' - and this was really just due to the way that 'C' represented himself. He seemed to try to go far out of his way to make statements like ""hey guys, I'm gay, look at me, I'm GAY!"" (e.g., have you guys ever seen the shorts female volleyball players wear? they're [bootie shorts](http://www.fivb.org/Photos/VB/Gallery/GU18_03/day01/Screen/01.CZEvsUSA.05.JPG). 'C' would wear them sometimes, and it was a little odd). 
He was especially flamboyant- and perhaps that was just his personality. However, 'G' didn't really mess with that stuff, he was just like the rest of us-with the exception that he liked guys. 
He was great to be around, and we were all cool with him being gay. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you think ""being gay"" equates to ""lets act as feminine as physically possible"", you're going to make people uncomfortable. Should they be uncomfortable in the first place? Maybe not, but that's not my point. 

**tl;dr: I'm from NYC- gay people are all over the place. We [the volleyball players] were totally used to seeing/dealing with /being friends with gay people. It's just that one of our gay friends seemed to try especially hard to show us that he was completely different, and that rubbed people the wrong way.**


//edit: I think I did a really poor job trying to explain what I was saying, so let me have another go. I'm not trying to say people should intentional stifle their personalities or whatever, that's not my point- what I'm trying to say is that of course, if you go out of your way to try to show people how different you are, you're going to bump shoulders. 

I'm a Christian, and I know how dumbfoundingly irritating pointlessly outspoken bible-thumping Christians can be. Should a Christian run up to people they don't know to yell things like ""YOU'RE GOING TO HELL""? I think that would make most people uncomfortable, despite the fact that  the person doing the yelling might actually believe that, and his/her personality might allow such a thing. 

Similarly, when a gay guy wears girls volleyball shorts -just for example- it makes a few heterosexual guys uncomfortable. I feel that this view would be fairly reasonable among straight guys.

Fifteen minutes of an 'aha' moment do not justify headaches every week for a year. The players could be trying to forget a bad test, or relationship issues, or dozens of other problems by having a fun night. Instead, they get stuck with Mr. Annoying.

Just because someone has a reason for being annoying does not make it a valid or justified reason. This was not some friends avoiding another friend while they set up a surprise party.

"windows","t5_2qh3k","No, I didn't say ""Go f*ck yourself with a book"". However, I am saying, that you should maybe start digging into how modern operating systems and file systems work before you make such weird statements.

When you have drivers lots of drivers on your hard disk which are never loaded, based on what logic should that slow down your machine? And a virus scanner doesn't need to touch these files as well, since they haven't been modified since the last scan and they can modified by a superuser anyway.

Unless you're working with Administrator privileges all the time, there is no point scanning system files for viruses since they cannot be modified with your user rights. Any process that you start - on purpose or through a malware - always inherits your user privileges and can hence only harm your files.

Furthermore, I don't see why games and internet browsers slow down because there are many files on your hard disk. The operating system kernel is smart enough to keep currently used files in the [disk cache](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_cache) (in RAM - the Linux kernel actually does this much better, it uses all free memory for disk caching - not using any free memory is just a waste) and thus all accesses to these files are fast. An additional technique is [prefetching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefetcher) where the kernel makes predictions on which files are likely to be accessed in subsequent operations and already loads them into memory.

As for the file system. Modern file systems have also many techniques to store large amount of data. While large files can be allocated in so-called [extents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extents), small files are packed together into the same logical sectors or even directly stored in the [MTF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_File_Table#Internals).

As for the advantages of Windows 7 over XP, I already left a statement in [another comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/rfl1b/windows_xp_is_the_killer_liteweight_os/). There is also an [extensive article on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_new_to_Windows_7).","1333238459"

Im 6'4 and i think standing over people kind of keeps them from getting snippy. The one that sticks out in my mind is this (its more amusing than anything).
I worked in a town in Louisiana that has several huge ass casinos (like Vegas style) that makes people drive over from Texas for the weekend. One Sunday I got these two middle aged redneck lesbians come in and they were adamantly trying to find out if we took debit cards. I assured them we did but they said ""we asked the hostess too, we gotta make sure."" I told again it was fine. So they order, get their food and and eat. When I get the check they hand me their debit card. When I swipe it....boom, declined. Swiped it again...declined. So I bring it out to them and I'm sure you've already guessed ""Do you ladies maybe have a different card becau..."" 
""We asked you if you took debit cards! It didn't work because you don't take them! "" 

""No ma'am. (I take out MY debit card) I've have paid for food with this on numerous occasions.""

"" we want a manager!""

So the manager (who's a friend of mine) goes over and comes back with a credit card. When he swipes it....boom, declined. He exclaims: ""That's the problem they don't have any fucking money!""

After much talking they finally use a check that, somehow, cleared. Clearly they knew they didn't have any fucking money and were trying to get over on us.","1333238461"

"woodworking","t5_2qlqp","I like Porter Cable/Delta, Bosch and Milwaukee.  However, not everything has to be the same brand.

Take a look at used tools.  There are always plenty on Craigslist.  Do your homework (Google is your friend) on each model and buy accordingly.

All of the better tools can be reconditioned.  New brushes, switches, power cords, bearings, etc. can usually be replaced easily by yourself.  The savings is totally worth it.

Also know that even good brands make cheapened versions for the Big Box stores.  I buy from Westwood Power Tools in LA.  They stock the contractor-grade versions.  They cost a little more, but rarely need service.  We use our tools a *lot.*  We have apartments we work on ourselves.  They get torn down to the studs and rebuilt; we've done this for 12 years now.  I'm starting a small manufacturing business, too, so I've recently picked up a few more.

Don't buy cheap tools.  They break.  Buying one cheapie and replacing it with another cheapie costs *more* than just buying one good tool in the first place.","1333238463"

A motorcycle is different than a car considering you only have two points of contact with the surface of the road and if either fails your ability to control the vehicle will be much more difficult than a 4 wheeled vehicle.  Never ride on a plugged/patched tire unless it's to the nearest gas station or in an emergency situation.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Huh. That's odd. I was raised in an abusive environment. I have been in two car accidents that should have claimed my life. I have had severe heart palpitations and tachycardia at the ripe age of 22. I struggled to the point of near-suicide over repressing my sexuality. I have struggled with depression, eating disorders, anxiety... I have watched my mother get her ass kicked by chemotherapy. I have been so poor that I've skipped eating for days. I have literally been at the point that if it hadn't been for the charity of others, I would not have survived.

Not discounting that she's been through some horrible shit, but it's a very self-centered view to feel that because she couldn't do it without relying on God, no one else can go through it without relying on God.

Edited to add: Part of the reason I no longer believe in God is that after years and years of pleading with him to help me change who I am, and solemnly swearing my life in service to him in return for him showing me how to not be gay, how to pull myself out of my depression, I finally realized that he wasn't going to answer me. Interestingly enough, literally as soon as I realized that, and decided that since his prescribed doctrine wasn't working for me, maybe I should try something else, life immediately got better. I got out of the rut I was in and started living my life. No regrets.","1333238486"

If they wanted to tell the truth, then they would replace the movie shown at temple square with that episode of South Park. What would happen if they started with that? After that showing, simply have the audience vote on what they would like to see next. I don't think it's a fair contest, but count the votes anyway. Ask the audience whether they'd like to see *[Legacy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulLvUw-c96o)* or [the musical](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5lCYqn2jcs)?

At least Parker and Stone did their homework, on both the South Park episode and the musical.

More seriously...It would be more *amazing* if Smith's purported translation actually matched up with some real world facts. *Name one!* If TSCC could find even one match, it would be shouted from the rooftops. Then it would be worth wondering how he had accurately predicted future archeologic discoveries. *Wow, how did he do that?* But because there are absolutely no matches, the *translation method* isn't relevant. On the other hand, the technique used in creating this elaborate *card trick*, this *long con*, this magnum opus of the *Smith family grift*- that is very interesting. At first, it may appear *the hand is quicker than the eye.* Maybe, the action should be slowed down. Statistical analytics of writing styles give the freeze frame camera tool we need. Rigdon's long life (compared to Smith), his changing theology, and his continuation of delivering sermons and blessings long passed Smith's demise, give the sample that is needed. Why are his  ideas and his writing style found so pervasively throughout the text?

He's said he'd do ""anything for the children"" and would likely be more obliged to join in if they told him that they'd donate a significant amount to a charity if he came on.

Tennant's definitely coming back. He loves the role and only left it because he respects it so much. He's pretty much free (other than being a dad, really) so I'm completely positive he'll be returning.

I don't really see any of the older Doctors coming back portraying themselves, but I'd love to see them take part in some form.

I think bringing back Rose is precisely what they'll do. We can complain all we like but Rose was an important companion and this is the 50th Anniversary. It's the culmination and celebration of the entire series. Everyone who's played a major part so far will want to be included for this historic event.

There are several ways to bring back Rose properly. She's matured and changed quite a bit. Apparently working in AltTorchwood, she's become a bit of a badass. If they don't make a big spectacle out of it (and they've shown that the Eleventh Doctor's pretty much over her) they can bring her and 10.5 back no problem.

We got the most expensive lights possible even though the ones we had were only like 5 years old and worked perfectly fine. In the mean time, our computers were over 10 years old and our economics and history classes used 30+ year old books. All other books where held together with tape and all of them required ""book covers"" because without them they fell apart. Kids would regularly try to find the books their parents (or in a few cases grandparents) used in school.

"books","t5_2qh4i","&gt; i came across the name just recently in a movie review and checked your comment history on a hunch. is he some kind of cineastic luminary or what?

I'll try to make this brief ;)

For me, he is a great interpreter. Joseph Campbell made it his life's work to analyze the world's religions with academic analysis favoring the interpretation of human psychology.

Highlights:

 * All religions are factually incorrect, but have central themes that come from the human stages of development and resulting subconscious.

 * Non-paranoid schizophrenia, deep artists, LSD and religions come from the same human biology and subconscious.

 * Without a supernatural god, there is only the conclusions that humans invented: Love, Compassion, Marriage, etc. All Mythology comes from men, and they have some very powerful things to say.

 * Human languages such as English, Spanish, etc are fragments of how the human consciousness actually processes things.  Based on what comes out in art, religion, extreme stress or extreme happiness, it's clear that languages are slow and limiting in our ability to convey to each other the *human experience*, and our related connections to each other. I quote: ""The person who has had a mystical experience knows that all the symbolic expressions of it are faulty. The symbols don't render the experience, they suggest it.""

 * he has many observations on the history of religions and how slow they are to change, and the breakdown of what roles they serve - and what parts are worth keeping and what parts cause suffering and conflict.  He makes the point that artists are like clergy in representing the religion, but do it with a far greater freedom and with different immediate objectives.

 * He lived and worked in New York City, also in Hawaii, and he has some wonderful things to say about the ideals of the USA, the Western Individual, philosophy of science replacing religion, etc.

He was educated at Columbia University, the University of Paris, and the University of Munich in Bavaria. He spent his entire adult life as a university professor and teacher on these subject.  He extensively cites his references and is a master of many subjects, including Sigmund Freud, Carl G Jung, Fredeerich Nietzsche, James Joyce, etc. He learned many languages and even translated works directly.

if you didn't already know... Campbell's 1949 book on religion and psychology was the inspiration for the 1977 Star Wars film. He became close personal friends with George Lucas and continued to write about psychology and religion until his death 10 years later. Many other works have resulted.","1333238511"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","And in any of those ranked games as Yi, did you build tanky? Or did you build standard Yi with damage items?

And as for superior kit, Yi has steroids whereas shy has none. Her damage is limited to her base damages on abilities. Higher base damage but lower scaling doesn't mean strictly superior.

What Yi does that Shyvana definitely doesn't is force CC. Shy can be kited after her ult, Yi is much much harder to kite because of slow immunity. He forces you to use as much hard CC on him as possible, and if your opponents are lacking in that, he can use meditate to tank a TON of damage given the opportunity.

As an example, here's a scenario that makes Yi strictly better than Shyvana.

You have Nunu support, and Kat mid. Not only does Yi scale by far better with Nunu's bloodboil, but your opponents now have to choose whether to CC Yi, Kat, or Nunu's ulti.

If you had Shy top instead, all they need to do is use the hard CC's on nunu and kat, and they can still slow and kite Shyvana to at least some extent.","1333238526"

Yes, shipping is a possibility, as is a moving company, rail freight, shipping container or a ReloCube. All of them are more expensive. 10 boxes and a car simply does not get you an economy of scale.

1,000 miles = ~50 gallons of gas + 1/3 oil change + minor wear and tear for a typical car. That's roughly $200. Additional gas due to weight from the boxes would be, at most, an extra 10%.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","^It's not just limited to 1 and 0, it can be neither 1 or 0, it can be anything in between 1 and 0. This is called a super-position. Because we don't know what state that atom is at, its at all states and no states at the same time. When we collapse the reality, it will still only be a 0 or 1, because the state of the atom is determined by the electrons of that atom. I am uncertain as to whether a collapsed reality can be 01, or -- in the quantum computing world, but a collapsed reality cannot be anything in between 0 and 1.

But should we be able to have a collapsed bit reading of 01 or --, thats two new states for our computers to work with, doubling the amount of information kept in one bit (aka 0, 1, 01 or -- instead of 0 or 1)

Binary code plays out like this

0000 - 0001 - 0010 - 0011 - 0100 - 0101 - 0110 - 0111 - 1000 - 1001 - 1010 - 1011 - 1100 - 1101 - 1110 - 1111

It's a base-two number system. With four states, we can move to a base-four number system for our computers (or quadinary?) Of

0000 - 0001 - 0002 - 0003 - 0010 - 0011 - 0012 - 0013 - 0020 - 0021 - 0022 - 0023 - 0030 - 0031 - 0032 - 0033 - 0100 - 0101 - 0102 - 0103 - 0110 - 0111 - 0112 - 0113 - 0120 - 0121 - 0122 - 0123 -0130 - 0131 - 0132 - 0133 - 0200 - 0201 - 0202 - 0203 - 0210 - 0211 - 0212 - 0213 - 0220 - 0221 - 0222 - 0223 - 0230 - 0231 - 0232 - 0233 - 0300 - 0301 - 0302 - 0303 - 0310 - 0311 - 0312 - 0313 - 0320 - 0321 - 0322 - 0323 - 1000 (etc. etc. etc.)

"Freethought","t5_2qhzx","I've never seen anyone who *demand* that theists should follow the scripture to the letter. It is however a frequently used counter-argument to claims like ""What the book says is true"" or ""The book is true because it was written by god"" or ""I get my moral guidance from $holy_book"". It is a fallacy to claim such a thing and still do cherry-picking. Most believers cherry-pick, *exactly because* the bible, qur'an, torah, etc poorly reflects the modern times we live in. As the collective knowledge of humanity grows, any holy text shrinks and gets smaller. Furthermore, by following a doctrine which cherry-picks from the holy text, one kind of admits that the new interpretation is even more obviously made up than the original religion was. If not, then what difference does it make to claim that a god made the scripture, if you can interpret and cherry-pick as you like? And if you don't believe that a god made the scripture and still look to it for moral guidance, then why not rather use a better source for moral guidance than a 2000 year old book? Incredible literature on metaphysics, philosophy, and morality have been written by great philosophers, who actually form a framework for debate.

And of course no one wants any theist to follow holy scripture word-by-word. That is fundamentalism in a nutshell, and we know what that usually leads to. Atheists can't be hypocritical in the same way, because there is no scripture for atheism, and it's not common for atheists to make baseless claims about moral superiority or divine creators of books or any other man-made work.","1333238554"

"travel","t5_2qh41","I know what you are talking about. And it hit me after about 5 months of being in new places every 2 or 3 weeks. It's a feeling of novelty wearing off.

For me, I believe it happened because I felt like I wasn't achieving anything, or building anything of my own. For 5 or so months I was simply reveling in the fact that I was building this adventure for myself and it was magnificent. By the 5th month, my adventure had ""built"" itself. It's not that I wasn't adding new and exciting pieces to it here and there, it's just that the premise of my adventure ""project"" was complete. And now I was just kind of going... I believe that this is also a plateau that some of the most financially successful people on the planet reach... That feeling of, ""Ok.... what now?"" You get it when you've been stuck in a cubicle for two years and are successful at your job and you get it when you're stepping outside of your tent in the morning to another magnificent foreign sunrise for the umpteenth time. I think it's just natural, and it happens to everyone in every situation. It's human nature to want more.


One of the things that helped me was to latch onto a personal project while traveling. Or get a manual labor job for a few weeks or month. Build something with your hands. Write a book. Take up photography. If all else fails, why not go back home for a little while? Go back for a few months and then reassess your priorities. 

I think some people think that because you're out and traveling and ""living the dream,"" you're never allowed to feel burnt out. But paradise gets old after a while. Doing anything for a long time gets repetitive. Change it up. Build or write something. Go home for a while and then see if you're up for continuing on the road. There's no shame in going home.","1333238558"

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","I respectfully disagree - a lot has changed. An Inconvenient Truth was released in 2006, and that really brought climate change away from the fringe to the mainstream. The Emissions Trading Scheme was legislated in 2008 - although the National Government has kneecapped it since. 

My interpretation is that he (or the National Government at large) is trying to balance public interest with big business interests and party donors, and that legislative actions have reflected that balance rather than any personal views. The National Party certainly has a lot of voters who do not think that climate change is real or pressing, and he would alienate them by making public statements supporting the science on the matter - but he would also face a lot of bad press by making public statements rejecting it. 

John Key isn't a stupid man, and I don't think he is stupid enough to completely reject climate change, but he is a populist who tries to publicly reflect the view of his constituency. I'm sure he hears from people who care to enter into conversation with him 'I am concerned about the ETS' a lot more often than 'I am concerned about climate change'. His actions reflect that.","1333238572"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You asked if someone would try dog meat out of politeness.  

Certainly you asked this question to this audience because of the Western cultural taboo against eating dogs.  That taboo exists because Westerners domesticate dogs and form companion-bond relationships with them.  So you clearly understand this, or you wouldn't have asked the question.

You later imply there is something that you do not, in fact, understand about this taboo, because you challenge someone's response that they love dogs by comparing a dog to a cow.

You state ""I [love them] too.  But it's still gonna be dead.""  Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like you meant this to imply that your love for dogs in general would not be an issue because not eating the dog wouldn't save it's life.  It's still gonna be dead, so (and here's where I'm jumping to a conclusion, so do correct me if this isn't what you meant) there should be no harm in eating it.

To point you back to the cultural taboo, I used an analogy.  Some people feel that it would be as culturally taboo to eat a dog as it would be to eat a human. I did this by using a parallel question and assertion construction as you did.  ""Why not [eat humans]?  Sure I love them, but if it's dead already, what's the problem?""

You then assert that a dog and a human are completely different.  My response points out (albeit absurdly) that the difference is in the eye of the beholder.

That's my point.

Just make sure you also know the general questions like strengths, weaknesses, why you want to work there, what sets you apart from other candidates.   In almost all of my interviews I have had questions like that.  If you're cataloging you probably won't be working with the public too much, but if this is also service oriented you may get questions like your customer service skills/experience, how you handle a difficult customer.  Oh, and they will probably ask you how you work in a group setting and how you deal with conflict in the workplace.  I didn't focus my schooling on cataloging so I don't know the more detailed questions but those general ones are usually good bets for any job.

Finally, probably the first thing they will ask is to tell you a little about yourself.  Make sure you had a 60-90 second blurb you can say about yourself and make sure it is great.  Good luck!","1333238592"

"islam","t5_2qhbp","this is a vast topic with some difficulties, here are some pointers:

1) there is no doubt that Allaah [](/swt) is All-Knowing (Al-'Aleem) and that His knowledge includes the past, present and future.

- (..) Allaah surrounds all things in (His) Knowledge [65:12]

2) it is a pillar of imaan to believe in al-qadr (destiny/fate), what is meant to hit you, will not miss you, and what is meant to miss you, will not hit you

- (They are) the ones who said about their killed brethren while they themselves sat (at home): ""If only they had listened to us, they would not have been killed.'' Say: ""Avert death from your own selves, if you speak the truth."" [3:168]

3) there is no doubt that humans have free will, Allaah [](/swt) informed us, that the angels do not have free will, and therefore we can become better beings than them, but that we can also become worse in rank than the animals, if we only follow our desires and primal instincts, even though we don't have to

- Verily, those who believe [in the Oneness of Allâh, and in His Messenger Muhammad (Peace be upon him)) including all obligations ordered by Islâm] and do righteous good deeds, they are the best of creatures. [98:7]

4) Allaah [](/swt) knows what you are going to do, but this does not change your responsibility and free will, even though He already knows what you are going to do 

5) Allaah [](/swt) does not admit people to paradise or hell simply because He knows that they deserve that, rather He will judge them based on their deeds and intentions

6) the ones who are going to be sent to hell, they will have no excuse, Allaah [](/swt) will show them their deeds, and they cannot deny them, therefore His punishment is just 

7) scholars have differentiated between the universal and the legal will of Allaah [](/swt) and here we have to be careful, and know our limits, because Allaah [](/swt) knows us, but our knowledge of Him is limited to what He taught us.

- Is not Allah the best of Judges? [95:9]

- Allah wants to forgive you. [4:27] 

- Narrated 'Ali: While we were in a funeral procession in Baqi Al-Gharqad, Allah's Apostle came and sat down, and we sat around him. He had a small stick in his hand and he bent his head and started scraping the ground with it. He then said, ""There is none among you, and no created soul but has his place written for him either in Paradise or in the Hell-Fire, and also has his happy or miserable fate (in the Hereafter) written for him."" A man said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Shall we depend upon what is written for us and give up doing (good) deeds? For whoever among us is destined to be fortunate (in the Hereafter), will join the fortunate peoples and whoever among us is destined to be miserable will do such deeds as are characteristic of the people who are destined to misery."" The Prophet said, ""Those who are destined to be happy (in the Hereafter) will find it easy and pleasant to do the deeds characteristic of those destined to happiness, while those who are to be among the miserable (in the Hereafter), will find it easy to do the deeds characteristic of those destined to misery."" Then he recited: 'As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and believes in the Best reward from Allah, We will make smooth for him the path of ease. But he who is a greedy miser and thinks himself self sufficient, and gives the lie to the Best reward from Allah we will make smooth for him the path for evil.' (92.5-10) [sahih al-bukhari, 6.60.473]

be also aware that some people went astray, after using philosophy to understand destiny in its totality, but this is not possible, the human mind is limited, and therefore this is a vain endavour, so we should stick to what we know, and not speculate too much.

this is simply false.  Banning slavery and segregation was only possible because of states rights.  It was states like Mass. and Pennsylvania demonstrating that an institution as venerable as slavery could be abolishing successfully that gave weight to the abolitionist arguments.  Had there been a national vote any time before the civil war, slavery would have been legal everywhere.

You are seeing the same thing today.  It is individual states legalizing things like gay marriage.   A national vote would be overwhelmingly against it.  But legalizing it somewhere will make it easier to legalize elsewhere.","1333238604"

""kh"" is a digraph that is commonly but not universally recognized as the ""Hebrew or German guttural sound"" (which is the worst description ever, but you know what it is). ""ch"" even in English represents three or four sounds, ""church"" ""cholera"" ""champagne"" ""cheek""... . And the common Armenian ending ""-ian"" could be correctly analyzed as either ""ian"" or ""yan"" depending on your phonological analysis. 

There's no real solution because in transliteration it's difficult to know what your audience wants. Linguists will want a consistent system that is perfectly isomorphic between the source and target language's letters. The media will want a transliteration that yields an approximately correct pronunciation on first glance.

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","I can tell you what coping strategies I used for many years, but only to warn you that I really, really wouldn't recommend them. I smoked lots and lots of weed from morning until night, and got a fair amount of casual, dangerous sex from very unsavoury places. Neither of these things made me happy, and although I just barely managed to hold down a job, or hop from one job to the other, they certainly landed me in a very messed up place, financially and emotionally. The only coping strategy that has really worked is deciding that I absolutely had to transition, no matter what the risks or costs, and that I couldn't let anything stand in the way of that. That decision gave me the determination to quit dope, alcohol and whatever psychedelics I'd been messing with on a regular basis (I'm not knocking drugs or booze when used in reasonable amounts, it's just that I'm not a person who is capable of using them in reasonable amounts). The same people who helped me stay clean also helped and encouraged me to accept myself and stand up for the life I had to lead.

Finance is not **that** important for getting to the stage you are trying to get to. Yes, I am very fortunate to live in a country with ~~free healthcare~~ universal healthcare funded by a state-sanctioned compulsory insurance scheme. But it's not low-cost HRT that enabled me to work productively and hold down a job, because I didn't get that until I'd been working under my new identity for over 18 months. What made the difference for me was some very well-chosen and affordable clothes from charity shops (thrift stores), the cheapest make up that looked half decent and covered up my beard stubble, and quite simply declaring myself to be a woman, and applying for jobs on that basis, knowing that I had marketable skills. You may not be lucky enough to live somewhere that is as liberal and tolerant, and you may not currently have any skills which are of value or in demand in your local market, but these are both things that are *within your power* to change. Keep believing in yourself, seek out other people who believe in you, and I promise you it can get better.","1333238615"

Secondly, wireless power is a vague term. 

If you pick up an electric toothbrush you will notice no electrical connection between the base and the toothbrush - the base of the brush and the stand each contain a coil, the rod which holds the brush in place is an iron core which makes this into a conventional transformer using near field induction.

what you're after is remote induction - transfer at a distance

"nosleep","t5_2rm4d","First off, Happy cake day!

The truth is that I am, or at least was, a pretty active urban explorer.  I did it off-and-on throughout high-school, mostly at the Knight Hospital.  When I joined the Army, a couple guys in my troop thought it sounded pretty cool and we made a club out of it.  We were called *The League of Extraordinary Ordinaries*, and we made several trips around the Upstate NY area.  As you're always moving around in the Army, the group eventually lost all its members and disbanded, and by the time my contract ended last year, I was the only one left.  Since going without the group didn't feel the same, I haven't done it since.  However, since the publication of this story, some of my friends here at home have expressed an interest, so maybe I'll start up again.

The Knight Hospital really is just down the road from my house, and growing up, I have heard a ton of stories about it.  Everything in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/qwt6i/never_ever_go_into_the_morgue_part_ii/c412u87) is absolutely true; in fact, my Grandmother once worked there.  While the phrase ""*Never, Ever, Go into the Morgue""* was made up for the story, the things kids really said about that place were just as creepy.

During my explorations, I have had some strange things happen there that I've been unable to explain, but as a skeptic, I'm hesitant to call it 'haunted'.  And while there IS a morgue, most stories about the hospital actually claim that the kitchen is the most haunted area, for some reason.

My friends think that I may have included The Hanged Man into the story subconsciously due to the fact that I did once stumble upon a hanging suicide, but I maintain that it was purely unintentional.","1333238628"

If this was a yin yoga class it sounds like a pretty lame one. I firmly believe yin yoga is essential to a well-rounded practice to balance out the yang in our more ""aerobic"" and power yoga classes. But the class you did sounds boring.

Yin is supposed to teach you the art of letting go by testing your limits. It teaches you the art of non resistance by bringing you in intense poses for a prolonged amount of time. Especially for a first timer, it's usually very very challenging.

Different things, sure. I'm open to hearing how your position on their moral weight is more than simply a point of view.

I think that we can make a distinction here based on reason, rather than opinion. My utilitarian reasoning would be that murdering an adult usually causes more suffering (pain inflicted in the killing process, suffering by family members upon the death, etc.) than taking the morning-after pill which prevents fertilization, killing the sperm and egg which, would happen anyway if sex had not occurred and which happens often otherwise (menstruation or male masturbation).","1333238672"

I don't know if you played Dark Souls, but one of the criticisms that the game receives is being difficult to the point where it makes progression through the game really slow. I guess this is a turnoff to people who want to be able to play a game for a few hours and make some progress, in Dark Souls a few hours might be spent attempting the same part of the same level.

BUT, to people who loved it, this is precisely what made getting somewhere in the game so exciting. I have to admit, reaching one specific checkpoint in the game made me feel awesome. The levels that you progress through are so hostile and spooky that reaching a bonfire (checkpoint) where you can just catch a breather and reassess your strategy without the threat of being disemboweled feels amazing. It creates a strange kind of immersion; the bonfire that you sit at really IS a safe haven where you can feel relaxed.","1333238678"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I worked at Applecare (Apple technical support) for a year. One elderly gentleman calls in, he gives me the serial number for his computer, and cheerfully ask him what he's calling about. He immediately asks me to transfer him to a *man"" (I'm a girl). A little shocked by his abruptness, I comply.

Any time someone asks to be transferred, we give them to Tier2 support, and they handle the ""difficult"" calls. I put the guy on hold, connect to Tier2, and find that there's a 10 minute wait for Tier2. I get back on the line with the customer and advise him of the wait, and ask if there is anything I can do for him during our 10 minute wait together, and he laughs and says, ""no, you're female, you don't understand anything technical."" I flush bright red and do my best to hold back my anger at his obvious sexism. 

I calmly advised him that he has called technical support, that I am a trained, qualified and certified Apple technician, and that I am happy to help him with whatever issue he is having. He is adamant and he refuses to tell me why he's calling and in an angry voice demands to talk to a ""male technician."" I write in the ticket exactly what the customer said.

We wait our 10 minutes and we finally get connected to Tier2. I advise the Tier2 guy what's up, give him the ticket# and before I get the customer on the line, I ask if it's ok if I eavesdrop on the call for training purposes, and he said sure.

I introduce the customer to the Tier2 guy, say goodbye, and mute the call so they can't hear me. The Tier2 guy was *awesome.* 

The customer wanted to change the password for his computer's login, and didn't know how to do it. The customer thought it would be really complicated and difficult to do, since *he* wasn't able to figure it out on his own. 

The Tier2 guy told him that it was so simple and easy that even his 85 year old grandmother could do it on her own without instruction, and he told him he was emailing him [the kbase article](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1274) on how to do it and then asked if there was anything else he could do for him. The customer flipped out. After the customer was done yelling profanity at him, the Tier2 guy calmly asked again if there was anything else he could assist him with, and the customer hung up.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I think this is a common misconception about what the great apostasy was, and what caused it. 

The great apostasy wasn't a result of all the priesthood holders dying, it was a result of the people actively rejecting the gospel as a whole, and its priesthood holders.  So while there may have been priesthood holders on the earth, they were not authorized to give the priesthood, or its ordinances, to anybody because the people as a whole had rejected it.  The three Nephites were removed from the people, as was John the apostle.  

They key point is that there was no organized church, and no way to receive the ordinances of salvation (Baptism etc). Not because nobody had it, or wanted to give it to them, but because nobody wanted to receive it, and because the people had no faith.

(Mormon 1:13-14):

""But wickedness did prevail upon the face of the whole land, insomuch that the Lord did take away his beloved disciples *(thee Nephites)*, and the work of miracles and of healing did cease because of the iniquity of the people.

And there were no gifts from the Lord, and the Holy Ghost did not come upon any, because of their wickedness and unbelief.""","1333238695"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've worked in retail since age 14. It's a hit or miss when it comes to customers. Sometimes I meet some really nice people other times I really hate them for how I get treated. It's hard to recall specific examples because I kind of try to block it out. However I can remember one time working the McDonald's drive through at age 14. I filled this huge order and tried to fit it into one bag. I have it out the window about to be in their car when the bottom gives out. Everything falls to the ground. That's when i hear the car behind them laugh loudly. I tell the car to park and try to fill the order as fast as possible again. When the next car comes out they make sure to salt my wounds by saying, ""hey you hear us laughing at you? Way to drop it."" I debated whether or not to spit on their food and drinks, but decided not to. I worked really fucking hard at that job.

Another time, I was working with my boss in the dairy freezer. He comes walking in the back muttering to himself and looking for a specific kind of  cottage cheese. ""Pink with pineapple, pink with pineapple!"" He can't find it and exclaims to himself, ""well I guess I'm a retard!"". The guy outside was looking for it and loudly says ""I can't believe these retards don't have this."" You don't realize how many times you can get criminalized for not having something in stock. No lady, I'm not the manager nor do I control the inventory, I just put what's here on the shelf. I'm more than happy to double check but don't shit on me when I can't find it.

The modern tie was developed in 1926, the waistcoats vanished in the 1940s, and by the time you get to 1960 or so, what they wore was virtually indistinguishable from what we wear now ([Rock Hudson in 1962](http://www.corbisimages.com/images/Corbis-U1353898A.jpg?size=67&amp;uid=036093b7-3f1f-4e12-8efe-a930fbcf7b00)).

You wish to use a particularly narrow definition of atheism because it suits your ideological objectives. That's fine. I, most everyone I interact with on the topic, and the vast majority of self-identified atheists on reddit appear to prefer to use the broader definition and add precision with the inclusion of modifiers. By your narrow definition that disbelief requires action and agency on the part of the atheist, your perspective could be correct to you. By our wider definition, you are quite wrong.

I have no further interest in pointing out the communication difficulties that arise from your narrow use of the term and the resulting pidgeonholes they create in your perception, or in the advantages of starting from a wide term and the flexibility it affords to allow me to comfortably conceptualize the wide range of atheist variants there are in the *real* world.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","No, it doesn't bother most women (I say women because the majority of females I interact with are over the age of 18). 

However, it's the same reason that most men and women don't pay attention words like congressman and chairman and mail man. They're so utterly engrained in our culture that we really don't notice them. There are reasons why things like ""congressman"" has been changed to ""congressperson"" and ""mailman"" is now ""postal worker."" Some people are like ""being PC is so lame,"" but language is really an important part of our culture. It highlights what our values are, but it also shapes our expectations.

It does, however, bother me. If I was to walk into a mixed-sex room (evenly or close to evenly) and be like ""Hello, gals,"" everybody in the room would feel uncomfortable: men would feel uncomfortable that they were being overlooked, women would be uncomfortable because they noticed that the men were being overlooked. But nobody thinks twice about clumping women in with ""guys.""

It relates to the notion of the male as the standard/norm, sort of like how white and heterosexual and Christian are norms in our culture to which everything else is compared. For a loooong time in science and psychology, participants were all male. In textbooks, most examples (math examples, English sentences, etc) were with reference to men. I can go on and on.

I don't think it's anything that's super offensive, because I recognize there's no hostility in its being said and its just a part of the culture we live in. But I am very aware of it.

And sorry if this is tl;dr. I'm a student of psychology with a very strong interest in gender and gender roles (I've conducted several studies as an ungrad, I'm presented at a psychology conference, plan on presenting at two more, etc).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It is a product of Zionists. Have you ever wondered why so many Jews push policies of affirmative action and integration on white people while they maintain the Jewish nationalist state of Israel? A place where it is illegal for a non-Jew to marry a Jew. How is it that these supporters of multiculturalism in the West denounce it in Israel? Why is it that they wish to keep Israel a Jewish state and deny rights to non-Jews? Why is it that in the US every racial group that promotes ethnic empowerment (La Raza/Black Panthers) are not considered hate groups by the ADL while white empowerment groups are?

It is within the Zionist interests to destroy the white identity. Perhaps the average Jew does not understand the implications of the policies that their rabbis support in the name of Judiasm, but these integration policies are specifically designed to allow the Jewish minority population to remove white control over the Western capitalist system. It's why we give Israel 40 billion a year for nothing ($100k for every Israeli citizen). It's not a conspiracy; it's fact. Zionist leaders are profiting by the disempowerment of  white European-Americans. They know that if whites retain political control they will remove Jewish control over the economy. This is why they are censoring Ron Paul; because he is the only candidate that speaks to the white nationalist movement and advocates the dissociation from Israel and it's demands in the Middle East.

Western whites are being genetically and culturally destroyed by Jews who manipulate Blacks and Hispanics and give power (media attention, monetary resources) to people like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton through the ADL (both take trips to Israel; a place where blacks do not exist). 

Whites only exist because they breed with other whites who share their genotype. Our culture only exists because there are white people to pass it on. Interbreeding and integration will effectively destroy both our cultural and genetic heritage; as well as lower the collective intelligence of the entire United States and Europe. Intelligent people have a lower fertility rate and mass immigration into their countries is a culture/genetic death sentence. Do you think Japan allows non-Japanese people to become citizens?

This phenomenon is not new. Jews have been doing this for 2000 years. This is how they must behave to survive as a prosperous minority. Jewish supremacy is the heart of Judiasm. Goyim racism is what keeps them from pillaging the Goyim economy. If you question the double standards of Israel they label you an anti-semite and, depending on which country you live in, charge you with hate crimes.

If you opened up your eyes it would be as evident as day.

cyano is red/blue slime that covers your sand/rocks and can cover coral, theres also diatoms which look like cyano but usually golden brown color and won't usually cover rocks/coral. diatoms are nothing to worry about as many new tanks get it which will usually last 2~3 weeks, i'm just after having a diatom bloom myself which last 3 weeks.

if its cyano or diatoms , do 20% water change and try and remove as much as possible during it. 
also try and move your powerheads around to get more flow in that area.
if that doesnt work, you might have to add some carbon/gfo filter in the back part which will help reduce a simple bag of the stuff will help no need for a reactor.
do you have a deep sand bed? you might have to add some sand shifting snails like cerith or Nassarius to help get the sand oxygenated, i think a conch might be to big for your tank or you could get one of them.

Enter angry looking black woman and three kids. I had just given away the last lane to my manager who is Irish and Canadian (read: super white). I very politely informed the woman that we had no lanes available due to leagues and that we were that way during the week from about 5:30 to 9 or so. Woman proceeds to say ""You tell that cracker ass mother fucker to let me and my babies bowl.""

Me: ""ma'am I'm sorry but we have no more lanes. You can wait until someone else is done or you can come back another time"" give her some bogo coupons 
Her: ""whatchoo think, cuz I'm black I can't afford this shit? (Gets very stereotypical ghetto at this point). I want to talk to your manager right now.""
 Manager comes over, asks what the problem is. This woman proceeds to accuse us of being racist, associated with the ""klan"" and says she is going to call Al Sharpton. I shit you not.

 Manager offers her his lane. She says she's too mad now and that she would be back with her lawyers and storms out, tipping over a trash can and a display with league information on the way out. My manager looked at me and just said ""What a bitch.""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Spent my senior year living with my best friend. My favorite two things:


We had a ""plant"" that my friend's mom had bought for him the year before that he had on the balcony at his old house. He never took care of it in any way, so the plant soon died and was replaced by some sort of extremely durable weed. We brought it the 50 miles to our new apartment and placed it on the balcony there. We proceeded to 'feed' the plant all year with cigarette butts, beer, urine, spit, burnt/spoiled food, etc. Occasionally one of us would just randomly get up and go outside, usually drunk as shit and proclaim ""PLANT'S HUNGRY!"" and deposit random garbage into it. The weed lived through all this abuse, including a small fire as someone threw a smoldering cig into it that caught the potter on fire.


We were messy as any two bachelors in their early 20s can be, and our bathroom was no exception. It had no garbage basket in it, so after a roll of shit tickets was used up, we'd generally just toss the cardboard roll in the corner somewhere. This went on for the first few months we lived there until one of us got the brilliant idea to start stacking them up  together. Connecting two rolls by shoving a third roll halfway inside each of them and so on made a pretty durable long rod of these tp rolls. Eventually it became known as the ""shit staff"" and was 5 or 6 feet tall and just chilled in the corner by the shower. Always invited curious questions by guests who used our bathroom.","1333238739"

I didn't want a roof rack because because it would have cost more, some require to remove the front wheel, I didn't want to have to hoist the bike up there, etc.

I like the stickup a lot.  I just started riding in October and have been removing both wheels and putting the bike in the trunk, HUGE pain in the ass, so having the rack is great.  Takes seconds.","1333238747"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt; Jim Sterling doesn't write reviews for The Escapist.

[But he does write for The Escapist](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/jimquisition/5524-Konami).  And now you know he's dishonest yet they choose to continue publishing him.

&gt; but she explained herself rather clearly before this whole mess even began.  Which seems to disprove your little theory.

She did not.  She wrote nothing but positive things about the ending [prior to being called out by someone who had finished it](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/6.353199-Mass-Effect-3-Review?page=2#14015334).  Remember that this 'mess' was already underway by the 6th as pirates had finished the game and posted the endings many days prior.  People receiving early copies likely had as well.

Once called out, the damage control starts.  She initially tries to agree with them that ""[and while I didn't love the game's ending(s), they didn't diminish the overall experience for me at all](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/6.353199-Mass-Effect-3-Review?page=2#14015334)"".  Really?  That's hard to believe, surely anyone who saw the multiple endings would be shocked.  Oh wait, let's skip forward a few days to where we learn [she was lying about having played more than one ending](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/6.353199-Mass-Effect-3-Review?page=11#14035505).  Oh.  Her story keeps changing the more pressure is applied.

The reason The Escapist is getting so much heat is that their prior review for Dragon Age 2 (a 10 out of 10) got everyone very suspicious they were either incompetent or corrupt, and [the arrangement with BioWare to cross-promote Gavin's music and Mass Effect 3](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112180-Miracle-of-Sound-to-Premere-Mass-Effect-Song-Live-with-BioWare) established a conflict of interest similar to the one IGN had where [BioWare modeled their writer/host as a NPC in the game](http://www.ign.com/blogs/jess-ign/2012/03/02/interview-at-gamezone-my-involvement-in-mass-effect-3-i-will-never-stop-doing-what-i-love).  It looked like BioWare was trying to influence reviews with these ridiculously 'cozy' arrangements with review sites.  Sure enough, her Mass Effect 3 review glosses over the terrible endings and she lies about having seen several of them.","1333238764"

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","The best way to deal with this is to have a coordinated team. 
As Maokai you typically start regrowth+pot(s). Not much room for a ward. Some other junglers can afford to get one right off the bat (e.g. Udyr can easily start cloth+2 pots+ward). 

So you need your support to ward red. Or, support can ward river + wraiths so it covers both entrances. As soon as the enemy jungler is spotted, nearby lanes should come to help kill the jungler.
It's obviously easier done on blue side, since you can potentially be 4v1, and only 3v1 on the purple side. 

If your team doesnt react and you have a not so good champ to 1v1 just let the buff go and try to recover either by countering yourself/farming small camps/pull off a good gank.

As Maokai you have really strong ganks, especially if your laner has any kind of follow up CC. 

One other thing though, dont try to gank all the time if there are no good opportunities. Farm instead, cover lanes for your teammates to back, and try ganks when it's possible to do so. You can get really far behind if you quit farming those camps for too long. 

Finally get your timers down. It is key to jungling/counter-jungling. Try to deny small camps when you counter (i.e. leave one small monster and take the big one); steal the buffs (clear the whole lizard/golem camp) and get the timers down so you can come back to steal again. I see a lot of junglers leaving a small golem/lizard at enemy blue/red and it's not really optimal. You want to keep that edge and have accurate timers while keeping the enemy jungler guessing. You can even set up ganks in his own jungle if you do this consistently.

Hope it helps!

I find that canceling the aa animation after the 1st shot with tumble is intuitive. If you are in range of the target after tumble, Vayne will fire the supercharged aa and I can try to time the condemn right after the aa animation (just like the tumble) to quickly fire 2 hits in a row (aa + condemn).

It is fair to note that condemn's range is shorter than Vayne's aa range.","1333238780"

Internet rumor has it they're very popular in prisons because they give you an intense full-body workout, require no equipment, and can be done in a very small space (e.g., a cell).

The first time I tried them, I think I only managed about 3 in a row. I think the most I've been able to do in a row (without pausing) is about 15.

I hopped into a 1 player start server and fired as fast as I could from the hip while moving jumping and all sorts of crazy ass shit I might pull in a close quarters pistol fight and nothing made the spread become anything near what I experienced in suppressed fights.

I think suppression does not affect your initial spreads for your shots, but prevents or slows the recovery of spread with pistols.

Now, research ([source](http://www.feuq.qc.ca/IMG/pdf/casp_-_savoie_-_recherche_-_1112_-_travail_etudiant_-_fr.pdf), p104) have shown that students work on average 18.8 hours per week during their school semesters (and 35h per week during the summer, but let's focus on the semesters).

So that makes a typical student workweek of about 64 hours. Of course, this does not count any extracurricular activities, which can make a big difference on the ol' Curriculum. So the average student is pretty busy.

The minimum wage is currently 9.65$ per hour for non-tipping work ([source](http://www.feuq.qc.ca/IMG/pdf/casp_-_savoie_-_recherche_-_1112_-_travail_etudiant_-_fr.pdf), p121). So this 1625$ fee hike means that students will need to work 168 extra hours per year to cover this. That amounts to a little over 3 extra hours per week. 

So now the average student will need to work 67 hours per week to make ends meet. Now, I know everyone puts up these kind of work week once in a while. But can you sustain this rhythm for three or four years? Wouldn't you want to blow steam once in a while, without being called a freeloader? 

Now, let's consider the case where you have children to pay for, or some health problems impairing your ability to work. Haha! Just kidding! If you are in this situation, [you're screwed](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/view/355593/). Enjoy the gutter, you ain't gonna leave it.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","You are spot on when you say it's fun to think about it...it's one of those subjects I can very easily get so lost in! As far as asking questions and such...I really feel like everyone should. But more importantly, if I want to make an informed decision about something, it's better to have every facet of truth, you know? As of right now, I would say it's harder for me to DISPROVE that a god of some form exists. Much like Descartes' ideas, almost every question I ask leads back to another question, and near the end of said questions I'm left with this over whelming idea that *I'm most likely missing something*, and as such, I can't **disprove** a deity. That doesn't mean I'm going to worship him/her/it, except through living my life the way I would like to be treated: I try and be gentle and give every creature the time of day (I'm vegan...I just can't stand the thought of inflicting pain on any creature. That's a personal choice for me, though, and I don't judge others or even usually discuss it). 

I'm also the kind of person who has a tendency to take reality at face value, and I'm only just now starting to question that. One of the biggest questions that has always plagued me while searching for my religious identity has always been the question of whether or not god (if he exists) is omnipotent. If he is, then that would mean free will doesn't exactly exist, which would mean the whole idea of there being an after life split into something good/bad (Heaven/Hell) is meaningless and ultimately unfair. A Christian once argued with me that God knew your life plan before you were ever born; he knew what choices you would make and what you were destined to do. If that's the case then, I argued, why does Hell exist? It seems incredibly unfair to create someone if you already know they are destined to spend eternity (that concept alone terrifies me, fyi) in pain and agony and despair. But, if god isn't omnipotent, does that make him/her/it flawed as well? The thought of a flawed deity doesn't rest easy with me either. 

Once again though, I would really like to thank everyone for taking the time to discuss this with me. You guys are pretty frickin' sweet :D","1333238811"

I didnt think much of it until my wife was pregnant with our son and I started researching. I read the usenet group misc.kids.parenting where circumcision was discussed often. I was already convinced on logical grounds that it was wrong but also conversed with.intact.men who described the sensations their foreskins provided during masturbation and sex. I will never get to know those sensations.

When I tried to raise the issue with my wife, she shut me down with ""we will do whatever my doctor says. You are not a doctor and thus not qualified to debate it"" . So at the next ob gyn appointment I was sure to ask his recommendation. He took my side with a vengence. So my wife was in agreement with me for a week or so until her mother started working on her. Then she starts throwing a hundred different arguments against me. I refused to give in although it took everything I had. My son is intact. If I ever try to talk about my feelings of loss with my wife, though, she just tells me I need to get over it and worry about something that matters.

"darknetplan","t5_2rju2","**TL;DR**: In the 1800s a foreign bussinessman starts his own telegraph company in Canada. He lowers his prices to below cost, forcing his competitors to follow suit lest they lose customers. This causes a loss in stock value and said businessman sweeps in to buy up all telegraph companies in the country. 

A similar tale may be playing out today with the introduction of Wind Mobile in Canada, owned by Naguib Sawiris. While foreign competition may lower prices in the short term these foreign businesses aren't concerned with the betterment of their host country and it's unlikely that they'll reinvest the capital gained from Canadians back into Canada.
_____________
Curious, my first thought was to make an analog to the 19th century steel industry in the states but there weren't any foreign players on that scene. I think it's still a valid comparison as it illustrates something that is being taken for granted in this article: a national business is not inherently more likely to re-invest in its host country any more than an international business once it reaches near-monopolistc control of its market.

I go even further in stating that it doesn't have to be a monopoly per se; it merely has to be sufficiently successful. Take the modern day example of America's ""Job Czar"" Jeffrey Immelt. In addition to being directly tasked by the US government to create more jobs in the states, he is also the CEO of the American multi-national GE (General Electric). Despite these roles he has taken on, he has actually created more jobs outside the US than he has within its borders. For example Brazil alone has experienced the creation of 10x more jobs than the US due to GE's investments. 

As a Canadian I would love to see some more competition in the Canadian telecommunications market. Both Bell and Rogers have a notorious reputation for providing poor rates and service to their customers, and since they have been the only players on the scene for quite some time they know they can continue to do so without losing business. However, as someone with passing familiarity with recent history I would still hesitate to get on board with Wind Mobile. They may be providing better rates now but will they continue to do so? I don't think that will be the case, and considering how the current government likes to do business I don't see them intervening should a monopolistic scenario begin to arise.

**TL;DR 2**: I agree that Wind Mobile may not be as great as it seems to be right now. Only time will tell if this will play out like it first did in the 1800s, but I'm not getting on board with them just yet.","1333238835"

I've seen several people at least 8 years old or older, unable to play any form of computer game because the ""controls are too confusing"", AKA they can't use the mouse &amp; WASD keys in conjunction and whatnot.

There's 3 possible outcomes in which the first one is more likely: 1, every kid I've seen try to work a keyboard and mouse is fucking stupid, 2, your sister is a fucking genius(and should turn out to be an awesome gamer), or you turned on MC and she's not really ""playing"" more than sitting there holding the keyboard.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This is going to be the ""bro-iest"" thing I'm ever going to post on reddit, but having a larger penis is a problem:
1. normal sized condoms pinch, feel awful, and you lose an erection
2. it can hurt your partner - I've done this before and *it isn't* fun or cool or anything. You're putting your partner through pain, and that's going to discourage her to want to sleep with you again.
3. it's expensive. Exactly like you said - magnums are expensive and nobody gives them out for free. Having a larger penis burns a hole in your pocket (somewhere there is a joke here... I need to find it lol)
4. It can be dangerous because you can break normal condoms - it's happened to me, and it's scary, for all the reasons.
5. It becomes a thing (haha) - some women (and some men) find out about it and try to come on to you. It's happened to me and it feels disingenuous and isn't sexy or cool. I get turned on by women being aroused at the thought of being with me, but it feels so impersonal that it's a turn off.
6. It's a sports hazard - for real. It gets in the way when you're doing stuff, and can get hurt (once, even though I was wearing shorts, I was doing some construction work and a PVC pipe hit me ""down there"". I was instantly incapacitated, and it hurt to move or get out of bed for a couple days. It took me a week and a half before I could get an erection again.)

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","&gt;According to the original story, if there were long arguments OOC, it was not playing out characters.

The arguments were a result of the Paladin roleplaying his character and the players thinking he was just being a dick. So it was out of a result of playing the character.

&gt;Fifteen minutes of an 'aha' moment do not justify headaches every week for a year.

In your mind. That's just your opinion. According again to the story the players found it to be awesome. You might have hated it but that's pretty irrelevant. 

&gt;This was several people being upset for months

I think you're far overexagerating how upset they were by this. D&amp;D is just a game, silly arguments happen within it but hopefully as adults people realise it's not that big a deal. 

&gt;If this is fine by you, I don't see a reason to continue this conversation.

Mine or your opinion on whether this is 'fine' or not is again irrelevant. The DM clearly thought it would be a cool idea that his players would like, the Paladin player equally did and the other players realised how cool it was once the reveal happened.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I used to work a five-star hotel in Australia. About 7 years ago an inexplicably famous crooner, let's call him Michael Mublé, comes up to my desk on Sunday morning, the busiest time of the week as the place is full and all the weekend guests are checking out at the same time. 

He lines up to speak to me and opens by accusing the lady in front of him of pushing in (""Am I not standing here? That lady just pushed in front of me. What a fucking asshole!"") then launches into a five minute rant about how the elevator was taking too long the previous afternoon. I worked on the concierge desk so I obviously have nothing to do with elevators whatsoever. There's a maintenance number listed in his room for that. I also don't have a time machine to go back and warn him.  

Conversational extracts:

""I want to speak to your manager!"" I point to my manager and say ""he's over there"". He looks at me and says ""I don't want to speak to your fucking manager"". O_o

""My name... (looks around, pauses of effect)... My name, is Michael Mublé. I am staying on the EXECUTIVE LEVEL.""

""I am spending $20000 here!"" (pretty sure this wasn't even remotely accurate)

The thing that amazes me most is that he was FURIOUS about a long wait for an elevator from the previous day. Between then and when he hassled me, he'd played a show at the concert hall next door, had time to sleep on it, and still managed to be so angry and unreasonable that he decided to take it out on someone who was totally unrelated and not allowed to argue back. 

What's more, after he finished he got in his minivan which was waiting to take him and his bandmates to the beach in the Australian summertime. 

I've read a bunch of stories since then about what a crass peice of shit he is, even in concert. Apparently it's standard to get a bunch of walkouts every night from how ungentlemanly his conduct is. ","1333238873"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I think women do, in general, see that men mean to compliment women and hope for a positive reaction. However, there is no space for a women to turn off that attention, or to reject these unwanted advances without being labelled a bitch or a prude or dyke or ugly or whatever. Women are expected to react positively to something, when despite what men may think, **they do not want**.

I hate to make generalisations like this, but since you started off on the assumption that all men want to have sex with all women, I'm gonna flip that round. Women generally are looking for one romantic partner, and want an emotional connection to their partner. So their pool of likely candidates is considerably narrowed down, and outside these parameters are strangers, with whom they *do not* want to have sex with. These are the people approaching them and offering sex.

To put yourself in their place, imagine someone in your life you categorically do not want to have sex with. If imagining a woman is too difficult, imagine that it's a man. Imagine men wolf-whistling you in the street, grabbing your butt in bars, licking their lips at your little brother when he plays out in shorts. Is that still complimentary?

"fantasyhockey","t5_2s0tu","Worst was either Luongo (7th), Backstrom (10th), Crosby (11th) or Ryan Kesler (30th).
I'd rank worst pick to best:
1/ Crosby (cause of injury)
2/ Luongo (has stunk, barely a starter and 7th overall)
3/ Kesler (has been terrible, enough said)
4/ Backstrom (still played almost half the games with over 1 point a game. not that bad)

Best was probably either Ray Whitney (16th round 15th pick) or Brian Eliott (surprised nobody here chose him as it), (undrafted)

It would easily go to Elliott (might win Vezina)
But Whitney's good too (having a breakout year)

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My girlfriend has been a barista/waitress for about 6/7 years, and even though you'll think I'm just saying this, she is the best. Highly professional, friendly, constantly recieves praise from customers. She's never been to a job interview where she didn't get the job. She's been a supervisor/shit manager of a few places for the past couple of years. But still she gets these old bitches that come in and act like they should be treated differently from all other customers.

Snapping their fingers at her when they need service. I find this to be pretty much the height of rudeness when in a resturant, cafe, whatever. But she still gets it.

The biggest bitchzilla and her fat cow friends came in to the cafe/deli my girlfriend works at and ordered 4 cups of coffee. ""That's fine"", she says, ""Anything else you'd like to order just now?"" - ""No thanks, but could we have some milk with our coffees?"" - ""Certainly, I'll be right back"".

My girlfriend gets the coffees and carries them over, two in each hand. And the idiot goes: ""...Uhhhh, where's the MILK?"" 

Maintaining her professionalism and trying to smile nicely (a bit (it was near the end of the shift from hell)): ""Well, I've only got two hands! So I'll just go get it now! Mmmmkay?""

When she got home, she was like: ""I wanted to say that I was holding it up my ass and clenching, and if she wanted to put her cup on the floor, I'd just unload it in there for her""","1333238879"

The first man (a Japanese immigrant) to open a Teriyaki restaurant in Seattle in the 70s substituted sugar for mirin (probably because it was cheaper) and started selling large servings of chicken and beef skewers with this slightly different teriyaki sauce. Then in the early 80s many Koreans immigrated to Seattle and many bought franchises from him and his business partners. They added garlic and other spices from Korean cuisine giving teriyaki chicken its modern American flavor.  This started an explosive expansion in Seattle, where today there are more teriyaki restaurants than all fast-food chains combined. ","1333238885"

"LucidDreaming","t5_2r0f4","ell yourself you are going to lucid dream before yo go to bed. Don't smoke weed, and let your imagination go nuts as you slip into sleep. Here's the thing about techniques, they only give you a higher percent change that you will slip into lucidity. First and foremost, do you dream often? If you don't dream much, you most likely won't lucid dream. Dreaming is the key here. It's all about being in a normal dream and realizing how odd it is. It has nothing to do with how your eyes are, or what position you are laying in or any of that crap. It's about having the ability to dream first and foremost. 

The reason WILD gives people a higher percentage to slip into lucidity is that it invokes standard dreaming. So if you have plenty of dreams but just can't get lucid, then work on dream recall. Dream recall is practicing  remembering your dreams as clear as you can recall a memory from yesterday. When you think of yesterday, you should be able to think of what you did as far as your daily life is concerned, and what you dreamed. Get very detailed with remembering. Notice the detail in everything. As you develop dream recall, you'll be able to see more while your in your dreams, it makes dreams more vivid because you put effort into focusing on the nature of the dream world. 

This means that if you can remember your dreams in high detail, the next time you dream you have a better chance of noticing more detail and therefore notice that things are very odd and unlike reality. You'll be able to compare reality to what you are looking at in the dream. An example would be that you start walking through your apartment/house in a dream and realize there's a christmas tree in the dream. If you weren't keen on noticing details, this may slip right by you and feel totally normal in your dream. But since you are noticing detail, you'll think ""... a christmas tree? Why is there a christmas tree in here, it's march!"" That's your opportunity to become lucid. These odd moments where things aren't right. 

At first you may only notice the oddness and then go on with your dream, but as you work on it, you may get glimpses of lucidity, where you say ""A christmas tree... what the hell... OH I must be dreaming!"" Then you realize you are dreaming but the flow of the dream may crash over you and you lose your lucidity, this happens a lot. But as you get better, you'll be able to stabilize yourself within that chaotic flow of the dream. You may say ""What the fuck... a christmas tree? Ah right, I'm dreaming. Well, fuck you christmas tree!"" Then turn it into a dragon, jump on its back, fly out the window and burn your city down. haha. 

A big hump once you do start getting glimpses of lucidity is being able to control the lucidity, that's tough at first. It can either get very exciting that you wake up, or you just lose lucidity and slip back into the random flow of the dream, or you freak out, but I doubt you would since you're trying to become lucid. It's fun, man. There are many things to explore and very odd things to grasp once lucid. There's no frame of space and time, so you can basically do anything, be anything, in any time. etc etc. Sometimes you may mix many random ideas into a lucid dream and cause it to become too chaotic that it makes you wake up, it's a whole new world. Anyhow, hope that helped in some ways.","1333238888"

"EnoughPaulSpam","t5_2sir4","&gt; Is his honesty - weather or not he is right on anything - not enough to push someone to admire him?

Are you kidding me? He's one of the most dishonest candidates out there, and not really all that different than the other GOP candidates, except that he takes even more extreme stances than many of them, and then tells his supporters that he's actually looking out for them when he pushes legislation which then pisses all over them. And then when you guys get involved, you then even state that he has the opposite position from what he's stated at times as well, leading to even more dishonesty in the discussion where he suddenly has opposite positions of what he's stated that he has, because it wouldn't go over as well if you stated that he had the stance that he does, and you guys probably even know it.

For instance, he has stood in opposition to every single landmark piece of legislation and judicial advancement which gets made in the area of civil rights, claiming that they are pieces of discrimination, but because it isn't all that popular to say that you're a racist, he then tries to say that he's actually looking out for the best interest of the minorities by making them fend for themselves.

Heck, you might as well look through [this list](http://www.addictinginfo.org/2012/01/04/10-reasons-not-to-vote-for-paul/) of legislation that Paul has pushed through which 

And then he even states outright that he's pro-life, and radically so, to where he believes that life should be defined at the moment of conception, which he has tried to push for defining harshly with his Sanctity of Life Act, which is rather clearly a pro-life proposal.

And yet you guys then try to state that none of us really know what it's saying, as it's a demonstration of his pro-choice stance, which he finds detestable, and is a shining example. Yeah, sure. You do realize that there are some lawyers on Reddit, and that they aren't nearly as stupid as to think that a bill with that wording is pro-choice at all, right?

&gt; Personally, I believe one would have an obligation to vote for the only honest man on the field.

So let's put up a theoretical for why that's a completely ridiculous reason to vote for someone.

Let's say that I'm a candidate who has only one issue, which is that I want complete global annihilation, and that on my first day in office, I promise that I would launch all of the nuclear arsenal of the US throughout the world to then end the whole human race. And I really mean it.

Does my truthfulness as a candidate for what I'd do as president really make me then obligated to vote for a guy who would see me, as well as the rest of humanity dead?

&gt; Personally, I would vote for him even if he was a statist.

The most common being surgically created.  An AV Fistual helps facilitate the process of dialysis in End Stage Renal Disease, since veins are unable to cope with the high pressures created during the dialysis process.  An AV fistual helps enlarge an vein so that it doesn't burst when large volumes of blood are returned to the body.  In the instance of this post, my guess is that the pressure created due to muscle mass squeezed an artery until part of it popped, and then it healed by fusing with a nearby vein.

The question wasn't ""would you kill and eat your dog?"" it was ""Would you try dog meat?""

Ethically, when your dog dies, is it not more moral for you to eat it than it is not to? Surely your dog would prefer that you received some kind of benefit from its death than it would just have those nutrients go to waste.

It's also very possible that we've an instinct against cannibalism because of the higher possibility of disease. If they've got a parasite or infection, we'd almost certainly also be vulnerable to it.

Basically, I can ask tangential questions dealing with more complex issues too, but that still completely avoids answering the question. Perhaps it's that you can see no logical justification not to eat dog meat, but we're not governed solely by logic. ""I wouldn't try dog meat because I keep a dog as a pet, and don't like the idea of it"" is a better answer than ""It's dead.""","1333238899"

"community","t5_2qu49","Oh interesting! I hadn't noticed the continuity ""error"" and I had forgotten about Troy's explanation of the goatee from Inspector Spacetime.

I definitely agree that it would appear the ominous ""evil"" as presented visually by goatee-ed characters could be parts of Abed's imagination as he tries to deal with emotional conflict that may or may not be beyond his maturity. That one Christmas episode from last year shows that he is capable of retreating into his imaginary world when he cannot handle an emotional conflict. It also demonstrated that the rest of the characters are not exactly privy to his inner world. This thrown perhaps into sharper relief now since he not only spends all his time with Troy but they also live together. 

Edit: Another mention of alternate universes came in the model UN episode! (I'm watching it right now...) Abed asks about the possibility and then follows up with ""what does that mean for free will?""

This has clearly been on his mind all season.","1333238912"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Other issue being what exactly constitutes reasonable suspicion. If a officer asks you who you are and you refuse to respond and walk briskly away, that comes off as a bit suspicious. Especially if you do it in a very passive manner with your hands in your pockets, a look that naturally makes you feel non intimidating, but makes it appear as though you may be concealing something. 

Unwillingness to identify yourself only raises causes be suspicion and promotes additional investigation. Obviously legally you are allowed to say no and walk away, but in many cases in doing this you are only trying to prove a point and practice your rights. 

Like in this case, had these guys just produced ID, they probably would have been asked to just move on and they could have and none of this would have happened. 

Instead they raised his suspicion and argued. When the officer approached the one guy, the other guy put his hands in the officers face, again completely not needed and again raises the tension of the situation. 

If you want to practice your freedoms, just hand him your id with a smile on your face, keep your hands steady and in the open, and remain calm. You are not going to have issues if you just act cooperatively and if you are not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about. ","1333238914"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Why, and why?

Do you extend the same need to all arms, such as weapons of mass destruction?

What about an imaginary product along these lines: ThinkerToy^(TM) for toddlers, which through 15 minutes of play time each day will stimulate the child's brain making him/her grow up on average 5% smarter than other kids. - At least that's what the marketing says (articles and/or ads in media with readership in the 25-40 range). In reality it does not make kids smarter than any other toy would, and the cheap material which is considered dubious/inappropriate for use in toys gives off a chemical which will as it turns out give some percentage of the children cancer 15 years from now.

So no person who has seen the results of a formal review of the product's claims, and can interpret such a study to see that the product is bogus, would want to buy such a product. Even moreso a person who has analysed the contents of the product's materials, and knows that one of the materials is of dubious safety to children.

On the upside, thanks to missing testing and regulations in some countries together with the power of advertising, there exists a profitable marketplace for this product in the world.

Must that product too be made? Might it as well be done by you? Would it not be shameful and greedy?","1333238916"

&gt;Neither fit is exactly perfect, but when the boy's large is tucked in and the sleeves are rolled, it looks pretty damn passable.

Since you are not considering the removal of the light or AFG/VFG, a 2 point sling can help you balance the rifle or a heavier stock. Granted, a lightweight barrel profile will help the balancing as well as reduce the overall weight. You can have a place like ADCO recontour it for you.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","""Hell"" isn't that clearly defined to be eternal in the bible, the harshest* interpretation is based on a papal bull of the 14th century (a time where catholicism took on a really grim face):

*Purgatory* is a place for catharsis, before you enter paradise. In classic interpretation, sins are ""burnt out of you""; in more recent interpretations it is the pain of ""seeing the light, but not being part of it"".

*Eternal hell* is reserved for the ""real bad people"" - those who committed a capital sin (murder, adultery, apostasis) knowingly and out of free will, and never repented. 

Under the concept of free will, sinners still have the choice to repent and find eternal bliss. 

Now, if you *insist* on an omniscient god in the strongest possible sense (i.e. not just knowing everythign that can be known, but perfect precog), and this omniscience *not* being affected by the grant of free will, well there. God knew ahead that Joe Shmoe would never repent, and still stuck to the rules he made. There, Joe Shmoe burns in hell, and only god could have prevented it, ergo, god is evil. q.e.d. 

Personally, I don't see any point in sticking to these assumptions just so that outcome is preserved. 
(Nor do I understand hell in the catholic sense of a state of being but rather as a state of mind)

He didn't die, he was resurected shortly afterwards, and god can't die anyway, thus negating his omnipotence, because even if he wanted to HE CAN'T die.

""Oh well humans betrayed him, so a ""human"" had to repay it.""

The story went that the Squat race had been virtually destroyed, and the few remaining Homeworlds were annexed by the Imperium over the hundreds of years after the attacks. Only a few scattered and embittered remnants of Squats survive throughout the Imperium.

* Currently however Games Workshop have taken the stance that the Squats never existed - older republished novels have been edited to remove all references of Squats. In other cases books have not been republished due to the stories featuring Squat characters or other obsolete races. ""

"dragonage","t5_2r8lo","The cinematic quality in DA2 was light years ahead of the first Dragon Age game and may I say the first Mass Effect game too. The camera angles, the cinematography, the soundtrack and the voice-acting; all of those contributed to how high the cutscenes and the movies were throughout Dragon Age 2. You can definitely tell that the cinematic influence was carried over to Mass Effect 2 &amp; 3.

Speaking about voice-acting, the game got two playthroughs out of me because I had to experience the game through more than one of the ""dialog stances"". I absolutely loved that through the entire game, all of the dialog changes based on what ""stance"" you pursue. Even when enemies confront you or major boss battles, their dialog changes based on if you're a good Hawke, the comedic/wise-ass Hawke or the ""fuck you"" Hawke.

In ME3, you may find the quest system to be similar to Dragon Age 2, i.e. a huge clusterfuck of a quest list. Also the dialog wheel appears in DA2 from ME.

I bought all of the DLC for DA2 and they were all great; too bad there won't be more especially when a planned expansion pack for DA2 was cancelled to pursue Dragon Age 3.","1333238955"

If you had some magic button to press and transfrom USA into anarcho-capitalist system overnight, it wouldn't last a day. But in reality there is no magic button you press to get to anarcho capitalism. People need to go there themselfs, same as we abolished slavery and now people believe slavery is wrong. So if you would one day have an anarcho capitalist society, people would already be ancaps.

&gt; But that hasn't happened.

1. The same argument was used to justify slavery when it was still in pracrice. ""Hey, there was always slavery, the society can't function without it"". It makes no sense.
2. There were some societies with decentralised law, as medieval Iceland and Ireland. A nice video about [law and defense](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylXAhyDZhZ4) without the state, links about Iceland and Ireland are in the description. Iceland was really close to anarcho capitalism, and [it lasted for 290 years](http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig3/long1.html).

&gt; But telling me ancaps think otherwise isn't going to convince me otherwise. Why do ancaps think de-centralized system will be united? Do they have historical examples behind this? Psychological experiments? Logic? Something? If so, please tell me. Like I said, I am here to learn.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","You're correct - different conceptions of theism require different responses, of course. If I were a Christian, for example, I would be either an agnostic or a gnostic theist as to the Christian God, but likely an agnostic or gnostic atheist as to all other gods. This doesn't sully the definition at all, it just requires that we be more specific about what it is we are agnostic towards. It's like asking someone, ""Well, do you think cars are safe?"" The answer must be, ""Well, which car? Some, perhaps, depending?""

(The US doesn't have a formal system of transfer payments, but some states definitely pay more in federal taxes than they receive in federal benefits, and WA and OR are two of those.) There are significant economic incentives to BC joining with WA and OR. WA and OR have significant agriculture, a strong technology sector, lucrative commercial ports, and in the cities, a young, educated workforce. [BC's GDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadian_provinces_and_territories_by_gross_domestic_product) for the year 2010 is $191,006 million Canadian (so about $196,736 US [1]), while [WA's GDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_GDP) for the year 2010 is $351,100 million US and Oregon's is $168,900 million US. Per capita, BC's GDP in 2010 was $46,192 US, while WA's was $52,403 US and Oregon's was $44,447 US.

"math","t5_2qh0n","One way to derive formulas for infinite products using primes is using observations like the following. The crucial step is the first one, it uses unique prime factorization. Look up the Euler product formula for more details.

(1/1^2 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + ...) = (1 + 1/2^2 + 1/4^2 + 1/8^2 + ...)(1 + 1/3^2 + 1/9^2 + ...)(1 + 1/5^2 + 1/25^2 + ...)... = 1/( 1-2^-2 ) 1/( 1-3^-2 ) 1/( 1-5^-2 )...

So pi^2 / 6 = 4/3 * 9/8 * 25/24 * 49/48 * ...

I suspect the result you mentioned has a similar proof.

Note that we didn't use anything about the distribution of primes, just the fact that we can factor any number into a product of primes in a unique way. In fact we can get a lot of information about the distribution of primes and other number theoretic questions by looking at these infinite series and products. This approach is called analytic number theory.","1333238975"

With my first character (Dark Elf, Dual Wielder) I pretty much just did some daedric quests, the Dark Brotherhood, and defeated Alduin, and that somehow took me 65 hours (it's so easy to get sidetracked)...

My second character (Khajiit Illusion Assassin) I played ~40 hours initially, but I've now come back to and now he's at ~105 hours and going strong.

I didn't play my other characters nearly as much (15-20 hours) as I built them just to do specific guild quests for the most part.

Then there are the numerous character I only played a couple hours out of Helgen in order to test out a new build idea, and just gotten bored of. One of the reasons I went back to my cat is that he is flexible enough to switch between multiple playstyles, which keeps the game interesting, (although sometimes I have to force myself to stop sneaking while I'm wearing my combat suit...)

""Don't be soft mate, just give me the 20 Lambert""
""No sorry I asked you for ID""
""Listen you fucking n*gger, give me the fucking fags"" (British slang for cigarettes don't giggle)

He looked pretty shocked at this and said ""Don't talk to me like that, get out now""

"LeagueofLegendsMeta","t5_2smhl","A lot of positioning is just applied map awareness.  Next time you play, put a sticky note on your monitor that says ""Where are the enemy champs?"" and take a look at it from time to time.  Try to figure out where the enemy probably is and then position yourself accordingly.  Are they all mia? Better get the hell out of their jungle.  Did you see them all top?  Well then either push bottom or save top tower.  Did their blue just come up?  Maybe they're headed over there and you should react accordingly, either by getting out of there or possibly waiting for them in the bush to gank.  Did you see them headed mid?  Don't stand in the river bushes waiting for death.

If you know where the enemy is you'll have an easier time knowing where you should be in relation.  

If you're talking purely about teamfight positioning, that's even easier.  Just feel it out and don't get poked.  If you're an initiator, you're out front waiting for an opening.  If you're squishy, sit in the back waiting for a cool down window.  If you're beefy, follow the initiator.  Just practice and do things with *intention*.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There are so many things that could go wrong at a pharmacy.  CVS especially, I've been working for that company for about 4 years now.  Each store is busy, and help is given based upon the number of prescriptions they do per day.  For example, if an average of 300 prescriptions are filled a day for a total of 2100 prescriptions per week.  Then that store receives 100-something technician hours.  A lot of times the manager has to allocate those hours to peek business times.  And sometimes that isn't enough.  

Customers are extremely unpredictable.  I feel sorry for the people that have to wait in line for 10 minutes because the asshole in front of them decides to bring in the discount coupon card during the transaction even though the coupon card mentions to give the pharmacy the card when DROPPING off the prescription.  Shit like this happens; it's unavoidable.  The best thing I could do is do my job the fast and accurately.

Sometimes I feel like giving up though.  We have customers that are complete angels and we are extremely nice to them back.  But once they hear news that doesn't please them they will go ballistic on us, sometimes for reasons that are out of our control.  I once had a customer that needed her diabetic medication, however, it was an hour before closing and she had no ride.  So I felt bad, knowing that she really needed it tonight I offered myself to personally drop off the medication once my shift ended.  I got to her house and she handed me her check and then proceeded to complain to me about how the first time she came by we should have had it ready so that I wouldn't have to do this.  I apologized to her and told her to have a good night.  I wish everyone would understand the struggles that pharmacists and technicians have to go through each day.

I don't carry any of them CCW, Sigs are thick framed and that makes them uncomfortable for me.

I'm not a fan of the P250's DA only trigger.  It's a good pistol, and it's accurate as Sigs generally are I just don't like that trigger and coming from a 1911 it'll feel really weird.

In the general size range of the Glock 19 I'd go with another Glock, or a Walther PPQ.  The trigger on the PPQ is amazing out of the box.  In the end though there's a lot of good defensive pistols now, shoot as many as you can and see what works best for you.  In the end what counts is that it's reliable, accurate enough, and *you* can put rounds on target in a high stress situation.

Edit:  A good point in another post.  The P229 is not a lightweight gun so take that into consideration when you'll be carrying it all day long.  What you can carry comfortably depends a lot on the weather where you live.","1333238998"

"lgbtsex","t5_2sk5b","That you can maintain an erection until he touches your penis, points to psychological causes of the dysfunction.

First, I'd like to say Erectile dysfunction is not an accurate indicator of (biological or psychological) health -- you're very likely a completely healthy and normal guy :)

The issue here is extremely probable to be sex-related anxiety issues and behavioural cues that need some reconditioning. It is very unlikely that you have something significantly wrong with you psychologically, and while feelings of internalized homophobia and shame are things you'll want to address, they are likely a completely separate issue ;)

Here are common therapeutic techniques you can try out:

* Try masturbating to porn together. After doing this together multiple
times, try touching one another. Try masturbating while he touches your thigh one time, then successively moving up to the groin, and then penis, in subsequent sessions.

Take your time with this. Don't rush it or view anything as a goal or expectation you need to reach: You're both just enjoying some porn and relaxing.

* Try masturbating to porn with a condom on. Sometimes guys completely lose it when the condom comes out, so this is a preventative step so that you not only get used to the feel, but also associate arousal with it.

* Try sleeping naked together, and being naked around one another when you aren't trying to have sex. Lots of casual penis touching. This will help break down the associations that might be provoking anxiety in you or acting as a mental block.

* See your doctor for Sildenafil (Viagra), or a similar Cialis. See if you can get them generic. Since your doctor might not warn you -- Never take an ED drug with poppers, it's extremely dangerous.

Honestly, I would say this is the best solution for you, although the others are good too. The Viagra isn't something you would be taking your whole life. Rather, it can give you more confidence and eliminate those core anxiety issues and mental blocks, after you successfully have sex/fool around a few times. But keep in mind that the alternative things I've listed are good strategies too!

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","First of all, it should be noted that Singer (as a utilitarian) believes that animals deserve moral consideration, not necessarily that we should not experiment on them. In fact, there is an abundance of research out there that argues that animal testing has a beneficial consequences for the lives of both humans and animals. So even given all his arguments, they don't mean we can't debate, say, that there is a net benefit coming out of the way we treat animals.

Second, Singer's argument can be attacked on the idea that animals can ""suffer."" Harrison (citation at the end) makes several arguments to explain that no, we don't know that animals can feel pain in the same sense that we feel pain. 

* Reactions to harmful stimuli do not necessarily indicate actual suffering:

""The argument based on 'pain behaviours' is the most intuitive. Considered in isolation, however, it is the least compelling. Even the simplest representatives of the animal kingdom exhibit rudimentary 'pain behaviours'. Single-celled organisms, for example, will withdraw from harmful stimuli. . .we show little sympathy for those unfortunate ants which are innocent casualties of an afternoon stroll, or the countless billions of microorganisms destroyed by the chlorination of our water supplies""

* Pain behaviors may not necessarily occur in response to actual pain and vice versa:

""In more elevated levels of the animal kingdom there are also instances of 'pain behaviours' which undoubtedly occur in the absence of pain. Some parent birds, for instance, will feign injury to lure predators away from their young. . .Animals might have sustained considerable tissue damage, but display none of the signs which we imagine would usually attend such trauma""


* Pain behavior is not an accurate expression of any internal state:

""Pain behaviours. . .can be ably performed by non-living entities. If we were to construct a robot which was devoid of speech, yet was to have an active and independent existence, it would be necessary to programme it with mechanisms of self-preservation. . .Properly programmed, such a machine would manifest its own 'pain behaviour'. If we lit a fire under it, it would struggle to escape. If it found itself in a dangerous situation from which it could not extricate itself. . .it would attempt to summon aid with shrill cries. If it were immobilized after a fall, it might, by facial contortions, indicate that it was damaged. But this 'pain behaviour' would convey nothing about what it was feeling, for robots. . .can feel nothing. . .'pain behaviours' of animals demonstrate, in the first instance, how well natural selection has fitted them for encounters with unfriendly aspects of their environment. 

* For neither animals, nor our imaginary robot, is 'pain behaviour' primarily an expression of some internal state.""
Physiologically it is impossible to determine whether animals feel pain or not:

""Our experience of pain, for example, seems to be mediated through a complicated physical network involving the neospinothalamic projection system (sensory aspects of pain), reticular and limbic structures (motivational aspects of pain), and the neocortex (overall control of sensory and motivational systems).4 (It may be significant that this latter structure we share only with the primates. An argument could be made on this basis alone that the experience which we designate 'pain' is peculiar [only] to us and a few primate species.)""


* Even if they do have the physical capabilities of feeling pain we cannot determine whether they are physically capable of suffering from it:


""Blindsighted individuals can learn to respond as if they see, even though they have no conscious awareness of seeing anything. . .animals might respond to stimuli as if they were conscious of them, while in fact they are not. . .birds which lack the human apparatus of conscious vision. . .might not simply have qualitatively different visual experiences as suggested above, they might not have conscious visual experiences at all. It may be concluded that an animal's experience of stimuli which we would find painful might be . . . not painful) or may even be non-conscious. Animals might react to such stimuli by exhibiting 'pain behaviour' and yet not have that mental experience which we call 'pain', or perhaps not have any conscious experience at all.""

Third, he talks about the idea of marginal cases: ""we can't judge by rationality because there are humans we accord rights to that have the same level of rationality as animals."" But marginal cases exist for pretty much everything, and aren't a unique reason to prefer his theory. For example, let's say that a man is paralyzed from his waist down and cannot feel sensations from his leg. That doesn't make it okay to stab him in the leg while he's asleep (or while he's awake, for that matter). Just because he doesn't feel pain or take any immediate detriment from it doesn't mean it was a morally permissible action.

And then there are a whole host of arguments against his entire ethical framework which I won't get into. 

Harrison, Peter 1991. “Do Animals Feel Pain?” Philosophy, Vol. 66, No. 255 Cambridge University Press on behalf of Royal Institute of Philosophy http://www.jstor.org/stable/3751139

EDIT: Okay, I have no clue as to why I'm being downvoted. OP is asking for a rebuttal, and I'm giving some arguments in rebuttal to his theory. 

DOUBLE EDIT: I added the specific parts of the Harrison article I was citing; hopefully, this can clear up more confusion. But don't be fooled by the length of the second point - I'm giving three separate arguments here as a response to Singer.","1333239017"

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","I would add training and propaganda to your list of aggression causing factors.  The prime example of training is the way the average parent treats the average kid--that is the root cause of the results of the Milgram experiment.  The prime example of propaganda is government schooling.

""Sure, that sounds like mob rule. But we don't have that now.""

So if the majority of my neighbors vote to increase taxes to pay for wars against brown people in other countries--I don't have to pay those taxes?  Are you saying that taxes are voluntary and determined on principle, not voting?

""First, read up on the electorate system. Secondly, read up on the senate and the house, and the state powers, and then read up on the supreme court. We have stuff in place to prevent mob rule.""

How are those controls working out?  Is our military only used to defend?  Does the monopoly of government voluntarily limit its power?  Do cops follow their own rules?  Do public schools educate?  Do industries with heavy government involvement like health care show higher quality and lower costs?

""We have stuff in place to prevent mob rule. However, I think it is being exploited by those in power, not necessarily the 51%""

So you are saying that there are people in power that are supposed to represent the ""will of the majority"", and yet they don't.  What, exactly, are you advocating for?

I used to work at a coffee shop and I was making drinks and there was a BIG line of people and a large list of drinks for me to make, I made an americano (there were about 4 americanos on the list) in a customers travel mug and put it on the bar calling it out, 
this guy leaps at it and says ""UHH THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN A TO GO CUP?!?"" 
and I look at him with my eye brows raised and say ""Is this not your travel mug?""
him: ""UHHH NO!""
me: ""Then I don't think that's your drink!""
And then the person owning the mug took their drink and winked at me hahah.
I just think that story is hilarious because HOW STUPID ARE PEOPLE, did you think I was just fucking GIVING YOU A MUG buddy?

I've also had people ask what was wrong with my eyebrows, which gets really awkward (I have to fill them in because they're naturally really pale) 
I've also had people make me try on clothes for a friend/ family member in my retail job and when I've said something like a coat is too tight and suggest sizing up they usually respond with ""well she's smaller than you anyways""
fuck you, buy the wrong size and feel stupid when it's too small for them then.

The fighter/thief, a female elf,  got tired of waiting on the rest of the party who were patching up and searching after a fight, and checked out a hallway and door by herself. She ran into a couple of night hags and got her ass whooped fast. The rest of the party, (not knowing what happened to her, as they left the room), decided to give her another five minutes even after she had been gone ten minutes. When they finally killed the hags and found her, she was strapped to a table and was being skinned alive. She permanently lost several points of charisma, and not being the nicest looking thing to begin with, became absolutely hideous. On the plus side, she got one point of constitution for surviving the ordeal.

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","Thank you for being so obviously patient with her!

Behavior does tend to change a lot in the first few months a dog is in her forever home, but I can't say whether her fear will naturally get better or worse. 

Your instinct that forcing her may only make her more fearful is spot on. If she can be calm enough to be motivated by rewards (food or toys) you can reward her for exploring, but try to force her as little as possible.

Two really awesome websites:

[fearfuldogs.com](http://fearfuldogs.com/) started by a woman who adopted a dog, Sunny, who was rescued from a hoarder. Her booklist is really excellent and so is her advice.

[BAT or functional rewards](http://functionalrewards.com) which is a method developed for fear as well as other behavior problems. The fundamental concept is to use distance as a reward for desirable behavior - but practitioners tend to mix that with other methods as well.

Does she respond to food? Does anything motivate her? If not, I'd make sure she has places to hide and work on letting her know your presence isn't a threat (by consistently respecting her space.) You can walk into the room, drop a treat and leave. Or since she (congratulations!) is now wagging her tail when she sees you wait for her to come to you and pet her on her terms. Offer treats too, if she'll take them. Make sure that she can always get away from strangers - a scared dog who can't flee is more likely to become aggressive. 

You should learn to watch for her more subtle cues - like tongue flicks, yawns, head turns, etc. [Here is a gallery of some of them](http://www.canis.no/rugaas/gallery.php). There are links to more calming signals and training on /r/dogtraining. Definitely start learning about positive reinforcement training methods so that you are ready when she is.  

It's possible that you have a long road ahead of you. There are a lot of really wonderful methods to work with fear, unfortunately it's a tough problem. Much like anxiety disorders in humans.

Sleeping on the couch all day isn't normal for a 6 month old, though it may be that she is shut down from fear. :-(. Definitely ask a vet, and hopefully after a few weeks of safety she'll be more lively. 

Obviously a professional is the best thing to do - but unfortunately about half of all professionals are terrible, so I recommend getting a book or two so you know enough to screen for the right professional. You may also talk to your vet (or a vet behaviorist if you have the $) about whether medication might help - and of course screen for any medical conditions which might be exacerbating fear.","1333239037"
"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","Before I get started, I prefer to defined my own concept of ""Creative Property"" as to avoid confusion or conflation with the vagueness of government-defined-intelectual-property.

* **Creative Property** *""the ownership of an unique and original form; a one-of-a-kind form could have never reasonably occurred without the application of creative thought and effort by the original creator(s)""*

--------------

&gt; *""I never made any such claim. I only claim that if your job exists solely because of an illegitimate legal fiction ~~like copyright~~, I don't care if you lose your job when we set things right by eliminating that legal fiction.""*

I agree, except are copyrights actually legal fiction?  Or more precisely, are ~~copyrights~~ Creative Works any more of a legal fiction than any other property right, or laws against murder, fraud, theft, and violence.

**Justifications for Creative Property**

[1] Perhaps it's best to start with the Libertarian justification for property; self ownership.

* John Locke's labor theory of property is a natural law theory that holds that property originally comes about by the exertion of labor upon natural resources.  Persons own themselves and therefore their own labor. When a person works, that labor enters into the object. Thus, the object becomes the property of that person.
* *my take:* One's labor is one's property, as an extension of self ownership. No man is entitled to the physical or creative product of another individual's labor, except through consensual agreements.
* [Here's a good followup article.](http://hallingblog.com/scarcity-%E2%80%93-does-it-prove-intellectual-property-is-unjustified/)

[2] If you avoid moral claims and/or claim ""creative property is a myth"" - physical property is also nothing more than atoms and ownership is just a human construct.  As such:

* Property, Intellectual Property, Non-Violence, and even the Non-Aggression-Principle are truces of human interaction for mutually beneficial relationships.  [(more here)](http://jamescarlin.wikidot.com/property-as-a-truce-of-mutually-beneficial-human-relationshi)

---------------

**Property Enforcement**

&gt;*"".... that can only be enforced via government mandate.....""*

This merely demonstrates a lack of imagination, and the same fallacy as those who claim *""property is a construct of the state, and can only be enforced by the state.""*  [(easily debunked)](http://jamescarlin.wikidot.com/private-security-and-dispute-resolution-in-a-free-society)  It would be far more accurate for you to state instead that you are *""unaware of any means of enforcing IP without the state.""*

Protecting Creative-Property can be done through a variety of means, including Encryption, DRM, Server-Side Data, Obscuring creation methods, lowering costs to the point competition isn't economically viable, secrecy, content updates, contracts between reputable businesses, arbitration, reputation, etc.

--------

&gt;*""only those who agree to the terms of the contract can be held liable.""*

This is a double standard that is never applied to theft of physical property.  If a person takes property from you against your will, and never signed a contract, they would still be liable for damages.","1333239038"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","That is, in many way, a horrible nasty pernicious view of women from a so called feminist. The idea a woman seems to be ever pressured into sex and ever unable to actually speak their own mind is downright offensive.

The argument also smacks of false-consciousness based ideas, which you can also argue is very patronising and insulting. 

Dan Savage has this exactly right [here](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14495) dealing with that type of claim about sex and constent. All worth a read but I think this is particularly pertinent.

&gt;
I get letters every day from people pressuring strangers, personal trainers, boyfriends, girlfriends, and yappy little dogs for sex. Shall we lock them all up? No, of course not. Because what determines whether or not a person who is pressuring someone for sex is ""moral,"" much less a rapist, is how they react when they hear ""No."" Do they take ""No"" for an answer and drop it? Then they're moral, pressure or no pressure. Do they sulk and pout and resort to emotional blackmail? Then they're jerks. Do they fuck the person they were pressuring for sex anyway? Then they're rapists.


Also you are right about SRS. They are a bunch of hysterical shrieking twats who do not seem to understand how the world works, how normal people think, have relationships and sex and so on. It's amazing any of them can actually exist in the outside world. ","1333239039"

112a are hard to beat when the evidence is almost alwasy 100% damning.

On the bright side, an NJP is not the end of someone's career, not even close.

My fellow Sgt has 2 NJPs, and picked up only 7 months after I did (and I felt I picked up rather quickly), and the command fought to change his mind about re-enlisting (he wants to get out).

Remember, there is NOTHING judicial about ""Non-judicial"" punishment.

So by refusing the NJP he has to be willing to take this all the way to court.  That is something for his legal counsel to help him decide and no one else.

People aren't actually defined as you think they are -- they're just people. The labels are man-made. And there is nothing about them that makes people less ""real."" Further, the labels aren't even what you think they are. 

From a medical point of view, trans/intersex women are women. From a biological point of view trans/intersex women are women. They know they have a medical condition, but they aren't stretching any definitions because human sex (as I showed in my previous post) is defined in many ways. 

&gt;Same with trans women/men: whenever they meet someone new, at some point, they're going to have to clarify that they're stretching the common definition of woman/man

Not really. And as the medical remedies for their medical condition improve, there will be even less need to say anything. They say something to share the intimate details of their life -- not because they're stretching any definitions of anything. And when they say something varies from person to person, as it does for anyone with intimate details to share.  

It's your definitions that do not accurately describe humanity. Trying to hold people to inaccurate definitions as a measure of whether or not their ""real"" is illogical or at best subjective. Really, trans women are women. There are all sorts of subsets of men/women, but to pick one subset and say ""these people aren't real"" is just discrimination. It's certainly not funny.","1333239058"

I count 1250 delegates left to be assigned (based on [this](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/republican_delegate_count.html)).  If a candidate needs 1144 delegates to win, Paul has 1067 to go.  That means he would need to win more than 86% of the remaining delegates to win outright.  Given that he's won roughly 6.5% of the delegates available so far, I'd say he's pretty much out.  Technically not mathematically impossible, and I guess you could argue he might win an open convention, but it seems pretty unlikely.","1333239063"

First bike: $4000 or less. You can get a used Ninja 250 for $2-3 easily.

A few things to watch out for on the road: While you're driving your car, try and do head checks (Turn your head) for every lane change you do (if you don't already.). Also watch the road for any debris like sand, oil, liquids n' stuff.
Tips for beginning riding: You are going to hear horror stories about riding in traffic. Take them as good information, but don't let them scare you into being panic and overwhelmed. A calm mind can much more easily deal with all the motorcycle controls, traffic, and other important details at the same time. If you freak out, you won't be able to act safely.
About the motorcycle: One of the most important things to understand are throttle control. If you want more information on how to finely control a motorcycle, read or watch the vid for Twist of the Wrist 2. Cool stuff.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I used to work at the infamous Ponderosa Buffet as a line cook. Fun fact, you can actually order meals there other than ""buffet, please"". So with these so called meals, you get choice of side: either french fries, or baked potatoes. One day we got slammed with business and completely ran out of baked potatoes, and had some in the oven starting to cook. 

In walks The Customer. He stands at an ample 6'4. He's a wide man, clad in denim and full of beefy desire in his heart. His mustache, thicker than Sam Elliot's. This is an American man made by and for his time. His lips part, and out come the words: ""Buffet and a Ribeye."" 

The host begins to speak, but is shut down. ""With a baked potato.""

""We currently are all out of potato. We can offer you-""

The man's face turns a shade of fuchsia not even Crayola could name. His eyes bulge, his lips tighten. The air blowing in and out of his mouth creates a rippling tornado of absolute fury around him.

""NO POTATOES.""

""WE-""

""NO POTATOES?!""

He moves faster than anyone of his girth should and ever has since. He pokes his angry face back into the kitchen.

""NO POTATOES! WHAT'S GOING ON AT PONDEROSA?!?!""

""NO POTATOES!!! YOU SHOULD BE FIRED,"" he proclaimed, waving a finger at me.


His family had to pull him back to the front desk, him still hollering. He accepted the sad terms we had to give him. French Fries. The kitchen was on the other side of the wall from the buffet line, so I walked around to see him eating his steak.

He just ate it with pure spite. I've never seen anyone mow on a buttered well-cooked steak with just pure hatred. He didn't even enjoy the buffet. He just sighed when he had to pick up the tongs/spoon/ladle like it wasn't enough. There will always be a baked potato shaped hole in that fat man's heart.","1333239083"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; if you look at history most dictatorships and totalitarian state are absent of religion.

Are you so sure? I'm pretty familiar with a lot of history. There have been a *lot* of dictatorships. The majority tend to *use* religion, not remove it. Dictators like to associate themselves with religion. The ones that remove it simply make a new religion, a cult of personality (see North Korea for a present example) - they like to remove the competition. But it's *much* more common for dictatorships to profess piety.

But state imposed atheism has *nothing* to do with maintaining secular laws and not forcing people to follow a particular religious tradition.

The reason why the US was founded as a deliberately secular state was to *protect* individual religious beliefs, not eliminate them. The first amendment prevents state-supported religious precisely so the state *doesn't* impose one religion on everyone. You should be glad of it, because it's there to protect your own beliefs.

Many countries have largely lost their religious beliefs 'naturally' rather than imposed by a totalitarian state, over recent decades. They are not remotely hell-holes. They're actually very nice places to live.

&gt; I must point out that atheism is a religion onto its self 

Look up the definition of religion in a few dictionaries. Find the definition that includes Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and so on. 

Them explain how that definition encompasses 'absence of belief in gods'.

&gt; if you didn't believe then why care at all?

http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2007/10/atheists-and-an.html

&gt; because both sides have their zealots.

Name some atheist zealots from recent times and the worst things they have actually done. Name some theist zealots from recent times, and the worst things they have actually done.

Is it really fair to equate them?

Calling a tribe with strong religious leadership a theocracy is fair enough.

An interesting point. Maybe all states do continue to grow, and won't stop till they collapse. However, you are making an assumption, that assumption is that government is the cancer. This could very well be the case, but it hasn't been established. Worth finding out, for sure. Not worth cutting out body parts if we don't know for sure that they are the cancer. And I do mean scientifically sure. Every ideological movement has been convinced that they were the cure. They have all been wrong. You may be right, but I wouldn't count on it. Certainly hasn't been the historical pattern. 


You made a fallacy in your final point. Governments are made of people. People hold ideologies. Which means they don't always act to grow their government, yes? Assume I was the leader of a nation. I would want to find a plot of land where ancaps could try their thing. Why? Because I think ancap might work, or it might not, but the best way to determine it this is scientifically, in a monitored situation, before risking my hypothetical countries economy on an unproven concept. 

Sure, the dollar might collapse. But a whole lot of other things could happen besides ancap, for sure. Like when the mark collapsed after WW1, or the Zimbabwe currency, whatever that was called.  I kind of feel like to get your system started, you need someone with power to get it started. Which is a problem, because revolutions have almost always started with backing by someone with power and vested interest, and what vested interest would someone have in an ancap state? Unless of course, a person could be ideologically motivated to give up their power......................","1333239089"

People should be free to believe what you want, but we don't want them to force it on others by

* Pushing religious ideas as science in public schools (e.g. the push for Intelligent Design to be taught as an equally scientifically supported alternative to evolution)
* Denying kids alternatives to religious teachings in public schools (as we saw when religious bodies fought against the introduction of ethics classes)
* Forcing others to observe it's rules without providing solid secular reasons to do so (like this Peter Madden guy wants with homosexuals)
* Accepting Government funds for services that do not adhere to Government discrimination policies (e.g. a government-funded Church-run adoption agency or charity service that refuses applicants who do not adhere to Church laws - if they want to discriminate, they should only use Church funds)
* Exemptions from child protection laws on the basis of religion/spirituality (because ""God/Allah/The Earth Mother told me so"" should never be an excuse for subjecting your child to permanent injury or death)

A woman called me a bitch for not using two coupons on the same item. Then my boss gave her a fifteen dollar gift certificate. I told him he just paid her way more than I make in an hour to call me a bitch. Other customers in my line asked ""What do I have to call you to get a twenty dollar gift certificate?"" in a sarcastic way because they were also pissed at the shitty customer and my boss. 


Another woman snarked at me on Christmas Eve after her item didn't ring up at the sale price. Newsflash = I have absolutely nothing to do with how items ring up at the register, and I can't just type in the price.
I tried to explain this to her civilly but she ignored me while ranting to her male companion (son?) about me.

Then she threw her cash on the counter instead of putting it in my outstretched hand, so I threw her change on the counter and crossed my arms. 
She asked ""Why are YOU getting frustrated, you're the one who made a mistake!""

I said ""Bubbye."" and SHOOED her. 
My boss saw the whole thing and he never even said a word. Not even later.

She was like ""CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT SHE JUST DID?!"" to her male companion/son who just laughed at her.

I've never been so rude to a customer in my life. I was going to spend Christmas by myself, and she was buying a last minute Christmas present and being rude to me for no fucking reason.
The next person in line was all ""I am so sorry that just happened."" and I was about to cry.

I slept til like 5:30 pm on Christmas since I was alone anyway. God, worst Christmas ever.

It is the same as if you happened to be gay and they threatened to disown you unless you married a woman.  It is the same as if you and a woman of a different race/religion were in love and your parents forbade you to marry that person due to bigotry or narrow mindedness.

You using cannabis to treat your condition is outside of their comfort zone and rather than be open to discussion, they basically threaten your way of life just so they can be comfortable with the decisions of their adult son.","1333239114"

I bought a Slurpee from 7-11, and just talked with him while walking and sipping it through the mask. People stopped and called out to me or tried to take my picture, but I just kept nonchalantly strolling down the main avenue. Eventually, we ran into a concert at a local coffee shop with a bunch of people we know. We sat down and ordered coffees, and I drank mine through the straw that I used for my Slurpee. At that moment, with loud music blasting throughout the coffee shop and a crowd of people staring at me in confused bewilderment, I kicked back and thought to myself, ""Wow, I really don't give a *fuck* right now.""

"stopdrinking","t5_2s7yr","I can identify with so much in your post. I also worked as an RGN at the end of my drinking. I never worked in a drug and alcohol rehab, but I was a trauma nurse so spent plenty of time with alkies. I would have to listen to my health professional colleagues make snide remarks about drunks and druggies yet I knew that I belonged in that category too. 

It took me many attempts to get sober, and it was always hard to be back at day 1. The thing to remember is that so many individuals never get a second chance - and some never get even one chance. I didn't go the AA route, but I found something that worked for me. In the end I was completely beaten, and I knew that I'd never drink again. I gave up being an alcoholic.  

You seem quite positive about throwing yourself into the meetings, and I think this approach may work for you. I agree that it is going to be a whole lot better to be in AA than in a bar. Just remember that no program can work for you when you hold onto too many reservations - you have to let go for any of these paths to work and become willing to do whatever it takes.

I could do something really outstanding that would make my parents proud, and if its past like 10 o clock, it doesn't matter, she's mad and tired.  I could probably crash my car, and if I told her in the morning, she would totally not be mad. It's weird.  So what I do is, if she's mad, there's nothing you can do except leave.

One of the biggest debates in American politics in the last fifty years has been about whether or not abortion should be legal. Currently it is legal.

Many people think it should be made illegal again, and many of the people who think that way are Christians. Not all Christians are against abortion, and not all people against abortion are Christians, but many of the most well-known advocates of outlawing abortion are prominent Christian politicians. 

With me so far?

Of the four remaining contenders to be the Republican candidate for President this fall, all four are outspoken Christians and all four state that they are in favour of abortion being outlawed.

Many people who believe abortion should continue to be legal express this by saying things like ""the government should not be able to decide what happens in my uterus"" - in other words, that they consider abortion to be a medical procedure in which the government should have no say.","1333239142"

And if a couple cells do constitute a new ""life"" then a whole host of thorny issues become manifest.  Especially when you consider that up to half of all fertilized eggs don't make it to the the implantation stage.  Are all these ""lost lives?""

I will say that I hope that, in the future, you provide support for lower resolutions. My netbook -- and really, this is an *ideal* netbook game -- has an absurdly low 1024x600 maximum resolution, which means that the bottom 15th or 20th of the screen is cut off, meaning that I can't quite follow the chat. If you provided support for lower resolutions, then you could really market it as a great game for underpowered PCs, in the same vein as *Torchlight*.

Other than that, it looks beautiful!

The biggest thing I am hoping for to happen is that as they die off their set mindsets die with them.  On average people who are under 30 are fairly ready to admit they are wrong and change their opinion given enough evidence when compared with a 65 year old.  I think this is partly due to the 65 year old just mentally having that concept (whatever it may be) being pounded into his/her head for 65 years and partly due to age restricting how well the brain can adapt.  I personally think that the newer generations are more flexible on changing their opinions in part due to we are more exposed to the internet and globalization.  Eventually, we also will be less likely to change our minds, but I hope that we NEVER reach the point of ""as my grandpappy used to say..."" gibberish.","1333239156"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Rock is such a broad genre that I can't really make many definitive statement about it, other than I'm pretty sure I don't even know what it means. When I think of rock bands I tend to think of modern rock bands like the stuff you'd hear on the radio over and over and over. Stuff like Seether and Nickelback and Staind and Foo Fighters, not that  those bands have a *whole lot* in common with each other.

Really, what I think of is technically called modern or alternative rock. I don't know if there are any *pure* rock bands out there, or at least they aren't getting airplay. That's the thing though: music evolves over time. I would just say that rock hasn't stagnated; it's just moved on to other things. *Contemporary bands that do play unadulterated rock like The Black Keys or Wolfmother are decidedly un-modern, and are sometimes referred to as retro-rock.

Honestly the only band I can think of that I would just call rock is Queens of the Stone Age and/or Them Crooked Vultures. Or maybe Chickenfoot. But see, right there are two bands that are fairly pure, singular rock bands that sound nothing alike. So I don't know.","1333239162"

I don't want the East Coast, California and other population centers deciding everything politically by virtue of population. The EC has worked for most of this countries existence, now people (democrats) want to get rid of it. It balances out rural vs. urban and all get an equal voice.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","The difference is (I read this somewhere but I don't have a link sorry) that game updates on xbox live are diff patches, which update only the changed parts of the game binaries.

But on PSN if the developer updates one byte in a file, then the entire file has to be re-downloaded.

The reason for this is security - game binaries are ""signed"" with MS and sony's keys for their respective systems. (the console will not run a binary that has not been signed).  Obviously, changing a few bytes in a binary will invalidate the signature on the binary (because its based on the hashcode of the files).

So, if you want to patch a few bytes of the file you must also include a new signature for the patched file.

This is what MS does.  Their method is not any less secure, its just more difficult to get right.

Sony didn't bother including a mechanism for developers to patch files.  Developers can only update entire files.","1333239170"

Because pirating it would be the *only* way to actually play it. When a developer/publisher start forcing an experience on you *their* way, well, I think we should all pirate it. Because every measure they have ever taken to stop piracy has screwed over legitimate buyers. Yet pirated copies are virtually unaffected, and many many times superior to the legitimate product. 

People have argued *against* piracy for a long time, but how about people turn it into a protest tool? I've never seem any program, DRM, or method stop pirating. If people really can't control themselves to not play a game, I don't have a problem if they get it free. As there's no other way to stop EA/Bioware's horrific practices.

When I am out and am tempted by fast foods or conveniences (candy bars, cereal bars…yes they are just as bad) I grab a handful or as much as I can anyway of my stomach and think of how gross it would be if I ate whatever I want.  

&gt; You think you’ve lost weight? Check out some fashion models or skinny celebrities online and you’ll realize that you can probably do better 

&gt; Compete!! Compare your body to your friends’ and coworkers’ bodies. Are you the thinnest? If not, why not? If you are, think about how jealous they are of you  

&gt; When in restaurants, ONLY order off the appetizer menu, and ONLY eat half of it.  For example, if you order an appetizer of chicken wings, only eat 3 of the 6.  If anyone asks, just say you’re not that hungry.

They deleted their posts after being embarrassed by their inability to read my posts.

Taking my text out of context calls into question your character. Here is what I said: ""Iirc they are all Olympic athletes. (The blog explains it better and has more pictures): ""

The blog explains it better. 

And for anyone wanting to know why they are attacking me, ""throwawaytpp"" sounds like it's short for throw away transphobia project, which is an educational project started by trans people to help bring awareness to their existence. Some people don't like it -- others just hate trans people.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Performance engine tuner here with experience in multiple engine management systems, tuning for both performance and fuel economy.  Nearly all modern engine computer have what is called ""fuel enriched mode"" that is activated when engine load goes over approximately 80% naturally aspirated load.  In this mode, extra fuel is dispensed to keep the combustion chamber cool to prevent damage.  I can't speak to exactly how this is done with diesel, or if that truck was a diesel, but the general rule of thumb is the higher the load on the engine, the less efficient it is -- significantly.  Combine that with left turns having a tendency to require you to accelerate pretty decently to turn in front of oncoming traffic, as apposed to right turns that can generally be done at your own pace without fear of being t-boned (and in the worst case, you're accelerating over a smaller distance). 

TLDR: I believe. turning left tends to put more load on the engine over time compared to right turns due to the nature of left turns tending to require a lot of throttle to avoid oncoming traffic.","1333239210"

(although it wasn't athritis apparently because i got tested for it) however, i can effectively control it with a strict healthy diet. athritis in my understanding is inflammation of the joints. inflammation is brought about by supplying the body high amounts of omega 6 fats not in balance with omega 3's. obviously many people eat a lot of junk food and don't get full on athritis, but i would say it could be playing a part in your condition. if i were you, i would go on a strict anti inflammatory diet and see an alternative medicine doctor. MD's don't understand auto immune diseases AT ALL. they don't get you are what you eat. good on you for not overloading your body with those chemicals. 

PLEASE try an anti inflammation diet. google it. it will consist of eating a lot of vegetables, fish, some fruit, rice, etc. this will help you A LOT. kill all junk food.

Illium and Mekenstein are amazing planets, with capitals that are beyond my dreams of industrial progress.

Of course, these planets are warmer than Earth, so I would likely move to the higher latitudes so I don't kill myself. Unless I live in the cities. Also, the rampant free-market economies are hardly something I would enjoy. Virmire is just as wonderful in environmental beauty, the problem, however, is the Terminus Systems.

Thessia is a wonderful world, I must say. [Without the Reapers stomping it out of existence,](/spoiler) it may have been one of the most beautiful industrial worlds I have been to in the series. Earth was also very nice, in the same aspect. Vancouver seemed like a very nice city to live in, plus, its nice and close to home. :3

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Relativity *is* a physical theory.

&gt;Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light

Be careful of what you mean by ""nothing"". Suppose you have a lighthouse at the center of a very large circular lake with a radius of 1 light-second and the lamp in the lighthouse makes one rotation per second, then the location of the spot of light on the lake shore is moving at about 6.28c in the rest frame of the lake, and this makes sense in relativity. What you cannot have is particles or information moving faster than c, and you can't make Lorentz boosts of more than c (so it wouldn't make physical sense to talk about the rest frame of the spot of light from our example).

But this is irrelevant since c^2 is not a speed faster than light since *c^2 is not a speed at all*, it has units of m^2 / s^2

E=mc^2 is not a claim, it is an equation. Theories as a whole make claims, but snippets of a theory on their own do not claim anything. The claims most directly associated related to E=mc^2 would be about energy release during particle-antiparticle annihilation, and these claims are entirely physical.

&gt;So God creating via evolution would fit into phsyicalism?

No, since such a theory would imply the existence of God, which is not a physical entity.

edit: forgot to address the following

&gt;But what we are saying physicalism is is basically ""whatever science says"".

If you want to frame physicalism that way then it would be more accurate to say ""whatever science *could* say"", assuming that science can't make claims about things which are inherently unobservable.","1333239224"

I think that nowadays (and it's still just some possible explanation, I have no real facts to prove my point), European psychologists have a more global, more large and maybe more ""complete"" view of psychology, whereas americans keep on wanting to be pioneers and finding *the* ultimate theory..

&gt; no porting of games required for it to work

But this article points out that Valve specifically ARE porting something to linux that involves driver problems and draw calls, which pretty much only leaves something running in OpenGL, which can pretty much only be the source engine. 

&gt; I'm not sure what you're referring to about these set of certifications. I've never heard of anything like that

Thats pretty much what Android is. Thats why you have some phones running qualcomm chips, some running nVidia chips and some running TI chips. As long as they support the required instruction set and min performance then the get certed for use in android phones.

&gt; The steam console is a myth and isn't happening

I agree with this

&gt; what is happening is the Big Picture Box

This I'm not so sure on. Big picture mode has already been outlined as a UI design spec that makes steam easy to use with a controller on a big screen, I would think the fact you can simply plug an HDMI cable from PC to TV is good enough. If you are going to go as far as a net box you might as well go the OnLive route unless you expect the video streaming box to be EXTREMELY cheap.

&gt; Furthermore this supports the ""50ms draw calls"" 

50ms is an awful lot of lag for a local system. Even a remote system like OnLive tends not to top 200ms. The 50ms was specifically attributed to compiling shaders every draw call and was only overhead, not the actual call time it's self. I can't think of any reason why you would need to compile shaders when you are litterally encoding USB input, encoding/decoding wireless packets and decoding video streams for display. Like I said earlier, using and entire linux distro for stuff that simple is complete overkill, especially when the entire UI will simply be rendered on the PC and streamed anyway (cause doing stuff like that would make the hardware cost 50$ instead of 200$). At best they might use a cut down kernel that you will never interact with in any way.

&gt; I can't see any other way of Steam achieving their Big Picture Box without using something like this

I can, just plug in a wireless controller to your PC and plug your TV into the video card via HDMI. Select Big Picture Mode in steam and there you go.","1333239236"

In any event, as Parsnippity says,you should obtain renter's insurance.  It's relatively inexpensive and it can cover your property wherever it's used--though you'd want to make sure you had coverage for water damage too.

It did to me when I wrote it.) My family is accepting of my decision to leave but refusing to talk religion of any kind. Whenever I bring up minor issues (Because its hard not to talk about religion with your family when you've been raised to do it your entire life) they totally get kinda embarrassed and hush up. I've heard from my highly sympathetic brother that they get embarrassed when I bring up stuff and in order to preserve the peace they'd just rather I didn't talk. So that's where I fall. It gets very frustrating for me because I feel like I no longer connect to my family like I used to and we used to be very close. I was always encouraged to think freely, question and analyse everything, but once those questions took me outside the church it hurt because all my answers no longer became valid for discussion with my family. 

I'm torn over what to do because I like keeping the peace with my family. On the other hand, I dislike the fact that my beliefs are essentially ignored...like a disease no one wants to talk about. Am I asking to much? Other's here have problems with their family pushing religion down their throat and being all passive aggressive about it. ","1333239243"

I don't have direct knowledge or bulletproof full-story evidence *because I'm not on the inside, I'm not part of that little Enron Club"" before it all came crashing down.

Do you know why? Because people like this don't think for themselves, and have been conditioned to see anyone suggesting a conspiracy(conspiracies which are very real things, and have been major causative forces behind historical developments since the very beginning of nation-states) as nuts, silly, etc. All the things that would make you never really look into the 'theory' they're suggesting for yourself, because of the way you've been conditioned to view anything even slightly suggestive of conspiracy as lunatic-fringe.

As far as conspiracy in government, well, again, the history of *nearly every country since the beginning of nation-states has at one time or another revolved around relatively small groups of powerful, wealthy men, conspiring together to gain greater control over the lives, labor, and minds of the masses that they perceive as being below them*.

Or perhaps you think these personalities simply vanished with the invention of the lightbulb or the writing of america's constitution? Maybe  they just disappeared, and human nature shifted overnight, or perhaps you hold a strong faith-based belief that the systems we have in place to prevent them from pulling the same shit here that they pulled in most other nations throughout history are peopled/staffed by incorruptibly-built gods?

Conspiracies are very real things, and acting like it 'just doesn't happen beyond a corrupt guy here and there every few years' at the top of the social heap, the top of the economic/political system where the people there have the most to gain from doing just that(conspiring together to profit in some way), is obscenely unintelligent.

It makes you the mental inferior of the conspiracy theorists to simply discount and dismiss everything they suggest by nature of them being 'conspiracy theorists', not superior. Use your own ability to reason, stop getting sucked into some black and white debate where one side makes the other crazy, and instead actually examine the claims of both side in contrast to the evidence, and then instead of latching on and rooting for either side(*this causing you to discount any evidence which contradicts your view - which, in the case of 9/11 for example, BOTH sides are absolutely guilty of, both ""conspiracy theorists""*[which happens to include a number of commissioners from the official 9/11 commission, just not to the extreme of ""george bush did it"" - which simply is not provable and is not really relevant, is not evidence-based, and IS one of those inane claims] *AND those who support the official explanation from the Bush administration/NIST*. 

As far as 9/11 goes, we have one of the most monumental days in modern American history which has basically shaped our foreign policy for the 10 years following it. We had an officially appointed commission to investigate the events of that day after having to demand *even that* from the Bush administration - and we have a number of the officials appointed to act as commissioners coming out publicly after the fact *actually using the words ""it was a cover-up""*, and writing books about it effectively stating that nearly all of their efforts to have a legitimate investigation were blocked by members of the administration, literally using the phrase 'dog and pony show'. If this isn't important to you, then I'm not really sure what planet you're living on. We have an official explanation that is contradicted in a number of ways by publicly available evidence, and most people just ignore it with a ""well, I don't have a better answer so even if some of it isn't right it's better than nothing"" - this is absurd. THIS is lunatic-fringe.

There is plenty of reasoning and evidence that suggests that the Bush administration did not tell the people the whole story, and the 9/11 commissioners themselves called it a cover-up - using those words. Is that really meaningless simply because there is no bullet-point presentation readily available to tell you exactly what happened in a way that differs from the governments'? The government gave you an **officially-endorsed conspiracy theory** which does not take all of the evidence into account, and in some cases is actually contradicted by actual evidence available to us of what happened that day(this makes their conspiracy theory no more credible than one coming from a private group of scholars or engineers), and you believed it simply because it came from an authority figure, and because nobody else could say ""here, I was involved and know exactly what happened from beginning to end"" - and even if someone like that existed, you would probably ignore them and any evidence they presented to you unless it came from god himself, or a former president or something), ignore the claims of both side and come to your own conclusions based on your own contemplation.

ps - and even now, reading that, you're probably jumping to the immediately polarized thinking of someone who has been conditioned to not think shit through for themselves; instead of reading what I wrote and seeing me as someone who is saying ""there were questions that needed answering which were never answered, and there appears to have been a major failure somewhere at the highest of levels of the government"", you'll probably *decide*(though I have given you no reason to, and in fact have given you good reasons not to) that I'm some irrational conspiracy theorist screaming about how the illuminati took down the trade centers to make america into a police state - why? Because it's easier to dismiss everything I say when you do that. I don't think that, and I don't think George Bush knew much about it, I don't think he's anywhere near smart enough to pull anything like that off, I think that at the very least, someone should have been punished for incompetency even if we don't go any further than that - instead, many of the people who deserved that were *promoted*.

There are questions that should have been asked, or things that should have *at least* been commented on - and they never were. If you personally can't think of 10 such questions off the top of your head, *then you have not looked at the events of that day or the evidence, beyond what was provided for you on CNN/Foxnews*.

*TLDR: it's like any other conspiracy theory, the government offers you an officially-endorsed conspiracy theory, but if the actual evidence contradicts the theory given in explanation to you by the government, then it is invalid - simply because it came from an authority figure does not change reality. You would have NO PROBLEM seeing this if we were talking about the government of another country, but when it's here in the US, somehow our system is totally different and the rules of logic no longer apply*. It's really almost grotesque, this kind of thinking.","1333239248"

There *are* distinct gender traits that come into play in relationships.  Men tend to seek power, are problem-solvers, and will generally (and I think should) have the leading hand in a relationship.  On the contrary to what many feminists will say, women do admire these take-charge characteristics - they love to be led, protected, and comforted by a strong man.  It's all built-in.  Some men take this too far, and that leads to abusive habits, but the more modern notion that both sexes are equal *and* the same is BS.  Men and women have different, complementary roles.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","You get manascrewed or -flooded in this game just as you would playing IRL - once every couple of games. That's the way randomness works. 

The campaign gives you progressively harder decks to face, that's by design. The rationale goes as follows:

1. It's unfun to somehow alter the random draw element of the game. The computer should not cheat here, and doesn't. Seriously, it doesn't.
2. It's unfun to let a computer make suboptimal choices at higher difficulties. At the lowest difficulty setting the computer never uses instants, sorceries or activated abilities. That's fine for very new players, but at a higher setting it should behave like a competent player would given the same hand and board.
3. How, then, can we implement a campaign mode where the match-ups are progressively more difficult?

There's really just 1 answer - you alter the deck. The early decks the computer uses lack removal and use many inefficient cards. They get progressively better right up to the 'end boss', Karn: He uses plenty of cards that are banned for regular play and the developers will never give that deck to players for online play, but it serves its purpose magnificently: it gives a real challenge you're unlikely to beat at your first try that's still beatable.","1333239259"

Some of us also want to be able to have relationships without having children.  Relationships tend to include sex.  Plenty of people just plain don't want children.

It isn't a miracle drug but it is a far more targeted delivery system than conventional chemo.  It is saving people who were left to die after all conventional treatments for lymphoma had failed.

So, it isn't like this is just sci fi.  There are real world applications targeting cell receptors in FDA approved drugs (actually, I should say drug, I think BA is the only one in the class that is approved).","1333239269"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","You will never get a sensible answer to this question for two reasons:

1. It is a non-negotiable point of Christian doctrine.
2. It cannot be true, given the premise of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God. 

2(a): An all-powerful deity can do whatever he wants, no matter how much the theologians prattle on and try to say he *must* do this and he *cannot* do that. That's what ""omni"" and ""potent"" mean when you put those words together, after all.

2(b): An all-loving deity would not voluntarily allow his beloved creatures to experience a single bit of suffering in this life, any more than you would voluntarily allow your own child to burn his or her little hand on a hot stove, even if you felt it might ""teach him a lesson."" You are not a sadist, but the Christian God is.

He not only allows temporal suffering, but condemns *the majority* of humankind to *an eternity* of agony that is not only unimaginably horrible, but also utterly pointless. It cannot possibly teach any lesson, because it cannot be escaped, nor is it witnessed by anyone as an example. His one escape hatch, faith in Christ, is simply unavailable to most people due to the belief systems (Islam, atheism, Mormonism, whatever) in which *he* has allowed them to be raised. And many Christian denominations refine the cruelty even further, requiring *their* kind of belief in Christ to avoid the flames.

You simply cannot resolve this dilemma, a form of which was postulated in Plato's writings hundreds of years before Christ. Any attempts to do so are just theological bullshit and hand-waving, wrapped in gold leaf and hidden behind incense smoke.","1333239270"

[2] I knew a company that had an elaborate system of backups with tar, rsync, and gpg.  Trouble was, they never tried restoring from a _TOTAL_ loss standpoint.  When a total loss happened, they then realized they only had the GPG keys saved _inside_ their backup, making the whole thing unreadable.

New saddle! Most likely you can keep the seatpost, but if the saddle rails (metal bits on the bottom side of the saddle) are flat instead of rounded you'll need a new clamp. $50 and up

Swap the handlebars for some comfortable mountain style ones. Your saddle is pushed down relatively far, if the frame is a little big for you this will make it easier to handle. This could be expensive as you'll need to replace the levers and grips as well. If there's a shop with used parts near you you may be able to accomplish this for around $50. New, i'd expect to pay $80 or more for everything. Not including labor.

Finally I see clipless pedals on there. If you're not riding with the shoes for them you'll find platform pedals a lot safer. $10-$30","1333239286"

It's very expensive, has a huge engine with a lot of power and torque for a beginner, is heavy, requires expensive gas, insurance would be through the roof, etc. Look on craigslist for something like a USED Honda Rebel. It's 234cc, light, agile, and easy on gas. The whole point of buying a used bike is because when you're learning to ride, you will most likely end up dropping it, whether while riding or at a standstill. Once you have ridden the smaller bike and when you think you're ready, you can move on to a bigger bike.","1333239288"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm 22, smoked since I was 18.  This is my fourth or fifth day with no cigs, I can't remember honestly (maybe because I still smoke weed).  It's actually easier than I expected.  I was agitated and pissed off for the first 2 days, couldn't sleep.  That sucked, but I got some Camel Snus, because it's not too strong, and that takes the edge off.  

Yesterday I went up to my buddy's house, while he chain smoked cigs.  I got repulsed by the smell and the smoke, and I didn't bum one off of him, I didn't even feel the desire to smoke one.

The hardest part so far is driving, in this nice weather, with my window down, and NOT having a cig. 

If you really, *really*, honestly WANT to quit smoking, you'll just press through the initial shitty stages.  It's 99% willpower.  Like I said, I've been at it for just a few days, so I'm not the best person to help. ","1333239288"

One elderly white couple and a black couple. There was a small ""divider"" through the middle of the restaurant, no higher than 4 feet or so, and it just so happened the couples were split.

I was just following the rotation so every server got appropriate customers. A black family comes in. Dad, Mom, daughter. I sit them. The server comes back a few minutes later and says they aren't happy. The guy called me racist because I sat him on the ""Black"" side of the restaurant and that the other side had softer cushions and more light. 

The meal hadn't come out yet and all they had was drinks. We offered to move them where ever they wanted, but it was clear he was only thinking of a free meal. So sad his daughter would grow up thinking that was appropriate behavior..","1333239290"

29 November 2006 


&gt;Like most New Zealanders, I take the risks posed by climate change seriously. The scientific evidence indicates that the world is getting warmer and, if this does not change, the results could be catastrophic – for our society as well as for our environment. ... It would be hugely irresponsible for any forward-looking Government to ignore that threat. If human actions are contributing to a warming world we must do what we can to reduce our impact. ... But there is a balance to be struck here. There are some people who advocate ditching all our environmental responsibility in favour of a single-minded devotion to economic growth. Another minority would say we should do whatever we can for the planet, and to hell with the economy.  Most New Zealanders recognise, and agree, that these objectives, in as much as they compete with each other, need to be carefully weighed against each other. I can assure you that in developing our policies this is something National will have foremost in its mind.","1333239297"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience#Omniscience_vs_free_will

Anterograde omniscience is the type of omniscience used to incorporate complete knowledge of the future into God.

A common objection towards free-will is the fact that God knows the future, and what is already known is not considered part of free-will, thus is considered predestination. Such objections however are very controversial and have been refuted by proponents of Divine Omniscience. The alleged paradox arises from a misunderstanding of Divine knowledge. The common misconception is that God predicts the future. This however is a false assumption. The Divine Being who is Eternal does not predict human actions but rather post-dicts them from the future. As such human free will is actualized without any paradoxes.

If the future was given the definition of Physics, it can be drawn down to this. The past is something that's known, the future is something that is not known but may have an infinite series of possible branched time-lines and the present is the eliminator of possibilities. God knowing the future does not determine it as his knowledge is not a deterministic process emanating from the past but rather a knowledge that exists in the present and future actualized by human free action. The future exists as a web of possibilities whose outcome is known by the Omniscient Being but not predictively from the past, but rather post-dictively from the present and future. The mistake that is often made here is to confuse the human being's understanding of his actions and of physical phenomena with the knowledge possessed by the Diving Being. The two are not the same and once this is understood, all seeming claims of paradox are resolved.

Another possible response is to state that God knows the future but does not influence it. One may posit that God knows all possible future events, meaning that he would see an infinite number of timelines laid out on a plane, and such time lines would still remain to exist even if not chosen. Such a God would know every possible way of how something was going to be. He would know all the mathematical probabilities for example of obtaining event A and would also know if a free agent like a human being would cause A to happen. By virtue of self-control God allows humans to shape and morph their lives on their own accord. This way any seeming paradoxes are resolved as one can have a world with an Omnipotent, Omniscient and Free God, while simultaneously actualizing the possibility of free agency within the created order such as that seen in human beings.","1333239303"

I have 60 year old parents, who've been life-long Tolkien fans, that would love to be able to explore such a fully detailed map of Middle Earth in Minecraft, but could only ever do so in Single Player peaceful. When I told them about this map project, they were so excited that it exists. They even watched some of the key parts of the Jesse Cox Tour on youtube. Their jaws were on the floor a good majority of the time while watching. heh

So I sure hope someday it gets released. As long as it's released carefully enough and with enough credits worked into it somehow, it's sheer popularity probably ensures anyone attempting to steal it would be publicly shamed. There's certainly enough evidence to prove who it was truly created by.

Size wise of course, that is a bit challenging..heh

I'll give him a pass on the draft though since that's always a foresight thing, but he did a lot more bad than good to that franchise and I can say with a straight face that I miss when the Islanders were actually competitive.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","about a decade ago i went in to get a job at dominos. the owner ended up knowing my dad so i thought i was a shoe-in. after watching some videos i had to come back a few days later to take some type of online test. the owners wife was there, and while she was setting the test up for me the kid making pizzas said ""hey you know you get a free pizza after finishing the test?"" so i said oh thats cool, i'll have one with everything on it.

then i went in and took the test in the little broom closet/office and at the end of it all the wife went from fake patronizing enthusiasm to passive aggressively furious in a matter of 30 seconds. considering i thought i did pretty well, i had absolutely no idea what was going on. she called her husband and he got on the phone and was like ""so....what happened? WE EXPECT YOU TO TAKE THIS TEST VERY SERIOUSLY AND OBVIOUSLY YOU DIDN'T""

again i had no idea what he was even talking about, he was very abrupt with me and the conversation lasted all of a minute and a half. he was saying i didn't have the job without saying it. i have a form of autism so all of this went right over my head. i handed the phone back to the wife and she looked at me to try and gauge my discouragement like somehow i wouldve learned a lesson by being put in my place, when really i was just completely confused ugh.

i asked her what exactly was going on and she said i did terrible on the test, i mustn't of studied etc etc etc. when i asked to see the correct answers she showed me the only ones i got wrong were what kind of sauce comes with cheesy breadsticks or whatever they're called, to which i replied ""red sauce"" that was marked wrong because i was supposed to call it spicy marinara. the only other question i got wrong was again, what kind of sauce comes with cinnasticks to which i replied ""frosting"" and the appropriate answer was ""sweet icing"" ugh.

i was like are you serious bro ugh, just bewildered. realizing this wasn't going to work out i headed for the door, slightly discouraged but more like ugh what is going on, when all of the sudden the overenthusiastic pizza making kid says HEY BUDDY YOU FORGOT YOUR PIZZA!! ONE LARGE PIZZA WITH EVERYTHING ON IT FRESH OUT OF THE OVEN! 

realizing i just got a 30 dollar pizza for nothing made it all worthwhile. oh and i got a job a month later making 600 bucks a week weeeeeeeeeee

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","the best(and strangest) occasion happened at work actually. I was cutting fabric for an older woman (in her 50s I think) who commented on my age first of all. It went a like this:

Me:""Uhm.. I'm 20...""

Her:""No!!""

Coworker: ""Yeah, we didn't believe her at first either.""

We spent 3 hours helping this woman and actually stayed late to finish up (near 500 dollar fabric purchase and she was pretty cool so we were ok with it.) She came back the next day to talk to my manager about us and how great we were.

"CrohnsDisease","t5_2s453","Well, here is what I posted on IBD to explain why I created this

""Hey everyone! So I posted one of these in r/crohnsdisease and since have made several more just off the top of my head. One thing I hate about Crohns: Not being able to share your fustrations with anyone because no one has the same issues you do. Memes are popular because they can be shared with everyone, right? So I want to share this with you because I know people here will giggle at some of these or shake their heads and say ""Yeah, thats fucked up and I hated when that shit happened to me""
I see most posts these forums are people asking for advice and general stuff like that but I want to hear what other people can come up with. Why do I want this to be popular? I feel like it could be therapeutic to read through them and see one you can resonate with and know you're not the ""only one""
Please take the time to look at them and make your own if you'd like. Please consider it! I already got a donvote on r/CD but i think this would make a lot of us SMILE so do share something you've hated about your IBD - Laughter is the best medicine, and being able to laugh at our misfortunes in the face of them is one of the best ways to get over them.
Don't let Scumbag Intestines get you down. We can get through this, and everything passes (unless there is an obstruction...)
I would really love to see some other experiences posted in this MEME form - please consider it if you have anything to share. :)
http://www.quickmeme.com/Scumbag-Intestines/?upcoming""

I don't see them as ""one-liner jokes"" - because I just want everyone to know they're not alone. That other people go through it too. And although you might not be able to talk about it with other people because of its embarrassing nature, and how other people just don't ""understand"" nor care. Some of them may make you smile because its not like you're laughing at CD. It's like you're acknowledging that your intestines do things that fuck you over like Scumbag Steve (or scumbag anything) fucks people over. 

I just felt like it was therapeutic for myself to write these and know that other people would be able to relate. It's a collective ""fuck you, Crohns disease, because you fucked me in *this* way"" - when you read about CD online you don't get a real understanding on how it can really impact your life. I feel like understanding what other people go through can help you get through it. Does this make sense?

[The Twelve Kingdoms](http://myanimelist.net/anime/153/Juuni_Kokuki) - This has got to be one of my favorite anime ever. It focuses heavily on the story and character development. There is absolutely NO fan service. It's an adventure story set in a fantasy world filled with mythological beasts and a strong mythology behind it. The only downside is that it starts off relatively slow and the main character is annoying/whiny in the beginning. As much as I hate to say this, the story really picks up and changes at episode 6. I don't like the ""You need to watch until here for the anime to get good"" attitude and argument but there are always exceptions and this anime is a definite exception. She changes around episode 6, the story starts picking up, and you will most likely start to get hooked then, which is what happened to me. Once I was hooked, I couldn't stop.

"Feminism","t5_2qr7i","&gt;The discriminatory laws should exist regardless of the proportions of discrimination in our society, so they really don't prove anything.

Discrimination laws don't need to exist if no discrimination is happening. This is why we don't have discrimination laws based around protecting white, male, straight, cis, able-bodied people from the PoC, female, queer, trans*, disabled people.

&gt;What evidence do you have that women are disadvantaged in politics? Don't less women run for public offices?

Why do less women run for public offices? What gender roles must be conformed to in order for officials to get elected?

&gt;What do you mean women are disadvantaged in education? Do you realize there are more female university students than male ones right now? Boys are also doing much more poorly when compared to their female peers in elementary school or high school.

Please cite the source for more female university students graduating from university than male ones.

Boys are not doing more poorly than girls are in primary school education when corrected for socioeconomic and racial differences. The reason boys are doing poorly relative to girls is not to do with gender differences, but class and racial differences in a male-male dynamic. The actual difference between boys and girls on tests where that is corrected for is actually around 1% in the girl's favour, which is statistically insignificant.

&gt;I do think women are discriminated against to a certain extent at work. According to most recent reports the discriminatory component of the pay gap is 5-10%. I do think women face a higher rate of sexual harassment at work.

Both of these issues are common and prevalent, (and the sexual harassment thing is not limited to work) and have to do with gender roles also. Women can't combat them, as they cannot change their gender to that of a man's. This is clearly a sign of institutional oppression against women, and a place where being a man is a privileged position.

&gt;How are women discriminated against in sports? There are always separate leagues...?

Women who want to try out for male leagues are denied for no basis at all. Women-only leagues get less funding and less media attention than their male counterparts. Women in sports careers are not making the multi-millions that the men in the same sport do.

&gt;I see feminists doing this more than anyone.

What does this mean? My comment said that women are more frequently the victims of sexual assault, sexual slavery, and in sex work.

&gt;Actually, those insults are directed at a person's gender identity. People use those insults to imply that the person is not acting like their gender identity. [...]

Yes, and they are gendered slurs which all imply that the men are better than the women and crossing gender boundaries is a bad thing. Being called ""manly"" is not a slur. It's also not something commonly used against women afaik.

&gt;I'm not really sure what you're going on about with the ""gay"" and ""fag"" explanation. I think you make too many assumptions about the thought process of someone who uses those words.

Gay and faggot are insults because of the gender roles assumption already mentioned. I'm not saying it's a conscious thought process, I'm saying that it's unconscious and that's how it has developed over time.

&gt;The porn industry is a free market.[...]

Women consume porn at lesser rates then men, but not by a large degree. Most people globally consume porn. The fact that *no* porn is directed at women rather nullifies the idea that porn for women is not profitable, especially since there are independent porn makers who do make porn for women and manage to stay in business. They are just few and far between.

If the porn makers don't know how to make porn for women, why aren't they learning? Why don't they ask? Why don't they figure it out? What reasons go on behind their minds that they don't think to ask or figure out how to tap into this market? That they don't ask, that they are constantly objectifying women, especially lesbian women, for a male marketplace and never do the same for the women who would also be avid consumers of porn, is indicative of the mentality behind sexism and discrimination.

&gt;I'm saying that we're reaching the point where it's difficult to tell who is more privileged. You say yourself that you can't quantify privilege. You are clearly unaware of your own privilege.

Please tell me how institutionally women are oppressing men. Female privilege does not apply to instances where men oppress other men - that is an in-group struggle or on a different facet of privilege like class or race. Female privilege has only to do with women oppressing men on a societal level.

&gt;Men are are far more likely to die at work. 

Men are more likely to do jobs that are dangerous, because of aforementioned gender roles.

&gt;Women are now going to University at a higher rate than their male peers, and also have gender-specific scholarships.

If I took that to be true, for it to be female privilege it would have to a) be women oppressing men and not be a class or race issue, b) also show that women graduate from university at higher rates then men, and c) show that with graduation from university women are also getting more graduate jobs than men.

&gt;Men are never depicted as good fathers in the media.

True. I discussed that in my gender roles post. Gender roles disadvantage everyone. How is this an act of women oppressing men?

&gt;for every instance where a women is depicted as sexually assaulted or raped, a man will be depicted as the one who did it to her.

Men are usually the perpetrators of sexual assault, on both women and men. I can look up the stats for you if you like, but female on female sexual assault is fairly rare. How is this an example of female privilege?

Finally, privilege is not an active thing, it's an institutional and cultural thing. We don't live in a world where everything we say and do is especially thought out for the broader reasons behind it. Privilege isn't about individuals thoughts and reactions, it's about societal trends. Individuals buy into it, or work against it, but the buying in is passive, while the working against is active.

Privilege only comes into play when one group socially benefits from the oppression of another group. In instances where men oppress other men, as in the case of homelessness, sexual assault (generally, I am aware that men can be raped by women but like women-on-women rape it's far more rare than man-on-man), ect, these have to do with class, race or other issues of power. They are not women oppressing men. They are men oppressing other men. It sucks and is just as bullshit as men oppressing women, but it has nothing to do with gender privilege and has everything to do with class, race, sexual orientation, ect privilege.","1333239356"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So this only happened a few days ago.

I work in a Mom n' Pop Video game store, and I had a customer [Around 18ish] who came in to trade in some games. As per our usual routine, I needed to record his Driver's License info [Required by the state] and I handed it right back to him [I ALWAYS make sure to put it *IN.* *THEIR.* *HAND.* ]

So he looks around, decides he just wants a gift card, I ring it up, hand it to him, tell to have a great day.

... As I turn around, after he left, I saw his Driver License sitting on my counter top... So I immediately grabbed it and put it under the register- I knew he'd be back.

10 minutes later, a medium sized, weathered-looking dude in his 40's with a trucker hat and white T [with stains all over it] throws open the front door to my store, and [with several customers around, mind you] says, in a threateningly loud almost-yell,

""WHY THE FUCK DO YOU HAVE MY SON'S DRIVER LICENSE? HUH?? WHY THE HELL IS IT HERE? WHAT THE FUCK?"" Immediately, I reply, ""Sir, you can't speak like that in here, I need you to lower your voice, this *IS* a kid's store.""

""NO, why the FUCK did you take his license?"" for 30 seconds I tried to explain that his son had actually forgotten the license on my counter top- he wouldn't have it. The son trails in right behind him, ""I'm so sorry, man- Dad, SHUT UP, It wasn't his fault!! I'm so sorry about him, man."" 

I told the kid it wasn't his fault, walked back to my my register, handed him his license, and proceeded to shit my pants as everything sunk in as to what had happened. I still get a mini panic attack just thinking about it... I had to apologize to my customers, thank SOME HIGHER POWER there weren't any kids there...","1333239358"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Mine is terrible. When I was in high school (9th grade) I started going to this youth group because I had a crush on this guy who went there. Well I didn't know any of the girls and I just hung out with the guys. One time we had a lock-in at the YMCA so the boys planned a bunch of pranks for the night. We were dropping laxatives in people's drink...I mean they weren't like ""haha I scared you pranks."" My task was to put vasoline on the toilet seats in the girls bathroom. So, I go in there and barely smear the vasoline on the toilet seat, I really didn't want anyone to get hurt. 

Everyone's starting to figure out that we were the ones that were playing the pranks and we kind of get in a little trouble. Then the worst part happens...I still feel bad to this day.

I totally didn't think that I shouldn't put vasoline on the handicap toilet. So I get called into a room...since I'm the only girl in the group and the only one who could go in that bathroom. The youth group leader AND the crippled girl (MEAN on a regular day and super religious) were both present. I got the lecturing of a life time, the crippled girl gave me the worst guilt trip. ""Do YOU realize what this could of done to ME?"" ""WHY would you even think of doing this to a handicap person!""

(It's giving us all a great laugh today, but imagine having to deal with this confusion every single day!)

Also, here's a [chart of the IPA for the way English is pronounced in different countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA_chart_for_English_dialects ""The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain."").

Edit: More Trivia: also for quite a few Americans Mary/marry/merry are all pronounced identically.  Other Americans distinguish 2 of them or all 3.

What are your opinions on this? And what is your opinion of Hedges critique of New Atheists in general? I will add relevant articles by both Hedges and Harris where they address each other (plus an intelligent third party review of their arguments).

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","One of the most surprising things to me was getting to be in on the process of creating a video game.  I was just the Web guy, so all I was going to do was create some web-based ""brochure ware"" to promote the game.  But I was in on the game from the start.  And what I learned was really surprising.  It turns out that almost *nothing* creative came out of the blue.  One guy was a military buff, so there was a whole system of creatively-titled ranks which seemed really cool, but it was based on what he knew from the real world.  Another guy who was creating monsters had a cubicle *full* of photos of strange real-world creatures (cuttlefish who hypnotize, the tongue-eating louse, and so on).  He told me that his goal was to make sure that every monster he invented was based upon something in the real world, so it would seem more immersive and plausible.  In the end, his creatures were *fantastic* and otherworldly, but I could see how each one was tied to reality.  If I didn't know that he was working in that way, I would have assumed that he was just incredibly imaginative.

And this really is where a lot of creativity is done.  It isn't, ""I woke up with a dream of the fantastic,"" although that happens.  Most of the time, it's more like this: ""I saw something that got my creative juices flowing, and so I've challenged myself to produce something cool from it.""

Once you realize that it's OK to be inspired by other things, you can start to branch off.  Take an idea and graft something weird onto it.  Brainstorm a whole host of crazy variations on your theme and then discard the ones that don't please you.  Amuse yourself.  Be outrageous.

I'll leave you with the creativity that my son displayed recently.  I was running a Goodman Games module that takes place inside the hollowed-out roots of a gigantic dead tree.  And my son had recently played in a game which had a land-squid.  He was fascinated by that.  So as he saw me working on the roots, he started scribbling out ideas for monsters that could live in the roots.  He had viney creatures, root-like creatures, giant termites, etc.  But the one that really took off?  He called it the octomite.  It had 8 arms like an octopus, but they were root-like and could gain nutrients from the earth.  The creature's true hunger, however, was based upon that of a termite.  It loved to eat wood.

So as I sat there working on these root mazes, I suddenly realized that not only was his creature a reasonable addition, but it was also probably the explanation for *why* the tree had died and the roots had become hollowed out -- backstory which the module itself had never bothered to provide.  I started pulling out the monsters from the module and replacing them with octomites.  By the time the game was underway, we had this monster that was creepy, difficult to spot, deadly, and ecologically sound.  It made more sense than what the module itself provided, and it scared the hell out of the players.  I was really happy about it.  And the whole concept was basically just, ""think about what other creatures can do, and steal from that.""","1333239393"

You can think about it this way, if you are trying to push a car is it easier to push when its already moving, or when it is stopped? Its the same physics for a combustion engine, just instead of your energy it is using fuel to get the force needed accelerate the car forward. When only taking right hand turns you will hardly ever have to come to a complete stop, and therefore save on gas.","1333239396"
"airsoft","t5_2qi2x","As someone that has worked in the airsoft industry for the last four years, I'd have to say go with KWA or VFC. Those two brands are the ones that I see the least coming into my shop for repairs and/or upgrades. Both brands offer superior quality and performance over other traditional AEGs. I use a VFC M4 right now and I couldn't be happier with it, for the money invested.

I have owned a lot of different models and brands of guns over the last 10+ years that I've been playing. The only brand that tops KWA and VFC is SYSTEMA. Unfortunately they are ridiculously expensive so that prices them out of the reach of most players. Plus you have to be a little crazy to drop $2k on a PTW setup ;-) 

If you are a competent airsmith or just like tinkering then JG, CYMA, and D Boys can be worth your time and money. They are good options if you are looking for something that retails for less than $200 and are willing to work with the poor quality control that the mainland China manufacturers offer.

I can then use Caps-X Caps-O to do omni-completion etc. Pressing Caps Lock on its own does not send Escape. Pressing Ctrl on its own, however, _does_ send Escape.

I don't think this is a problem in xcape. If I rather check Swap Ctrl and Caps Lock instead, I can switch the Caps lock state with Ctrl as expected but it still sends Escape! I've also noticed that some (but not all) of the Ctrl-Alt-Arrows mappings work (to change workspaces) when I use Caps Lock instead of Ctrl. 

I don't know what goes on ""under the hood"" of the Keyboard Layout dialog in Ubuntu. Maybe there is an even ""lower-level"" way of making Caps Lock an additional Ctrl that I don't know about. But xmodmap gives me headaches :(

Edit: Found the `--debug` flag. Pressing Ctrl-A and Caps-A both give

    Intercepted key event 3, key code 38

and similar results for Ctrl-B, etc. (i.e. key code numbers are the same). Pressing Ctrl by itself gives

To set the scene, it was September 11, 2011. I work at a Hardware store in a pretty affluent neighborhood, and I'm a foreigner. Early in the morning, around 8 or 9 am, a man walked in pretty steamed up. He quickly picks up a few things and comes to my register. As I'm checking him out he looks at me and says ""I can see that you're from Afghanistan"" (which I'm not, I'm not even from the middle east, but that doesn't matter). No one has ever assumed this before so I ask him why he would think that. To which he reply's, ""You terrorist, I work for the government and I can have a people here right now!"" People have now begun listening in, with some defending me. I tell him that ""I don't know what Afghanistan has to do with 9/11, seeing as it was terrorists and not the government who committed those actions; I too am an American sir, and I am shocked by your actions and words against me."" By now, there is a full on scene and my boss comes in and berates him on rude he is and that he is not welcome at the store, which is followed by people clapping and one woman exclaiming ""That's what's wrong with our nation"" and giving me a $40 tip (my jar)!

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I've seen that being floated around but, at the same time, if talks aren't even going to proceed over the issue that is important to the West, then it's just more drawing lines in the sand.  It is certainly a major fault to have preconditions going into this, but it is a fundamental problem if Iran will not even put that bartering chip on the table at all.

Headlines about Iran and what not matter very little; the powers that be are well aware of the state of affairs, and quite honestly I doubt you'll find many Western populations with a very positive opinion of Iran in the first place.  That being said, I understand that it makes perfect sense from Iran's point of view to continue their enrichment program, but with the added caveat that it similarly makes perfect sense for the US and West to oppose them at every turn for desiring to elevate their nation to great power status in a geopolitically valuable region such as the Middle East.

The West is enticing Iran with both threats and dropping sanctions, regardless of the wording.  What it sounds like is that most of these sanctions are tied to Iran's place on the list of ""state sponsor of terror"".  In exchange for the indefinite suspension of terrorism, the State Department could likely just take Iran off that list, much like what was done in Libya back in 2006 (which has very little to do with what ended up happening in their revolution last year).  This is also what happened with North Korea in a quid pro quo.  It doesn't mean the government has to go, although the US government would certainly want nothing more than for that to happen.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt;No one can own a resource that isn't scarce.

Information is scarce.  You are, again, conflating information with the media it is stored in.  MP3s are not scarce - but my labor to produce something unique (stored in that format) *is*.  Were it not scarce, you would not need to copy it in the first place, just as you don't need to steal air, because it would not be unique information and have abundant sources.

&gt;However, you don't own copies made from it.

I do, as it is stealing the information that is production of my labor.  My property.

&gt;in order to use that argument, you have to first establish that IP is the same as any other property, and even though you think you have, you haven't.

So Rothbardian property rights are totally void?  Mixing my labor with resources is *not* how I justly obtain property?  Prove your physical property *is such* any other way, and I would think you might have an argument.  But if, as I understand it, property = labor + untapped resources (as under the *labor theory of property*) then *uniquely produced information* certainly is property.

&gt;How much of your work am I allowed to quote? How will this amount that you come up with not be completely arbitrary?

How are the terms to any contract not arbitrary? Under a free market, the copyright terms would be set by the producers.  But pointing out the State screws up copyright (as it does nearly everything) is not the same as saying copyright is therefore invalid, just as pointing out the State's hypocrisy on murder does not therefore justify killing your neighbor.

&gt;Copyright as codified and enforced by the state is involuntary (on these grounds alone you should stop supporting it, as it violates the NAP). 

No, it isn't.  Producers can choose to not copyright their material.  Consumers can choose not to buy copyrighted material.

&gt;However, if you form a voluntary contract with Joe to not share your work, and he lets Andrew copy it, you have no claim against Andrew. You can only pursue Joe for violating the terms of the contract he agreed to.

I can pursue Joe for knowingly accepting possession of stolen property, as *unique information is property*.  You are claiming a right to the unique production of my labor (beyond a right to produce similar - or miraculously identical - information separately).","1333239460"

It took 6 hours and 28 throws to get the perfect picture, according to the record. Also: no cats were harmed.

Yeah I'm not a fan of faith healing and they do sound quite manipulative but I'm not sure that's the same as being fanatical. 

Sure it's not as rational as UU or the Quakers but I still think any church that attempts to integrate a modern scientific understanding of the world into orthodox Christian teachings serves a meaningful purpose even if they do have some methods and beliefs that I find unpalatable. Like I said above in my opinion that's far more likely to achieve a measure of success than evangelical (i.e going out trying to 'convert' people) secularists. They seem to have relatively progressive official positions when it comes to issues like women's rights, separation of church and state and homosexuality. I guess I don't really know enough about either the Church or religion in the US in general to express a view on how they compare to other religious groups but my impression is that they're far from the worst.

Did you mean because we THINK they are not as advanced morally or intellectually?

Personally, I think the perceived difference between te the Holocaust and the genocide of American Indians is more due to the fact that was recent -- survivors still exist -- than this, since we were the ones who perpetuated the genocide of the Indians. The difference between the Holocaust and the Armenian and Rwandan genocides is twofold--in scale, since 10 million is considerably larger than 1.5 million and 800,000 respectively--but also in level of organization. There are different kinds of ""scary"" in terms of deaths, and the systematic nature of the Holocaust makes it more terrifying than the somewhat more random nature in which Tsutis and Arminians were killed. Which do you find more frightening, being shot in the back of the head, or being shaved, tattooed, forced to near your deathbed, then stripped, gassed, and burned? That kind of terror leads to a fascination with what happened in movies and books that hasn't been the same with other genocides. ","1333239490"

In general, the more neutral you're able to make your accent, the less working class you seem.

Also, a thick local accent can make you seem street-smart about the area if it's genuine.

follows race crime from 1976-2005.

&gt;From 1976 to 2005 --

    86% of white victims were killed by whites
    94% of black victims were killed by blacks

they kill whites 2.33 times more than whites kill blacks. 

What I found really interesting was how the chart following black homicide seems to level off. Then I remember the incarceration rates...it's a hockey stick. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States

Also, keep in mind that some of these statistics count Hispanics as ""whites"", which is a big problem for census statistics and crime reports. 

http://posttrib.suntimes.com/news/7966579-418/more-hispanics-listed-themselves-as-white-on-us-census.html

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_crime_in_the_United_States#Current_crime_rate_statistics

&gt;The UCR classifies most Hispanics into the ""white"" category. The NCVS classifies some Hispanic criminals as ""white"" and some as ""other race"". The victim categories for the NCVS are more distinct.

(Hispanics become ""Hispanics"" when they're the victims but are counted as whites when doing the crime)

Also good luck finding a non-biased hate crime report when only white people can be racist.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","hmmm I had not thought of that. I should step away from any words like should though, because I don't think that morality 'should' do anything. I think that morality arises from actual facts about humanity for a certain purpose, and in that sense it is pragmatic. So, what I meant to say is that, in my opinion, it is nonsense to say that morality ought to extend its considerations to animals, except insofar as it is pragmatic to do so (not strictly in terms of material welfare of course, this also takes into consideration mental distress about treatment of animals or whatever else). To this end I would say that, even though you could certainly derive a sort of racist moral order from the fact that humans are naturally less empathetic towards other humans of other races, you could still argue that it would be more pragmatic to adopt a moral order based on a wider extension of human empathy. And I think that this would not be a difficult argument to make considering how much we benefit from having a racially and ethnically liberal society. Just to contrast this, I think that Utilitarianism is completely unreasonable because human beings are neither capable of nor interested in considering the consequences of their actions on the total utility of mankind (not to mention animal-kind). 

My moral philosophy is always turning in on itself, so this is kind of argued on the fly. I would of course appreciate further criticism. ","1333239513"

But its very frustrating to witness privileged people discussing the oppression people face with such ignorance, even if its well-meaning. Such discussion often divorces itself from the realities of peoples lives, becomes hyperbolic, and is more influenced by the media than should be permissible. Frankly, its dehumanizing. People need to be more careful in these discussions to remember they're discussing real peoples real lives. Also in a discussion about classism,etc to see people equating intelligence with a degree was absolutely disgusting.","1333239536"

Um. In response to your second point, we don't have direct democracy. So no, your neighbors can't vote to establish taxes. They have to vote for representatives to establish taxes which can be challenged on a constitutional basis in the courts, or vetoed by the president. So no, no mob rule. 

Heck, Switzerland is the closest to mob rule in the world, probably, and they are a heck of a lot better off than the U.S. 

Our military isn't only used to defend. Who ever said it would be? Never saying that using it to attack isn't immoral, but it isn't established in the constitution that we wouldn't. But on the whole, our system is working badly, sure. Again, not advocating any system, just attacking them all. 

Alright, customer need is the problem statement, sure. But don't think that customer need can't be overridden by those with the right power and influence. Say your entrepreneur does start this system, and it allows cooperation between agencies. Every organized crime organization will want him dead. He will probably die. And yes, organized crime will probably be in place before he will, because customer needs are rarely fulfilled the moment they exist, someone with the right idea and resources has to come along first.","1333239551"

he was like yeah I got the cash. I was like, "" you know we have great financing terms right now"". so we put through an application it gets declined he failed to mention till after the fact he went bankrupt 6 years ago so they excepted that and left.

He came next day with his father who was just off the slow boat from Poland. He dint have ANY government ID with him I tried to explain to him as professionally as possible that I cant put it through with-ought the proper ID. He FLIPS out pacing back in forth hands in the air saying
""K NOW I'M PISSED!!!!

He started going on about how this is my fault and I should consider a career change, as I'm sending him out the door he says I'm sure the competition will enjoy his cash. 

Now at this point I'm fuming, he's attacking me personally for something that's out of my control so as he's walking out I'm like "" K have fun ""

He FREAKED OUT!!!  started running at me fists clenched, tripped on an 
Ottoman and falls flat on his face. as i'm walking away from the whole situation trying to shrug it off shaking my head he calls me on it.

"religion","t5_2qh39","You don't need to justify disbelief.  Disbelief is the default state.  It's also not relevant.  You're not going to convert anyone here.

You need to decide which set of rules you are playing by, but you seem to be unwilling to do so.  Are you setting your hypothetical in a realm where Jesus really is God, who is by definition omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent and therefore did the right thing without question, or are you setting it in a realm where the only meaningful moral agents are human people?

You need to pick one of these things.  You are doing exactly what so many people who reject Christianity hold against Christianity: you are constructing your own Christianity, dismissing the parts you don't like, to make your point.

&gt;There are multiple stories in the Bible which indicate that Yahweh is an advocate of scapegoating, sacrifice, and more specifically, child sacrifice. I do not share your view that I am incapable of judging the morality of a god.

These things are in the Bible, yes.  When you acknowledge that these things were written by flawed humans, it is perfectly legitimate to say that these things are terrible and immoral.  If, however, you want to acknowledge that it is the word of the Christian deity -- who is essentially by definition without flaw and perfectly moral -- you must similarly acknowledge that these things are perfectly moral, as they are enacted at the will of a perfectly moral being.  You can criticize the character of Yahweh for being immoral in a human realm, but if you want to grant that YHWH is the being presented in the Biblical text, you can't criticize his morality without picking and choosing which Biblical qualities you apply to him (ie, Psalm 16:2, ""You are my Lord, I have no good apart from You."")

&gt;As I am sure you are well aware, anyone who sacrifices their safety to take a bullet for someone else, would not also be doing so in order to take upon themselves the sins of the person being saved.

That's what makes it an analogy and not a description, you know.  Jesus -- as Jesus, the man, and not as Yahweh -- saw judgment coming on humanity and stepped in the way.  Yes, it's weird.  It requires you to do some mental gymnastics to understand it, because it's a supernatural concept that has no natural equivalent (that is, Jesus is just Jesus, a man, living all of the trials as a human, esp. if you're looking at the synoptic gospels, Matthew Mark and Luke, vs John where Jesus is a supernatural from start to finish).

TLDR It seems to me that your point is that God = Jesus, therefore it's not really a sacrifice ... but if you are willing to accept God = Jesus, you need to accept the entirety of the supernatural explanation of the events, wherein God = Jesus, but also Jesus = Mortal Human Man, a mortal human man who feels fear and terror, who is aware of his own mortality and fears death the same as anyone, who cries out in terror as he dies, ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?""

Jesus -- as the mortal man -- saw a threat against someone.  Jesus -- as a mortal man -- died because he believed his death would protect other people.


...

My point here is: Do not attack Christianity on the grounds of Christian beliefs.  If you are going to assume the validity of Christianity's supernatural beliefs, then you have to assume that their deity is doing the right thing -- it is the core of their beliefs.  We are much better equipped to criticize Christianity on purely natural grounds, where we can cite the hypocrisy, cruelty, mania, racism, sexism, immorality, ethical debasement, etc that is presented by the mortal human writers of the text.","1333239556"

[reposting]

From the /r/atheism FAQ -

&gt;An explanation of why posting in r/atheism that ""as a moderate theist I'm totally different from the fundies!"" misses the point

&gt;You're missing the point. 

&gt;There's a fundamental battle between rationality and supernaturalism - that's the tension between theism and atheism. 

&gt;It's nice that we share some political opinions, it's nice you don't hate gay people, it's nice that you accept evolution, it's nice that you accept that the Big Bang happened. It's certainly better than the alternative.

&gt;But if you think those things are what we have issue with, or that those things are what's wrong with theism or religion, then you're missing the point. 

&gt;**The problem is dogma, blind belief in the supernatural, faith, and denying rationality. You have a fundamentally dishonest worldview that can never fully coincide with evidence and rationality.**

Having spent so much time in a long distance relationship and having fought relatively in comparison with my friends in no distance relationships, I know that the cliché 'distance makes the heart grow stronger' (and may I add resilient) is completely true.  Personally, the fact that you can't just see them in person every day makes you take the time to properly understand your s/o during the time that you do see and talk to each other.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","The issue is that you're investing an enormous amount of money into a QB who is 30 and gets hit likely more than any other QB in the league with his style of play and propensity to take sacks.

The biggest thing is that he's proven repeatedly throughout his career that he is not a great pocket passer and has real maturity issues. So the Eagles spend, essentially, 2 years with him and see half a season of high quality play, and suddenly decide this guy is ready to be given $100 million? Let's just reflect on the stupidity of this--they gave a felon who got into his problems largely due to his last $100 million contract $100 million again, a year and a half after he was released from prison.

How is this a savvy business move? In the first place, there are serious questions about Vick's ability based on his entire career. Then once you consider the way the guy completely fucked his last team, it's so hard to justify that amount of money. I get that people change and you need to give forgiveness sometimes, and that's fine. But that doesn't excuse a lack of caution with a guy who has made another team pay for a similar mistake.

The results of that deal are yet to be seen but it will certainly be interesting to look at it  in hindsight in 10 years.

It all depends on the agreements in place between the retailers and NCSoft.

If however the retailer has an agreement of ""Sell as many as you want and pay for the copies later"" then it's against NCSoft's financial interests to be that generous since they never saw any of the money.","1333239576"

I cannot link to my source.  I am using WestlawNext, which is not free and requires an account.  Any links I gave you would not work.  The reason it is not free is that it gives much more than the text of the statute; it provides cases interpreting each statute, history of each statute, and discussions of statutes/cases provided by Westlaw's staff attorneys.  However, none of that is necessary to see that ""use of force by an aggressor"" is either not part of the ""Stand your ground law,"" or at best an exception to the law.  I don't need any sources for this because all it takes is a plain language reading of the statute.  An aggressor may not stand his ground, but instead must make every reasonable effort to retreat, and may only use self defense when there is no other reasonable way to retreat and the threat of death or serious bodily injury is still imminent.  You have basically been saying an aggressor may invoke ""stand you ground"" so long as he does not stand his ground... like I said, you don't need to be a legal scholar to see the absurdity of that argument.","1333239578"

When I was a teenager, I went through a phase of looking like I was a boy (puppy fat had left, but no boob or hip fat to balance out a strong jaw and big shoulders). Wearing dresses made me look like a boy in a dress, but pants and big jumpers made me look like a cute girl. I just wore feminine touches like sneakers with a lot of metal on them (this was 2004, okay), jumpers with teddy bears on them etc. 

I'd also advise not wearing singlets. Because of the contrast of your shoulder size to the size of the straps, it will make your shoulders look bigger (why insecure men who spend too much time at the gym wear them). If you're looking at dresses, I think cap sleeves and shirt-dresses would create a more feminine look than strapless or spaghetti-strap style. ","1333239579"

Yes a producer does get the Oscar because they're generally in charge of the production, go figure. And while they do have influence, they are still working to complete a work representative of the director's vision and to ensure completion of the film.

A producer can also have a multitude of other meanings. In some cases they aren't even a creative force at all, or in other cases they are entirely creative.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","Although I appreciate you going to such length explaining your argument, I have to point out that it is no different from the usual semantic tricks to try and set atheism on equal footing with the various forms of theism.

First, let's address how you choose to define ""choice."" You seem to be suggesting that, in the boxing match example, the person chooses to believe that Boxer A will beat Boxer B, when that is not actually what happened. First the subject decides to bet on a boxing match. The subject reviewed the evidence in question - in this case various statistics - and reached a logical conclusion based on that evidence, in this case that Boxer A has an increased likelihood of winning. Finally, the subject chooses to bet on this logical conclusion by betting on Boxer A. The actions of betting and reviewing the evidence were predicated on choices, but the actual end conclusion was not in and of itself a choice. The subject chose to follow the evidence, but did not choose where that evidence leads. The subject could even have wanted for Boxer B to win due to personal tastes, but the evidence suggested otherwise. An atheist similarly chooses to examine and follow the evidence wherever it may lead, and ends up at the conclusion that there is no compelling reason to suggest that god(s) exist. But there was never a choice to *be an atheist*.

Next, lets address the common ""atheism is a belief"" refrain. Sure, atheism could arguably be defined as a belief for many people; a belief that there is no compelling evidence to believe in any god-claims. However, this does not somehow put it on even footing with a belief in god(s). Atheism is an answer to the question ""do you believe in god?"" with a negative, a lack of belief in god.

Finally, lets take a look at this whole paragraph, broken down:

&gt; Now to me, I feel it is illogical to believe that everything exists for no reason. 

Two problems right off the bat. First, your feelings on what is logical and what is not are irrelevant, that should go without saying. Saying, I can tell already that you are going to purposely confuse ""no reason"" and ""no purpose."" Moving on, we'll see I was indeed right.

&gt; When reasoning why an apple falls to the floor, the laws of physics provide an answer. 

True, but this does not explain the *reason* for the apple to fall as you are choosing to use the word. The laws of physics, in this case the law of gravity, provides a demonstrable causal relationship between phenomena. The theory of gravity, by contrast, provides an answer to the question of ""how did the apple fall?"" or in other words ""what underlying mechanism caused the apple to fall?"" Neither of these are the same as ""why did the apple fall?""

&gt; When reasoning why everything exists for no reason, logic and a scientific approach tells me that it does not make sense to believe that things to just exist for no reason.

Whew, that was a tough one to read. First, you have failed to adequately explain how you have reached this conclusion that, based on logic and science, things cannot exist without a reason. Second, this is where the whole reason/purpose mix-up becomes problematic. Science shows us the underlying principles of the universe, the cause and effect relationships that occur over time. Scientists are still investigating how this universe came to exist, and there are many different competing theories. Perhaps we shall one day discover that we are simply one universe among a multitude, and that the anthropic principle is the only reason we observe our universe to be the way it is. Or perhaps the underlying laws of quantum mechanics are found to be immutable, and a universe such as ours must inevitably emerge from the quantum bubbling of emptiness. In any case, all such answers would provide a reason for our universe to exist as it does. But it does not provide a *purpose*, nor should it. A purpose assumes a subject with such a purpose, and science does not need that assumption yet.

&gt; If I rule this out, I must then believe that some type of conscious being influenced our existence.

And here's the final big leap. Let's say the universe was caused to exist by some outside of preexisting phenomena. Why does it have to be conscious? Just like the apple is not influenced by our minds to fall down due to gravity, perhaps the universe exists purely due to some a-conscious thing.","1333239588"

"masseffect","t5_2rc19","There's a lot of middle ground between the old Shadow Broker, and the Liara we see (or at least I saw) in ME3. I would actually really like to see her struggle with that, being transformed into a more hardened anti-hero, yet many scenes with her still strike me as a fawning, obsessive child, staring at Shepard in wide-eyed amazement.

I am curious what you mean by her alienating everyone else she knew. Maybe I missed something about her time on Ilum (I haven't read the comics, so I don't know much about her recovering Shepard's body and the like).

I'll also admit to being bitter about how much Liara I felt was shoved into the narrative throughout ME3. I imagine a lot of people would find the scene where she collapses onto her bed in tears after the Asari homeworld to be heart-wrenching and endearing, but I just found it awkward and forced. I can't really reconcile this hysterical child with 'The Shadow Broker' - I feel like we were told she's both, and are expected to just take it on face value, without her actually showing both sides in any capacity. She's just constantly the Ultimate Dorky Sweetheart - which I'm sure a lot of people like.

Thank you for responding, though! I know my opinion of Liara differentiates (often radically) from most other peoples, so I'd enjoy having a dialogue about it.","1333239594"

Most annoying is that it's not just home routers that could cause issues; equipment at your ISP could also be causing a problem, and it would be really difficult to tell (and more difficult to get them to fix it, pretty much all we can do is cross our fingers and hope their techs are competent).

To your second point: Corruption is inherently the many deferring power to the few, which then use their power for their own benefit. It is as such only even possible if power is concentrated into the hands of a few people: to an institution. Clearly to reduce corruption, the powers of institutions should be reduced wherever possible. While preventing powerful new de facto institutions from springing up.

Fortunately there are two usefully distinguishable types of power: executive power and decision-making power. Institutions are great as executive organizations that follow a strict written code, escalating ambiguities to the decision-making branch. The decision-making can then be organized not in terms of an institution like a parliament, but instead like an open forum.

The ideal incorruptible society as given ought to be entirely alien to us today, being devoid of any society-endorsed organizations at all. But we'll know how it's done a lot better by the time baby steps are taken and implemented.","1333239622"

Coding, pre-college, is a largely solitary task. People that are more social are probably less likely to learn coding because the time they use doing that could be better spent hanging out with others. People tend to expect girls to be more social, but that doesn't mean it's *female* peer pressure that's driving them away. The peer pressure that's driving social students away from coding is gender-less, social peer pressure. However, it does appear to disproportionately affect girls, at least anecdotally. 

Good thoughts.

Make sure to makes list of all the downloaded xbl arcade games so you can redownload them later with out all the fuss over which ones you have bought already. The other option is to forget about those games and if you never download them again, that means it was a waste of ms points and isonly taking up hard drive space but alas I digress. Continuing on, once you have back up all your important crap, next is to format all your useless crap. After that just run mw3 and redownload all the updates and maps and enjoy your day.

I think this could be dealt with by appropriate regulation.

"Catacombs","t5_2t5r5","&gt;This is a ridiculous conversation, and so much Judiazing.
Can I find a passage where YHWH comes down and speaks about a new covenant? No, I can't. 

How odd that you would find it peculiar that the God of Israel would engage in ""Judiazing"" in the *Hebrew scriptures*, of all things. To be perfectly frank, I think your interpretation is groundless sine you cannot find even one supporting verse, and that the end is to Hellenize the scriptures.

&gt;That said, I can find plenty of passages with Apostles talking about it, and I certainly believe that God was speaking through them (as he would through ANY prophet)

Yhwh gave criteria for prophets, also. If they are wrong about one thing they cannot be prophets. Yet the apostle of which you speak saw Jesus three years after Jesus said that no one would see him, and to believe no one who claimed to have seen him, and that when he would return it would be at the end of time for everybody to see. Also that so-called prophet clamored against Yhwh, saying that Yah's instructions were moot solely by his own authority. If you wish to follow false prophets, you may. However Yhwh gave his criteria. Choose today who you will follow.

&gt;But you've gone and barred those passages from the conversation for no good reason other than you don't accept their testimony.

Only because their testimony contradict other testimonies explicitly, many of the books are counterfeit (Peter's epistles speak of issues that took place after his lifetime), others are by men who anointed themselves and testified to themselves. Should we accept any prophet that comes along? Why do you reject Joseph Smith? Why can't we cite him?

Because he's failed to meet the criteria of Yhwh, and he speaks by his own authority, and his sayings contradict the prophets we know and the God we know.

&gt;So you won't accept the overwhelming testimony on the Apostles and Church history on these matters. 

Why should I? Who are they?

&gt;But don't pretend like you even follow all 613 commandments in the Old Testament.

It is written, ""Judge not, lest ye be judged.""

&gt;You can't even offer sacrifices for the laws you do break!

I'm not a high priest..although there was one who was anointed for such tasks.

It is written, ""For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice, and in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.""

&gt;Rebuild the temple and reinstate the animal sacrifices if that suits you, but this conversation is ridiculously skewed if you've barred entire swathes of evidence from the table simply because you don't accept them.

It is written: ""On the evidence of two witnesses or three witnesses a matter shall be established."" Yet you bring forward only one witness, a self-proclaimed apostle and murderer, and he is a witness against the covenant and instructions of God. And you rebuke me for not accepting such a testimony?

&gt;Feel free to put yourself under the law.

I'll trust in the good character of my God and in the wisdom of his instructions any day.

&gt;As for me (and the rest of Christendom), I'm under the law of grace. 

So you say, asserting that Yhwh's wisdom and instructions were not his grace, nor his son, only the revoking of his Word, through celebrating the death of his son.","1333239679"

If you are not free to go, you have been arrested. The cop does not have to say that you are under arrest for you to have been arrested. This is important because if the cop has no reason to ""detain"" you, you can sue him for false arrest.

My username doesn't state that large breasts are a necessity for making one attractive to the opposite sex. In fact, it doesn't say that breasts have to be large to fix everything, either. And people with breasts are not automatically stupid, either.  

Furthermore, when I said, ""interesting, witty, etc etc"" I never said they couldn't ALSO be physically attractive by some attributes.  JUST being physically attractive with nothing else to add doesn't make a person a good candidate for a long term relationship, IMHO.","1333239680"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","The problem with this story is it frequently gets bandied about on /tg/ as a sort of carte blanche excuse for all sorts of RP shennanigans that justify otherwise really unpleasant gameplay. It's sort of an ends-justify-the-means anecdote.

Obviously if that works for your group, that's awesome, but I feel confident in saying that's probably not the ""average"" preference. Furthermore, ""that guy"" is a term frequently used to refer to the one guy who ruins games; the guy who makes you second guess even attending at all, the one who holds up the game for twenty minutes to rules lawyer, the one who just doesn't ""click"" with the group. You never want a ""that guy"". He makes the game shitty.

And every time I read this story I come to the same conclusion TryUsingScience did. Tabletopping is so often more about the journey than the destination, especially given how fickle the dice can be at crucial moments. This story inverts that; it doesn't matter that the game sucked for a year, the ending was awesome.

People are going to disagree on where the value should be placed, whether it's the game itself or the conclusion (and it need be placed on one or the other in this case, because this is such an extreme example.) Ultimately what it comes down to, in my opinion, is that the ""Paladin"" was making the other players have a lot less fun than they should have otherwise. No reveal is worth that.

This is a nice story of a single group's experience, and as long as it stays just that then I'm totally cool with it. I'd really rather not see it become a popular habit among the RPG community, though. I see it like heavily erotic gaming. Sure, if everybody's totally comfortable with it and that's their thing then there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. On the same token I think it's reasonable to assume that that sort of thing isn't going to be going on in your average game, and you shouldn't expect it or be particularly okay with it without some pretty blatant forewarning.","1333239705"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Blizzard's point is that there are already in-game cheats for infinite resources. However, they shut off your ability to earn achievements. Therefore, the only purpose for using third party trainers to get infinite resources is to circumvent the no-achievement facet of Blizzard's built in cheats.

I don't think achievements are super important and I don't really care if people are cheating their way to them in all honesty, but I understand Blizz's point that it might devalue those achievements for people that legitimately earned them. In light of the fact that some people actually are upset about people cheating their way to these achievements, and the fact that if all these people wanted was to play with infinite resources or what have you they could do it without using trainers, I can see the logic. I don't see how that's an argument for trainers at all, really.

Now, if people were using trainers for some other purpose that was not hurting anyone in multiplayer and was not provided by Blizzard, that would be a much better argument.","1333239711"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Okay, so everything he does is justified, and the girlfriend is completely in the wrong, *how do you propopse* they both act about it? Should the girlfriend decide to have the child simply because of OP's feelings? Would that be fair? Is it entirely OK for the OP to throw out his girlfriend after she's just had an abortion?

Also, look up what an ultimatum is. The girlfriend is not issuing an ultimatum by making a decision. The idea is so ridiculous I don't know where to begin.
She has the responsibility, yes. Is that an advantage? Hell no. It just adds pressure, stress and guilt.

&gt;Pregnancy affects both partners. Some choose to run from it, others want it and here the OP wants it.

Yep. He wants it. And he can have a child as soon as he finds a girl that wants to, but not this girl. She's got feelings, and thoughts, and plan for the future that doesn't line up with having a baby now. It's not fair that she should give up her life for this mans want of a child.
** TL;DR: It takes two to tango.**

&gt;Yet the OP is the one who lacks empathy because he doesn't want to continue on with the relationship after the abortion? Please. If that's your argument you fail to even notice that the GF also lacks empathy for not taking into account the OP's feelings and hiding the pregnancy for upto 3 weeks.

I see we're on the assumption train! Let me assume some too!
What if she DID take his feelings into account, but her NOT wanting a baby was enough to override his want of a child? And what if we assume that she in fact wanted to tell him, but was afraid he'd react with dissapproval (like he very much did)?

Setting an ultimatum indicates that you are a bad partner. Good partners compromise, bad partners set ultimatums. There are rare exceptions of this rule, this is not one. I'm not saying OP isn't allowed to leave her. But he shouldn't decide to end the relationship over one single thing, that puts her in a risky and pressured position. That's not what good partners do.

But yes, go ahead and call me unobservant. Your view is far superior. I'll just disregard reason, and the fact that you're overly biased towards the OP and taking assumptions for fact.","1333239712"

I've worked at the express line a few times and we're allowed to help people with more than the limit when we're not busy. They sent a woman with a cart full of groceries through and since I don't bag on that lane I was putting her stuff through in under a minute, about 3/4 of the way through a guy comes over, dumps his basket of stuff on the end of the lane and flips the woman the bird. He was only in line for about 30 seconds before he couldn't handle the ""wait"" anymore. 

I've also seen a customer freak out around Christmas time when a fellow cashier was working after her shift ended due to a massive rush. The managers quickly shut down her lane and sent the people trying to line up afterwards to another check out. A man who was trying to line up with her leaves his cart, yells at the cashier and leaves.

For many purposes, pseudo-random number generators are actually preferable, because the random numbers they generate can be repeated if so desired. For example, if you run a monte-carlo simulation and you end up with an unexpected result, you can redo the same simulation in debug mode and arrive at the same program state.

A second interesting thing to consider is that most modern operating systems have access to sources of randomness from the outside world; for example, the precise time at which network packets and keystrokes are received are quite random insofar as the computer are concerned, and can be used to build up a pool of random bits.

If you have access to a linux computer, read ""man urandom"" for more information.

&gt;A stand-your-ground law states that a person may use deadly force in self-defense when there is reasonable belief of a threat, without an obligation to retreat first.

[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-your-ground_law)

&gt;A Castle Doctrine (also known as a Castle Law or a Defense of Habitation Law) is an American legal doctrine that designates a person's abode (or, in some states, any place legally occupied, such as a car or place of work) as a place in which the person has certain protections and immunities and may in certain circumstances attack an intruder without becoming liable to prosecution.

[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_doctrine)

Castle doctrine relates to self defense **within one's own home.**

Unless zimmerman owned the sidewalk/street trayvon was walking on, you're talking out your ass.

The stand your ground law is a worthless piece of litigation created to give people the right to attack others based off the idea of a perceived threat.

There is a huge difference between defending yourself in your own house and going into public and shooting people down because you think they're going to hurt you.

Also, I'd suggest given the lynch mob the media has created with this case you quit forming your opinions from ""news"" headlines.","1333239732"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; ""man-whore"" is much less widespread and is often used jokingly.

I've heard it used as a legitimate insult many times, too. I've also heard ""slut"" used jokingly a lot - that doesn't negate the times when it is used offensively. That's just you trying to minimize it so that you can still pretend there's a double-standard.

&gt; ""virgin-shaming"" is problematic too, and definitely sexist. I'm not sure what point you're trying to make by mentioning that.

Because you said there is a double-standard. There is not. Both sexes are judged based on their sex lives, whether it's slut-shaming or virgin-shaming.

&gt; why did you even bring this up? It is not at all related to the original insult.

Another definition on that site:

""one who uses the male penis of another as a mode of transportation willfully to gain social or **financial status** with no regard of self itegrity or how they are percieved by others.""

That's very relevant.

Also:

&gt; Slut is definitely a problematic word that upholds a double standard since the corresponding word for men, ""player"", has positive connotations. So yes, calling one girl a slut is sexist.

Since there **isn't** a double-standard, it is not inherently sexist as you claim.","1333239737"

"community","t5_2qu49","I think what happens is that the writers and actors will experiment with the characters and try out different styles and situations for the characters. When one of those experiments works very well, the fan community vocalizes it and latches on, and the writers and actors know to continue with stuff in that trend in the future. That's largely why we saw Troy quickly grow out of being a jock and into a bit of a super nerd.

But when the fan community doesn't vocalize that they love something, I think that the writers choose to move on and continue experimenting in the hopes that they find something. I love Pierce and Chang, but not as much as Troy or Abed (or Annie or Britta or Jeff), and even though I enjoyed Pierce's arc in the second season, I didn't love it enough to vocalize to the writers that Pierce should continue in that direction (and as you pointed out, this was probably for the best). It's not that the writers don't have an understanding of who these characters are, its just that its a matter of putting the focus on one aspect of that character or another.

So while Troy and Abed have become fan favourites, and the writers have curbed the show to utilize them and their quirkiness more, characters like Pierce and Chang are still in that experimenting stage, and thus have been left behind a bit while the other characters have flourished.","1333239743"
"CCW","t5_2s4mc","Sigs aren't necessarily the best choice for CCW.  While they are great guns, most of them tend to be thick (exceptions being the P239 and, to an extent, the P225) and heavy.

All of these previously named guns are DA/SA.

I haven't been much of a fan of the P250 series.  I might recommend the P238 (.380), but you said you were getting tired of 1911-style guns so that is probably out.  There are various other models, too, that I can't think of off the top of my head that you might enjoy.

"Dogtraining","t5_2r067","If your dog is purposely avoiding looking at you she may be ['calming you'](http://www.canis.no/rugaas/onearticle.php?artid=1). Of course it may just be that outdoors is too exciting - in fact most dogs won't generalize things they know indoors to outdoors very quickly. You have to get it solid inside and work up to more distractions very slowly.

Teach attention to handler indoors. Have training sessions and wait until you get eye contact then click or 'yes!' and reward (probably with high value food). If you aren't getting anything close to eye contact, shape it. So reward for facing the right general direction, etc.

In a non-distracting environment try this game. Walk 5 feet with her on leash then stop and click or say 'yes!' and reward. Don't even expect anything of the dog just give a treat. You'll find soon that the dog is keeping an ear on you at least. Move to longer distances and more distracting environments slowly. Combine this with attention to handler exercises and you should eventually have a dog who defaults to looking at you if you stop walking.

Also, be patient and don't walk if the dog is pulling (or walk in the other direction.) The book *Control Unleashed* might be helpful for getting attention. The author, Leslie McDevitt, teaches agility through positive reinforcement and it's largely a book about teaching focus with distractions.","1333239745"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Actually, the biggest problem with airships isn't really speed.  A solar-powered airship using modern available materials and equipment would max out at around highway speed.  Not breaking any speed records, but you could travel in comfort for about the same price as going by car (counting accommodations and meals) slightly faster.  Of course this couldn't compete with a high speed rail system, but it can go over water.  In terms of speed it can't compete with an airplane, but it has the potential to be much cheaper and carry far more weight (there is no theoretical upper limit on airship size, they don't get less efficient like planes do).  In short, airships would be at least competitive with cruise ships and freighters, with the bonus of going over land and sea with equal ease.

Weather effects aren't really hazards to airships, save in very rare circumstances.  Like planes they have the potential to fly over hazardous weather.  The incredible success rate of U.S. and U.K. combat airships during the World Wars is evidence of their potential safety rating.

No the dangers of conventional airships is in take-off and landing.  You see, helium is expensive (hence the use of hydrogen in the Hindenburg, although other factors did contribute to how fast the fire spread in that case) so instead of venting lifting gas, modern airships remain lighter than air at ground level.  This makes ground handling extremely complicated and requires special mooring equipment that is quite uncommon.  They are prone to ""weathercocking"" or spinning around their single mooring mast.  Lifting due to gusts is also known to happen, and no effective means of controlling a massive, lighter-than-air vehicle by ground personnel has been found.

There are ways around this, though.  Heliostats combine airships with helicopters, using rotors to offset payload weight and produce lift, so the helium envelope only offsets the empty weight of the vehicle itself (net zero weight empty at ground).  Similarly some airships are designed with airfoil shapes so that they generate lift by forward motion like planes, achieving the same benefit.","1333239748"

"computing","t5_2qx6z","There isn't time to learn a new language well enough to be successful.  The sort of programs you'll be expected to write won't take THAT much longer in Java than in a scripting language.  Just google something along the lines of ""useful programming competition problems in java"" and see what comes up.  

Stuff I've had to write has involved String operations, converting a number from base m to base n where m and n are defined by the user, and other things that don't involve complex language, but are pretty specific algorithms.  The actual practical bits don't *usually* get into data structures and stuff like that, but if it's a Java competition you want to familiarize yourself with Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract classes, and all the boring stuff that is in your AP textbook and left you scratching your head asking, ""When will I EVER need to use this?""

Also, there's a lot of syntax stuff that sometimes people like to throw in the quiz portions.  Stuff like:
    What would the following code segment output?
    String x=""A day at the races.""
    int y = x.indexOf(""a"", 4);
    System.out.println(y==-1 ? ""String not found"" : y);
Or other little syntactic tricks that you don't NEED to know but are interesting parts of the Java language.

The point of socialized healthcare isn't actually efficiency, but a moral narrative which says that we're responsible for our neighbors. Although the socialized healthcare in Britain has been having significant trouble I have some first hand experience observing the Canadian healthcare system.

I'm a graduate student currently living in Canada (from the U.S.) and people here must wait months in between specialist visits for a single injury. My Canadian friend had to go through a tremendous rigmarole of calling up doctors in other provinces and numerous doctor visits over the span of half a year only to have Doctors decide that they weren't going to actually do anything about his leg injury. Meanwhile Canadian healthcare sectors which are unregulated (free), such as plastic surgery, can schedule you and provide service within a week. On top of this, they're having significant problems maintaining their supply of cheap generic drugs. Although it's worth noting we're having similar problems in the U.S. (see linked article). Living here has given me many concrete examples of how increased government regulations harm people from day to day.

http://blog.aynrandcenter.org/shortage-of-drugs-abundance-of-regulations/

On the issue of coexistence or nonviolence, I often think that people who disagree with me are uneducated, foolish, stupid, and just plain wrong. As an example, I'm not only an atheist, but I believe that religious beliefs are harmful. Nonetheless, I do not presume to have the right to presume to tell people what beliefs they may and may not act on, short of violating the autonomy of other people.

If the 80% vote to provide healthcare to the 20% which opts out, that's the right of the 80%, but not the right of the 20%. There's nothing wrong with generosity. I'm not against universal healthcare, cooperation, generosity, or any of those good things. I'm against the evil of using the law to make people who disagree obey, especially when it is unnecessary.","1333239754"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm a pharmacist and to be fair a lot of people (re: most people) don't understand what is going on with your prescription. I will admit it as a patient to a pharmacy, it is annoying to not get acknowledged. But, the pharmacist is doing the job of managing phone calls/checking drug interactions/dealing with insurance issues/following up with MDs for errors or clarifications. It's a job that demands a lot of multi-tasking and it never really gives up. 

What most people don't know is that companies like Walgreens and CVS put a lot of pressure on their pharmacists. They monitor pretty much everything. How many rings does it take for you to answer a phone call, if you tell a person to ""wait"" for a prescription can you fill it ten minutes,  total prescription volume etc etc. I don't think the current retail model is conducive to a quality experience. Where we are respected as surrogates in a patient's care. And that is probably entirely the fault of the business plan and the company ragging on its staff rather than the people involved. 
I only worked retail pharmacy for six months and I informed every single patient that it would take two hours to fill their prescription. At the end of the day it's medicine, not fast food and a mistake could be pretty damn harmful. ","1333239756"

It breaks the fourth wall in the greatest way possible. Here we have a videogame with a story revolving around the indoctrination and manipulation of its characters, and in the end even the player isn't safe from it.

It was a really good representation of the whole process and I think that more people should be exposed to their stories.

Find reasons to feel good about yourself, no matter how tiny they may seem. This may seem cliched, but it works. Write down things you like about yourself. Even if you can only think of a few, or even one. Try as hard as you can to think of as many as possible. Think about what you take pride in. Then when you have the traits you like about yourself, practice focusing on them and noticing them, and putting them to use.

The next step after that is to do productive things. Whatever nagging tasks you have... even small things like personal hygiene and cleaning your living space... get them done.

I think you and I have similar views as  in we both don't think the question is an answerable one.  Your view may be slightly different but I feel at the core its the same.  Maybe thats why I identify as agnostic and you do not.  The way I have always identified what people could be is based on the answer to ""Is there a god?"" . Those that said no were atheist, yes were theist then agnostic would be indecisive in different ways.  Atheist agnostics would say there probably isn't a god but its possible.  Theist agnostics would say their is a god but there is no way to prove it and its possible there isn't(or something to that effect).  Then the more open definition of Agnostics you think both are equally possible or ""that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify the belief that deities either do or do not exist.

I guess my question is what would you call someone who would say that they do not believe in god(s)? I'm not trying to prove you wrong but more to understand the viewpoint and why an atheist can't be someone who lacks belief and someone who does not believe.  ","1333239774"

Because they worship the almighty dollar, the very idea of user created content for existing games cannot be allowed.

A perfect example from personal experience: I have SFIV for PC and enjoyed the costume edits done by the community a whole lot more than the DLC costumes Capcom released; it must have pissed them off that we were able to experience another level of enjoyment to their game without giving them extra cash for it.

My parents never really had any hobbies, they were always too busy with us kids or their chores to have any fun. So I have no idea what to do there.

My long term goal has always been to get the best education I can get, in the field I am least likely to hate doing in 10 years, and now that I'll soon be finished with that, I have no idea what to do. I also used to play football, play in an orchestra (which I kind of never really liked), but my passion for these things just kind of died out over the years, and I never found something new.

"TheLastAirbender","t5_2rybx","If Amon can energybend (and based off the similar eye movements of that one bender to Ozai's when his powers were taken, I think he can), I think it would be pretty interesting if the season finale of the first season (there are going to be two, right?) ended with Korra going to fight Amon before she has mastered Airbending with Tenzin saying that without having developed her spiritual connection to it, she isn't ready.  The fight does not go well, Amon energybends her, and she almost resists, but her lack of ""spiritual fortitude"" results in the loss of her powers.  Season Two would obviously see the return of those powers as she comes to see the importance of bending going beyond just the power to fight.  I think such a storyline mirrors Aang's defeat by Azula at Ba Sing Se in his own impatience to end the war, yet contrasts it as he lacked power and had great spiritual fortitude, while Korra has great strength and lacks spiritual fortitude.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Someone accidentally shoot those kids.

Seriously though - that must take some huge balls to come forward and make this accusation when you know for a fact that the US military who is running the country will happily execute you for that sort of statement.  After all they executed the other dozen or so people just as reprisal for a road side bomb that none of the dead people had anything to do with.

Executing a bunch of locals as reprisal for a road side bomb appears to be standard orders for the US forces, but usually it happens immediately after the explosion so that the soldiers can claim they were firing on hostiles.  Of course the people who plant the bomb don't exactly hang around to get caught.  The reprisals help to terrorize the population into policing their own locales to prevent road side bombs.

If the kids are telling the truth 15-20 US soldiers were involved in this deliberate act of murder against unarmed civilians.  Obviously an operation like that would have to be policy not the work of ""a few bad apples"".

ETA:
Apparently someone didn't understand me, so I'll re-emphasise the reason for the policy:
&gt; The reprisals help to terrorize the population into policing their own locales to prevent road side bombs.

It's collective punishment.  It's a war crime but it's a strategy all occupiers use.  When someone from the population hurts you then you kill a bunch of random civilians.  The Nazis I believe used a 100 for 1 ratio.  The idea is to terrorise the population into policing themselves and thus preventing more acts of rebellion.  It's perfectly rational.  Just incredibly evil.  This is what it means to run a military occupation.","1333239811"

For my own sanity, I hope you're a troll. 

FWIW, here's some actual data that may make you think about your uninformed opinion regarding who is getting abortions:

&gt;""One common reason women give for terminating unintended pregnancies is that having a baby would **prevent them from achieving goals such as pursuing an education.** Patterns in abortion indices by educational attainment may be due, in part, to educational goals. For example, the fact that **women with some college education were more likely than all women to have an abortion** (as suggested by an abortion index of 1.21) may reflect that these women were in school or hoping to complete their schooling, and having a baby would have prevented them from achieving this goal.

Additionally, 58% of women obtaining abortions were above the poverty line. Quite a number were considered ""low income"" but as the majority were in their 20s, it is possible that it is due to being a student (as women in college were the highest proportion of those obtaining abortions).  57% of women paid out-of-pocket for their abortions. 

Given, they do also discuss in this article that women of low SES and minority women are overrepresented. However, It is still important to note that over half (~60%) either have some college or a college degree as well. 

With that said, women who obtain abortions have the capacity to realize that they aren't ready to take care of a child (or another child). That's being responsible. 

All statistics were obtained via the [2008 report from the Guttmacher Institute](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guttmacher.org%2Fpubs%2FUS-Abortion-Patients.pdf&amp;ei=76B3T6nCKYX10gH7npzgDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5ZX0RzDp7Avuc2hmhcbtC2K4HtA).

People who intend to enter a monogamous marriage in the future who go around having sex with lots of people they don't think is THE one are cheating their future partner. It's a loophole that fools a lot of people as they're ""technically"" not cheating. But it's the same thing. It only fools the ones who want to be fooled. 

I didn't run around screwing everyone I could in college. Or after college. I refused to have sex with my now-wife for months when we started dating, even though she tried, because I wasn't very sure at the time I intended to marry her in the future. I use that criteria for every person I have sex with, and I regret every person I had sex with that I didn't end up marrying. It was a failure in prediction or in the relationship and I became a less desirable monogamous mate as a result. 

Edit: Maybe he just wants to get his ""swerve"" on. If it's no big deal then it's no big deal. 

Edit2: The desire is natural. No one claimed otherwise. That doesn't mean the action is automatically fine. His desire to cheat is natural as well. Again, that is irrelevant to whether or not it is okay to do. ","1333239833"

The longer it has been in 12/12, the more stressful it'll be on the plant, and is more likely to herm the plant. In this context, re-veg would mean sexing the plants then putting them back on your veg cycle. I don't condone this. 

And yes, you can harvest a plant and re-veg it. However, you will need to transplant what's left and make sure you leave foliage on to help the transition. This can take a long-ass time, like 3 weeks.

Is he culpable for the Klan's past acts of violence? I believe that even though he is not criminally responsible for acts that occurred before he joined, he is morally culpable for joining the Klan. The Klan has blood on its hands, and anyone who joins must share the guilt. So, too, with the homosexual movement.

That is, these groups would not let anyone into the sorority or fraternity whose skin tone was darker than that of a paper lunch bag, in order to maintain a perception of standards. Spike Lee's film School Daze satirized this practice at historically black colleges and universities.

Along with the ""paper bag test,"" guidelines for acceptance among the lighter ranks included the ""comb test,"" which tested the coarseness of one's hair, and the ""flashlight test,"" which tested a person's profile to make sure their features measured up or were close enough to those of the Caucasian race.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","&gt; Then there is the account that child witnesses provided Yalda Hakim, a journalist for SBS Dateline in Australia. Hakim, who was born in Afghanistan and immigrated to Australia as a child, is the first international journalist to interview the surviving witnesses. She said American investigators tried to prevent her from interviewing the children, saying her questions could traumatize them. She said she appealed to village leaders, who arranged for her to interview the witnesses.

&gt; In the video, the children told Hakim that other Americans were present during the rampage, holding flashlights in the yard.

&gt; Noorbinak, 8, told Hakim that the shooter first shot her father’s dog. Then, Noorbinak said in the video, he shot her father in the foot and dragged her mother by the hair. When her father started screaming, he shot her father, the child says. Then he turned the gun on Noorbinak and shot her in the leg. 

&gt; “One man entered the room and the others were standing in the yard, holding lights,” Noorbinak said in the video.

guide is well done, only thing i might wanne mention is team setup. i personally feel that lulu mid is going to make bot lane difficult. to go for a 2nd support char might leave the team with insufficient dmg output. sure lulu does dmg with that gear, does not have a brand like ""umph""-ultimate to bring to teamfights.

However, if the comp sci major and the art history major both applied to work in some non-technical entry level position, one might not have a major advantage over the other.

Just remember, it isn't the end of the world if you don't get to do EXACTLY what you wanted to do out of school. If you have some long term dream, you don't have to give up on it.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","My response to this is that, of course there are violent atheists.  Human nature is violent at times and nothing can stop that from happening.  (Not discussing this topic in specific, but less specific events of atheists doing violence, due to the information given by Emme E.)

It all boils down to one simple thing:
Show me the book with the title: ""Doctrine of atheism"".  Maybe it exists, maybe not.  It's not important; how many atheists adhere to this book?  Just about nobody.  Atheism is just a definition, nothing else.  You need more specific disclaimers such as ""humanism"", ""communism"" and so on that does contain elements of morality, creeds and doctrines that are agreed upon by more people.  In fact, atheism is a little like pure deism.  One believes there is no god, the other believes there is a god, nothing more than that.  *http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism
It's when you go into the details that you find the difference:
Communism is atheist, but atheism isn't communist.  Christianity is deist, but deism isn't christian.  See the difference?

Also, show me the masses.  The problem for a christian is that they might not agree to the pope.  But they both read the same book.  They agreed that this book is the guideline for their morality.  If you criticize the actions of the pope, you cannot avoid criticizing your own faith.
Now.  Stalin was an atheist.  But did we reed the same book, the same creed?  No.  I'm not a communist.  If I WAS a communist (a generalization is necessary here, there's many types of communism), I might not agree with what stalin did, but I need to admit, we read the same damn thing.
We can do nothing about human nature, but we can do a lot to bring about reason and a more flexible and less doctrinal morality.  People change, morals change.

Atheists doesn't and shouldn't claim absolute morality, the same way theists shouldn't claim it either.  Some do claim it, but what the heck, let's just be better people, shall we?","1333239909"

You are not being banned because Origin or Bioware hate how awesome mods are, you are being banned for hacking their source code which is a valuable IP and asset of the company, an asset that investors will look at and judge its robustness. Then, based on that, decide how much money to invest.","1333239918"

It shows professionalism and even if you are over dressed, it's always better to be over dressed rather than under dressed. Even if the interviewer says something like you didn't have to wear a suit, just say that you felt it was appropriate to wear for the interview and maybe even ask how the plant managers normally dress.

"apple","t5_2qh1f","Well on purely video front, apps would allow Plex, Xbmc to create applications the streamed directly to the apple tv. It would let me steam my own local media without having to use iTunes. Also, allow any service to create video channels in apple tv, which would add more content.  

While I have never tried this, without tactile feedback, I would imagine you cant really completely focus on what's going on the tv while interacting with a iOS device (unless you only use accelerometer). 

Like people mentioned before, you can mirror with AirPlay, but all it does for apps current is act as a wifi VGA cable, right? The applications are also optimized for iOS aspect ratios, not TV so the UI isn't quite as fitting as it could be. 

I imagine the two main contributions to the app ecosystem for apple tv would be video content and games. I can't believe apple wouldn't make a killing selling console quality games. Consider that the iPad graphics are better than the Wii, and have the potential for similar game formats (all the hardware is there). 

After all, Microsoft did enter the console market with no history and look where they are now. I'd say apple has a substantial advantage in terms of people invested in their platforms, willing to spend money for quality, and hundreds if not thousands of game studios. ","1333239921"

"canada","t5_2qh68","I could not care less about the so-called plight of people working in restaurants.  I've had more than a fair share of shitty minimum wage jobs (none of which ever offered tips), and I've also worked in the kitchen of a very upscale restaurant.  I never saw a dime in tips when I worked in the kitchen (I know this isn't the norm) despite working as hard as or harder than the waitresses, and for longer hours.  Even now I work longer hours than most waitresses, and earn less year on year.  So why the hell should I pity them when I have even less money than they do, and work just as hard?

The obligation to tip simply because a waitress/waiter did their job (i.e. brought you food) is ridiculous and only done because of cultural inertia.  I'll tip if people make an extra effort, not because some stupid outdated custom tells me I have to, even when the service I got was nothing special.

And waitresses don't have to tip out to the kitchen unless they actually makes tips.  If they make less in a night, they give less to the kitchen.  It's not as though the restaurant will dip into their wages to pay the kitchen extra, *when the kitchen staff make the regular minimum wage* (i.e. more per hour base pay than a server does).

As soon as I started talking to the kids the father comes over and tells me that if his kids aren't hurting anyone I should let them do what they want. I told him the reason they weren't allowed was because if they got hurt, we couldn't see them to help them and if he has a problem with it he could leave. He told me he would and at almost the same moment one of his kids got hit in the head by the dock because someone walked across it, guess who had to save the kid.","1333239940"

Effectively increasing the damage the player takes can range from pretty good to god awful depending on how much. It's good if the player normally doesn't take enough damage (rocket to the face-&gt; doesn't die).

Effectively increasing the number of enemies could range from pretty good to god awful to it doesn't even work. Good if the number of enemies forces the player to rethink their strategy.

Effectively reducing the player's resources can work well or not so well. Fewer grenades could mean you have to take a different from normal approach at times. This is good.

Effectively changing the gameplay tends to work pretty well, but some might dislike the changes. For instance, tweak the level design, tweak the behaviour, tweak the enemies and how they show up (ex: ambushes, diversified groups).","1333239941"

All of them have absolutely great sprint speed and acceleration (~90 each). What he does when he breaks my attack is, and I don't mean mostly, I mean EVERY FUCKING SECOND, lobs it as far ahead as he can. With the speed of his attackers, 1 time out of 10 he's bound to get it, and then he crosses. That's it, nothing more.

"NFLOffTopic","t5_2ttcc","Everything Zach Snyder has ever done. He has no idea how to tell a story and seems to care only about the peripheral parts of movies. Sure some of his effects and costumes look cool, but I never give a shit about the characters who use those things. His movies are only ever bearable if he is retelling already brilliant stories.  
  
Example: *Watchmen* is the greatest comic series ever written (and I might even assert it to be the best thing written in the 20^th century). I love that comic, I even wrote a [long ass post about it](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/rgtfu/concerning_the_film_watchmen/c45rbu9) the other day because I see it as the kind of story that is so perfectly deep and vague that a reader is free to imprint a near limitless amount of meanings onto it and always be right. Snyder's movie? It was alright, worth seeing if you're into action movies but nothing special. This is because Snyder took on a story that was too big for him and largely failed to convey any of the important themes or any of the reasons we should be emotionally invested in these characters. He showed us how cool it is to (**SPOILER**) blow up New York City, but he couldn't show why we should care about a single one of those deaths.

i was good at it and was invited to stay over the summer to earn money for next year's tuition, and i accepted. we would handle walk-ins and calls, so one day i get a call from a visiting professor who is, by his own account, a *very* important man doing *seminal* research. he says he has a very important message from a research associate but ""i can't get into my email"".

no problem i tell him, and start walking him through the troubleshooting steps; the script i'd developed solved 95% of problems people would call in about, and it's almost always one of the first few simple things. after going through the first two steps, about 30 seconds into the call, he gets frustrated and says, look, you're treating me like a child, of course this isn't the problem, can you please get to the real problem and stop treating me like an idiot.

ok, i explain, i can shortcut things if he knows what he's doing, no worries. but i want to make sure we don't skip something just in case that's the solution. instead of walking him through every click, i ask if he knows if his tcp/ip settings are correct, etc. with this first question, he gets incensed. _now you're just being difficult, how am i supposed to know what tcp/ip settings are?_

no problem, let me walk you through how to check them. _no_, he says, _you're just toying with me because you can tell a learned professor what to do._ then he gets surprisingly abusive...no swearing, but carries on for a bit about how i don't know what i'm doing and how this is my big chance to get back at my professors because i blame my low grades on them and other such nonsense.

i assure him that i do know what i'm talking about and i will solve his problem if he works with me. _ok, go ahead_, he says, seeing that no matter what he does, i'm just focused on solving the problem and don't really care about any of the other stuff he said. (this is a thing i would do a lot on phone support. i would basically ignore everything a person said if it wasn't contributing to a solution. it was like a game to see how much info i could extract out of each person that called, the more difficult the person, the more challenging the game.)

ok, i say, click here, click this, hit that, what's it say...

after a few more minutes, he explodes. _you're treating me like an idiot again telling me to click things that are obvious! and you obviously don't know what you're doing! i won't be talked down to like this! get me a supervisor!_

ok, i say, i put the supervisor on 3-way and let the prof know.

the prof carries on for a bit and the supervisor says, yes, sir, i understand, but listen: i'm a manager. i don't actually know how to solve your problem. no one here does except severoon and you're already talking to him. this is university software and this is the university software support line and severoon is the one on this shift. so there's no one else in the world that can help you right now. how important is this email? how badly do you need to get your email working?

i can literally hear his face fall over the phone. he may as well have said out loud, ""i've made a huge mistake"" (gob.jpeg). the supervisor hangs up and the prof says, defeated, _ok, what do you want to know?_

i smile and say: just now on the phone with my boss, you said i didn't know how some of this networking stuff worked. tell me, what _specifically_ do i not know? please be complete because i want to make sure i fill in the gaps in my knowledge and this will help me greatly. once i feel i understand your complaint in enough detail to remedy my ignorance, we'll get to your email problem. how's that sound?

i must have let the line hang for 15 solid seconds of silence before he said, ""look, i'm just having a really bad day. none of that stuff was true that i said, and i'm sorry. please feel free to put your supervisor back on so i can tell him the same thing.""

i said, no, that won't be necessary, and if i can't solve his problem on the phone then i will get on my bike and ride over to his office (on campus about a mile away) and solve his issue in person, but i won't stop working on it until it's solved.

his problem turned out to be the second thing on my checklist.

"LucidDreaming","t5_2r0f4","&gt;What should I do with my eyes?

What I find works well is to look at the back of your eyelids as your eyes are closed. Looking almost as if they are open. After a while you will start getting hypnogogic imagery. You can go right into a dream directly from this imagery if you keep at it.

&gt;What do I think about during WILD? When I don't think about anything particular I just fall asleep.. And when I do think about something I don't fall asleep, but don't go into SP either.

If you are doing the above eye technique, you think about what you are seeing with your eyes. If you are doing a ""body technique"", like 61 point relaxation, you think about what you are feeling with your body.

&gt;Do I need to keep my mind completely awake and alert, or do I need to get my mind in a dreamy state?

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","**EDITED:**  I now understand that I'm totally wrong!  Sorry for the misinformation, everyone, but thanks for clearing it up.  I'll leave my original post here though, in case that theory of filming/setting is of any interest to folks.  

It's my understanding that the show is not trying to be set in any one particular place or setting.  They are using Portland to shoot because we have a very cool setting, landscapes, and weather that look great on film for the type of story they're trying to create but it is not supposed to be 'set' here.  So it would make sense that it could look a little 'bland' in terms of being Portland-y, because they are purposefully not using anything too distinct or recognizable so that the storyline has a feeling of 'everywhere' or 'this could be happening in your town too.'  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, as I actually haven't seen too many full episodes.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Thank you. The image of baby seals being clubbed is merely hyperbole. They're used by animal rights groups BECAUSE THEY'RE CUTE. We club the fully adult ones, it's a culling of the herd and an ecological necessity. Polar bears are dying off, which are one of their only natural predators (there are whales, wolves and sharks but they're all endangered as well) and the fish stocks are nowhere near they need to be to support the seal population. The fish stocks that we overfished and are now trying to preserve and have rebound somewhere close to what they were. And adult seals eat a lot. And they're greedy fuckers too. They'll bite the bellies (the tastiest part, to a seal) off and just move on to the next when they come to a school. It's heavily regulated, ecologically necessary and, honestly is a tiny cull out of a much larger population.

If you want to learn about bees, especially a very complex issue like Colony Collapse Disorder, definitely do NOT read the Guardian - you read one of the many reputable sources out there who will summarize the available body of scientific evidence out there.  Complex topics require experts.  You of all people should know that the mainstream is in the business of making money with sensationalism, not accuracy.

Assuming I believe you that you know this girl personally, *and* know she was molested as a child, I still have this from you:

&gt; No I'm not a psychiatrist. I don't magically know. She told me...

So now we're left with, unless she told you that she's an attention whore *because of* child abuse, you still don't even know that child abuse was a cause of *this girl* being an attention whore. Hell, even if she told you this, I'd *still* want to hear more about how she made that connection.

But even assuming I believe you, and her, and that it really is the case that she talks about orgies all the time **because** she was molested as a child -- and not that she talks about orgies all the time **and** she was molested as a child (remember, correlation isn't causation)...

You *still* don't know that this is necessarily true of every girl who talks openly about sex acts, nor do you even know it's true of the girl OP was referring to. You don't even know that orgies were involved.

On top of which, you still haven't explained how this particular girl was helped by being slut-shamed. After all, that's what your post was defending. You actually said this:

&gt; there are certain times where ""slut shaming"" is just trying to be reasonable with people that actually ARE trying to just get attention.

There are ways to be reasonable with people like that, and they don't generally involve calling them names behind their back.

**My opinion on the matter:**I mean yeah the way the developers act about it is wrong, and consoles don't seem to get anywhere near as much flak over it because it isn't considered as easily accessible. However encouraging piracy makes you a part of the problem. Don't like it don't touch it. Show them that it is't even worth the time even if you could get it for free.","1333239990"
"Guitar","t5_2qi79","Here's some additional information regarding vacuum tube specifications.  Vacuum tube lifespan is measured in hours based on running at 95%, or 5% below maximum current tolerance (referred to as saturation).  To give you a frame of reference, that would be like blowing a car horn from a continuous power source indefinitely at 95% of full volume, then track the number of hours that pass before it fails.  In the real world of guitar amplifiers, tube current never passes from anode to cathode continuously for an entire gig.  It varies (in volume) and is switched to standby when not used and completely halting flow of electrons.

Many years ago when most military applications employed the use of vacuum tubes, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) directed the average operational criteria for vacuum tube operation as no less than 2500 hours for military and government applications supporting Civil Defense in the event of Nuclear war (since EMP from a nuclear blast will destroy all solid state devices, but not vacuum tube transceivers for example - which is one reason ham radio is still so popular).

So here are some numbers (an approximation of course) taking your average lead guitarist working steady about three gigs per week and four, 45 minute sets, plus 2 hours for warm up or rehearsal time.

* 11.2hrs per/Week
* 582.4hrs Per/Year
* Life expectancy: 8.5 Years

If we demanded class A operation at max output with a minimum number of hrs before failure at just 1/5th the average set by NIST, that would be 500 hours.  At that demanding rate, the tube would still last 8.5 years!  In reality, guitar amps never work nearly that hard.

Re-tubing amps is another of many misconceptions musicians have been conned into believing, along with the ridiculous advertizements recommending that tube amps be re-capped every 7 years (all capacitors replaced).  This is all an effort to separate money from the wallets of the unwitting who are being taken advantage of every day.  Guitarists fall for this, and unfortunately, spread this bad advice to fellow musicians in an effort to be helpful.

It's really starting to stick in my craw.  One day, I must post a web page to r/guitar listing all the ways musicians are being scammed.  I need to make this a priority project.  I hate to see decent musicians being hustled every day by an unregulated industry. And I've written enough recommendations on r/guitar alone to write a book.  Anyway, best of luck with your AC15.

one evening, around 9pm, one of the well pumps turned off. this meant about 5 cabins didn't get water, and 50 odd kids couldn't shower or brush their teeth etc. annoyed with the fact i had to do stuff in my off-hours, i go fix the pump and go check if everyone got water again. a kid from one of the cabins, known to be a jackass goes ""oi you british dick, what took you so long, i could've done it myself!"". i smirk, go outside, turn the water to their showers off, go back inside and tell him that he can go fix it now, if he thinks he's so good. the kid's jaw hit the floor, he wasn't expecting any resistance. he promptly brushed past me outside to go find a councillor to complain to about me. in that time, i turned the water back on, found one of the directors, told him that everything has been fixed, asked for the keys to the truck, grabbed a friend and set off to walmart.

the next day, one of the councillors from that cabin comes up to me and says ""good job keeping *** in place, that kid needs some manners""

"skeptic","t5_2qj8f","So let me get this straight, you haven't actually received an official diagnosis of celiac disease then, have you? You're self-diagnosed yourself. I mean, it's entirely possible that you're right but you said it yourself:

&gt; So not only would acquiring a diagnosis now be extremely painful for a few months, it would also be a massive, lifetime financial liability on my individual insurance rates. 

This simply speaks more to how our insurance system is broken and has nothing to do with an education campaign around helping doctors better diagnose celiac disease.

The catch is it's entirely possible to take a well-meaning bit of self-help and turn it into a crazy fad that sucks out any good intentions. This is exactly what's happening with the gluten-free fad and it's exactly what happened back in the eighties with lactose intolerance and the [dairy-free fad.](http://www.notmilk.com/) It's interesting looking back just how short lived the anti-milk fad was.

I personally have no skin in the game, literally. I don't have the genes (www.23andme.com puts my odds at 0.03%) for it nor the antibodies, but when I tell people that it doesn't stop many health nuts from trying to push gluten-free anyway despite the fact that such a diet will do absolutely nothing for me.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt; But when someone who hasn't opened a book in their entire life and spouts out that science is the answer to everything... His judgement is based purely on faith no matter what side he takes. His faith is just in science instead. In fact, blind faith.

I rarely know people like that. The people I know who have faith in science did so through thorough investigation, and just like many scientists they all have different views on the conclusions science comes to. Example: Physicists tend to agree there was a big bang which started the universe based on what we've observed concerning the universe's current state. Scientists split on different hypothesis of *how* the big bang started. Most of them don't make any dogmatic assertion about what started the Big Bang or if the Big Bang happened the way we think it did, but they have a pretty good idea. 

The difference between that and faith is that faith says ""this is the way the Bible says it is and any deviation from it is heresy or deceit"". Science says ""this is the way we think it is based on our observance of the known material we can observe and if we eventually find out we're wrong, we'll go back to the drawing board"".

4) They opposed Communism because for a very brief period Germany was run by ineffective communist government. Jews were the face of Communism and Pogroms were common in German history. Jews were stereotypical trade unionists, political agitators, and bankers. None of which were welcome by those who wanted to own industry in Munich or the rest of Germany.
5) They were fascists who were clean living, health nutty, militaristic industrialists. Kinda like Mormons.

You can intuit this pretty quickly by thinking about where you see the Milky Way in the sky during the year. It varies quite a bit, and is usually pretty high in the sky.

"politics","t5_2cneq","You can't completely take money out of politics, but you CAN take it out of elections and almost completely eradicate bribery. That is the biggest difference between the US and say Finland. In Finland, a corporation could conceivably pressure the government to do its bidding, but it can't control who is elected or bribe single politicians outright. In Sweden, a politician had to take a hiatus from politics because she bought a candy bar on her state issued credit card. Just a few months ago, the leader of the second biggest party was forced to quit after he had been taking government subsidies for an apartment close to the parliament that he was not quite entitled to. Just as perspective for you.


The first step is to ban donations to political parties or candidates and raise money through taxes and divide based on a function of the number of members. The second step is to ban political advertisements. The third step is to encourage the free press and also unconditionally fund unbiased public media with no control from the outside. A fixed amount of tax dollars should be spent on public media, and that amount can never be changed.


The US has a fairly good start with NPR, but that should be extended to a major TV and internet news channel. The other two steps should get the US started down the path of reasonable politics...","1333240062"

"psychology","t5_2qhcz","there is also a big misconception here about psychoanalysis being less effective than CBT. psychoanalysis gets talked down in academic circles because of the lack of ability to test it empirically.  that being said, saying that CBT is more effective isn't necessarily correct.  jonathan shedler published an article called ""the efficacy of psychodynamic psychotherapy"" in the american psychologist that has a much better insight into this than i can offer, but his point is that psychoanalysis is just as effective if not more than other forms of talk therapy.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;That's so idealist I might just cry.

I'm glad to have inspired you.

&gt;Community colleges accept everyone who's got the money for it. Do well there, and you might get accepted to a decent university. If you can pay for that, which less and less people can, then you can get your degree and get a good job to work off the debt you've accrued from student loans.

Unless you have some sort of horribly debilitating disease that keeps you from working, or else some impossibly long criminal record, there is no reason you can't go to a community college. She works at Macy's, I understand that... So where else does she work? Oh, she only has one job? What is she doing with the other 40 usable hours a week?

Look. My brother and I were raised by our single mother, who made $30,000 a year when I was growing up. I have not had an easy life in any way. I really fucked up in high school, and I didn't bother applying for college. What did I do? I sat around, waiting for some opportunity to come along so that I could be successful like everyone else. And I waited. And I waited.

And then I realized that I was being fucking stupid, so I got a job. Then I got another one. At 20 years old, I worked 75 hours a week for under $10 an hour. I worked my fucking ass off. I worked nights. I was working so much I wanted to die. But I fucking did it, because I wasn't going to sit around anymore and wait for my life to begin. I finally managed to save up the money to attend a community college.

I am not in an ideal situation now. But I'm getting there. I have a job I love in a field I love, and I only work 40 hours a week because I can finally afford it. I'm at the university finishing my education. I have a little apartment downtown. I have a car for the first time in my life. I have a few thousands dollars saved. And I'm not going to give it all up and go back to complaining that ""America isn't like that anymore.""

&gt;Don't impose your ideals of upward mobility and seizing the ""American Dream"" on people.

My mom died about 3 years ago from cancer.  Towards the end of her life my family went to an island where we used to spend summers camping.  My parents were in their 50's, my brother 16 and I was 28.  We had an amazing time.  My mom was really sick by that point and couldn't do a whole lot, but we sat around the campfire talking, carried her out to the beach and visited places we had spent happy times when we were younger. 

We all had a great time.

And just an additional suggestion, make sure wherever you go you all take time to spend one on one with your parents.  Obviously your mom is the focus here and the one that's sick, but remember that your dad is in a lot of pain as well.  I found the best thing I could do for my dad was spend time with just him.  Not having my mom or my brother around gave him a chance to actually talk about what was hard for him and feel like he had someone to share the burden with.","1333240079"

&gt;They get to showcase their talents to convince NBA teams.

Cause who would know LeBron James was good at basketball otherwise? 

&gt;They get free food, free living, for four years. 

Fuck yeah. My value (as a top ten recruit) is hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars and you'll give me free food? How generous. Bullshit. The NCAA system is basically put in place to allow professional sports to avoid having to pay to develop talent. Soccer in Europe somehow seems to do fine without sending kids to university to party for a few years.

&gt;That's worth quite a bit of money.

A negligible amount relative to what a first round draft pick is paid. 

Professional leagues should be paying for their player development, not offshoring that cost to universities.  If the players who can't hack it in the development league, then fine, send them to universities. But this idea that a full-ride is this great gift to an elite player. It isn't. It's a pittance.

Anyway, I would hesitate to call her crazy to her face because that usually puts people on the defensive. I would approach it by saying that these ""devilish moods"" she gets in hurts you and the people around her, that there would be a difference if it was just emotional, but having the urge to physically harm another person for presumably no reason is socially off-putting at best and downright dangerous at worst.

Emphasize that non-crazy people go to therapy too. Therapy is ideally just supposed to be an outlet for people to discuss their lives in a safe, non-judgmental setting. Suggest that her lack of desire for sex is affecting your relationship, and that, while you're not trying to pressure her into have sex, you would like to talk to someone about ways for you to personally deal with not having sex. Maybe imply that you're having a hard time understanding why/how she believes in aliens and that it would help to have a third party explain it to you. Offer to come with her.

I honestly don't think that anyone would judge you for stretching the truth just a tiny bit in this situation. No offense, but this is very likely beyond your ability to help.","1333240079"

So now we're in an open relationship and we can have sex with whoever we want as long as we use protection. It's been pretty fun so far (and I finally broke double digits).

The interesting thing is we've found that it's not nearly as satisfying as having sex with each other, so it's actually been a huge help to our relationship.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","I think need to understand where the energy goes, and energy means fuel for the most part. Keeping the car on gives you a constant fuel use, weather or not you are moving and it is porportional to engine RPM for the most part (it's countering the internal engine friction, powering electronics, etc), there is friction when you are moving (drive train losses, tire/road friction, wind resistance) this is roughly proportional to your speed (with an exponential component in there), and then there is acceleration where energy is converted into kenetic energy, this can be conserved and replace fuel needs in the other two energy losses, but breaks basically just remove it for you without conserving it at all. Thus break usage is a very large user of fuel, on top of that accelerating (what produces the energy that eventually goes into the breaks) takes the engine out of it's power band, so you'll get maybe half the efficiency when accelerating.

Combine the effects, and you get idling sucks your gas up if your not moving. If you are on the highway then most of your fuel goes to rolling and air resistance, if you stay at about 55mph you will generally get VERY good mpg. But city driving is the worst, it includes LOTS of accelerating (after you wait at the light for example), and it includes LOTS of breaking, in city driving this is where all your fuel goes, the other two areas do not matter nearly as much, if you want to increase mileage it's better to avoid accelerating and avoid breaking, if you can take the highway or the local street, the highway will give you better mileage even if you are driving 20% further (on many cars).

Now why do I mention all of this? Because in city driving where you are actually making many turns, wait time and drive length mean very little, what matters is how much accelerating/breaking you are doing, and if right turns gives you less stopping for it's going to be better for your mileage, I think if you do a rolling stop at the stop signs and traffic lights when making right turns that will save you fuel (it's much harder to do that with left turns). In reality though, I think the driving style has more to do with it than weather or not you made a left turn (and the light timing matters, I know when I commute to work I know how to avoid lights and cut 30% off my travel time)","1333240088"

Not necessarily.  The fake iPhone texts usually have the green/white conversation bubbles and the wrong font.  This appears to have the correct font, as well as the correct resolution and pixel density.

Though it's not particularly funny, this one probably isn't fake.  The reason fake iPhone conversation templates were made in the first place is because sharing text messages was a popular thing to do, and I'd wager that many people, like the OP, still do share legitimate texts.","1333240089"

There is only 1 possible configuration for any 3 players to each be in the wrong rank.

There are 336 possible combinations of 3 players.

Therefore there are 336 possible ways for exactly 3 (but any 3) players to each be in the wrong place. 336 in 40,320 chances for such a scenario to occur (again, if this was truly random).

Conclusion: this scenario had either 0.8333% or 0.00248% chance of occuring. 0.8333% if you don't care which 3 players, 0.00248% if you're set on Baj, Beef, and Doc being in the wrong places.

There are some awesome little mundane things in it that really ground you in the world. Anytime you want to use a jump gate to get to a new system, you have pilot into the gate and initiate the jump manually.

If you want to land on a planet or a space station, you have to request permission to land and then initiate the landing yourself. You can set in your heading and speed and then leave the controls of your ship, as its moving, and move around your ship to mess with things.

You can board other ships and kill everyone on them to steal them.

The CPW laws make illegal possession of a handgun, with the exception of a person in possession of a license issued by article 400. That means that, if you have a pistol permit, you CAN NOT be charged with CPW for possessing your licensed pistols (with the exception of possessing a firearm on the grounds of a school, which is exempted from the exception). So, if you carry concealed on a restricted hunting/target permit, you are NOT breaking the law, only violating administrative restrictions. 

There is no statute that bans ""exposed handguns"" like CA, and there isn't a ""going armed to the terror of the public"" law like OH.  This is why if, for example, you're openly carrying while hunting, nobody's going to bat an eye at you -- there isn't a law that says you can't do it.  The most they can do is get you on a catch-all law like Dis Con if you're OCing in public, which makes it *constructively* illegal.  ","1333240107"

After about ten minutes, she says ""This' exactly why I hate livin' in this town, see kids, all the inbred retards they hire around here?"" and leaves. I was hoping an actual worker could come over and sort the situation out, but they never seem to be around when you need them here. I wasn't nearly offended as I was humored.

This is covered in the [Comprehensive Rules](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/rules) section 514.  Cleanup Phase.

However, there are points that you may gain priority during the cleanup phase, which is rare, but if you cast spells or activate abilities during the time you gain priority, then there is another cleanup phase AFTER the current cleanup phase:

&gt;514.3a At this point, the game checks to see if any state-based actions would be performed and/or any triggered abilities are waiting to be put onto the stack (including those that trigger ""at the beginning of the next cleanup step""). If so, those state-based actions are performed, then those triggered abilities are put on the stack, then the active player gets priority. Players may cast spells and activate abilities. Once the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, another cleanup step begins.

As for taking the pill to get rid of periods, it can be costly if your insurance won't cover enough packs/year to let you skip the placebo week. Skipping the placebo week with traditional pills would mean going through 17 packs/year instead of 13. Even if your insurance covers it, some doctors won't write a scrip that covers more than 12 or 13 packs a year. 

In my case, skipping the placebo week NEVER worked. I would bleed anyway or spot unpredictably 2 or 3 weeks later. I would rather time my period for once/month than have random spotting all the time.","1333240121"

The logical extension to your argument is that if Westwood Studios had all of the players dial in once a week to update a profile kept on every player that included random achievements then Command and Conquer would have a built in system preventing from getting them while cheating. And if you did hack the game to get the achievements with cheating then yes, you should be banned.

Maybe you personally don't care for achievements, maybe you have never spent a lot of time to get something in a game and thus it does not make sense to you but there are a lot of people that do like to invest their time for the feeling of accomplishing something. That feeling is certainly diminished if you then see a random dude going ""herp derp, I got the same thing by switching my exe and typing 'lolololo123' in the console"".","1333240123"

Each level begins with an on-rails flying section like Star Fox, Panzer Dragoon or Sin and Punishment, and then consists of an on foot section that plays kind of like a third person shooter, although it's the furthest thing from a Gears of War.

Loot is a big part of the game, there are tons of randomized Weapons with different stats. A big part of the game is replaying levels to get better weapons to replay levels at higher difficulties or play online.

The story is great too, there are so many absolutely insane twists and turns and the dialogue is super funny and charming with a ton of self-referential jokes about video games.","1333240126"

I would be more concerned about whether she has a history of cheating or not. IMO, cheaters don't change very easily. However, just because she's had a lot of sex in the past doesn't mean she still wants to be with other people. As someone who's had a lot of sex, I can tell you after a while, it's basically all the same. Being with one person you love for the long term, though, things start to get more interesting. When you develop trust in your relationship, the sex gets awesome. At that point, it doesn't matter how many other people you've been with before because the only person you want is the one you really trust.","1333240140"

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","Sorry for taking a while to get back to you. Life is busy and I'm moving between houses. Since you seem genuinely curious I believe you deserve an answer. I just don't want to be called that malicious atheist who was talking crap about our religion. Here is what I don't respect.

On the surface, I don't respect the belief that God exists. Remember that I believe that ""respecting beliefs"" is a nefarious phrase. I can try to have a reasonable discussion with you and I am respecting *you* as I am doing so, but since I believe that the belief in God is a harmful one, generally speaking, I don't respect it.

As for things which are more specific to Catholicism?

I don't believe the infallibility of the pope is a belief to be respected. Since as an atheist I believe the word of the pope is equally as holy as the rest of ours, I don't think it is wise to say the popes words are to be treated as infallible. And since I know human beings' tendency to be fallible (including myself and other atheists--this is in essence one of the reasons for my atheism,) I think assigning the label of infallible to a singular human being is a harmful mistake.

I don't respect the Catholic church's opposition to contraceptives. Since our world is a world of limited resources, since having sex is a natural function in a lot of our lives, since I don't believe sex for pleasure only is morally (and certainly not ethically) wrong, and since contraception exists, it is oppressive to deny individuals or partners *the choice* of weather or not they would like to have a baby. I see it as a denial of freedom for a very bad reason and therefore I don't respect it.

That is a start to some of the things I don't respect about Catholicism. I hope that adds understanding to what I mean when I say there are beliefs of Catholicism that I don't respect.

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","I am you, ten years from now. And I **did** wake up and think I should have taken a different path. Everything you have described sounds exactly like how I used to feel. I actually sniggered out loud at ""I prefer romantic comedies to action movies"" because as a 'guy' dating girls it was always really painful to explain, ""no, I am not like all those other dudes, I actually really want to come and see that Sandra Bullock movie with you, I probably know much more about Sex &amp; The City than you ever did, and by the way I'd really like to be Charlotte, please..."" Try not to worry about the sexual arousal thing. Arsonists get sexually aroused by starting fires, I've heard, so it can be as much to do with a sense of freedom, self-determination and breaking taboos than the actual gender issues. One of my exes was a cis woman who got incredibly turned on by her own body, and by looking at herself dressed up in sexy clothes. If you're a girl who likes girls, it's only natural to get turned on by that stuff. But in my experience, once I started to live day to day as a ""normal"" woman rather than dressing up in secret, as a ""treat"", most of that arousal went away and I got much more of a sense of calm, being at peace with myself. I also found myself much more attracted to men than I used to be, once I had the experience of a man treating me like a lady, but everyone's different and your sexuality is completely separate from your gender, and if you continue to find that you always like girls too, then that's cool too - there's plenty of girls around who like other girls :-)

I don't think I've really answered your question yet - how did I decide what was right for me? Honestly, just by thinking, exploring, talking, reading other people's stories, not putting myself under pressure to make an instant decision but instead giving myself the freedom to **not** decide until I felt it was right. Counselling did help, I was lucky enough to find a therapist with some special expertise in gender identity issues and who also just had a very warm and supportive personality. But just as important was surrounding myself with some very kind and understanding women friends -- it was their love and support that ultimately made me feel part of the sisterhood, and to be sure that that was where I belonged.

"startups","t5_2qh26","I've spent about $200 on paid stuff:

* An ad on some forum -- offtopic.com, I think -- I made a post, they promoted it. $25 for a day. They typically don't perform well b/c the community there isn't so accepting of paid posts, but mine did decent, probably getting me about 30-50 subscribers. 
* A reddit ad, maybe two, $20 each. It sucked. Got me two subscribers.
* An ad on A Word a Day, an email list which claims to have 1mm subscribers. $99 for a day. I may have gotten around 100 subscribers from it, but I don't think it was quite that high.

That's it, I'm pretty sure. I've never paid someone to endorse the newsletter. I've only paid for ad space. I'm horrifically cheap (honestly to a fault) and I don't think that ads perform well on a CPA basis for me. 

Endorsements? Lots of twitter ones, some solicited, some not. Also a few blog posts were solicited, but here are a few unsolicited ones (mostly... there's some grey involved, which I'll explain):

* [Derren Brown](http://derrenbrown.co.uk/blog/2011/06/learn-day-email/) -- I have no idea how this happened, but it was huge.
* [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/07/15/email-newsletters-worth-subscribing-to/) -- it's a list of good email newsletters. [Hacker Newsletter](http://hackernewsletter.com)'s writer suggested that the writer make the list, and the HNNL guy and I have swapped links and strategies many many times, so he kindly also suggested me.  (By the way, link swaps within your medium are *great* if you're a publisher.)
* [Brainpickings](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/06/21/best-daily-email-newsletters/) -- Early on, I asked the author of this post for advice. She was very helpful and the one piece of her advice I turned down for Now I Know ended up being core to Fact and a Photo. A year later, she wrote that post. 
* [Laughing Squid](http://laughingsquid.com/now-i-know-learn-something-new-every-day-by-email/) -- I've come to know the owner of the site there but I told him explicitly that NIK isn't right for his readers. His team obviously disagreed :).  They also [wrote about Fact and a Photo](http://laughingsquid.com/fact-and-a-photo-site-features-an-interesting-fact-image-daily/), [totally unsolicited](http://danlewis.tumblr.com/post/19662042230/underplanning-and-launching-by-accident-my-recipe-for).  They're awesome.
* [Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com/2012/02/18/learn-something-new-via-email-every-day/) -- So, I have syndication arrangements with [MentalFloss](http://mentalfloss.com) (which gave the list it's first big boost) and [GOOD](http://good.is), and a long time ago asked Neatorama if they'd be interested, too. They basically passed. Just over a year later, they wrote that post.
* [MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com/107574/Its-not-procrastination-if-youre-learning-things) -- posted by a reader, unsolicited. You'll see a comment in there by a ""close personal friend of Dan's"" (true). When the MeFi post hit, he asked me how I finally got a MeFi post -- and my reaction was ""someone posted about NIK on MeFI?!?!?!"" Had no idea.

"ronpaul","t5_2qh0r","This clearly ignores the fact that all of these delegate counts don't translate into reality. These numbers are based on the assumption that these delegates are somehow bound to vote the actual supposed proportioned count. Just look at Nevada, it claims Paul only got 5 delegates, well Nevada just voted for their delegates today and Paul swept all of the delegates in Nye County, the largest county in Nevada, a bulk of the delegates. This is happening all over the country in counties in every state. Regardless no one of the GOP candidates are going to win the necessary  1144 delegates to secure the nomination. So when it comes down to all these delegates given the opportunity to vote their conscience who knows who will be standing when the smoke clears.

And you'll get paid way more, have a more stable and comfortable life, and be treated with more respect.

But for each loan that generates a certain amount of interest ($10ish, I think), you'll have to file something specifically in your taxes.

But if you don't say anything and you actually do have it, then you could spontaneously die someday. Not to sound overly dramatic, but that's the nature of the disease. The disease presents itself outwardly by some of the symptoms that you touched on, but the real damage is done on the inside. The same disease which causes abnormally long long bone growth also affects the elasticity of muscle tissues. Unfortunately, muscle tissues protect the integrity of our organs, lining them internally. When this tissue is weak, you're looking at spontaneous problems in many different systems of the body. The worst and possibly most serious complication is when the aorta becomes weak, leaving it vulnerable to suddenly rupturing. Not trying to scare you, but just saying, it's good to know. It's always good to know so that you can take precautions that will allow you to protect your body. Always ask. ","1333240168"

Firing him will do nothing. In time the fear created will pass cops and will continue to act violently; This is a epidemic across America.

Officers continue to exert excess force and malcontent; along with easily falsifying information and manipulating laws for their own gains.

Obviously this pathetic person (along with many people) became afraid and concerned with a few black boys just having fun.
Whether what they were doing was in a legal realm or not; its far to easy and everyone everyday breaks some kind of infraction and law.
It has become impossible not to; even when the average person has tried to understand and follow the laws; they're still enforced and then used to prey upon people.

The economic need to perform well and write lots of tickets since that is a task and all task officers want to excel in, so he can get a raise or keep his job.

We encourage these problems.

We encourage for profit prisons

We encourage mores laws and harsher punishments for profit

We destroy people and lives and families for profit

We ignore addiction for profit

We arrest and kill for profit.

We drug and mistreat for profit

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","I’m putting a lot into this even though it’s not going to be seen. I am fascinated with the development and use of nuclear weapons. I’m not an expert, so all of this is just arm-chair stuff.

I’ll use a hypothetical here, we’ll assume that the Russians and the American’s get into a nuclear war. I’m going to just put you in my seat and treat you like an American citizen for this example.
Early into the attack, the Russians detonate a very high altitude nuclear weapon, probably several of them. The purpose of the weapon is to knock out as much of the American infrastructure as possible. This Electro-Magnetic Pulse would be one of the key differences between OP’s article and what I’m writing. Most military and government hardware would likely go undamaged; it’s shielded. Your car, cell phone, and most of the American power grid would be disabled. This cripples the American Civil Defense ability, which has been neutered since the anti-proliferation era.

This, sadly, would probably be the only warning you can expect. Since telecommunications are down – at least on the user end – you won’t be able to get any information until it’s too late.
So, let’s talk weapons. Since the anti-proliferation era I was talking about, nuclear armed states like the US and Russia mad a big show of taking their nuclear arsenal down quite a bit. Russia is still very powerful in that department, and we are too, but our arsenals are streamlined quite a bit. We have left behind the days of silo launched Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). Nations now rely on Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) for most of their nuclear defense. Subs can be harder to track and even harder to scramble defenses against.

The most modern SLBM in the Russian arsenal is the RSM-56 Bulava. It has a range of 8-10,000 kilometers. It carries on board a warhead that is anywhere from 100-150 kilotons. Yes, ten to fifteen times that demonstrated in OP’s article. The missile is built to survive traditional air defense systems. During the silo era, the US was ready and willing to detonate nuclear weapons along its *own* seaboards to stop incoming missiles from reaching further in land. The Bulava, however, is built to survive a nuclear blast from as close as 500 meters away. Also, it’s shielded from EMP attacks.

On, I forgot – the Bulava isn’t carrying just one 150 kiloton warhead – it’s carrying ten of them. The warheads, called Multiple Independent Targeting Reentry Vehicles (MIRVs) are loaded into the missile along with decoys meant to make one missile look like many. This makes it harder to intercept the missile before the MIRVs are deployed. [This]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Peacekeeper-missile-testing.jpg) is what the MIRVs would look like as they came into your town. The Bulava would be carrying, across its 10 MIRVs, 1.5 megatons of destruction. That’s just one missile. Russia has at least 600 in service.

If you’re lucky, you’re near the epicenter. It’s been discussed here in /r/askscience and in articles across the internet, but you would be dead before you even had a chance to become aware of a change in your environment. How fast would death occur?

OP’s weapon is a relatively “simple” fission bomb. A high grade core of fissionable material (generally Plutonium-239) is surrounded by explosive lenses that implode and create nuclear fission. That’s how the Fat Man bomb worked.

Fusion nuclear weapons, which both the Russians and Americans have, take that a step further. In the Teller-Ulam design, the fission bomb is referred to as the primary. The primary sits above something called a secondary. At the center of the secondary is the sparkplug, generally thought to be lithium-6 deuteride. The sparkplug itself is surrounded by uranium, which serves to protect the secondary from the heat of the primary and also adds to bomb’s explosive power.

The primary and the secondary are encased in an aerogel or polystyrene. In American weapons, this stuff is referred to FogBank. It’s so classified that we forgot how to make it. When we wanted to refurbish our nuclear weapons, we had nothing on paper about the composition of the stuff. Anyone who was involved in its creation was either dead or retired. We literally had to invent it all over again.
Anyway, the aerogel isn’t just there for structural support – it’s extremely important in the detonation of the secondary. The way the secondary is detonated is by compressing the core – the lithium-6 deuteride – and turning it into tritium (a radioactive isotope of hydrogen). This produces nuclear fusion – yes, the same fusion type of fusion that powers our sun.

Early into the design of this type of weapon – called a two-stage thermonuclear weapon, a hydrogen bomb, or in the American case, the Teller-Ulam design – it was thought by the designers that the secondary should be compressed by the mechanical explosive power of the primary. Eventually, they changed their mind – they would use x-rays of the primary to detonate it.

Remember the polystyrene foam that I was talking about? When the primary detonates, before there is a fireball, before anything noticeable happens, it releases massive amounts of x-rays. These x-rays bounce off the case of the bomb and change the foam from solid to plasma. This increases the pressure and causes fussion. The uranium tamper around the sparkplug absorbs massive amounts of neutrons, and produces a fission event in and of itself. All of this happens before there is a fireball. All of this happens before you even know there’s a bomb near you. And all of it happens several hundrend meters above you. And it’s happening nearby, because there’s nine other warheads going off at the same time.

You’re dead from the gamma rays and x-rays before there’s even a fireball, about a microsecond after detonation. If you’re close enough to the epicenter, you’ll be vaporized by the destructive power of the bomb. Before the impulses can reach you, you’re gone. Moving further out, you’ll be blinded and burned, and eventually far enough out you won’t be hurt by the bomb itself outside of some long term radiation exposure effects. But you have more important things to worry about for now. [Here]( http://www.carloslabs.com/node/16) is a map tool to determine the blast radius of a nuclear bomb. I would select the DF-31. It’s a 140 kiloton bomb in the range of what I am talking about.

The bomb casing, the soil, the vaporized buildings – the *people* who were near the epicenter - have all now been irradiated and kicked up into the atmosphere by the blast wave. They are carried up into the sky and will rain down on everything nearby. Where it lands, how long it lasts – that all depends on meteorological factors and on how high the bombs were when they were detonated. Also, if you’re lucky, maybe the bombs didn’t use a uranium tamper after all. Maybe they used lead, in which case, fallout would be dramatically reduced.

In any case, if you are not close to any of the epicenters of the ten 150 kiloton bombs that just went off, you need to seek shelter immediately. Do not touch any ash. Immediately remove your clothing and discard it upon entering shelter. You need to wash off all of the ash on you. [Here]( http://archive.org/details/AboutFal1963) is a video on fallout. Only eat from cans, eating fallout can be fatal. You want to avoid breathing it, but if you disrobed before you entered your shelter and washed properly, you’re likely safe. When you do go out, do so for short bursts, only after all ash had settled, with your mouth covered, and 
always followed by the same disrobing and washing.

TL;DR: You’re probably dead regardless.

"Metal","t5_2qhud","**[In Flames - Jester Race] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jester_Race)** - One of the best, if not the best, melodic death metal albums of all time. 

**[Jungle Rot- Skin The Living] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_the_Living)""** one of my current favorite bands. Wisconsin death metal in the vain of **Obituary***. These guys are the epitome of American death metal, straight up hard hitting Death metal. 

**[God Forbid - IV: Constitution Of Treason] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV:_Constitution_of_Treason)** - New Jersey   groove/melodic death metal. Suggestion for song to listen to is [""To The Fallen Hero] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMwhJ6JV25Y). Beautiful salute to the troops and Dimebag Darrell. 

**[Ghost - Opus Eponymous] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_Eponymous)** - Creepy, ambient heavy metal. They refer to themselves as Nameless Ghouls, and their live shows are **SICK**. 

**[Witchery- Witchkrieg] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchkrieg)** - Swedish death/thrash metal in the vain of Slayer and sort. Kerry King makes an appearance on [Witchkrieg] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88mSch_fwc). Very cool band. 

**[Crowbar-Sever The Wicked Hand] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sever_the_Wicked_Hand)** - **HEAVY AS HELL** sludge metal. Who can resist listening to Kirk Windstein?

**[Eluiveite- Helvetios] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetios)** - Folk metal that is super unique. There are 9 band members, and 9 different instruments (including a hurdy gurdy) so you can imagine how amazing it sounds!

**[Goatwhore- Blood For The Master] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_for_the_Master)** - BEST BAND EVER. Nuff said

**[Orange Goblin- Eulogy For The Damned] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Eulogy_for_the_Damned)** - British stoner metal. These guys are the time of music that is **perfect** for a night at the bar, having a good time. 

**[Vader - Black To The Blind] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_to_the_blind)**- Raw Polish death metal. Doesn't get any better than this!

**[Devildriver- Fury Of Our Makers Hands] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fury_of_Our_Maker%27s_Hand) - Devildriver is one of my favorite bands of all time, and this album took them from good to **GREAT**. [End Of The Line] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoAXB_Swj-Y&amp;ob=av2e), and  [Grinfucked] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWKppF-ZcBI) are some of the best modern metal songs, and their heavy as anything.

I can't comment on Mumble from the server side (the only one I've personally run is Ventrilo, the other programs I only have user experience with), but with Ventrilo your latency depends heavily on server configuration and your ping to the server itself.

Edit: This isn't to say that there isn't server latency with Ventrilo, Vent uses a buffer to reduce the metallic ""robot voice"" effect while Mumble uses a much smaller buffer. Artifacts in voice quality become more common the shorter the buffer is, especially in a long stream of audio (how often with any voice service has somebody with a bad connection gone from crystal clear to sounding like a Dalek in mid-sentence? This is the effect of unpredictable connection latency exceeding the buffer). The buffer directly adds to latency in order to make your voice clearer. On a predictable latency connection (which a serious gamer should have) you won't notice the difference of a smaller buffer, and this makes Mumble preferable in the optimum case.","1333240221"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was raised with my grandparents who didn't speak English at the time. Consequentially, I didn't get very good English skills when I was in school and I was put in ESL despite being born and raised here. My teachers even said I spoke fine and I just had a bit of an accent. We would get berated in that ESL class if we ever spoke something that wasn't English. The teacher also hated me. She spent half of the class just yelling at me because I couldn't tie my shoes properly. I eventually became ashamed of speaking my native language and I'm just became uncomfortable speaking at all in any language at all. Because of this, I turned heavily antisocial and when I changed schools, I didn't have any friends because I never spoke. I got put into ""social-development"" classes which made it even worse. I'm now in my final year of highschool and because I became so quiet, I didn't get much practice speaking. And now I'm bad in both english and my native language, and I have been considered to be selectively mute. FUCK YEAH, ESL &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

As my base grows I'll expand the storage and start to make more clearly defined categories. Building block chest will turn into dirt/gravel/cobble chest and brick/smoothstone chest. Naturals chest will become food chest, plant chest, mob drop chest, etc. As I get more stuff I'll add a chest for the Nether, a chest for dungeon stuff, a chest for tools and armor, a chest for lava buckets, etc. Things will get even more broken up, for example brick/smoothstone might become a chest for smoothstone and stone brick, a chest for sandstone, a chest for clay and bricks, and on and on.

A lot of the time I'll keep the bulk of a certain item in a location that makes more sense, like rotten flesh next to my zombie grinder or wheat and seeds at my farm, but I always like to keep at least a stack of every item (or as much as I can spare) in my general storage area.

This build is the best i could come up with. I changed the videocard to a GTX because I've had a much better experience with Nvidia than the alternatives. I dropped the processor down to an i3 ( will still give great performance) to fit the budget. Your mouse was unneccisarily expensive and fancy, so I changed that. It is still a good mouse. The motherboard is cheaper but still has great specs. As a general reccomendation, do not buy intel motherboard My advice for the monitor is to shop around on ebay and craigslist. Find a cheaper one, then you'll fit the budget. Good luck!","1333240241"

That simply underscores the point.  You aren't doing anything you need WebGL for in the first place.  Canvas 2D is embarrassingly deficient compared to OpenGL and you are going to be strictly limited by your need for fallback compatibility.

&gt; I'm targeting Chrome/Firefox/Safari/IE 9 for my port, and I **should** be able to get them all working

Famous last words.

&gt; less than a 1 MB download in total

So, pretty much a toy or demo.

&gt; And people stealing my WebGL engine isn't an issue because it's super simple anyway

So, pretty much a demo or toy.

The best part to steal is going to be not the engine itself, but seeing what you did on the compatibility front.  That's why people use jQuery; not because something is hard technically, but because of browser quirks.

It is also not an accident that you are doing such a simple project.  You essentially have to write 8 different versions: 4 browsers, times 2 for WebGL/Canvas 2D.  

The extra development effort, especially in *frustrating* areas like compatibility (things break for no good reason) caps project scope fairly severely, and will likely lead to burnout.

I'm not trying to talk you out of it, just making the point that it's a huge pain, so it would be interesting for you to write a post-mortem after you ""ship"".

"gardening","t5_2qhkh","Ask away! This is something I really enjoy. I pull off the branches of the dying leaves (there must be more than one for action) as they meet their bigger stem. Quite a few times there are baby suckers growing out of that same area so I just see it as exchanging a tired expended leaf segment for a new energetic one, that will grow out all green.
I was brand new to this gardening thing too, in 2007. I have learned many lessons, mostly the hard way. :| I have also lived in two completely different hardiness zones which means new times to plant seeds, and having to adjust expectations for what to plant. For example, I don't do lettuce anymore  because it is too disappointing :( . But I can plant okra here, so that is a new experiment this year.
The tomato plants you see in the photo are in a 3'x3' 'forever' raised bed from Gardener's.com. They are indeterminate plants. You really need quite a bit of space and soil for most indeterminates. If you treat them right and environmental conditions support, they will go on and on and on and on producing. If your tomato is a determinate type (you did not state the kind of tomato plant it was), it will grow to a certain height, produce prolifically, and then go into decline. You can maximize plant performance in both cases by treating it right - careful watering, fertilizing, etc. Unfortunately, I myself am not that good. :)  I had to add timed microirrigation (which is easier than you might think) to make up for my travels and very hot summer weather. In the hotter months,  I spray with neem oil on a weekly-biweekly basis to keep the bugs from eating it all. I do need to get better with periodically applying tomato-specific fertilizer. I tend to agree with some other posters here that this might be the issue with both of our plants.
As for background, I started with containers, and still very much love them, but there is a little more drama with containers vs. raised beds. It is harder to control some conditions, especially for the bigger plants like tomatoes. In containers I will grow Tumbling toms, patio tomatoes, and other plants that only get about 3 feet high. Any bigger, and the containers I use (up to 3 gal) can't meet the tomato's demands as it grows...and I end up disappointed. 
Good luck!

EDIT: I never answered one of the questions. I planted this in November, which means NOTHING.  Tomatoes have differing maturity depending on their type. My beloved tumbling tom cherry tomatoes take ~100 days but they are gorgeous container tomatoes. An Early Girl medium sized tomato usually takes about 1/2 that time. So how long it takes depends not only on conditions, but what kind of tomato is in your container.","1333240251"

"Transhuman","t5_2qh2k","&gt; The Clarke Progression has a fatal flaw in that fails to recognize how people want the space program to progress.
 
... That's really not a flaw at all. It was a roadmap; and was meant as a stratagem; it was the ""cheapest and most effective route to getting up there for good"".  You could do other shit, sure, as long as you didn't disrupt the Progression in so-doing.

&gt;  The only way to overcome this paradox and reinstate the Clarke progression is through overspending: 

If we'd never fallen *off* of the progression we would've found shit vastly cheaper.

This, you do realize, is the fundamental nature of why I'm pissy with the Apollo program in the first place, yes?

&gt; Nuclear weapons are the most immediate threat to human civilization, the Orion program would provide an excuse for their further development.

I'm sorry, but neither of these assertions are true.  Back in the fifties the former was true, but today it is simply... isn't. (And not merely because of how constrained nuclear armament has been. Compared to the threat of synth.bio, nukes are a child's toy. Locked away from the child.)  As to the latter; Orion rockety would depend upon shaped nuclear charges. These are a very different *kind* of research-and-development from what is conventionally the case for armaments. Also, you'd need the weapons-deployment-systems and those are nearly as hard to maintain as the actual detonating bits themselves.

&gt;  You talk about reaching Kardashev Type I as if Kardashev articulated a plan for the evolution of humanity. He didn't, he talked about energy consumption.

... Wat.

Kardashev's scales were of ""a civilization that is using X amount of energy"". So by saying we would reach post-Kardashev-type-I civilization I'm saying **we would be using that level/amount of energy**. 

Also -- Kardashev Type I isn't ""an entire sun"" -- it's ""an entire planet"". 

And there is absolutely no faster track to eliminating the scarcity-economics situation we find ourselves in than to ramp up that energy availability.   With ""limitless"" energy comes the economically feasible means of producing vastly greater amounts of food and shelter with vastly less ecological impact. We would be able to cheaply lift objects into microgravity conditions from the surface of the. Etc., etc., etc.,.

*EVERY* last thing you said we should be ""focusing"" on **cannot be achieved without first achieving post-Kardashev-type-I civilization status.**

Faster computers?  Grow the crystals in microgravity conditions.

People on other planets? Need to be able to get up there cheaply. Takes energy and metric shittons of it.

Alleviating human suffering? Requires mineral wealth and economic prosperity -- both of which require energy.  (Lunar regolith alone would be able to double or triple the effective economy of the Earth. Let alone near-earth-asteroids.) 

Increase lifespans through ""expanded biological research"". The only way to do *that* safely is through perfectly-isolated biological environments. Only way to get **those** is to have the research done off-planet.  Which again requires metric shittons of energy.

So yeah, I'm bitter about it. We could have had such an incredibly awesome society by now. Instead... we don't.","1333240253"

&gt;Defining women the way I wrote in my post wouldn't nullify the joke

I assume you mean, ""hey, I know you didn't do it on purpose but by defining a women as someone with a vagina you're excluding pre-op transsexuals, your definition of a women is problematic for (insert reasons from explaining chromosomes abnormalities to brain sex) as well as forcing gender queer people who may have a vagina to identify as either women or man. Can you please be use more appropriate language next time, thanks."" And in that case, yes, it would at least change the joke into something not a joke and not funny. Yeah, I mean, we do live in a ""cis-centered"" world but come on, ""cis"" just means ""not transgendered."" We also live in a cis-racial world, in which ""cis-racial"" is a word I made up to mean ""not-robotic humanoids."" 

I wrote this in the original thread, I'll reiterate my opinion here; when not directly talking about the trans community we just have to assume certain things about gender because 99% of the time they are true. If there is a person without a nose because they had booger cancer then I will treat them with respect as they deserve, but any other time I'm going to include ""noses"" in my big list of things humans have on their faces.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","&gt;Germany heavily subsidizes solar setups and they have had a fair amount of success.

Solar power is 2% of electrical generation in Germany.

&gt;chemical battery during the day and, while it works at a lower rate, continue to make power in the night hours.

This would mean even more expensive construction of vast fields of extremely toxic chemical batteries, and vast expense to build enough solar panels to cover the efficiency lose from changing energy from electrical to chemical and back again.  

&gt;Contrary to popular belief almost any place in the continental united states can use solar power so generation can be localized.

Yes but not every place in the US has enough space.  I defy you to find enough real estate for giant solar farms in, say, new jersey.  The places with enough space are those, by definition, in the middle of nowhere.

&gt;There are huge hurdles for technologies to surpass but it still represents our best chance for fully sustainable power.

Huge hurdles to pass means that your method is not a solution today.  It might be in 10/20/50 years, but isn't one today.  Seems to me that ""it doesn't work yet"" is a huge problem. 

The fact remains that the only solution to power that exists today that doesn't use fossil fuels is nuclear, no ifs ands or buts.","1333240260"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Ok, I've taken a few copyright courses here. I'm pretty sure that's a blatant copyright violation.

A) The owner of a copyright has no legal say whatsoever in what is done with a legally made copy. So your disk and the content on it is yours to access. Rights dealing with multimedia are fuzzy and backwards, but you still own the things on the disk, and as long as you wouldn't be considered to be making ""copies"" of anything on the disk, Origin/EA/Bioware has no say in what you do with your content. You can make the argument that your modding is ""essential"" to your enjoyment of the software, which would only strengthen your claim.

B) According to the whole ""Hot Coffee"" scandal with GTA: SA, wasn't there a rule sent out there that anything on the disk is free game to the customer? If locked, unaccessable content on a disk is still considered ""available"" to the owner/user, then ""locked, unaccessabe"" pay-to-unlock disk is, necessarily, also available to the owner/user. 

I'd really love to hear anyone else who knows this area chime in on this. Next year I intend to write an article on the copyright implications of the video game industry's attempts to control the used-game market. It seems to be a very blatant violation of copyright law, which expressly states that the owner of a copyright has zero say in what happens to a legal copy of their copyrighted material after they sell it. The attempted ""locking in"" that's going around and attempts at preventing used games from playing, or charging extra for online access to used games should be, absent further legislation, very illegal. 

TL;DR: YOU OWN THAT DISK. The publisher/developer/whoever has legally given up any claim to what you do with your disk and the content on it so long as you don't reproduce it. This includes a right to re-sell. ","1333240261"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Unless you control one of the top franchises in the market (CODMW, WoW), you would cry at the profit ratios that some indie titles can turn. That is to say, most AAA developers invest several times more money into titles than indie developers, and receive fewer dollars back for every dollar they put in.

In addition, indie developers are beholden to basically no one except the employees, who tend to number in the teens, not the hundreds. On top of that, more AAA devs have stockholders, or at least shareholders, to answer to.

All of this means that indie developers can:

A. Take more risk on a venture, since there aren't as many vested interests expecting a solid ROI.

B. Not worry as much about piracy since their costs aren't as high.

AAA developers need to put out a product that is safely and reliably profitable. That is why so much money is spent on advertising, and why so much is spent on DRM. When you make a game for $900K and sell it at $15 (Wasteland 2's goal figures), you only have to sell 60,000 copies to break even. In comparison, SW:ToR ran a total of **~$150-200 million** to make, and still has not broken even despite 2 million sales.

**TL;DR** - There's less pressure and financial vestment on indie houses, so they can be a little looser about protecting their product.","1333240262"

That means that you cannot make the voting age *greater* than 18, but you could make it lower - in fact, you could remove age restrictions entirely.

I believe crime in the city is not being taken care of. Might be a little hard with all the social welfare programs being located in Hamilton...or is it just all the low income families? Speaking from personal experience I've literally had bullets fly by my head...robbed at knife point...had thugs jump me and my friends completely out of nowhere....had my car broken into...What did the cops do in all these situations. NOTHING.

Jobs

Not many well paying jobs. Their even cutting back on nurses and other hospital workers. Just great.....

Cost of living

Taxes in the hamilton area are some of the highest in the area. 
Car insurance rates in hamilton are some of the highest in the area.

All the old houses that are falling apart

People need to learn how to take care of their shit. Atleast have your front lawn presentable.

Water System

The water system in Hamilton is a wreck. Not only is it old but they are far behind in replacing what needs to be replaced. I wonder how much lead piping is still out there.....

Cancer rates

Just take a look at that. The entire GTA area is not doing so well. If you compare it to other areas in Canada.

&gt; society has totally opposite standards for men and women regarding sex, and if they fail to fulfill their specified gender role, they are insulted. This proves there is no double standard.

Did I miss something? that's pretty much the definition of a double standard...

that definition (of dick-rider) is still not at all relevant. An equivalent male insult would be to accuse a man of gaining financial status from women by sleeping with them.

This isn't really relevant to the original comment, but you seem to be basing your comments on the assumption that women ""give"" and men ""get"" sexual activity.

&gt;LAN sync is a Dropbox feature that speeds syncing dramatically when the file exists on your Local Area Network (LAN).
&gt;
&gt;What does that mean exactly? Well, when you add a file to your computer's Dropbox, the file is then synced with Dropbox servers. Dropbox will then initiate the syncing process as soon as it determines a change has been made to the file. All linked computers and shared folders will then download any new version of the file. **With LAN syncing, Dropbox will look for the new file on your Local Area Network first, bypassing the need to download the file from Dropbox servers, thus speeding up the syncing process considerably.**

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","The article you cited doesn't impress me.

Why? 

Firstly, because the author constantly makes a single, false assumption- That all humans act rationally in every social circumstance. He essentially claims that potentially bad actors would either be isolated enough to be defended against or will be dissuaded because to act against the interests of the people around him would be unwise.

I would counterclaim that wisdom and lust for power and hubris are many times mutually exclusive, and that people often acquire power over others for the sheer pleasure of controlling them, regardless of the cost or whether it is in their best interest to do so. Whole empires have been sent hurtling into decline because of one ruler's simple desire to get what he or she wants.

The article does not address these types of people, at any time.

Take his example:

&gt; Bill Clinton was perfectly willing to fire off dozens of cruise missiles when the Lewinsky scandal was picking up steam.  Now regardless of one’s beliefs about Clinton’s motivations, clearly Slick Willie would have been less likely to launch such an attack if he had been the CEO of a private defense agency that could have sold the missiles on the open market for $569,000 each.

So he contends that greed for money would override a desire to avoid scandal and maintain power. Human nature, at least to me, seems to indicate the exact opposite. 

If we assume the worst motivation, that he launched the missiles to distract from his affair, if he were the classic narcissistic bad actor, he would easily spend millions to avoid being exposed and kicked from his position. The money would mean nothing to him. 

Actually, in the case of a private defense agency there is actually much less of a likelihood that there would be any effective oversight, especially if he otherwise produced a significant profit for the owners. You can see this type of behavior in modern corporations, where many bad acts are willingly covered up or minimized in order to preserve profits. Ask BP why they spent millions to try and cover up their spill in the beginning instead of fessing up and spending those millions to mitigate the damage.

Secondly, he claims that 

&gt; For the warlord objection to work, the statist would need to argue that a given community would remain lawful under a government, but that the same community would break down into continuous warfare if all legal and military services were privatized.

That's a near impossibility, because under a government, the groups and people that would rise to power and cause such warfare are interdicted by smaller law enforcement agencies long before they amass enough power to cause full scale warfare. In a privatized environment, with no over arching law structure, there is no limiter to such groups rise as long as they don't trigger the response of the privatized agencies around them.

We already have examples of this, in Mexico and Central and South America. Narcogangs operate unfettered in some parts of nations and steadily grow in size and influence until they are nearly unstoppable by anything but an organized military force. 

Those in the society with the wealth to hire a private force capable of stopping them don't, because they either are co-opted with the temptations of immense money-making opportunities, bribed sufficiently enough to not even form said forces, or threatened with assassination and kidnap of themselves and everyone they care about, or some combination of all three.

Without a legal system backed up by force, nobody is ever responding to a lawsuit, and if they have enough money to sustain a large armed force, they don't have to care about market forces, as they control most of the facets of the market they operate in.

In a free market voluntary environment, people like Pablo Escobar wipe the floor with the peaceful people around him, no matter how wealthy they are. Why? Because he's not peaceful. He's ruthless. He was not the richest man in Colombia, but he was one of the meanest, and that was all that mattered.

Then, after he pretty much discards how humans act in the real world, he then slips into total fantasy-

&gt; Third, people need to really picture the nightmare scenario to see how absurd it is.  Imagine a bustling city, such as New York, that is initially a free market paradise.  Is it really plausible that over time rival gangs would constantly grow, and eventually terrorize the general public?[iii]  Remember, these would be admittedly criminal organizations; unlike the city government of New York, there would be no ideological support for these gangs.

The author of the article must have been asleep during his American History class. I submit to you Chicago in the 1920s. That city was owned, literally, by the mob. They had paid off the mayor and every organization beneath him to the point that the FBI had to come in and break up the mob there.

But remember, in the author's world, there is no FBI. He might offer that some private equivalent might form, but that already had happened- the Chicago Crime Commission existed and did have an impact, but without the resources of an entire national agency, the mob might still rule Chicago to this day.

So is it plausible? beyond doubt, it's a certainty, it has happened. It *is* happening. Mexico has a fully national army, and still the Zetas kill at will.

&gt; Once private judges had ruled against a particular rogue agency, the private banks could freeze its assets (up to the amount of fines levied by the arbitrators).  In addition, the private utility companies could shut down electricity and water to the agency’s headquarters, in accordance with standard provisions in their contracts.

Bad actors needs banks? And what stops them from forming their own? Utilities? Bad actors can't accumulate resources themselves? What makes the author think said parties, if they weren't just simply bought, would not be threatened or co-opted into the service of the bad guys? 

&gt; Of course, it is theoretically possible that a rogue agency could overcome these obstacles, either through intimidation or division of the spoils, and take over enough banks, power companies, grocery stores, etc. that only full-scale military assault would conquer it.  But the point is, from an initial position of market anarchy, these would-be rulers would have to start from scratch.

Al Capone started with nothing as the child of immigrants. Pablo Escobar was one seven children of a farmer and a schoolteacher. Starting from nothing seems to be one of the best recipes to create powerful criminals. This does not strike me as a deterrent. They both rose to power in markets that were as black as black gets, and the epitome of market anarchy, and yet they eventually held power over thousands of people and millions of dollars, even *with* a strong state attempting to stop them.

Let's recap- these people we so personally capable that a 'tyrannical state' with the power to coerce the resources of millions of people took years to subjugate them. If there were no state, the last barrier to their complete freedom is removed. What then?

Excuse me if I don't consider the presented article as very convincing.

&gt; That's why the state doesn't work. Libertarianism assumes humans are greedy, power hungry, act in their own self interest and goes from that. To say a system which assumes humans are greedy doens't work becouse humans are greedy makes no sense.

Don't go attacking a strawman. I claim that the system doesn't work because it assumes good, cooperative private parties will overcome with money the forces of greedy, ruthless bad people who use overwhelming force from the very beginning of a transaction.","1333240286"

Smaller companies, as well as other companies who are still tied to their original roots, will embrace modding and will even assist in the community by releasing tools and programs for it. Sadly, many of the big name companies, or smaller companies bought out by big name companies, regard modding as a faux pas that goes against their business model of squeezing as much money out of people as possible. I do indeed believe they are afraid of modding also because it is yet another sign that these big name companies are no longer relevant or needed when it comes to creating enjoyable content. Where would the money be for these giant companies if they existed in the Quake era where just about any weapon, map, skin, game mode, mod, UI features and enhancements, graphical updates, and so on, existed without paying the extra 15.99 just for a thimble of these possibilities? It is good that there exist companies that hold modding in high regard, for in many cases, they would probably not be where they are at now in the gaming industry if it was not for them, and for those who have turned their backs on the modding community, I hope that they continue to fade away.","1333240286"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;Well, a requiem is simply a mass for the dead, and the mass is the celebration of the Eucharist, which of course is the central ritualistic tradition of Christianity. It's difficult to see how Fauré could have written a requiem in the absence of these defining historical factors.

As long as people die and are missed requiems will be written. That the requiem was written still gives no reason for Jesus to be sacrified or the concept of sin to be fabricated in a way that a general act of forgiveness wasn't sufficient (to touch back to the original question)

It's probably safer to acknowledge Fauré's agnosticism as one prime origin of the lack of brimstone in the work.

&gt;And although he dropped the Dies Irae as a discreet movement, a brief portion of the Libera Me is reminiscent of its text, which is really more about the terrors associated with the day of judgment rather than eternal torment.

Libera me was actually added some years later and he seems to have used it for contrast before enveloping eternal rest once again. I do wonder whether this libera is not as much about judgement day as liberation from our fear and internal judgement as we can not communicate with the person we have lost. ","1333240288"

Who? I would advocate for a private collection agency.  
As far as force is concerned...  I would ask who is the initiator?  When you put up a fence and threaten to shoot anyone who encroaches on ""your"" land withou paying compensation,  you are the one initiating force.  If you don't pay compensation, you have no right to privately control unearned value.  If you aggress against others who try to use those uncompensated resources, it is you who initiates force.

&gt;Second, we all must take up space and land to exist, so the notion that somehow we're not allowed to exist without compensating others is... ludicrous.

And what if all the land is already owned?  Does a new child have no right to exist? 

&gt;And third, all land is not created equal. Land has value, and some land has way more value than others. How is it fair for a person with a prime beachside resort to pay less than some midwest farmer with 20 times the land? So how do you appropriately assign the taxes? You need a centrally planned agency to do that, and we know how well socialism works at assigning prices.

No geoist would advocate the system you laid out here.  Compensation is set by auction markets.  As long as nobody else wants to use a parcel of land you owe absolutely nothing.  However, once control of natural value is contested, it is held by the highest bidder. The controller of 10 square feet in Downtown Manhattan would pay considerably more than a farmer with hundreds of acres in Nebraska.

&gt;What happens if we start to colonize other planets? Suddenly the amount of land available changes, due to human labor. Granted this is a long ways off, but if you can't apply Georgism as a philosophy to future civilizations, it's not a consistent philosophy.

The first colonists on Mars won't have to pay any compensation, because that land will be uncontested.  However, the value of that land will rise as future colonists arrive and contest use of the land.

For example, I was on the shot about 15 years ago, and I had a period of varying levels of flow for the entire time I was on it (a year), plus about 6 months after I stopped. The only positive things it did for me was to eliminate my cramps and prevented pregnancy.

None of the bc pills I've tried ever decreased my periods, just controlled cramps and prevented pregnancy. 

As for the IUD, my OBs would always refuse to give me one. I had two claim they had never heard of the Mirena and refused to even talk about it.

I am now 41, have had one child and cannot/will not have any more kids. My periods are getting out of control at this point. On my heavy days, I get extremely lightheaded and my face, lips, and nail beds turn white (no clue what that means, but it's something I've noticed happening the last couple months).

I'll be making an appt with a well-reviewed GYN in the next couple weeks, and I'm going to ask her about the possibilities of having an endometrial ablation. I'm tired of having my period wreak a week or more of exercise for me and make me urgently need to sit lest I faint to the floor. So...I guess I am going to try to do something about it again. :) ","1333240308"

"masseffect","t5_2rc19","Very interesting, I think this is probably the strongest argument against IT I've seen. 

I don't think what you are saying has anything to do with authorial intent.  True, it gives an example of in game elements that constrain later author backtracking.  What is more compelling, to me, is that it's an analysis of a storytelling element that demonstrates why indoctrination is inconsistent with the core of the Mass Effect experience.  Mass Effect has transparent narration, never before in the series has it tricked the player.  It rarely even employs dramatic irony--generally when we see cut scenes where Shepard is not or is not yet present we see the whole story.  The rare exception are the cut scenes with the Illusive Man.  In any case, those cut scenes clearly represent real conversations.

I will push back a bit though.  The most obvious argument is that there are two senses in which the author can ""cash in"" the trust he has built in the narration of the story.  

The first is the sense you use it: because we trust the narrator, the game can allow us to experience events not directly perceived by Shepard without undue skepticism or confusion.  

There is another sense though.  The narrator has thus far played it straight, building our trust that what we see is what is really happening.  That is precisely what is necessary to pull off the ""fourth wall"" indoctrination many postulate explains the ending.  I'm not saying this point by any means overcomes the serious doubt that the game's consistent use of the first sense should engender in us that at the last second it would suddenly use the second.  What I am saying is that the only way the second use is possible is if the game does precisely this.  IT is wounded, but not defeated.  There is hope yet for the theory to recover.

The Mass Effect, contrary to what you suggest, has given you control of a character outside of physical reality.  This was the first game in which you controlled a character in a dream state, for example.  Shepard is subject to visions in both ME 1 and 2 from Prothean relics.  In both Mass Effect 2 (Overlord) and Mass Effect 3 (Geth consensus), Shepard enters a virtual reality.  

Your response will be that the game gives you visual and aural cues to clue you into the fact that you are not experiencing the typical ""real"" world.  IT folks would rebut, however, that the game *does* do this in the ending.  I'm of the opinion that the unlimited ammo and destroyed armor things really are game mechanics.  But your field of vision is sharply limited.  Time slows down, your character feels as if she is floating.  We hear voices saying no one made it even as we walk to the beam, and Anderson soon follows.  The Illusive Man looks significantly different from his appearance just hours/days (minutes in playtime) earlier at the Cerberus base.  Black shadows.  Shepard bleeds out the exact spot at which she shot Anderson, but only after Anderson dies in game. Not only that, but the Crucible itself uses the character from our dreams as its avatar.  

There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the typically transparent and honest narration is telling us something is altered or different about this reality.  More importantly, many of these clues are similar to those used to used to alert us of this fact in the dream, virtual reality, and hallucination sequences.

Anyway, that's my initial reaction.  Your post is really well thought out. Would love to hear your response.","1333240315"

You can basically attend every class you want in a Germany university, the question is if you will be allowed to write the exam at the end of the term and get some kind of degree for it. 

Germany Universities are much more focused on one subject.  You won't have those basic subjects everyone has in a US college, because much of this is already covered in secondary school. 

And it kinda makes sense for me, but if a university gives you the option to choose a certain subject they also have to make sure you can attend the classes and that's limited. What's you benefit if you can choose a combinations, but get a crappy schedule?","1333240326"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Obama 2008 was masterful.  He understood from the beginning that winning the primary was about winning delegates.  In caucus states, where he could get disproportionate impact from a few savvy supporters, he identified and encouraged them.  In winner-take-all primary states, he played to win or saved his cash.  In proportional states he fought hard so that a 5% win by Sen. Clinton would give her at most a one-delegate gain on him.  

First her campaign countered with ""we've got an insurmountable lead (in super-delegates, who can change their mind).""  He kept campaigning.  Then he took the lead in *committed* delegates.  ""There are still enough super-delegates to give us the win,"" said Sen. Clinton.  Then he took the lead in *overall* delegates and the supers began defecting.  ""It's not mathematically impossible yet..."" -- and then one day it was.

His ground game for the general was amazing -- names and addresses with key issues, so door-knockers who were veterans could focus on areas where veterans' issues were important.  

And of course his campaign stayed on-message.  D.C. tends to freak out when you ""lose"" a news cycle.  But rather than flail around and make disastrous short-term decisions to please the chattering classes in D.C., he stuck to his core principles, stayed calm, and weathered the micro-scandals that the media tried to drum up to sell papers.  When the GOP reacted by choosing a fundamentally un-serious VP candidate, his campaign kept their mouths shut and let her dig her own grave.

As Andrew Sullivan frequently points out, Obama is like the Road Runner.  Doesn't say a thing, just keeps moving.  When you think you've got him cornered, he grins, sticks out his tongue, and says ""Meep meep, motherfucker.""","1333240329"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","There are cheats built right into the game that give you unlimited ""resources / gas / whatever"", they are really easy to use, and they properly disable achievements as they should. If you use a trainer for the exact same thing there is really only one reason you would do that, and that is achievement cheating.

Now I don't know every single trainer there is out there, and maybe there is some exotic thing that makes all your units run backwards or whatever which is not possible through ingame cheats. But the problem is that anti-hack software can really only see that a program does *something* with Starcraft2's memory... it is pretty impossible to analyze what values exactly get hacked and whether that would be harmless fun or achievement cheating.

The big difference here is that Blizzard made a good effort to provide people with everthing they need to legally alter their single player experience - they can use cheats, and the enormous map editor allows you to mod pretty much everything conceivable. If you still use a hack once, you get a short ban to notice that you are not supposed to do that and that's it. EA/Bioware on the other hand have adopted a business strategy to make their games purposefully impossible to expand/improve by the community, so that their can better profit off their own DLC.

^(That said, I know Blizzard has done some bad shit in recent years, and lost a lot of my respect, too. But you really can't condemn them for this stupid trainer issue.)","1333240332"

The Image does not come back as a Messenger automatiically; when the Image left the battlefield, it lost all trace of what it used to copy, and in the graveyard is only a plain Image.

This is unlikely to include the original Messenger, since Player A's Undying trigger will resolve first. (Probably.)

Choosing not to copy anything is a legitimate option. If A chooses to have the Image copy nothing, it will ETB with a +1/+1 counter and therefore be 1/1. Note; it will **not** have the Image's ""sacrifice me"" trigger if A does this, since that is acquired as part of the copy ability.","1333240338"

I did my toes first to practice a little bit, and to decide if I wanted to go with a white base. (Sorry my feet look terrible. I decided last minute to post them, also, so I never cleaned them up.) I'm moderately happy with the results. I think the lines are too sharp. I used a makeup sponge to apply the paint, but I think I should have dabbed it around to transition the colors more. It was so much fun to do, I already want to take it off and do another one! Ha!

White - Not sure if it's Dusk by Simply Irresistible, or SI by Dusk.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Conclusion 
Brannan v. State serves an important victory for both the public and the Open Beaches Act. The holding dictates that beachfront homes which become located on the public beach following the natural migration of the vegetation line can be removed without compensation. The removal of these homes is not deemed a taking because the easement was not created, but rather historically dedicated. The ruling also serves as notice to homeowners who purchase or own beachfront homes that if vegetation lines shift the house may be removed under the Act without compensation.

...That's not what this says at all. It actually says if you own a beachfront house and the vegetation line changes the government can take your house without ANY compenstation because the land was made for public use and not private based upon the ""Rolling easement"". 

Edit: Here is the website OP originally linked in the comments section that he or she has since taken down either way it could do with a [reposting](http://masglp.olemiss.edu/Water%20Log/WL30/30.1rollingeasements.htm).

"airsoft","t5_2qi2x","StormShark is giving you solid advice. As for your questions:

AoE stands for Angle of Engagement. It deals with the angle that the sector gear makes contact with the piston. Personally, I have never seen a real need for it but lots of people swear by it.

Reshimming the gears, when done properly, makes sure that the gears are meshing with each other correctly. It greatly increases the lifespan of your gears, which helps your gun last longer. You also typically experience better rate of fire and have a quieter gun.

R-hop is a new modification done to AEGs that has given great results in range and accuracy tests. Basically, it gives the bb a wider and longer contact patch in the hop-up window. That causes much more backspin and also helps to ensure that the backspin is perfectly in the vertical axis.

Go [here](http://forums.airsoftmechanics.com/) and read through the Technical forums. That will help you to better understand what StormShark suggested. Hope this helps!","1333240352"

Maybe they would also be told that people without their trait are responsible for the war or something. After the fallout levels have reached a point where people can live outside the vault, they would all be unleashed with an unfaltering belief that people who do not possess their physical trait are inferior, and maybe even dangerous.","1333240358"

This book has become something of a running joke among historians of science and it is dutifully mentioned as a prime example of misinformation in the preface of most modern works on science and religion. The flat Earth is discussed in chapter 2 and one can almost sense White's confusion that hardly any of the sources support his hypothesis that Christians widely believed in it. He finds himself grudgingly admitting that Clement, Origen, Ambrose, Augustine, Isodore, Albertus Magnus and Aquinas all accepted the Earth was a globe - in other words none of the great doctors of the church had considered the matter in doubt. Although an analysis of what White actually says suggests he was aware that the flat Earth was largely a myth, he certainly gives an impression of ignorant Christians suppressing rational knowledge of its real shape.""

And they were right to give the first half of ME3 a 10/10. Everything before and slightly after Tuchanka was epic and astoundingly amazing. Then after Rannoch, things go downhill and speed up so much, youre basically playing an FPS. But most reviewers wont get that far and it sucks because we don't get an accurate representation of the game overall.

Then again, how many of us would have still bought ME3 if IGN, GameInformer, theEscapist etc all said the ending of ME3 sucked? I'm not defending anything or anyone, I'm legitimately asking: who would have bought ME3 if reviews said the ending stunk?","1333240373"

I grew up in South Dakota and I am of Sioux heritage (I do not post here often but when I do 95% of it relates to the Sioux Indians). In S.D. there is a Native American Day. [In 1989 the South Dakota legislature unanimously passed legislation proposed by Governor George S. Mickelson to proclaim 1990 as the ""Year of Reconciliation"" between Native Americans and whites, to change Columbus Day to Native American Day and to make Martin Luther King's birthday into a state holiday. Since 1990 the second Monday in October has been celebrated as Native American Day in South Dakota.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_Day)

If the government can't work properly without taking that much from the wealthy, it's a poorly run government (which every state + the U.S. is). Let's try not going to war, and maybe we'll talk about using some of that money to help out the needy. 

About Elon, he wouldn't HAVE the money to build rockets if you taxed his income at 80%. He really is a billionaire, and if you took what you're talking about away from him, he would only have about $400 million, which isn't nearly enough to do what he's doing. And before you make fun of me for saying ""only"" $400m, grasp that he's not buying a new house every day. He's employing a thousand highly-skilled workers and ushering a new era of spaceflight.

Drawing lines from what I voluntarily participate in with a small group of consenting indiviual --&gt; how government tries to take money from people are two different things.

If we are to tax income, I believe a progressive structure makes sense. NOT because it can take more money from the rich: because there is a level of poverty at which people can't spare income.

The goal of the federal government should be to follow the minimal requirements of the constitution, go to ware only to defend the survival of our nation (not to conquer Islam and its oil), and to spend as little money as necessary in doing so.","1333240387"

I have had no issues whatsoever; one of my lunches consisted of a fully loaded chipotle burrito! (and you know how huge those are - 5xx-9xx calories even). So personally I haven't had any issues transitioning whatsoever (no stomach pain, no uncomfortable issues, no weird bowel movements, etc). The first couple of days (I'm on day 6 of hybrid) my weight was still dropping, now it is steadying and totally have to be more careful of my calorie count - I've had to skip meals a few times because the lunches out there are on calorie overdrive! One thing I am not doing though is snacking and eating empty junk; all that I eat I am keeping as much nutrient as I can do it. I've also lined up things like soy protein (containing vitamins), spirulina, krill oil (megared), aloe vera gel. I just got my dedicated wheat grass juicer and my first wheatgrass flat. :) I keep getting tempted to go back to strictly juicing - but I'll need to hold out at least for a couple of weeks before doing that again (really only so I don't burnout - I loved it but just thinking ahead).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I worked at a NH liquor store in a college town during vacations when I came home from school. Even after working there for 3 years, I was always surprised by the amount of ass holes that would come in.

One of my worst days happened after my first few weeks working there. It was pretty busy, we had three cashiers on and all of us had a line. A white guy in probably his mid-40s and his latina gf, mid-20s at most, were next in my line. When they came up, I asked the woman if she had her ID (in NH we card everyone in the party that appears to be under 30) and she asked me why, so I explained the policy. She left to grab her passport that was left in the car. The guy stayed and was really friendly, he even apologized for holding up the line. However, when the woman returned, she slammed her ID on the counter and asked me very cooly ""So, what gives you the right to discriminate against me?"" I was extremely taken aback, as I was only doing my job, and tried to explain that I was just following store policy, but this chick was clearly on some high-horse morality kick from some law ethics lecture, and refused to let me get a word in, accusing me of discriminating against her because of her ethnicity since I clearly didn't card the white man she was with. When I tried to explain that I didn't card him because of his obvious age, this only made her more angry because now I was discriminating her because of their relationship etc. etc. Unfortunately, I don't really deal with confrontation well, and as she continued to berate me, I could feel that I was on the verge of tears. So, not wanting to cry in front of this lady, I finally blurted out: ""Well if you feel that way then you can go through another line,"" and I booked it to the back to cry and calm down.

My manager and one of my co-workers later told me that after I left the woman became very quiet and was visibly shaken/embarrassed when she realized how big of a bitch she had been. The couple had to get in another line and when she was again asked for her ID, she handed it over without complaint, and the guy asked the cashier if I was okay and that he felt awful about how upset I had gotten. So, while I wasn't able to stand up for myself at the time, I can only hope that she will always remember the effect that her words can have on people.

TL;DR: Self-righteous woman makes me cry after accusing me of discriminating against her, and gets a reality check when she realizes that she was the one being a bitch.","1333240425"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","If you think about this starting from basic physics, the result makes sense. As some people have alluded to, it's the acceleration of the vehicle which consumes fuel, not the velocity. Inertia means that the car would continue to roll forever without requiring fuel to push it.  However, friction and air drag applies a force (F~cv^2) that needs to be overcome to maintain the same velocity. The fuel required to do this is relatively small compared to the amount of fuel and energy it takes to accelerate (F=ma) a large chunk of metal up to speed. Even if the right handed trip took more time, this only means that the drag force had to be overcome for longer, but the number of times you accelerated from being stopped is much less, leading to a large savings in fuel. 
This is also neglecting the efficiency of the car in higher gears as well. In low gears, the engine will burn more fuel per mile than in higher gears.","1333240445"

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","I always imagine what I'd do if I was mugged. My favourite idea based on my appearance is to pretend I am their gang leader's lawyer and he's gonna be mighty upset if he finds out I'm mugged but this has to be knowledge based on me knowing who their gang leader is.

Then is the one where I void my bowels while emptying my bladder in front of them. I think they would just leave because of awkwardness.

Lastly is the one where I turn the tables and mug them. I'm sure there is a sequence of linguistic events and animalistic behaviour where this is feasible even for me, though I am yet to discover it. I imagine part of it involves ""strutting the walk"" and using colloquialisms such as ""gat"", ""shit"" and ""knock"".

All of this assumes they don't have firearms and/or other weapons. I wouldn't hesitate to hand over everything to armed road agents.

To try to touch some of the specifics you mentioned: practically, there won't be a huge difference between AMD and Intel so long as you get a good CPU. Intel CPUs tend to be recommended most around here, and they have some of the best available. SSDs will drastically cut load times, but are significantly more expensive than HDDs.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Does she put in more effort than you into other parts of your shared burden, e.g. does she do 80% of the cooking, cleaning, organizing, etc. If she does, then you shouldn't complain - you have a somewhat anachronistic set-up that probably works well for you two.

On the other hand, if you are an equal contributor to the housework, then her contribution to the relationship is sex and female companionship (you are getting sex, right?) and your contribution is being a stable provider. Some people like that role. If you don't, then you need to change it. 

She is being a dick by not remembering her responsibilities. It is not unreasonable for you to ""be a dick"" by reminding her. However, if you attempt to change the contributory dynamic between you two, you need to be fully cognizant of the fact that she may not like you being anything less than a full provider for her needs, and leave you, throw tantrums, cheat, etc. Are you ready to deal with the consequences of your actions?

EDIT: Apologies for possibly over contributing, but I can't help it - I was once in your situation and I feel like pontificating. I just saw from your post history that you lost your virginity when you were 28.

These paths aren't on the scale of individual cell bodies. They are running along substantial portions of the entire length or breadth of the entire brain. And we know that there is lateral symmetry in the brain, which would imply a general lateral pathway. We also know there is a central switch for sensory processing, which would imply a symmetry for connections between the thalamus and the cortex. Shrug.","1333240460"

His dad died four years later. When Artie tried to kill himself with the knife, it was just as he reached the age that his dad had - in his twisted logic, living longer than his dad was able to would have been wrong.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There was a man at my work named Bird. He was the definition of a gentle giant. He had a pleasant, calming voice, and never cursed.

Bird worked the tech support for the company. Well, when the company was bought out, they kept some people on, and he was promoted to the head of the tech department.

One day, we got this customer. He was that snobby, angry entitled rich kind of customer, someone who thought the world owed him something for gracing it with his presence. He was a clean cut, needle eyed little pissant, and everyone knew he was trouble the moment he came in.

He had bought a Sony Vaio, which are like the Macintosh of PCs (if you know what I mean), and demanded that it be fixed under the insurance provided through the previous company. We were all perfectly fine with that and tried to work with him on it.

The problem was, he wanted us to perform magic. He thought there were some kind of strings we could pull to make the repairs go faster, so he stuck around for hours. He started getting angry and yelling at customer support and the tech department.

Why didn't the management throw him out? Well, we had a new GM, and he wasn't really comfortable with his power. He was a dopey man that kind of fell into the position after putting in his prerequisite slave hours. His level of involvement in the store was sporadic, and his sizable wisdom could be read directly from company policy without any room for further interpretation.

I don't know exactly what was said in the tech department, because I was at the customer service desk when it happened, but after hours and hours of berating and shouting at employees, Bird, the gentle giant, turned to the man and raised one defiant, the customer is NOT always right, middle finger.

That story sent ripples through the store. No one would've believed it if he hadn't been caught on camera. The GM, following his company policy instead of his moral code, said he had to fire Bird. For sticking up for everyone at work, Bird got shafted. What happened to the customer? They fixed his computer and he never shopped there again.

What can we learn from this story? There's a lot of things that can be read from it. Personally, it created a creeping doubt in me of working for others just to have a job. If I put in the requisite slave hours to become GM, would I be as hollowed out as that man? After decades of work, would I fire Bird?","1333240468"

In some of these areas the CBC is the only media source that covers the local issues that matter to them.

Without the news rooms that comes with stations like the CBC small town journalism would be almost non-existent.  

Plenty of people get their news from radio or tv.  People on the internet always assume that because *they* get their news primarily online then *everyone* does.  That's simply not the case.  In fact, for most radio and tv are still their major source for information.  And the most trusted.

Further, copying these basic skills is really underwhelming for an ultimate.

Do you think companies should be able to circumvent copyright by recording professional musicians playing a pop song written by someone else, and selling it for a cheaper price than the original artist?

You can't claim a chord as your intellectual property, as it's been used for decades by people all over the world. You need a composition, multiple notes or chords with well-defined lengths, in a well-defined order.

You haven't explained yourself, so that's kind of funny.

&gt;There is a majority of whites and a majority of men but that does not equal a majority of white males.

And your argument is basically ""you can't know for certain!"", which means that you don't understand how statistics work. If there's a majority of white people and a majority of men then it's probable (which is what this is about) that the majority are white males. This is not a scientific study. Might as well claim that you can't know for certain that people weren't lying about their gender.

&gt;Using words like ""any"" sets yourself up to be wrong. Using the words like ""people"" means some people, using words like ""don't have any sense"" means absolutely none. If you want people to understand what you mean, then you should use words correctly.

It wasn't ""people"", it was ""thousands of people."" This is hilarious, considering the last part.

&gt;This statement alone shows you do not understand SRS.

Yes I do, it's that your type of slacktivist believes that being racist in order to try to ""shock privileged people"" (which is nonsensical) justifies being racist. It doesn't, and you're an apologist for bigotry.

"techsupport","t5_2qioo","Don't install ""Ubuntu Netbook"" on your Dell Mini 10. I did, and somehow, my battery wouldn't charge anymore (either booted in Windows, Ubuntu, computer off, it just wouldn't charge). Good thing I was still under Best Buy's ""14 day return warranty"" or I would of had a ""non-portable"" netbook.
If you want to daul-boot here's how you do it. You definitelly want to back-up all your data, and have a usb DVD drive and a copy of Windows XP in handy in case you bork your partitions.

1. Go to http://gparted.sourceforge.net/download.php and download the ""stable release"" ISO
2. Go to http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ and click the ""download for windows"" button near the top of the page to download the .exe file
3. Whip out a usb stick that you don't care about the info on it (it has to be greater than 512MB)
4. Insert your usb in your computer and memorize it's Drive letter ( H for example)
5 Go to the ""unetbootin.exe"" file that you downloaded and click on it.
6. Instead of ""distribution"" choose the ""Disk image"" at the bottom, and click on the button on the right and navigate to the ""Gparted ISO"" you downloaded.
7. On the bottom, choose your USB drive letter
8. Click ""OK"" and if it asks you to format the drive to fat32, do it.
9. After it's done installing, reboot your computer and press the function key for ""boot menu"" (usually F12)
10. After gparted starts up, you'll see something like this: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/screens/gparted_1_big.png
11. Right-click on the partition and choose ""Resize"". Re-size your partition to whatever size you want.
12. Pray
13. Click ""apply changes"" and DO NOT EVEN TOUCH YOUR COMPUTER
12. After it's done, just create an EXT4 partion from the ""unallocated"" space
13. Restart into windows and do steps 2-8 except with your ubuntu ISO
14. Boot into your ubuntu USB stick
15. Choose to install ubuntu in the ext4 partiton you created in gparted
16. When it asks to install ""Grub"", say ""Yes""
17. After it's done installing, boot your computer and you'll see a ""Grub screen"" (http://i35.tinypic.com/n5oeox.jpg), choose Ubuntu to boot into Ubuntu, and Windows XP to boot into XP. You can also change your grub settings to automatically boot in either windows or grub.

Funny, but public schools are incapable of ""getting those notions"" in anyone's head.

Worry about your own children fucktard. Their children will live on, they'll survive, and by historical standards they'll even do ok.

Huh? Have you never experienced public schools *in general*? They're all shitholes designed to force-feed stupid bullshit. That 1 out of 10,000 of the myths have been changed does nothing to make this particularly better or particularly worse.

This middle aged couple came in to try and return some items in the pet store I work in. There's like :$200 worth of items and they didn't have the receipt. My manager, let's call her Shelley, calmly tells them that without a receipt, all we can do is give them store credit (sometimes we make exceptions, but we had been getting fraudulent returns recently and anyways, that was way more money than normal). The husband starts freaking out, screaming at her and getting probably an inch from her face. Shelley is maybe, maybe 5'2 and she just put on her poker face and kept saying there was nothing more she can do because the company takes this shit seriously and can fire us over that big of a return without proof of a receipt. They would have to wait for our general manager Joe to get back from his lunch.

This guy is livid, screaming at her at the top of his lungs and all I could do was stand there awkwardly trying not to he noticed so I could tackle the fucker if he touched her (we are a close group of people, I regularly text Shelley on our days off). 
Finally Joe comes in and Shelley tries to explain what's going on, but the guy is talking over her just saying 'give me my money back, I'm never coming back here, I just want my fucking money back you thieves' etc. Joe explains that they will do the return only, ONLY because he was there and that his employee did the right thing and that if he didnt stop yelling he could take his stuff and leave. The man grumbled at 'that was all he wanted', made some halfass apologetic remark to Joe, not even to Shelley, took his money and left.

- besorg dir Stecklinge, von einem Grower oder aus Österreich. Damit hast du garantiert Weibchen am Start, bei Samen (auch bei feminisierten) ist das immer so ne Sache.

- wenn doch Samen, dann lieber ein paar Euro mehr in ne gute, stabile Genetik investieren. Schau dich mal auf Samenwahl um :-)

- wenn Indoor, dann mit Schrank,VSG, 2 NDL's (Wachstum und Blüte), Lüftung mit Filter,  ein Ventilator.( zwecks Kosten sparen, es soll ja Leute geben die mit ESL's growen. Hab da keine Erfahrung; spart zwar Strom, bringt aber auch weniger Erträge.)

- Beim Düngen IMMER genau an die Vorgaben halten.

- Fang nicht mit gleich einer Blueberry o.Ä. an, besorg dir was leichtes. Bei einer Orange Bud z.B. kann schonmal von Anfang an weniger schief gehen.

-  immer wenn du nicht weiter weißt, es gibt genug Foren in denen alles schonmal beantwortet wurde. 

- EBAY!!! dort gibts alles was das Growerherz begehrt, und das auch noch wesentlich billiger als beim nächsten Growshop. 

- Mach dich auf eine fette Stromnachzahlung gefasst :D

I mean, if you owned the actual data on the disc, you'd own their source code, their engine, their art, textures, everything - and be capable of making unlimited copies. It would shatter the company's ability to make a profit, and probably collapse the gaming industry.

I think ethically, it's entirely up to the software publisher/content creator. They made the game and spent the money to get it made and published. It's up to them to say how it gets released and used.

They may be a dick about it, but I think, at the end of the day...they made it - it's their call.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","What lies? What are you talking about? We come here because it's the subreddit dedicated to Islam and we have a right to talk about Islam as well. You say that /r/exmuslim is a circlejerk but if there is only one opinion around in /r/islam (ie. muslims' opinion) then this is a circlejerk too! And in that case, well, people who know nothing about Islam nor the issue of apostasy will never learn more about it... If you don't like our opinions then debate them and we will enter the debates with you because two opinions are better than one.

A handful of cases? That is not true, and there are still people being killed for not being muslims in muslim countries, just check the news! I have received death threats from a muslim that discovered I wasn't a muslim anymore and fortunately I moved away and now I'm safer, but there are so many exmuslims living in fear, you can't deny that. And even if they were only a handful, then it is a terrible injustice for people to be killed for not believing! That is why we indeed fear the reaction of our people. Because many of us would be chased from their families, would get killed, jailed or discriminated, and that is extremely unfair, no matter how many of us are victims of that, that's an issue in the muslim world and in every muslim community around the world!

I didn't tell you to trust me, I told you to go look at impartial reviews from non-muslims and non-exmuslims. No matter what one fellow exmuslim did, I don't tell you to believe us, nor do I tell you to believe imams, I tell you to believe people who aren't winning from telling you that this is right or wrong, but would just show you the facts. An imam is here to guide you, so his opinion can be biased as he's a muslim himself, an exmuslim's opinion can be biased too against Islam, that's undeniable, but someone who's an academic and has nothing to do with all of this will probably be less inclined to hide the facts and the truth whatever it is.

Yes, I do believe that many things in Islam are wrong and that people who realise it should leave it instead of changing and modernising it. But the point is that you cannot say that Islam is entirely pure and all-loving. Living as an atheist is living free from all of this, so I wish more people would go this way but the purpose of /r/exmuslim, regardless of what I have said in one of the threads, is not to show Islamic as demonic, but to help other people leave it and feel better without it when they need to. 

&gt; If you want to live free of Islam and muslims, what exactly is stopping you from leaving the community? Nothing at all.

Why don't I have the right to live peacefully and not threatened every day by people who used to call me a brother? Why do they want my death now? Why do they despise me? Because I don't obey to their beliefs anymore? That's absolutely unfair and that shows Islam as an intolerant religion. Where is this whole tolerance everybody's talking about if you don't accept exmuslims at all?

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","This is a difficult situation for everyone. I get it. I don't have to agree with you to understand where both of you are coming from. I've also had a lot of experiences in my life where I thought one way and then changed my mind once I experienced it from the other side. Empathy is so important because without it, you can end up making decisions that ruin other people's lives (even if you have the best intentions).

I think one of the reasons why you experience so much hostility here is because (intentionally or not) you make a  lot statements where you basically dictate her feelings without considering her feelings. 

&gt;  I never make her feel like that though

This might or might not be true. I'm not saying you do, but you can't say that you don't with any level of certainty because you're not in her situation. I mean, I have the financial upper hand in my relationship and I do my best to never, ever make my boyfriend feel bad about it. However, that doesn't change the fact that it's true. 

I know he thinks about it because whenever he gets paid, he's insists on spending every single cent on things I want to ""make up"" for it even if I tell him it's unnecessary. I have the luxury of not thinking about it most of the time because I'm the one who makes it. Yet I feel guilt whenever he overcompensates on dates. The fact that he DOESN'T talk about it, makes it that much more clear that he considers my money ""mine"" and his money ""his,"" especially when I always consult him when spending money. I would never let my boyfriend spend the money I make without asking me *because* I consider it our money. Questioning what he does with it, to me, implies equality because I'm not just letting him do whatever until I say stop. It shows that my money is his money and both of us are responsible for treating it like the finite resource it is.

Of course you're free to disagree with me. Everyone has different opinions on how finances should be dealt with and I'm not trying to change your views on that. I'm just trying to show you how her feelings might be different than what you thought. Good intentions are great, but they're not everything.

Communication is just so incredibly important as a general rule of thumb, but right now, it's critical. I'm sorry that you're the one who has to suppress your feelings, but that's the way it is. If it makes you feel better, I'm sure she wishes you were pregnant and not her. 

I think if I had to try and get one point across to you, it would be that having a child is the biggest commitment a person will ever make in their life. If you get your way (ie. convince her to have the baby), realize that your days of independence, self-satisfaction, and emotional/physical indulgence are over. Think about the emotional roller coaster you have been on and come to terms with the fact that your child will make you feel this way countless times over the next 18 years and probably for the rest of your life. They will do obscenely stupid things that both of you will be directly responsible for. If things don't go the way you want, if they are ungrateful, or disregard your opinion, you can't leave. If, God forbid, it's not born healthy, that's your problem too. You can end your relationship with your girlfriend, but you can't end your relationship with your children. (On a lighter note, I should warn you now that between a newborn and grad-school, you're probably not going to have sex again for a really long time.)

It is so incredibly important that you understand no matter how tempting it is that you do not back out under any circumstances, even if you're given the opportunity. If you do, you are a bad person. No exceptions. There is nothing that you can feel or anything that can happen that will justify you turning your back on your child. **Nothing.** Backing out will make you a bad person until the day you die.

On a less extreme note, understand that by changing your girlfriend's mind, you are accepting partial responsibility for the direction her life takes. Obviously, unlike with the baby, there are limits, but as the mother, her happiness and success are very closely related to your child's potential happiness and success, so you're gonna have a personal stake in it. 

I apologize if you're insulted. I'm not trying to talk down to you. It's just that so many people think that they're ready when they're not and because it's so much easier for men to walk away, a lot of them do. Please don't. I'm not saying you will, I'm just covering my bases. Don't do it. Don't even think about it. I'm rooting for the both you, and if a child is even potentially involved, I want everyone to be happy. It would be irresponsible for me to give advice and not put emphasis on the health and happiness of the child in question. It is so easy to be won over by the idea of having a child without realizing what it takes or what you're going to have to give up to successfully raise one. 

There's nothing wrong with wanting a child, but unless you know you're willing to give everything you have towards raising it, please don't have it. **Know** that you're ready. Know what it means and be prepared to step up. I am begging you. This is serious business.","1333240530"

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","The Intel unit is another Asetek unit, just like most of the others. Pretty much identical to the H70 Core, but comes with a fan. With a decent fan, they're basically the same price.

Personally I'd take the H80 over both of them, as it comes with 2 pretty good fans stock, and will outperform them.

As for the risks, the biggest would be the pump failing, which would possibly be a concern if you're planning on keeping this thing for 7 years  (!). [Side note, I'd say you'd likely be better served by buying a new machine at half the price every 3.5 years, as that's where the meaty value is]. As an owner of both a big air cooler, and an H100, I have to say the closed loop coolers are very nice especially when having to trouble shoot something. I also find they look a lot cleaner than those monstrous air coolers.

But that said, if you're looking for a big, high end cooling solution in that price range, your two best choices are the H100 (if you have a proper case for it, or H80 if you don't) for closer loop liquid cooling; and the Phanteks PH-TC14PE if you're going big air. The warranty on the Corsair liquid loops is 5 years.

Also: don't buy a closed loop solution thinking that you're ""getting into liquid cooling"". If you really want to get into liquid cooling, buy an XSPC Rasa RS240 or RX240 kit. Everything you need to make a full custom CPU water loop, with the ability to expand it to a GPU or whatever else later. It's not too difficult to install, and if you read the guides on Overclock.net about how to do proper leak testing, etc, the risk is extremely small.","1333240535"

"mcgill","t5_2rhkw","* I disagree. In comparison to U of T, Queen's, actually, pretty much ANY canadian school, they literally HAND you a schedule. Engineering is usually one of the few majors that you have zero flexibility in scheduling your own courses. This is not true at McGill. Yes, you do have to largely follow the suggested curriculum to graduate, but there are a lot of courses that you can flex around and move. I speak from experience; I came in with a lot of credits from high school, and that gave me a flexibility that is rarely seen elsewhere. If want to take a bio course, I take a bio course. If I want to take a polisci course, I take a polisci course. If i want to NOT take a course, then I can just take one less course a semester. 

Additionally, you get a chance to specialize early. This is not really a BIG thing, but I think it is pretty cool. When you sign up for Engineering, you sign up for Chemical. Or Mechanical. Or Civil. you don't just sign up for engineering. What this does is that it gives you a chance to do stuff relevant to you. I have friends at U of T right now that are taking a few general engineering courses that aren't relevant and that I don't need to take. 

* Notice I specified ""we have great profs and we do great research"". If you want practicality, go to community college and get an engineering technology degree. Engineering degrees in school don't really give PRACTICAL knowledge unless you are going into a very specific field; if you end up working for a company, the only parts of your education that you'll be using in the earlier years are your design and drafting skills, much of which you will learn on the job anyways. 

Personally, I would not recommend going to a school or a place for the next 4 years just ""because the place is cool"" or because ""I'll become more interesting"". 

Just make sure you are picking this school for all the right reasons.

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","This please.  As a hot-pepper aficionado, you quickly realize that there are different sauces for different occasions.  Sriracha is good on a lot of things, but that flavor profile does not jive with what I would consider to be traditional salsa.  I actually make my own salsa from scratch and have found that because most sauces contain vinegar, they're not that great for adding heat to salsa since they really mess with the flavor.

If you are uncertain, bring a very mild batch of salsa and a smaller batch of very hot salsa.  Find out what people's heat tolerances are and then blend them together to get somewhere in-between.  This honestly works better when you make your own salsa; I don't eat the processed stuff because it honestly pales in comparison to home-made, but I'm sure if you buy within the same brand, it will come out OK.

The best way to do it would be to bring fresh diced peppers in addition to your salsa, but the problem with this is that the heat doesn't really blend with the salsa until the whole mixture has rested for a few hours.

This will involve killing a live mouse. This is the same reason that buying beef at the supermarket, over a year, makes you directly responsible for the death of a cow.

The only way one could make the argument you are making is if the mouse was found in the wild, or in a house, or as roadkill, etc., where its death would not contribute to the perpetuation of mouse-death. This was done with http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38376048/ns/us_news-weird_news/t/its-percent-wrapped-roadkill-worlds-most-shocking-beer/#.T3eiTsy1W5M

As a sidenote, we can also stir up other weird philosophical arguments, like: If the earrings become a sadistic hit, will it increase demand, allowing less ethical competitors to take over the market? If the mouse lived, would it  become a parent to more mice which would inevitably die in mouse traps? etc. Probably not relevant here, but food for thought.","1333240548"

I can see why some people (wrongly as our whole system of swearing is 9-% derived from sexual terms and it is gendered but not directed at a gender) get upset at say the word cunt, and why particular terms that are there to explicitly deride a group of people poof, n-word etc are just not acceptable (although SRS does seem to miss times where the playful concept of irony comes into the equation). 

My point is more it is utterly stupid to discuss sucks it because (almost) everybody knows it is harmless. It shouldn't need debating.

"politics","t5_2cneq","*take this with a grain of salt, I heard this second hand and don't know how accurate the info is, plus I'm a bit sketchy on the details -happened a while back.

Here's a reason you might not want to just hand over your ID to an officer:

 I had a friend who was riding his bike in a parking lot (he was a semi-pro flatland bmx rider) and a police officer stopped and asked him for his ID.  My friend complied, the officer ran his ID and then went on about his way.

Fast forward a years or two later and said friend is applying for a promotion at his security-guard job.  This promotion required a background check, and when they ran him through, it came about that he was on some kind of list for suspicious persons (I can't remember the exact name of the list), and so he was denied his promotion.

It turned out that the officer that had asked for his ID, had ran his info through their data base, and either that had automatically put my friend on this list, or the officer had taken it upon himself to put my friend on this list. This was post 9/11, and this ""suspicious persons"" list had something to do with the new powers police were granted through homeland security.

Eventually my friend got cleared and got his promotion.

Anyone else know anything about this? Sounds kinda shady to me, and perhaps unconstitutional.","1333240555"

"Foodforthought","t5_2rete","I don't understand the point of this article. It's a venue for selling weapons. Ta da!

The only thing that *would* be interesting is talking about how Boeing weapons end up being used against Americans, but on this point nearly everything he says is misleading or wrong:

&gt; an organized free-for-all in which American companies like Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics sold weapons to almost anyone who could afford them.

Er, no. This stuff is [ITAR controlled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations), and subject to regulation by arms embargoes of the US, the UN, and OSCE.

&gt; One vendor peddling Javelin missiles said, “[They’ve] been incredibly successful not only for US troops, but also for other forces as well.” I took this to mean that American soldiers and their enemies could potentially be using the same weapons to blow each other to smithereens—meaning straight-up profits for the companies selling them.

Show me an anti-American regime that is a [JAVELIN user](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FGM-148_Javelin#Users).

&gt; It was readily apparent that SOFEX’s conceit is a thinly veiled excuse to sell US arms to any military with the means.

See ITAR, above.

&gt; American armament companies are theoretically prohibited from selling to rogue regimes, but there’s a loophole that says it’s OK for “nations friendly to Jordan” to buy their weapons.

Citation? Does anybody know what he's talking about? There are zero Google results for the phrase he quotes.

There are officially five rogue states: Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. Show me the loophole that allows an American armament company to sell a weapon to any of those states.

&gt; I spoke with another ex-Marine and Iraq war vet who identified for me some of the weapons for sale at SOFEX that had been used against him and his comrades during his tours in Iraq and Afghanistan (one of the worst offenders was China’s Norinco, whose missiles are widely used by insurgents in Iraq).

Chinese weapons being used against the US. Not US weapons. This should not come as a surprise.

And what does he mean ""whose missiles are widely used by insurgents in Iraq""? Does he mean the Iranian-made (not ""China's"") NORINCO-derived rockets (not ""missiles"") that were used occasionally (not ""widely"") in 2007 against US forces in Iraq? Does he mean the mostly Russian-derived Iraqi-assembled Al-Samoud 2 missiles which used a couple Chinese-made components, which the Iraqi forces fired at coalition forces in Kuwait, and which insurgents certainly never acquired?

I might get proven wrong, but I'll take a guess that no Iraqi insurgent has *ever* used a Chinese missile against coalition forces.


And there are plenty of other bizarre statements:

&gt; Every SOFEX commences with a “show of force” arranged by King Abdullah. This time it consisted of elite military training exercises focused on antipiracy special ops. I watched as mock combatants fell from the sky with purple smoke coming out of their asses as they overtook a “boat” made of a bunch of shipping containers, marooned in the middle of the desert. I thought, “What the fuck is happening here?” No one seemed to have a grasp on reality.

"TransphobiaProject","t5_2s5w4","That's the problem right there, everyone has to suck it up sooner or later, and you know, most people manage it. It's call learning to turn the other cheek and let the little things slide because they aren't worth the fight.

It's tiring to be told suck it up ? It's more tiring to see every little thing that could possible be construed as a smite against a transperson trumped up as though it's more justification for the 'cause'.

George Takei is an LGBT hero and inspiration to many the world over.

This whole thread, it's one more person from the T community crying over spilt milk, or as is more often the case, the potential of possibly spilt milk, if you squint just right it almost looks like an attack.

Yes, there is a lot of insecurity that goes hand in hand with being transgender and it's easy to feel the brunt of cruel and heartless jokes, to feel that you are an object of amusement or derision, to imagine that everyone who looks at you is laughing.

Reality check, the 'cause' is not advanced one inch with rubbish like this, in fact it's probably straight up damaging and will only help to distance members of all communities.

READ THE DAMN JOKE !! It does not actually mention the gender of the person being told to undress. Getting bent out of shape over an assumption is in two well chosen words "" fucking paranoid "".

If we as a community put as much effort into actually accepting and supporting everyone in our own community and treated all gender expression as equally valid we might all just be a lot better off.

I don't think to myself 'gosh, women are weaker, this game means nothing now'. Just like you don't stop playing a game even though you have the upper body strength of a kitten. Games are fantasy.

I would buy more games if there were girl leads. I specifically buy games when girls are a choice.

Brite tanks are built specifically to hold high pressures, both for force carbonation and for high pressures of co2 to push the beers into a packaging line. Brite tanks are often rated to 45-60 psi 
where regular fermentation tanks are rated to 15-20. 

Folks have been worried that centrifuges pull out too much flavor and are abrasive to the beers, shearing being the main issue. I think if Vinnie at Russian River isnt worried about it, it's a non-issue. ","1333240568"

I stated at her thinking WTF lady? Then had a tiny freakout.

No cell phones, so it was not uncommon to just drop by your buddy's house to see if he was home. We always hung out in larger groups and would have more fun than you can imagine just being complete dumb asses. Also, having a secret stash of porn magazines was an essential part of being a teenager. Homework was hand-written, but I started using a typewriter and later a computer when I got into college. My senior thesis (48 pages) had to be stored on three separate floppy discs. No spell check either. Oh, and you could get into a really good college with 3.3 GPA and a 1150 SAT score. My tuition at UCLA was under a thousand dollars my freshman year. Very few kids needed financial aid because you could pay most of your costs working part time.

"lawpractice","t5_2sk4y","I think Square's fee is just a cost of business, and I know at least on our old/manual CC reader, there was some fine print about charging a ""convenience fee"" as verboten to cover the bank's service charge. For most of my crim defense work, it is flat fee stuff, so I certainly *could* raise my prices 3% or whatever to make up the difference. But honestly, I think clients prefer a nice round number (e.g., $1500 for a DWI-1) vs $1545 or whatever.

As for immigration law, I think it is likely very lucrative, but as you said, that shit is complicated, and I just have zero experience really in that area. Like everything, it depends on your location, and honestly, like everything in the law, it depends on whether or not that area of practice interests you. I enjoy going to court and trying cases. Therefore admin law, bankruptcy, tax law, estate planning, etc. don't really interest me that much. I know plenty of attys who hate going to court tho, so whatever floats your boat, ya know? I think if you could tap into the employment-immigration niche, there's good money to be made there (esp if the employer is paying you to get their employees work visas and stuff). Sadly, I think most of that work is done by big firms, and the immigration work that solos see is more the plz-don't-deport-me/crim law stuff, where the clients may not have the money to pay for that kind of expertise and the cases tend to drag on for 18+ months.

Anyway, just starting out, I might look at bankruptcy (if your brain is wired that way), as part of my solo practice, as I understand that beyond the initial setup/software expense, if you can get a bunch of those cases in the pipeline, it pays well, is all electronic filing, little client or court time, etc. Lots of overlap with family law and crim law too.

Family law is decent, but can burn you out quickly, as some clients are demanding and need plenty of hand-holding, so make sure that your atty-client contract spells out how you're billing them and set your prices accordingly (and stick to them). NEVER renegotiate your fees, esp in a family law case, as that's a recipe for disaster.

Last, but not least, and totally unrelated, but important... join several professional groups, at least at first. A) you'll probably have some free time to attend their meetings, etc and decide if you really want to commit to the group, B) it gets you out networking, and C) on your website/resume/whatever, you can list it, as most potential clients have no idea that joining say, your state's Trial Lawyer's Association only means that you paid the dues. Many think it is an invite-only thing, or requires some special knowledge or experience.  Lots of clients tell me that when they were shopping for an atty, they looked at my website and saw my ""affiliations"" and were impressed, as the other attys they were considering didn't have those ""qualifications,"" I kid you not. I don't do a lick of personal injury or med mal, and honestly find a lot of the Plaintiff's bar kinda' scuzzy at times, but every year I renew my membership to the state TLA (which does *some* stuff outside of ambulance chasing) b/c clients are impressed by it. *shrugs*","1333240570"

And this is something else to consider: you are both in college and moving in to the next stage of your lives, this is the time to explore and grow, and relationships like this are kind of *supposed* to end at some point. If the relationship is getting too hard to manage, it will probably be best for everyone to let it end amicably.","1333240576"

"Coffee","t5_2qhze","Well, Handsome does have the advantage of primarily being a roaster, so in their one cafe location they have complete control, and obviously they aren't discriminating against cafes whom they sell to based on if they offer sugar or not, I'll give you that. 

Sugar completely changes the flavor of the coffee. To me it's analogous to going to a swanky restaurant, ordering a duck egg frittata with truffles, and then putting ketchup on it. You want to let the ingredients be the star, not the condiments. Now obviously, it's your money, you have a right to do whatever you want with what you buy. Is it wrong to put ketchup on it? No, there are certainly bigger problems in the world. But it's the prerogative of the establishment to decide what to offer to their customers, and the prerogative of the customer to patronize the establishment.

I just think it's great that there's this new big name in coffee that's saying ""We don't offer sugar at *our* cafe."" 99% of coffee drinkers will not care, and that's totally fine, but it at least puts out the idea that coffee is a great drink all on it's own.","1333240579"

To be honest, I'm not all that bothered that people all over the world are learning English and don't really see it as 'destroying culture' as some of my colleagues would. I think you're being a bit overly-American by saying it's because of the US, not the UK, that people want to learn English. You realize that American English is the anomaly, right? People are taught British English nearly everywhere else in the world, especially in mainland Europe. Germany is an exception because of America's heavy involvement post-WW2, but the same goes just about everywhere else. You have to remember too, people outside Anglophone countries learning English are still taught their local language. Even in the UK, Welsh is taught in Whales and there are movements in Scotland to reinvigorate the various Gaelic languages that existed there.

So the real question is this: if we take away food, products and languages, what does Americanization actually consist of? I don't really have an answer for that, but I suspect it'd be something to do with neoliberalism and misogyny.","1333240594"

I've talked with some of these people and they say no matter how hard they try to ignore the feeling it causes them so much anxiety they just can't come to the home. I usually will make arrangements to take my client to visit with their family or to meet them somewhere if this is the case. Also, some people who are newly hired experience the same thing. They want to work, but they just can't comfortably be around the clients, again no matter how high functioning or ""normal"" they are. At work we say ""Some people have it, and some people don't"" We don't judge these people for it because it really seems like something that can't be helped. Don't beat yourself up over it. I don't like the feeling of being the odd duck (being in a large group of people who are of a different gender, socioeconomic background, race, faith, me in a costume or vice versa, etc.) even though I know it's not right to assume I am being judged or really even being noticed.

If you think of the hatch equating with the island, Kelvin and Desmond always awaiting their replacement to push the button and save the world, much like Jacob.  At the same time there is this ""Other"" group who are brought to the island and have a leader.  This leader seems to change from generation to generation.  Ben wants to be that leader.  In fact, Ben wants to Jacob.  The only difference being that Ben is not waiting for a replacement -- he's waiting to be the replacement.  

But Ben has never spoken to Jacob and can only pretend to be the leader.  Tom and the others are only doing what they believe Jacob is telling them, but they are only doing what Ben tells them.  Ben is manipulating everyone -- he's on a long con, making him much like Sawyer.   

Now Locke comes along and he is supposedly special.  But Locke isn't really special.  He is being conned by the MiB, which is how he is able to con Ben into killing Jacob.  He preys upon both their weaknesses. 

There is an amazing moment in season 1 when Claire is dreaming and sees Locke making a crib.  Locke looks up and has those solid black eyes.  This whole moment comes back around in season 6.  It's truly awesome to see that moment.

But regarding whether the Others are good guys -- I think they're weak people who follow blindly.  Ben has his regrets and is thrilled to be a No. 2 in the end and not the no. 1. ","1333240630"

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","It's called Dragon Age 2 and it's actually pretty decent - if you play Dragon Age for the characters and plot - if you play Dragon Age for it's dungeons I wouldn't suggest playing Dragon Age 2; seriously you have one dungeon they rename ten times and just close off certain doors and areas.  

I can't even begin to understand the thought process that went into only giving the game one dungeon. Perhaps they believed that they could also put fights in Kirkwall itself and people would barely notice the fact, but I can only speculate. 

Dragon Age 2 was - combat and storyTELLING wise (remember I said storyterlling - not story) - a big disappointment. What it did better than Origins was character development and romances; though these were plagued by the fact that you could only talk to your companions when they had something to talk about and to pursue a romance you had to press the heart dialogue option - which made Hawke say some cheesy pick up line or some shit, like he was trying to pick up a hooker and not the captain of the guard, an elven blood mage with rejection issues or - if your Hawke was a Sassy Gay Hawke - a mage hating Tevinter ex-slave or a semi-abomination terrorist. 

Remember I said Storytelling wise the game wasn't that good? Well, the story itself was pretty good. It was unique, it wasn't about saving the world or any other cliche fantasy plot. It was about a refugee and his family growing to be a huge player in a city not his own. The problem with this is that Bioware did not really give you the time to grow to care about Hawke and his family before the shit hits the fan - and I won't say anymore because it would spoil it for you. The story itself wasn't the problem - it was the telling.

Also; Bioware just recently said they were planning a massive Awakening-like Dragon Age 2 expansion and then turned about and said ""LOL JK We'll just take some of the mechanics and put them into the next game. We'll try to give you some closure, but can't promise anything."" I'm paraphrasing of course.  

In the end, Dragon Age 2 would have been a solid game if it had an extra year of development, as it is you have to be a hardcore Dragon Age fan (like me) to enjoy it. 

EDIT: Because I had to step onto my soap box and talk about the romances and lack of decent DLC. ","1333240634"

As an example you'd be surprised how many traditional Japanese/thai/tibetan tattoo designs use vedic (hindu/buddhist) swastikas, like in patterns of characters kimonos, and decorative motifs, borders, etc. It's also very common in traditional american tattoos featuring native americans. A tattoo artist I worked with had a traditional native american girl with a swastika embellishment on her head dress, there was no way it looked like a nazi tattoo. the questions directed at him usually involve ""why would you get that when people are going to think it's 'the other swastika'?"", and not ""omg are you a nazi wtf?""

Anyways what I'm saying is if you really want to incorporate it there are ways you can do it. It's not guaranteed everyone will ""get it"" right off the bat or not ask you about it which can get annoying to explain.

yes, a gun is a police officer's weapon. police are taught how to use and aim and maintain them, as a part of their job training.

two shots each, in each leg, or in the gut, or two shots and then the release of the dog would have been way more than enough to put down one guy with what is essentially a big stick, maybe with something heavy attached to the end of it.

The car hop actually made light chit chat when I told her I liked her hair (color streaks) and wished me a good day.

Doesn't matter if I only order $4 worth of food. If you're an awesome waitress, I'm going to tip you at least 20%, less than a $5 order? Still several dollars.

With a bad waitress, that's not paying attention, rude, doesn't refill drink (my biggest peeve) I still tip 10-15%, but if it seems like they're off their game because they're having a bad day and they aren't being a bad waitress on purpose, I tip them extra in hope that it will improve it a little bit.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I used to work at this family owned Italian restaurant in the carry-out area.  Having worked there for well over a year already, I thought I had seen it all.  Whenever we get a pizza order over the phone, our standard time frame we would tell the customers is that it would be 30-35 minutes.  One day this guy came in and waited in line behind two people before I got a chance to help him.  I looked up his order in the back and informed the uptight looking man that it would about five more minutes (it had been exactly 30 minutes since he called in, so we were still in the clear), but not to him.  He went completely off on me: ""What the fuck is wrong with you people?! I order here all the time and every goddamn time you somehow manage to fuck things up.  How did a CUNT like you end up getting a job.""  I calmly told him I was sorry for the wait, and that I'd be happy to get our manager to hear his issues.  


So I go in back to get my boss, Adam, who is a close family friend with my parents; he lives in my neighborhood and I babysit for his kids and everything.  I tried to just tell him a customer was angry, but since I never go get him to take care of angry customers for me and he could tell I was trying not to cry, he asked me what happened.  I explained what he called me and he told me to come with him.  The man's pizza was ready, so Adam grabbed it and walked out to the customer.  The customer looked very pleased with himself to see me sheepishly hiding behind my boss who was holding his pizza and reached out for his food.  My boss then opened the box and dumped the pizza in the garbage can, ""We don't serve your kind here.  Don't ever try to order from us again.""  The guy's face was priceless.  He looked like he was going to explode, but just walked out of the door in a pissed off sort of way.  The other four people who were in the waiting room and saw the whole thing sort of applauded (wish they would've spoken up earlier, but hey I wouldn't have messed with that guy either). Best boss ever. 


TL;DR: Customer yelled at me and called me a cunt for having to wait an extra five minutes for his food (since he came early) and my boss tossed his food out and told him to never come back. ","1333240672"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Probably one of the craziest days of my life, it was fourth of july, and my buddy had a cabin out in the middle of no where. Earlier in the day, we were jumping my brothers jeep on a motocross track and lighting off fireworks. We go up to chill at the cabin, start drinking and smoking. Well thefriend who owns the place picks up a pellet gun, runs down a hill through the woods and starts shooting up at us. My other brother picks up the other pellet gun holds it out with one hand and shoots towards him. Hit him straight in the side of the forehead. The pellet got lodged under his skin, we call 911, but he is sitting there trying to cut it out with a knife. 6 sherriffs showed up thinking it was a real gun, expecting to find a body. We all get taken to the station cause we were not 18, all get out of it with zero charges. One of the craziest fourth of julys ever.

TL;DR Specify to 911 that it is a pellet gun, not a real gun if your ever in that situation","1333240675"

However, if they would have posted a picture of their 250lb cousins stark naked fornicating, it would have been removed from this sub Reddit without too much hesitation. This is opposed to the reaction that it may receive in other sub Reddits. Just because it doesn't create strong reaction non-topical content just doesn't belong.

http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/344/index/9917845/1

Interestingly, another dev stated it was fine to mod single player stuff as long as you don't mess with the multiplayer about 3/4ths of the way down.  That was Scylla Costa, title listed as ME3 Live Producer, and it was posted 15 days ago.  The 2nd to last post by a player was 14 days ago.



So that was that, but then a player bumped the thread 5 days ago (9 days after it had no replies) and the dev response came shortly afterward by Thomas Abram who is apparently a QA dev.  All of his posts seem to be locking threads.

So we have 1 dev telling us one thing and another telling us another, so Bioware definitely needs to get their shit together, but as far as this goes it's still inconclusive if BW is banning for modding the singleplayer, as it simply could have been a typeo or miscommunication.

Oh, and here's a winner from Thomas:

"toronto","t5_2qi63","I think I might be one of the few to argue this but personally I see no particular reason why the Crosstown LRT should be buried at all. I firmly believe that with development comes gradual restrictions on car usage. You want to drive down Queen during rush hour? You're out of your mind but totally welcome to it. Be prepared to get caught behind a streetcar though. I see no reason why Eglinton should be too much different. The goal of good transit is to remove cars, not to avoid pissing them off. If that was the case we'd might as well just build special tunnels for buses and make sure we never see transit of any kind ever again and leave roads for cars and cars alone.

As for your question within the parameters you've given, I'm fine with the part being underground where it is, and I really wish the climate had been good enough to stick to the original which kept the LRT above ground for a couple more kilometres west. Realistically as the city's density expands north there is less and less of an argument for personal vehicles to receive any form of priority over transit on major thoroughfares. I would never suggest Eglinton should become car-free (as opposed to some areas of the downtown core) but it should become clear over time that unless you have business somewhere on that road, you probably shouldn't be driving on it, and even then you should try to get on the LRT before you drive.","1333240694"

One time while having a casual conversation with a girl (in front of my manager, we became good friends pretty fast) that took a turn towards soft-sex or possibly war, I made a comment I had heard from a comedian at some point in time, ""Well if guys couldn't masturbate there would be war breaking out every 10 minutes.""

No idea why I said it now that I think about it, but this was the wrong younger-lady to say it to and she became embarrassed and left quietly while my manager laughed his ass off once she was gone.

Going from 2GB to 6GB will be a pretty noticeable jump. So it's still a better course than, say, dumping 2GB and just slapping the 4GB in there. From, say, 6 to 8GB is not going to matter as much, though, so in that case I'd say stick with 6GB of the faster rather than slowing it down to get to 8GB, etc.","1333240697"

I was very recently with someone who had many sexual partners throughout her life, while I've had 0. That didn't make us distant at all, besides the time she wanted to do things I wasn't comfortable with but once I communicated that to her she respected me and the way I was.

I strongly believe relationships come down to respect. Your partner has to respect your choices and you have to respect her. If you feel like you want to have more sexual partners, maybe you should talk to her about it.

Too many people are caught up in this belief that the only way to have sex with someone other than your SO is to cheat. You could just communicate? Tell her how you feel, what you want, and if she truly loves/likes you, she will respect that and allow you to live your life to complete fulfillment.","1333240707"

"LadiesofScience","t5_2sg5m","When looking at graduate schools, remember that you are applying to a *program*, not a school. Some may even apply to work with a specific person (their adviser). Figure out what you're interested in, then find the people doing the most interesting research in that area.

Since you are a Biology major, you have a lot of choice as to what kind of program you could apply to. You could do anything related to biology. You can even apply to programs that have nothing to do with your undergraduate major at all, but it would help to have some background in the area.

Also, you don't necessarily have to get a Master's in order to get your Ph.D. If you have a strong application, you can be admitted to a Ph.D program straight out of undergrad.

&gt;**The application consists of:**
&gt;
&gt;* Personal statement
&gt;
&gt;* Recommendation letters (usually 2-3)
&gt;
&gt;* GRE score(s)
&gt;
&gt;* Transcript

The personal statement is the most important, followed by the recommendation letters. The personal statement includes your reasons for applying, who you want to work with, your research interests and experience, etc.

Generally, your GPA and GRE scores don't matter that much unless they are exceptionally bad or good. However, some schools do have cutoff scores under which they rarely accept applicants. You can still apply to these programs if the rest of your application is stellar, though.

As a freshman, the best thing you can do now is seek research experience, begin to develop a relationship with a professor or two (so they can write you good recommendation letters later), and most importantly, figure out what you're interested in.","1333240708"

I was done on the bogus grounds that I had phimosis. In fact, a boy's foreskin is not expected to detach from the penis until adolescence. So the ""phimosis"" was normal. 

Also ""look like Dad"" was a factor.

When SBAs are checked, +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on the same creature cancel out and are removed. So, in this case, you would remove one+1/+1 counter and the -1/-1 counter, leaving four +1/+1 counters (and a 4/4 Pentavus).","1333240715"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;You mean you haven't seen any? How is this proof they don't exist?

Absence of evidence of P is evidence of absence in the case that if P did exist, we should have more evidence of its existence.  You can say the same thing about Tyrannosaurs Rex, ""Just because we haven't seen any doesn't mean they still don't exist.""  But are you willing to admit that it's more probable that T-rex exists then not?  It's LOGICALLY possible that fairies could exist.  But given that there is not a shred of evidence nor eye witness that they do exist, not to mention given how much we know about our planet, we're more reasonable in asserting they don't exist.

Not to mention we can just make the claims more ad hoc by asking question.  They are just small people, do why haven't they talked or reached out to anyone?  Don't you think SOMEBODY would have recognized a small person with wings who shine?  Since they are just ""special"" versions of people (indeed, even people who can fly) they should be at the top of the food chain and should have populated far more then even us regular humans.  If you research one version of real fairies, they apparently like to play tricks on us humans (like ""leading travelers astray"").  That's never happened.  I could do this all day.

It's just like the whole teapot analogy which champions this forum! (Given it's in the very title).  The reason we don't think there's a teapot in orbit around the earth is not because of the absence of evidence for such a teapot.  It's because we have good evidence that no such piece of china has been launched into space by us or that extraterrestrials have put it there.  Remember, it's the presence of contrary evidence.

&gt;We can trace where lightning comes from and it doesn't come from a man with a large beard.

Because thanks to modern meteorology we know that lightning comes from a negative charge at the base of storm clouds and not a man with a beard.  And adding the additional hypothesis that he could just be really small makes the claim more ad hoc and thus weaker.  By doing so, you kill your own case.

Anything else?

It is not normal that your initial reaction to:

birth control is that the woman may not take it
anal sex is that the woman may catch the semen and put it inside her
dating someone who doesnt want kids because she may be lying
dating someone who has had a tubal litigation because she may be lying

You have severe issues with women. There is something wrong with your brain, because that is not a normal thought to have.

Going beyond those issues with women, your fear of literally every birth control option failing you is not normal, either. You obviously need professional help. Stop denying your problems. If you want to fix them, seeing a therapist is a pretty  damn good way to start.","1333240739"

But more to the point, the abundance of invaginations in an organism's brain is more indicative of how smart the species is, rather than the individual.

Well I ask the lady as they are finishing up their purchase, ""Would you like to pay for that on this transaction or a separate one?""
She starts yelling at me! ""It's because I'm black isn't it! I Bet if I was white I you wouldn't have asked me that!""
I responded ""Ma'am it doesn't matter if you were black, Latino or white I still would have asked you the same question.""
At this point she has started yelling at how worthless I am, claiming she has stolen this item, I should mention now we have been suspecting her of theft for months. *And with publix/all customer service mottos, ""the customer is always right* My customer service team leader comes up and starts asking what's wrong, the lady starts going off about how all these white bitches are on her case accusing her of stealing and of course how it would be a black lady they be accusing mmhmm.

* Instead of having the scrawly paint headings with typed headings inside them, I'd choose one or the other (and if I was choosing the paint ones, I'd make them darker and more visible).
* If the bottom right block letter versions of his name is important (i.e. his logo or something), I'd make it easier to read and put it at the top over his name. It just looks weird to have his name in two places. 
* Lastly, not related to design, but if your GPA is less than 3.0 you probably shouldn't bother to put it on your resume.

I hung out with 2 French women that were in Iran one summer by themselves, a hot girl and her mom that were tourists. You see a lot of European and Asian tourists there. 

It's not like Afghanistan where women have to be accompanied by men and get harassed. Iran has female cops, cab drivers, bus drivers, store owners, etc...

The dress code in Iran is that women have to wear long sleeves and to cover your legs and hair. No one wears a burka. The younger girls wear jeans and try to show as much of their hair as possible where older generations dress more conservatively. It depends on the person and if they're religious. 

This is how most Iranian women dress:

I would never eat dog or human.  Period.  I also would not eat cat, dolphin, monkey, ape, or whale.

I do, however, eat cow, chicken, fish and crustaceans.

The things I choose not to eat I do so out of a sense of thoroughly-ingrained cultural taboo.  I readily admit this.  There is nothing magical or special about a dog or a cat or a human on a base level that *should* prevent me from ingesting any of them.  I understand this.

However, I'm not quite on the same page with you when it comes to the pragmatic thing. I believe that there are things that we view as immoral despite the fact that they would actually be more pragmatic. I'm having a bit of trouble thinking of a good example though... Anyway, I do have an objection to the following:

&gt;And I think that this would not be a difficult argument to make considering how much we benefit from having a racially and ethnically liberal society. 

At this point in your post, you seem to be implicitly saying that giving animals equal consideration does not benefit us. I think it could be argued that it does benefits us, but in order to make that argument, I would have to resort to utilitarianism which you clearly disagree with.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm sorry if I came off as arrogant, but I definitely did not mean to say I am the only person who understands subjectivity. That wouldn't make much sense given my argument. I'm saying there is no ""free"" or ""independent"" perspective on moral issues. I'm not defending anyone. Without learning some form of culture, nothing is intrinsically good or bad.

And I don't really think there is a significant difference between ""non-systematic"" teaching and ""systematic indoctrination"". You might teach a person your set of beliefs in a organised way but you'd only be teaching them because you think they are true (i.e necessary for the survival/perfection of the species). When you non-systematically teach, you're just following your set of beliefs, and children emulate your behaviour. You say you were never taught any beliefs. I say that's ridiculous. Were you never taught to say *please* and *thank you*? Not to steal? Not to murder? Not to lie? You forget about those because they are ""obviously"" the ""right"" things to do, but they're no different to being taught that only the strong deserve to survive. That people have a right to take anything they want. That fear is how you control people. That the police are trying to destroy your family, your neighbourhood, your way of life.

The only reference point you can judge another culture by is the one you were brought up in. If someone argues a moral point, you agree because they are more powerful than their opposition, not because what they are saying is any more ""true"".","1333240775"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","It's a judgment call on your part, and either way you decide, it seems to me to be a decision you can support and live with. I'm in my 60s, and it's been my experience that you make decisions as you go through life and you live through all your decisions. Whichever way you go, you'll live through it.

On this particular situation, my theory in life is that you should make yourself happy. It's not up to him, your parents, or anyone else to make you happy. It's up to you. Are you happy now? I have the impression you're not, and I see reasons for you not to be.

My suggestion is communication. Have a nonconfrontational conversation with him about your fears and concerns. Let him cry and promise to do better, then see if he does. If you're not happy after awhile, you get to decide whether you can make yourself happier without him. If so, end the relationship and move on. I promise there are other men who will be right for you. If you are happier with him, the stick it out, communicate, help him, and so on. 

Ultimately, the decision is yours based on your judgment. Best wishe whichever way you decide.","1333240781"

Yup.

&gt;Nevertheless, if you could point out either an answer or, more likely, a flaw in my logic

There is no logic, because there is no logical definition of [likelihood](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Likelihood.html) or [probability](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Probability.html) that suits the purpose you're trying to put it to.

Any probabilistic argument that you formulate which could very easily be employed to prove that you don't exist (which this one clearly could, with a little adjustment) is disproved by counterexample from the outset.

Did you read the part where some of the drivers were without license for 3 years, since 2008? If you have HBP and you're not allowed to drive a bus, then you *shouldn't* be in that field! Why is it the MUNI's responsibility beyond a certain (small) time?  Would **any** private company tell its employees ""it's OK, we'll keep you (unpaid) on the payroll, come back whenever you feel you're OK"" ?? I don't think so! Plus, there is **nothing** preventing these ill-equipped drivers to switch to another career; but they sat around for 2-3 years with no questions asked.

Please do a Google search to see the rampant abuses that go on at MUNI.

Here's an example that I was affected by: union steward upset that assignment wasn't done by seniority, so blocked all buses leaving the facility: http://sfist.com/2009/02/18/union_worker_causes_am_muni_delay.php

Other work rules that drive up costs: you're not allowed to hire part-time drivers. You then end up paying 2X or even higher for overtime (which is itself a safety risk, but hey: union rules!). You're allowed to just not show up at work if you are sick (or claim to be sick); no advance notice, no notification at all required! Cross-utilization of labor is not allowed, even for extremely menial tasks; you've got to pay overtime! 

I could go on.

I got stuck with him, I was fucking terrified but came in, got on the truck and braced for the worst. I look back on this time as one of the most influential in my life, 4 years of working side by side with this man on the hardest, most challenging installs the NW could throw at us. We became a team, I busted my ass and earned his respect and he treated me like an equal towards the end. Mike liked to drink and drink hard, he had a passion that few people I have met could match, sadly this passion was often displayed as anger and frustration over things he could not change in his life. This internal struggle would get the best of him, the man I had become to idolize in a sense would go on to commit one of the most selfish acts possible..... he took his life leaving behind 3 daughters and a wife, as well as a handful of friends that would have done anything for him. I turned down a chance to sit and talk with him one last time 2 weeks before he took his life.... one of the biggest regrets in my life, I feel like he was calling out and I was too busy to hear him, I let down a good friend that day and have regretted it ever since.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Non-popular kid here. I was in JROTC (yeah, I know), had a moderate acne problem, and I had a close group of friends who were admitted nerds and outcasts, so some general picking-on was common. It only took a few one-liners or general disinterest to stop any would be bullies. 

The only time I was ever really bullied, it wasn't settled very well. A very tall, very large kid who thought he was the king of the school found me an easy target one day. He said some non-sensical shit which I ignored and brushed off, as usual. For some reason, disregarding anything he had to say deserved punishment, so he came up to me and grabbed me by the shirt and tried to shove me against a wall. If he truly wanted to hurt me, he could have done it then and there...but he didn't swing a single punch.

I got lucky and my feet stumbled into his, causing us both to fall to the ground which got some laughter from everyone around. This made him even angrier. I was able to get up before him and, while he was on one knee about to stand, I grabbed his 'fro and pulled as hard as I could until he fell onto his ass. He musn't have been an experienced fighter because he didn't put a guard up to his face. I pulled back my fist and swung with everything I had. 

I didn't knock him out, but he was extremely disoriented...and my hand hurt like hell. Just like him I wasn't an experienced fighter, so I connected pretty poorly. I heard the common, ""OOOOOOOHHHH!!!!"" from the people around, I felt like a fucking God. It must have been the adrenaline, because I turned around and screamed, ""Any more of you ghetto pieces of shit want to fuck me with today?!"" (predominantly black school...I know, not proud of it.) 

Some administrative bullshit from the school, public apology, and a really pissed off father were the only real fallout from the incident. Because of luck, however, I wasn't bugged by anyone again. It didn't make me any more popular...but people generally decided not to fuck with me for some reason.  ","1333240793"

"funny","t5_2qh33","Last night, I went into the fridge and took out the most beautiful and ripe tomato I have ever seen. It was just gorgeous, you have absolutely no idea. I bit into it, and it was so juicy that the tomato water dribbled down my chin. I stood in front of the fridge in complete luxury. However, when I squinted and looked closer, it appeared that the seeds were in fact small human fetuses. I watched as they wriggled around and send droplets of juice flying into the air. Cautiously, I pulled one out and put it in my mouth. As I bit down, a high pitched cry of agony escaped the small fetus, and it echoed off the walls and pierced my brain. I felt very sad, because those little fetuses deserved to live too, but the tomato was just too good. I couldn't help myself. I ate the rest of it, even though the wails and pleas for mercy were getting louder every second. I wiped my mouth with a tissue, feeling very guilty. As I went to bed that night, it was as though I could still hear the screams of those fetuses. I tossed and turned all night. This morning, I woke up and looked in the mirror to see that my belly had swelled to the size of a 9-month pregnant lady's belly. I could feel them kicking, all those little fetuses. They were growing in my stomach, feeding off of the food I eat. It is now the late evening, and I can feel them swimming around in my stomach. They feel nice, and I am excited for them to come out.

This is a safe way to do so.  What's so disgusting about ammonia in this context and in the way it's being used?  Can you point me to a single study that shows a statistically significant danger or deleterious effect from ammonia being used in this way?  If so, please show me, because to my knowledge and my research into this topic none exists.  Rather, a lot of people are thinking irrationally (in the true sense of the word) and correlating a product used in cleaning to harm when this is not the case necessarily.  I'd guess this is possibly what's going on with you as well since you use emotional words like 'disgusting' to talk about the issue rather than whether the substance and chemicals have been shown to be dangerous or harmful in the context and manner in which they're used.  I'm not trying to flame you here, just pointing out a concern I have.

While meat may not be the most environmentally sustainable food product (it's often not) it IS one of the most efficient ways for humans to get a lot of nutritional benefits that last a long time in the body in relatively small portions.  Vegans must eat constantly and in large quantities to get all the nutrients in the right combinations that many meats offer in a relatively small mass.  This is often the most economically and time viable option for many people.  

Profits are definitely a part of this, but it's again irrational to hate or be disgusted or wary of something just because there's a profit-motive involved.  If the product is not dangerous (and it hasn't proven to be), is making full use of an animal that's already been slaughtered, is the most economical way for some people to eat, there aren't serious environmental concerns regarding the manner in which it's produced (compared to say, production and processing of soy beans where there are HUGE environmental issues) and there happens to be a person profiting from it, it is illogical to dismiss such a product based on these grounds or our instant emotional response to something that sounds 'foreign' or 'weird' to us.

"autism","t5_2qhs6","My son is turning 6 soon and has been diagnosed since 3.  My daughter is 2 and has had concerns since 15 months.  Every kid is different, so my story  will be different from yours.

Since your child is 4, and likely turning 5 soon if he's going to school in the fall, he has aged out of birth to 3 services.  However, starting at 3 years old  you should be able to enroll him in a preschool to help get him used to the idea of school.  Do that.

If you haven't already, contact your local birth to 3 resource center.  Get a family coordinator.  Get him into preschool classes on Monday if possible.  At these preschool classes, they will generally focus on filling the deficits your child has and helping to place him in the environment he belongs in.  

My son started a special needs preschool at 3.  Was non verbal until 4 and potty trained at 4.  At 5 he speaks on par with a 2 year old, but considering he only started speaking a couple years ago, we consider it decent progress.

Now he is in kindergarten.  Most parents push to mainstream their child into normal classes as soon as possible.  This may or may not be an important thing for you, depending on your child and his abilities.  My suggestion is to let the teachers give you advice as to where your child belongs.  Think it over, and make your own decision based on what the professionals think as well as how well you know your child.  That said it is a lot easier to put your child into a mainstreamed class later in the school year if he is surpassing his special needs peers than it is to put him in a special needs class if he can't keep up with his typical ones.

For us, we chose to keep our son in a special needs kindergarten full day this year.  He is in a class of 5 vs being lost in a class of 20 if we had mainstreamed him.  However, he has already completed the curriculum for the year, and is getting more and more integration time with the mainstream classes every week.  Every day he is communicating with us more and more and we are considering mainstreaming him next fall depending on how summer treats us.

It was important for us not to push him too hard too fast, especially as his social and communication needs are our biggest concerns for him.  ","1333240810"

I work as a designer at and ikea store. small space solutions is the right idea for this space. honestly this is a contender for challenging spaces like WOW. but hey if you plan to stay in a place even renting for a while its worth to make it nice. tips:

-Go back to ikea and get more wall mounted storage. only place to go is UP when space is tight. think vertical. 

-get more baskets for your book case and put the free floating stuff in it. less cluter visible bigger space look.

-get a better light like the knappa one. strings up no hard wire required.

-invest in 1 pax wardrobe frame 24"" by 98"" high with a nice white door and put EVERYTHING in that huge pile of stuff to the right of the bed facing. will fit nicely with as many shelfs as you want to put inside it. its custom. 

-paint one wall an accent color. its a cheap way to create a sense of partitions in space.

-dump that sofa. get smaller geometric one, light in color prefered.

-get larger art frames. scale it up and pick more graphic colorfull images.

-the EXPEDIT large unit can be a great room divider!!! put between foot of bed and couch and will create a nice wall! not to mention tripple your storage. yeah baby

- keep one fan and try and put the weights and stuff in a large nice looking basket 

-raise the curtain rods to near the ceiling for a bigger room feeling (secret trick) and pick lighter color drapes. (yes they make light color drapes that block out light.)

-do this post and update and I will be happy. and u will like too :)

The same goes for religion, ""all societies were religious, so we must have religion in order for society to function"". Just becouse it's tradition, it doesn't make it necessary. See my point?

"CollegeBasketball","t5_2rj3j","It's a tough issue, since there are a lot of schools where the athletic department runs a deficit. A big issue is that there isn't a way to really pay college athletes market value, because schools with huge donor bases will obviously put a higher value on players than program's with lesser resources. 

Despite all of that, I think a lot of college football and basketball players do deserve to get paid, as their performance/image makes a lot of money for other people.

There's no perfect solution to this issue. I think the most realistic solution would be to increase the stipend for FBS football and D1 basketball players to around $1500/month. This wouldn't put much of a burden on basketball programs, and the only football programs which would really be hurt by it probably shouldn't be competing in FBS anyway (and there are a lot of crappy programs that would have no problem finding the money).

The best alternative I can think of would be to establish some sort of a system for equitably (between colleges) distributing endorsement deals. I've been doing a little Final Four drinking, so I can't be bothered to come up with any sort of a specific outline, but the key to allowing endorsements would be to find a way to not give some schools advantages over others. It would probably require endorsements to be at a national scale, and maybe even determined by formula or voters. This would be meritocratic than bumping up the stipend, but would also be a lot harder to keep fair.

Bob Knight's arguments for not paying players are bullshit. Yes, college can be expensive, but successful FBS football and D1 men's basketball programs bring far more money than the total cost of education for the athletes. As a basketball example, Scott Drew makes $1.7M/year with incentives to hit $2.2M. Baylor's an expensive school, but the total value of all of his player's benefits probably amounts to around half of his base salary. 

Players get to showcase their abilities in high school. How much more money would Lebron had made if he'd gone to college? None, he would've lost money. What about the players whose professional stock is hurt by being required to play in college? The professional leagues benefit far more than the players from college sports.

This isn't a case of a tiny minority throwing a hissy fit because they see a cross, it is the general desire of the culture.

&gt; I'd like to see the seperation of secularism and the state. I find it intrudes on the freedom of people to express themselves culturally in public

I'm sorry you feel that way.  When it comes to public expression, do you not feel there needs to be a balance between personal freedom of expression/action and the desires of the public at large?  Does it infringe too much on personal liberty for instance to not allow people to have sex in public areas?  Because that's an area where society has requested people move it to the privacy of their homes, and I doubt many people feel it infringes their liberty.","1333240846"

**Back story:** I currently work for a vary large discount retail company as the lowest level of management they have. So the higher ups can track our sales we enter it into a SharePoint (It angers me they use SharePoint). All the stores are classified by region such as North and South.

**Story:** So today I get a call from another store because they have somehow managed to put themselves in their own region. Conversation as I remember it:

&gt;**Other store:** Hi it's Derpena from DerpDeDerp. Do you know anything about computers?

&gt;**Me:** Yeah a little. (I am actually studying Information Systems at Uni and computers have been my hobby sense I was 8 so I know more than a little I just say this so no one comes back to me for anything other than what I have already fixed for them)

&gt;**Other store:** I have put myself by myself in the thing you put your sales into, do you know how to fix it?

I noticed this earlier so I lent straight over to the computer and fixed it.

&gt;**Me:** Fixed.

&gt;**Other store:** But it still shows up as us by ourselves

&gt;**Me:** You need to refresh the page.

&gt;**Other store:** How do I do that?

&gt;**Me:** Press F5.

&gt;**Other store:** It didn't work.

&gt;**Me:** Did you press F5?

&gt;**Other store:** Yes, I pressed F and 5 at the same time.

&gt;**Me:** *sigh* See along the top of the keyboard all those keys that YOU never use. The one that says F5. Press that.

&gt;**Other store:** Oh it's doing something......... Oh, thank you so much.

Later that day I get an email from another store on the other side of the country asking me to fix it for them too. How they found out that I fixed it for the other store is beyond me considering we are not supposed to contact stores outside our region directly.

The fix was people were entering extra stuff in one of the fields that should actually be uneditable.

I think Horse manure less so than cow manure but still, just pile up your mix and check it so often to make sure it stays hot in the middle until all the carbon material is broken down.

&gt;[Multitasking] is simply not possible at this time. I realize everyone wants it, and hell: I want it, too; but everyone saying it is important doesn’t make it possible. The reason Cydia doesn’t have iOS 4 compliant multi-tasking is that, to make the modifications it makes to the system, it runs as “root”, a user that has more permissions on the system than anything else, which means that SpringBoard, a lowly process running as “mobile”, cannot suspend/resume it.

&gt;Now, this is something that /can/ be remedied, and is something that I’ve been thinking of how to do for a long time, but all the obvious ways people like to bring up for making Cydia’s GUI run as mobile with only small parts running as root would make Cydia run slower, and speed is something that is primary on everyone’s minds when they are using Cydia. Luckily, there are things I’ve figured out that may make this more reasonably possible, but certainly not for this release.

I'm not sure whether it's theoretically possible for downloading to happen in the background even if multitasking isn't possible currently.","1333240853"

Then you leave.

Edit: for all the folks afraid of being shot in the back, obviously you need to weigh your specific situation. The point is that upon asking what your status is ( under arrest, being detained, free to to) the cops have to deal with you. Yes, they can lie afterward, but at that point they're opening themselves up to legal issues for holding you without cause unless they communicate that to you.

&gt;You may end up in a very small clique where the non Greeks outnumber you. You'll end up seeing the same frat guys over and over at mixers.

My school is only about 15% Greek, and yet I am constantly meeting new and interesting people in the Greek system (and I in no way feel excluded or distanced from the rest of the student population). Also, the OP mentioned that she was joining to make girlfriends and not meet guys, so I don't think that the mixer thing really matters much.

&gt;They are social and you have something more substantial in common with your sisters.

Not to be rude, but it really, really irks me when people believe that women in a sorority have shallow or less 'substantial' friendships than people outside of the Greek system. The vast majority of women in my sorority (as well as other women I have met through the Greek system) are extremely well-rounded, intelligent and fun to be around. We are friends because we have common values, interests and goals-- not simply because we are in the same house. Our friendship is anything but insubstantial.

I agree that foresight, or the ability to project the future, is the most important ability for a GM. However, moves with good foresight can still turn out badly due to the uncertainty of baseball. That's why we simply can't judge based on what happened, but should judge the GM's and the team's ability of foresight. If a move was made with bad foresight it was a bad move, regardless of what happens, and the reverse is true.

As for the Pineda/Campos and Montero/Noesi swap I feel it was a near even swap in talent. If Pineda never returns to form or Montero becomes a bust I would still say it was an even trade, because from both team's perspective it made sense.","1333240863"

I was on military leave with three guys from my unit once, we were going to Vegas after spending about 32 hours on planes and in airports so, needless to say, we were...testy. And far too dry. We stopped at a Denny's (had to drive from fucking Utah) to grab a bite and we were sat at a table near two obnoxious, loud, rude teenage boys with terrible manners. They were getting food on the windows, being loud and abusive to other customers, calling the waitress names, just being pricks. One of my PFCs gets up and goes over and slides into their booth next to one of 'em and starts talking about cars. This was a definite what the fuck moment for them, big Marine just joining 'em without asking and making small talk...what the fuck...but they didn't want to be rude to this guy because he was...imposing. I outranked the fucker and would have thought twice about giving him shit for anything, big ol' hoss. He's apparently waving his arms around but we soon realized he was communicating: ""enemy, advance, rally point vehicle."" So we rushed these kids, manhandled them out into the parking lot, screaming at 'em Paris Island style. We get their keys and get 'em into their car, give 'em back the keys and they tore ass out of the parking lot. We paid for their meal and tipped the fuck out of the waitress on their bill (50 bucks on a 28 dollar bill) and then tipped her the same on our bill. It was really fucking stupid and flat out not a good idea and we should have been arrested but we were kinda out of our minds (Afghanistan), and holy fucking fuck was it ever satisfying.

Two of us had mothers who were waitresses.

Vegas was awesome.

"MechanicAdvice","t5_2tkvu","Hmm first off have you actually checked the pressure with another gauge? Could be a failing pressure sender. 

I also see you say the idle is lower than normal. It could be your idle has dropped for some reason and because the engine is higher mileage it doesn't generate enough pressure at idle. See if you can correct the low idle situation if when you test the oil pressure with a gauge and bump the idle up to factory specs and it falls within a good number.

If the pressure is indeed low then it could be oil pump or it could be the engine getting worn and tolerances getting onto the high side required new bearing set to be put into the engine. 

As for the changing of the pump/pickup I believe on those trucks it might be easier to drop the front diff than to pull the engine to do that job. You could also change the bottom end bearings at the same time with the engine in the truck going this route.

 Do you plan on keeping this truck for a lot longer? Is it high mileage? What kind of shape is it in? Do you have a backup vehicle/need this one for work? 

If you can this is what I would do. Switch to a heavy diesel oil, something like 15w40 or straight 30/40w if necessary. Dump in a bottle or 2 of that thick ""engine honey"" stuff. See if that gets rid of it. If not find the idle adjustment on your throttle body and crank the idle up a bit until it has pressure at idle. You may have to remove a cap or use a torx security socket to turn the idle up as it may be locked from factory. And finally baby the shit out of that engine. No high revs, no beating it up, lots of warm up time. Just treat it nice. Drive it like that and save up for a used engine from a wrecker to swap in OR buy a different truck OR buy a beater and  drive while you pull the engine and rebuild it.

Good luck. Report back with what you find.","1333240868"

They are hateful and bigoted, not towards all religions, but just against certain people. If you're gonna hate, go big! 

Why is there no blame at all the Buddhists? Fuck reincarnation, when everyone dies they're not gonna be some fuckin rabbits. I need a facebook screen grab for this. 

And Hinduism? Why all the gods? don't the know that there's no god at all, just Carl Sagan? what losers for believing in lots of gods....

Shintoism? WTF is that? Respecting everything? No, I'm atheist, and smart, and because christians are ignoring global warming because they're religious, I can ignore everything because I don't believe the spirit in everything

Zoroastranism? besides a deity named after a car, they suck too. Who actually believed, even in the past, that bad deeds made a road shorter into heaven? What assholes, I wish I had facebook a few thousand years ago so I could screengrab one of those losers

Hey, what about the unitarian universalists? They support gay rights and a liberal religion, and some of their members are self proclaimed atheists! They support women's rights and race right's as well! AHAHAHA BUT THEY""RE RELIGIOUS AND THEREFORE STUPID AHAHA

Native American spirit dances? Bah, humbug. I'm white, between the ages of 16 and 29, and I hate everything that is even slightly religious. 

***Fake Angry Views done with, real views ahead***

Seriously, because this is the thread for it, what the fuck is wrong with [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) ? Yeah, they may have some legitimate views, but the majority that I see is mostly intense hatred for certain people on facebook, or members of society that do outrageous things for attention. You give those people you claim to hate power! Your ranting, your attention, your cheeky jokes at the cost of many people who don't share the same view! 

Christianity isn't all the same people! Those at Westboro Baptist are different then those in the average church. The extremists have quite a few numbers, but they feed off attention like a Mynock on the Millennium Falcon; screaming that they're there doesn't actually do anything. No one likes extremists, but because of the upcoming election/ general dislike for a ""black muslim"" president, there seems to be more of the extremism than usual, within the mainstream. 

Also, no discrimination it seems like, at least to me, for Islam or Jewish people within that thread. Is it out of political correctness? Or something else, because I really don't get that. 

I have no idea what mark [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) is trying to hit.

The arts are going away because of NCLB.  You can't really 'test' for the arts, therefore it is not seen as important under NCLB.  Schools attempt to increase their test scores in English and math by forcing students to take electives in these areas instead of art or other humanities.  

Remember that we are in an age of austerity.  Since I have been teaching, state funding has either gone down (the majority) or stayed the same every year. Many districts are facing a crunch and choose to eliminate sports or other programs such as gifted programs.  

I asked for a citation for the 10k because I know State funding in Michigan is somewhere in the area right now of $7800 per student.  DPS has been in a severe budget crunch and have rang up a $327 million budget deficit.  I have trouble believing that the district can afford to spend 2k on each student in addition to state funding.  ","1333240879"

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","My family has never been one to have a lot of open conversation, and I think the fact that we lived a devout LDS lifestyle is the reason. Brothers and sisters hid things they did from each other the best they could, and talking to the parents about certain issues was just not done. It's definitely been worse since I left the church, which was 8 or 9 years ago. Every person is different, so my best advice is to focus on each relationship as it's own. Try your best to remain close without discussing the church, and if they do, politely decline to return. I wish I could tell you it stops being weird, but I never get used to reminders of their devotion to the church and the disconnect that it brings between us. Over time I have been able to speak openly about my personal beliefs, and in some situations I give reasons why the church's argument's against my views are untrue. Remember that barring tragedy, you have a lot of time to establish relationships that are not centered on the church.

False. A cop is a cop. No matter who's time they're on.

If a cop works part time flipping burgers at a McDonalds, they're still a cop, and they hold the same authority on and off duty. The only stipulation is that they must announce themselves as a cop (typically by displaying their badge) if they are not in uniform, before using their authority.

The creative division needs to shed the skin of Bioware and form a new body outside of EA's control. They need to form a new studio, I believe. This contract is constricting their creativity, and will fuck their finances once they lose their massive creative kudos they've built up. They will fail if they do not act drasticly now.

Roughly 6 million Jews were victims of the holocaust. But in addition to the Jews, *11 million* people of other groups were murdered in the holocaust: invalids, deaf, blind, mentally ill, members of certain religions, homosexuals, POWs, anyone who was not a member of the ""Aryan race"", and many others. With these figures considered, some people believe that the holocaust was not a religious persecution of the Jews, but rather an act of a regime that sought to cleanse the world of everyone that thought differently or was in the way. 

This sort of ""denial"" disapproves of the idea that Jews should be in some way compensated for the suffering of the holocaust, unless other, larger groups are also compensated.

When you're the engine, you understand how hard your engine works doing what. Riding at a low speed takes energy, but accelerating more so. 

It's much easier to bike at 5 miles an hour for an hour than it is to stop than start for 30 minutes. 

Evidence of this can also be found in the physics equations for work and acceleration. Acceleration takes much more energy than maintaing a speed does. When you maintain a speed, you only fight friction from the road. When you accelerate, you not only fight friction but also the inertia of yourself.","1333240906"

"guns","t5_2qhc8","You are basically correct.  You have to register, ""Class 11"" is the class for stock VW Sedans, it's what your beetle would be.  They are raced down there all the time.. usually on shoestring budgets and without any real support. Just finishing the race if you are running Class 11 is something to be proud of.  Class 11 impresses the hell out of me just because these are guys who basically said ""No money, no support.. lousy car.. Fuck it, we're racing!""

And IMO that's what it's all about.  I'm a motorcyclist so I'd be running Class 30 (Motorcyclists over 30 years old), assuming I can get down there while I'm still in my 30's.  (I've been working on it for several years now.  I was on my way down for the 2011 race and my bike was stolen out of my truck in Albuquerque.)

If you haven't watched it yet you should check out [""Dust to Glory""](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386423/) which is a documentary about the 2003 race.  They follow several teams through the race, several well funded [""Trophy Trucks""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophy_Truck) Honda's factory team, and a pair of guys running Class 11 in a VW Beetle.  

I have a friend who runs support trucks for the guys who race down there so my plan for 2011 was to work for him and trail ride the course just to get my feet wet.  By ""trail ride"" I mean ride the whole thing.. but with no intention of being competitive.  Just finish and see the whole thing from a riders POV.  I have since replaced the bike so maybe in 2012.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Actually IR and UV are far more dangerous than visible light because they don't trigger a blink reflex.  You can sit there and stare at a damaging light source and not even realize it.

As for IR reflecting off your windshield, probably not much to worry about there because there are a lot of mitigating factors.  The source is highly divergent since it's meant to illuminate a large area.  This means that out side of very close range the fluence level drops off dramatically.  Since you have the camera and light source pointed forward, and the windshield is angled, any strong reflections will get dumped down into the dash and become diffuse.  Also quite a bit of IR passes thru windshield glass so any reflections will be minimal-moderate to start with.  

I would strongly advise against having a close range staring contest with an IR light source, but diffuse reflections from relatively weak sources or highly divergent, distant sources are not a problem. ","1333240921"

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","thats DoD in general.  shoot, when i was in the navy, we had a few inspections of bikes, just to make sure they were registered, insured, and gear was in proper order.  

of course, i knew more guys with cars that weren't legal than all of the guys on bikes combined.

anyway, DoD requires the following to get on base (both civilians and military alike, military have to wear the gear all the time)

&gt; DOT lid

&gt; Long sleeve shirt

&gt; Long pants

&gt; Over the ankle shoes (Chuck Taylor type shoes are not acceptable)

&gt; Full finger gloves (the old instruction used to say leather, but I'm not sure if they've changed that or not since I have worn textile (icon) gloves on base for years.

&gt; Between Dusk and Sunrise, reflective gear must be worn. If wearing a back pack, there must be reflective gear on that as well (commonly called 'glow belts', the ICON style reflective vests are not mandatory, but they are typically recommended by base safety folks).  The glow belts are only required during low light hours, if it day light, you only need a jacket/shirt that is opposite color of your bike, but most gate guards dont know that.

also, lots of bases offer the MSF course (for free for military and dependents) on base, but these courses usually have long waiting lists. I think it is even offered to contractors for free/reduced cost if there is room in the class. 

there is a HUGE push with the DoD for motorcycle safety, and loss of life to bikes is raising awareness for military leaders. i know a few years ago, USMC banned some folks from getting/riding sport bikes and the Navy (I was a sailor) required extra training for anyone on a bike that was considered a sport bike. Basically, if it wasn't a well known cruiser model, you took extra training (except for VROD riders). ","1333240922"

Yes. First off, you're forgetting the term ""man-whore"". That is an **exact** counterpart of ""slut-shaming"". You attempted to just write that one off, but it exists. So perhaps you didn't *forget* it, but you're most definitely ignoring it.

Secondly, ""virgin-shaming"" and ""slut-shaming"" are both based on the amount of people a person sleeps with, and how that ties into their gender. It's essentially the same thing - it's judging someone based on society's expectations of how much sex each gender should ideally have.

&gt; This isn't really relevant to the original comment, but you seem to be basing your comments on the assumption that women ""give"" and men ""get"" sexual activity.

No, I'm basing my comments off **society's** assumption that women ""give"" and men ""get"". *That's* why ""slut-shaming"" and ""virgin-shaming"" exist - because society has assigned an ideal amount of sex each gender should have. That doesn't reflect how *I* feel about it.","1333240924"

There is an important passage in the recently discovered Gnostic Gospel According to St. Thomas: "" 'When will the kingdom come?' Christ's disciples ask."" In Mark 13, I think it is, we read that the end of the world is about to come. That is to say, a mythological image -- that of the end of the world -- is there taken as predicting an actual, physical, historical fact to be. But in Thomas' version, Jesus replies: ""The kingdom of the Father will not come by expectation. The kingdom of the Father is spread upon the earth and men do not see it""

Obviously it is not canon to believe this, but it is a strong thought with a lot of reasoning behind it. This is why I say that *if* the world of Majora's Mask is actually just imagined, then Tingle is part of that imagination (there is also a note about tingle on the bottom right of the image), making him ""fake"".

I brought this up because DeltaBurnt suggested that Gabora could have still existed in both worlds if he existed before the timeline split, so it is just two different versions of himself. But this explanation could not be used for Tingle if you were to say that he was created for the world of Termina, but still mysteriously exists in Wind Waker (and other games) because it is part of a different timeline.

I somewhat misspoke, their concentration systems rely heavily on water turned into steam and used to turn a turbine for power generation.

You are totally right, on the east coast land is at a premium. I live in Washington state and I am far too used to land being dirt cheap west of the Mississippi. That being said for a good size cross section of the country solar does make sense.

Nuclear is our key to getting away from horribly polluting coal. I would love to see twenty more nuclear power plants built to offer clean and cheap power to the public while solar power technology gets better.

I think that within the next ten years we will see solar become a sizable portion of our power system. We need to retire coal and natural gas power systems in favor of cleaner, better alternatives like nuclear, solar and to a lesser extent wind.  ","1333240939"

&gt; Your moronic transspecies comparison has none of these, it is a figment of your imagination and highly fallacious.

There is yet to be one post in this thread that proves the logic that trans-specie should be ridiculed and scorned by society. Which is the basis of all arguments against me. And this discussion is also happening elsewhere in this post, and they are not having any luck either.

&gt; Your insipid parody is hateful, it is bigoted, it is pseudointellectual, and you are a terrible excuse for a human being.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Maybe you can just detail your stuff out.  
It's like saying ""I like sex""...  
Well, ok, but then, the light bondage, does it include tickling with feathers? With massage oils? Toys? Clips? With what are you doing the bondage? Any costumes?  
Because, at the end of it, there's the ""putting the stick in the hole"" which people focus on way too much. It's all the things around it that you have to think about. So instead of thinking of ""sexual fantasies"" open up the scope of what you are thinking. Step back from the sex, and think of everything that leads to ""sex"". This can be just before, like the foreplay, or anything that's sensual. It can even go further back. What about a nice diner date, in a fancy restaurant, where you go with a suit, and she wears a red sparkling robe, like Jessica Rabbit, a diner with wine, a grand piano, some sensual close dancing. Then you go back to your place, drink some wine while slowly taking each others clothes off, while music like [this](http://youtu.be/DLvDMKGNbBY) plays in the background. (Fireplace optional)  
You know, explore other things than ""putting it in"".  
Or, you could gag her with your shirt, tie her with the sheets, slap her ass, call her a dirty girl and go at her like an animal, but, IT'S THE MOOD that's fun to play with.  
Rough sex is best when there's lots of SEXUAL TENSION at the same time, not just going ""let's do rough"" and then doing it. You build up to it.  
Meh, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe that's not the kind of thing your girl enjoy. And yeah sometimes a quick one is fun too, but if you are making list, that's probably not the kind of things you are thinking about.  
(Or for the quick one, you could think of places where you could try and do it.... hahaha)","1333240948"

I am going to assume from your statements that you have never taken a single college anthropology course due to your complete ignorance on the evolution of human civilization, starting with the hunter/gatherer society that we all came from. But anyway, who needs that information, right? Total waste of time when I haz the interwebz and can look up correct unbiased information anywherze, amirite? Also

**BIOTRUTHS**

Hmm, why did the men go out to hunt and women stay behind, gathering food and all that yada yada? Because of kids. It has nothing to do with athletic capabilities.  Men didn't ""evolve"" to be good at athletic stuff, it was just that back then when we were all living off the land, that was the role men were assigned to. Women, because they had to breastfeed, had to stay by the camp, but they could also go and gather nuts, berries, and all those goodies. That was just the role assigned to them because of the need to look over kids. Last time I checked, men don't have milk coming out of their useless little tits to feed children. Just saying. 

**tldr;-** Women didn't ""evolve"" to attract men and provide care; men didn't ""evolve"" to be better athletes. These were just roles and ideals assigned to the different sexes thousands of years ago that  I cannot believe are still perpetuated today. Guess what, we're not a hunter/gatherer society anymore. Women are actually good for something other than attracting men and taking care of kids. Believe or not! ","1333240948"

We're all sufficiently trained now that he never gets near our precious bathroom, but in the early days, he would emerge just ahead of the toxic green cloud that would drop us in our tracks one by one as the smell slowly enveloped the office. As far as he knows, our bathroom has been broken for the last four years.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;and that is one of the problems with our food system. If a new product is allowed onto the market just because another product is GRAS then the public will never know if it IS realy safe. New products should require NEW testing.

What are you talking about.  Ammonia has been used in food preparation for years as a means of ""natural"" bacterial control.  Also mechanically separated meat has been done for years as well.  Nothing about this is new, this is not a ""new"" product.  Your just hearing about it for the first time right now.

&gt;The reason WHY ammonia is used by BPI is to kill off salmonella and other harmful bacteria.

So?!  This is a good thing, hell we do a lot of things to our food to decrease the chance of them getting spoiled or contaminated.  There is nothing wrong with this.

&gt;The reason why they have to do that is because the meat pulled off the bone is from SCRAPS and not from prime cuts.

No it isn't.  There are two sources of contamination you have to worry about when slaughtering an animal; direct and indirect.  

Direct contamination comes from improperly slaughtering the animal (ie you nick the colon and fecal material is able to come into contact with any part of the animal) this type of contamination can happen to any cut of meat, be it scraps or the finest cut.  

Indirect contamination occurs from exposing meat to a contamination source such as a dirty knife, or a dirty table, or leaving meat uncovered at room temperature for an extended period of time.  This can happen to any cut of meat as well.  If you cut out a piece of meat with a dirty knife then its contaminated, it doesn't matter what cut of meat it is or even how expensive it is.

&gt;Natural levels of Ammonia are always present but that doesn't mean that exposing food in a factory process is safe or even healthy.


FDA quote from the [Database of Select Committee on GRAS Substances](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fcn/fcnDetailNavigation.cfm?rpt=scogsListing&amp;id=27 )

&gt;Although there have been no significant feeding studies specifically designed to ascertain the safety threshold of ammonium compounds as food ingredients, numerous metabolic studies have been reported in the scientific literature. Extrapolation of these findings to the concentrations of ammonium compounds normally present in foods does not suggest that there would be untoward effects at such levels.  In the light of the foregoing, the Select Committee concludes that: There is no evidence...  that demonstrates, or suggests reasonable grounds to suspect, a hazard to the public when they are used at levels that are now current or that might reasonably be expected in future.

They took research already done on the metabolism of ammonia and realized that the levels used in those studies were higher than those expected to be found in the food industry.


&gt;These scraps were labeled for ANIMAL consumption years ago.

So, I bet the USDA also has sirloin and chuck labeled as fit for animal consumption as well.  The fact something is fit for animal consumption in no way means its bad for a human being.

That's like neglecting to do work on your calves because your hamstrings are stronger, and all the calf does is move your foot.

"EnoughPaulSpam","t5_2sir4","And after pro-Paul trolls kept shitting on the threads, and I'd kept posting the rules they were breaking, **I WAS THE ONE TO GET THE WARNING** about trolling.

I left Zak this message.  Though I doubt it will get anything accomplished except getting me banned.

-------------------------------------------

What in the world has gone on with r/ronpaul?  I know there have been some statements recently about banning trolls and jerks, but was this intended to only apply to people who were critical of Ron Paul?  The pro-Paul trolls seem to have taken it as a license to unleash holy hell.

Not only are posts being made dragging EPS into stuff, but we've been seeing sock-puppets pop up and start posting anti-Paul rantings in r/ronpaul with a crosslink to EPS, so it looks as if it appeared to come from our group.  (check out the user EuroSoc.  He's an obvious troll.  The account was created 1 hours before causing all sorts of shit in your group).

We're dealing with this type of crap all the time.  We might drop in with a snarky question now and then, but we're not digging up 5 year old, out-of-context paragraphs on people and holding them up as ""evidence"" of some grand scheme to deprive Ron Paul of anything.  It's just mind-bogglingly crazy.

You know the history of EPS, you don't need another primer on why it was created.  (reaction to the same wave of Paul-mania that happened in 2008, the Daily Paul ""Go vote here"", yadda yadda).  And you know that most of us, if actually GIVEN a reasonable discussion are willing to participate in it.  Hell, we LOVE it.  But when the loudest members of the room are the Birchers over at r/nolibswatch and their ""enemies lists"", then your entire subreddit is going to be painted as those wackos and trolls.

And really, it's downright hostile to anyone who does come to debate against a Ron Paul idea in this group.  And people rarely even debate against the IDEA, what typically ensues is a bunch of ""He's from EPS"" bullshit and it all gets sidetracks into how horrible of people the person with the opinion is, and avoid the opinion entirely.

So yes, something needs to be done about the trolls.  I'll fully agree with you on that.  But it's not EPS that are the ones being the trolls right now.  And unless the rules that have been laid down for Paul opponents are also applied to Paul supporters, they can hardly be considered anything but rules to shut out opposing viewpoints in order to reenforce the echo-chamber.

Please.  Let's see some trolls removed.

"DepthHub","t5_2rmpy","Thing is, it's a bit of a touchy subject, and the original comment sort of illustrates why in the first line When he writes:

&gt;Poverty/ Chav Culture

These two things are not synonymous! It's upsetting to some to see them used as such. Chav has hugely negative connotations in this country. Ergo, by equating those stricken by poverty with 'Chav Culture', you are being derogatory to the poverty stricken. 

&gt;Imagine millions of young teenagers (13/14/15) who are 'pre-gang'.
Utter bullshit. They are not 'pre-gang' any more than emo's are 'pre suicide'. It is a stupid jump in logic to assume that everyone who associates themselves with a particular youth movement is destined for a gang. In my experience, the majority (and I mean *vast* majority) of those who could be labelled Chavs in their teenage years do not go off into gangs. They grow up and get normal jobs. Sadly, often not very good jobs, as education isn't exactly glorified within chav culture, at a pretty vital time in one's intellectual development. Again, you can see here how failing to distinguish between chavs and the poor could be seen as offensive. There are plenty of poor people who do strive to better themselves. 

Now, on the other hand, it would be slightly unfair of me to say that Chav culture doesn't tend to be pre-dominantly found in poor areas. And this is in part because these are areas where education is worse, and the education system is likely to let you down. In such circumstances you are of course more likely to embrace a culture that doesn't put any merit upon the school system. 

However, my Etonian friends tell me their school wasn't completely exempt from people who identified with chav culture. In my opinion, this only reinforces the idea that chav culture is anti-education, it is not a culture of the poverty-stricken, it is a culture for those disillusioned with the education system. As this can happen in any education system, regardless of how good it is, chav culture is not restricted simply to the lower class. 

See, when people say chavs have no future, what they mean is that the poor have no future, because while (as I hope I've just illustrated) chav culture is not the culture of the lower class, prevalent thought says that it is. They're being classist and they don't realise it. 

It's something I feel strongly about. I could hardly say I was badly off; I went to a reasonably respectable state school. In my particular area (Wales, if it makes a difference) there are no grammar schools (essentially state run schools for gifted pupils; they are also free) and so unless you have money you are resigned to a state school. From here you could be expected to move on to study at a decent establishment for higher education, such as Exeter Uni, a London Uni, Sheffield, Cardiff etc. 

But there are limits. I applied to, and was the only one to successfully apply to, Oxford from my school. A while later I volunteered to go back and give a talk about it- what to expect, and what the application process was like. When I informed one of my friends of this, I was asked 'why?'. They just couldn't fathom anyone from that area even contemplating sending in an application. There was just a belief that *you come from here, you cannot go there*. I have other friends who feel similarly strongly, and are from far worse areas. 

If something like a university education seems out of reach simply because of your background, well, there's something wrong. It's something that really needs to be addressed, and I think it's in part why some turn to chav culture, particularly in the lower classes. The media certainly doesn't help. Misleading stories about what goes on in universities (and in particular Oxford) really only further alienate these people.

 Case in point:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-16604050

This gives an awful impression of Oxford, and one that I can declare *is not true*. NONE of her accusations hold any weight, but what if you read this, and it was your only impression of the place? Coupled with this: 

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2057785/Oxford-Tory-song-salutes-Nazi-killings--Drunken-students-facing-inquiry.html

And a slew of other bullshit stories. All of it is counter-productive, and all of it needs to be addressed.


I hope I've been of some help. Please do ask if you would like me to elaborate on anything at all!

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Shows you have a half-baked understanding of suicidal despair. That's a good thing though. Be thankful you've never had suicidal thoughts and increasing strength of depression for an excess of 8 years. It completely changes everything. I almost suicides, but I found a way out of it. But my way out places me in one of the most misunderstood and repressed minority communities in the world. That fact alone added a whole new level of complexity to the suicidal tendencies I was already experiencing.

The OP's friend was suffering. Suffering greatly. More than anyone who has never been at such a point could even fathom. It warps reality and makes us delusional. In that state all there is to do is end the pain. Years and years of pain become too great to handle. Gotta kill myself, gotta kill myself, gotta kill myself, gotta return to nothing, gotta kill myself gotta kill myself fuck it all fuck it all fuck it all. These repetitive thoughts used to run through my brain. Mix it with a very heavy burden of psychological pain and you have yourself a recipe for disaster.

Of course it hurts those around us, but time will go on and they will get over it. More time will go on and they too will pass. More time will pass and the world as we know it will be gone. All of it in the blink of a cosmic eye. Why should I stick around feeling pain so my friends and family don't? The pain they will feel from my suicide would be so much less than what I've experienced over the course of my life. They can do this for me. They are strong enough to overcome it and move on. The one wish I used to have is that my friends and family would support my decision to suicide.

Now I'm not depressed anymore. I enjoy being alive and I realize now the pain of losing someone to suicide and I hate is as much as the next. But I also realize what that person went through and the struggle to be happy that she went through. Years and years wear us out and some of us lose the battle.

OP's friend is gone and that is very sad. I hope he doesn't view his friend as selfish. The struggles he went through were selfless and there is no doubt he struggled for his survival for many years.","1333241039"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I really shouldn't respond, but this is a short overview of how I see it...

If God is sovereign the way Calvinism posits, i.e. salvation is entirely dependent on His will, then either God is a liar and/or double-minded, Christ's sacrifice is insufficient, or every individual will be saved. For Scripture says again and again that God does not desire the death of the wicked, but wills that all should repent and be saved (Ez. 18:23, 1 Tim. 2:3-4, 2 Pet. 3:9, etc).

Furthermore, Calvin promoted the heresy of Iconoclasm, which denies the Incarnation. Calvin states ""that as often as any form is assigned to God, his glory is corrupted by an impious lie"" (Institutes, 1.11.1). Surely this means that Paul's claim that Christ is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15) is an impious lie. If God did take on human form in the person of Jesus Christ, then it is scarcely impious to make images of that form, keeping in mind that it is the person represented whom we glorify, not the actual material of the image. This was settled in the Seventh Ecumenical Council.

Finally, Calvin's entire system depends on Romish inventions that have little or no witness in the first thousand years of Christian theology. Chief among these inventions is Satisfaction Theory, introduced by Anselm (1033-1109), and based on feudalism. There is no reason to believe doctrines such as Penal Substitution are biblical if they originate a full thousand years after the canon was closed.","1333241045"

I think the electorate  in every other country in the world with some version of universal health care feels the same.

Imperfect as all these plans are, they're leagues better than what America has endured since Nixon, Haldeman, Edgar Kaiser. Exponentially better. My Care Card covers almost everything. My imperfect plan does not cover dental or eyecare, but a reference by my personal/family doctor, whom I *freely* choose and can change anytime, authorizes full coverage. No matter illness or injury, I'm covered, for about a third to half less than the excrable Nixon/Haldeman/Kaiser HMO ripoff system.

Once the electorate sees the benefits of universal health care  in participating states, the electorate in opt-out states will follow. That's how it happened in Canada. Tommy Douglas and Saskatchewan first, the rest following in spite of lots of threatening blather from right-wing self-interest.

The first is never a strict liability offense, the second one almost always is and the third may or may not be depending on the circumstances and jurisdiction. Reasonable belief that consent was present is sufficient to absolve a charge of sexual assault in numerous jurisdictions even where it may not have been determined to be legally present. This is not the case for statutory rape. The third depends so much on context (such as whether social host liability is in play) and local law it's pretty much worthless as an analogy. Get your facts straight before you spout off on what is and isn't legally the case.

His female companions, who came from his inner circle — all certified virgins or young brides — entered his bed naked in order to warm him with their bodies. Some of them also administered enemas to him. Among the young girls, there was rivalry as to who would sleep with him, and one of his girl disciples reported that his bed companions had a difficult time in restraining their sexual impulses since he often rubbed against them and touched them in erotic places. Although his closemouthed house guardians were fearful of public reaction if news of these ""pedophilic"" sexual interactions were publicized, Gandhi continued to engage in them until his death. Gandhi did not have sexual intercourse with them, but obviously the touching and feeling were very important to him.

If this is the case...


$1,000,000,000 added to the economy will add 1,000,000,000 to disposable income. Then this will be split savings/spending


500,000,000 will then AGAIN be added to OTHER'S disposable income

then 250,000,000

then 125,000,000

then  62,500,000

then  31,250,000

then  15,625,000

then    7,812,500

If we continue to add all these together. 
We get that the $1,000,000,000 added to the economy resulted in a $2,000,000,000 income increase overall.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Again, you're comparing apples to oranges. A fetus's only way to make it into this world is by a woman carrying it to full term. For millions of years, women had to deal with the fact that they may DIE after having a child. Almost 30 percent of them did (that's an estimation). 

Nowadays, we have a 99 percent survival rate for women who go through births. They get medication, therapy, and doctor visits. There are still women all over the world who can't even get a doctor while they're having the baby, let alone all the pampering our pregnant women in first world countries get. Being pregnant isn't like some type of torture nature puts us through. Although birth can be compared to torture but yet again, there are medicines and treatments that allay the pain. 

I'm just wondering what can be said about today's society when such a natural thing such as pregnancy can become too much, or become a burden. About less than 1% of pregnancies are concieved from rape, due to a body's defense system when it is being attacked. 99% are on purpose or through some type of error. 

Is it really so much for some of us to consider to human life pro-life people are trying to protect, rather than the women who have to ""deal with"" their mistakes and have a child? Yeah, shit happens. But when shit happens, you have to deal with the ""consequences"" rather than just taking the (very questionably) ""harmless"" way out. ","1333241078"

That's... not a gray area. They are agnostic atheists, what is gray about that?

You said it, *religious* people, they are religious.

&gt; religious people who reject certain theologies

I haven't met a single religious person who doesn't reject other theologies. In fact, I haven't met a single person.

You also said it again, ""religious"" people. They are religious.

&gt; ""spirituals""

A different question altogether. Are the theists? Then they are atheists. Are they religious? Then they are nonreligious. I know it may be shocking, but there is such thing as a nonreligious spiritual atheist.

For example, some atheists believe in ghosts. What you are doing is confusing and confounding what is actually being said.

&gt; non-practing theists

Theists. Who could be religious or nonreligious really. Would depend upon the person.

&gt; doubting theists

Still theists.

&gt; agnostic theists

Yes, theists can be agnostic. That's not hard.

&gt; spiritualistic atheists

And?

&gt; religious atheists

And?

The use of the word mutilation is accurate, that it creates a negative emotional response in you is your own issue, and I would venture to suggest that it only serves to highlight that the issue actually is rather sensitive for you.

It was interesting to see the different types of people who came in but i think among the younger secular voters there was a strong sentiment of if Christianity is so tightly wound in to politics on the state and federal level why would we want to allow the government to intrude on ourselves even more. so trying to keep politics out of this subreddit i think students are more open minded and passionate about improving the standard of life of all people but arn't quite jaded into the methods that the strictly left and strictly right lay before them and will usually find their own middle ground. i have personally found in my experiences as a libratarian that me and my friends have more in common with self described socialists, who supposedly believe the polar opposite of what we do than democrats or republicans, The vision is the same but it's the methods of how to get it done that we disagree with   ","1333241114"

Why is it so important for you to know anyway? Do you need to know how far she has gone so you can top it?

The only reason you need to burn fuel when not accelerating is because of air/ground resistance. Every time you break you essentially throw away all your kinetic energy and convert it to heat and earth momentum because normal cars does not have power regenerative breaking like electric cars does. To regain that kinetic energy when accelerating you need to burn the corresponding amount of fuel. If you must choose between stopping completely when making a left turn and preserving some of the speed in a right turn, that should make a world of difference.","1333241117"

It would probably never happen for a ton of logistical reasons, but I think it would be pretty fun to watch.  I doubt the NBA players would put their all into it, but it would definitely make some mad cash.  The problem comes when you realize that this time of year is crunch time in the NBA, and these college athletes have already been away from classes for so long that it would be tough to justify traveling for another weekend to play a game that didn't really matter.

Perhaps they could add it into All-Star week, and have a top NCAA program play against a team of rookies/second years?","1333241117"

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","&gt; Artificial intelligences, no matter how advanced, lack the one vital trait even them most stalwart Vulcan possesses: intuition.

1) Data was shown with intuition.

2) Holodeck characters were shown with intuition.

3) Intuition is known by cog.sci folks today to be basically a basic heuristic -- Level I cognition -- operating on partial information of which you may or may not be conscious of receiving. This is explicable and reproducible.

More importantly:

- *As I asked it* -- the point was that it wouldn't *be* AI in control. It would be *people*, using telepresence with remote feeds over subspace relay. Build robots that walk, talk, feel, and *look* like you. In every detail. And then have them capture sensory input and feed that into a chair you sit in that pipes the experiences directly into your brain, while the chair reads your neural activity and sends the actions you perform back to the robo-you.

&gt; Basically, AIs have superior brains and bodies, but non-AIs have superior hearts. 

* ""Data, you are the most... *human*... person I've ever known.""

This cycle works for everything from the labor market (people selling work) to input markets. When a government decides to add money to the economy. This, for a reason i am not gonna get into right now, causes the overall interest rates to go down. When interest rates go down, business are more likely to invest in more things (instead of putting their money in the bank and accumulate interest). When a business has more inputs (from labor to products) they can sell more things, and they can hire more people, thus helping the economy.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","check out r/learnart. We have a great community and there's lots of reading material. I recommend that you go there and post a picture of what you can do right now for advice on where to start improving.

As for books, check out ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" it's got a lot of dated pseudoscience but it does a good job of teaching a beginner how to properly observe what they want to draw. ","1333241137"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","And what's the root of the group mentality? What made the entire practice, the giving of wives, the consummation of those marriages. As to Thailand, I'd say that the majority of the people in western culture don't participate in it, such behavior is looked down upon and has to be practiced in secret. Looking at Pakistan this disgusting and absurd mentality is not only more pervasive, it's the freaking norm. Without knowing how many people participate in the sex trade, it's hard to say exactly how much of it is on our collective shoulders as a culture. This practice is a cultural norm in this part of the world, and it's spreading. even such practices such as date rape and participating in the child sex trade are private acts, this is totally different. It's institutionalized.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Not really, you'd own a copy of the *compiled* code, which is very different to owning the source code, art, textures and everything else^*. Decompiling software is technically possible, but is a hugely difficult task and would take years for any big budget title. The binary files. Also it would be covered by copyright law, making duplication a civil offence (or criminal one if you make a profit from it or do it on a large enough scale) much like copying a book for resale would.

Basically there are already protections in place to cover exactly what it is this is supposed to deal with, it's just that publishers find there's more profit in buying preventative measures than in following the already established routes

^* There are some cases where you can un-compile code, the main examples of this being java and actionscript. These package the code and send it to a pre-compiled interpreter instead of being compiled in their entirety","1333241139"

You cannot subjectively evaluate the ideal; you must choose objective criteria and those which are picked in the context of a utopia are peace, intellectualism and rationality, stability, and ethics.","1333241140"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt; No idea. For all I know, you're from Patchogue.

Patchogue isn't considered part of NYC, it's Long Island.

&gt; Because Trinitarios, DDP, Netas and ALKQN beef with Bloods (and the group that largely represents them), that doesn't mean all Dominicans share that attitude.

Whaaaaaat? The racism towards blacks existed before those groups existed. Ever heard of Trujillo, he was some guy who with plenty of support from his constituency had tens of thousands of Haitians killed. Racism has existed in the Dominican Republic since the first Haitians crossed over.

&gt; If you're talking about ""cocolo"", I only hear it used to clarify that someone is a non-Spanish speaking Black as opposed to a Spanish speaking Black.

Would you consider the typical African-American who does not speak spanish, a ""non-spanish speaking black""? While my Grandfather was called ""Moreno"" he was never EVER called ""Cocolo""

&gt; Maybe it's just you that has an issue with being Afro-Latino, I don't know.

No the issue is that you don't know the meaning of the terms and propagating it. In English, black = African-American, to Caribbean Hispanics ""Moreno"" and ""Negro"" can literally mean ""dark skin"" or ""Black"" but it does not mean ""African-American"" 

Please don't project some garbage racism on me I am well aware of my African descendancy and have no problems with it.

"science","t5_mouw","If you want some incredible research, check out BNCT therapy. It's amazing, basically if you radiate boron atoms with a neutron beam, they'll degrade into Li, He &amp; alpha particles. Li and He don't really have adverse effects on the body, but alpha rays are cytotoxic and only travel about 8-10nm (the diameter of the average cell), so if you have a way to deliver a molecular 'packet' of boron molecules (what's used in research is the carborane cage) to cancer cells, and you radiate it them with a neutron gun, you'll have localized, tumor specific treatment. 

I did undergraduate medicinal chemistry research on finding a molecule to taylor that carborane cage to lipids and cholesterol esters. The reason being, that cancer cells tend to over express LDL receptors, and when you dissolve these lipids into the LDL particles, and inject them into human serum, you can say that MOST of those particles will be headed towards the cancer cells--it's like you've got a few magnetic balls floating around in a pool, and they'll tend to go towards the most powerful 'magnet'--aka the cancer cells that over express the LDL receptors.

I've started a masters and quit the project, but seriously there's a TON of potential for this research.","1333241141"
