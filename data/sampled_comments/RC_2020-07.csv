"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm aware of the property rent, employees wages and the serving act. My opinion is if I'm spending enough money to enjoy a three course meal with a group of friends, I don't see much of a problem with ordering a pitcher of tap water for the group, especially if I don't drink soft drinks (so I'll just drink at the water.) Yes it comes in the pitcher and served with a smile but they tried to pass that act here in Ireland, and also implement *water taxes* and basically the whole country was having none of it and protested which ended in success.

Luckily I didn't run into any bother when I was in Aachen in Oct - Nov last year, the bar and restaurant proprietors where all very facilitating. Maybe it's just a cultural or regional thing",1593561600

"comingout","t5_2rw9q","Only you can know that. It took me years to come to the realization and then more years to accept that I was gay. I dealt with a lot of shame. I’m 24 and I came out last year. I remember when I first discovered porn when I was like 13. It started out with the straight stuff, but I was always drawn to the men and not the women. Then about a year later I strictly was watching gay porn, but I always attributed it to a phase. Then about a year after that I would can with guys and still through all of that I never thought I was gay. In my mind I thought that I would like women one day. Once I was in college I kind of realized that I was gay or bi (but I’m gay, with like a lime zest of bi/pan lol) but during college I had a very hard time accepting it. I hated myself for it. It wasn’t until the end of college that I started to experiment with dudes. Once I had my first hookup, there was no doubt in my mind. But honestly I don’t think that you have to do anything physically sexual to know if you are queer. It was a hard journey, but it’s part if the process. Always here if you wanna talk :)",1593561600

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history.

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

The Twili backstory is unclear at best interlopers (Gerudo? Sheikah? Hylian mages? Loruleans? Zonai? ect)

Sheikah seem to have helped the light spirits make the Twili Realm habitable for the Twili, or the Twili included/had atleast some sheikah tech.


There is a pattern here.

Master Khoga

Since we don't know who or what the Twili are in relation to other games/lore,  we just don't know, but it's different then you might have thought.

We can't say Sheikah tech wasn't used/banished before OoT for certain, but most people would argue that we can. We can't say what state the sheikah were in before or after the Interlopers but it's clear they probably had some tech, or the light spirits had sheikah like tech, or the Interlopers could mimic sheikah tech.

It's unlikely any Twili escaped the Twili realm after TP.",1593561601

"pennystocks","t5_2qqoq","I have only been trading for a little under 2 months. I invested only a few hundred initially until now I've put in 4,800. Although I've been up as much as 2k I'm at a pretty steady support of +800. I've only invested I'm about 10 stocks since then and only pulled out of one for a significant loss (8-10% I believe...  it was an 3x ETF and after over a month it's only dropped further). I'm definitely no day trader but holding onto a stock for weeks doesn't seem like a bad strategy. The amount of artificial pumping, even if it sends a stock up 1000%, has me extremely cautious.

1) If there is no significant news or financial catalyst driving the pump, I wont even look at it no matter what anyone is trying to say.
2) I opt for stocks that are very likely to receive news again and again such as pharma stocks. They also have great hype potential.
3) Make sure there is a lower chance of any dilution or offering (getting in right after one is the best imo).
4) Never buy stocks that trend down for years and have no major catalyst for climbing back up (excusing R/S).
5) Average down if necessary which means dont go all in at one point as well since you never know if it will drop further.
6) Depending on trends, estimate where your exit point is:
- If it's a big spike then 15-20% is typical for me to exit (almost every stock I've exited from has gone twice that high... but I didnt have to worry about a crash).
- I love love love stocks that show obvious accumulation because then the rise in stock price is also gentle and I can get out just as the institutional money has started to unload and hop into another as it's bottoming out. Rinse and repeat.

My strategy likely wont get me a 1000% return in a year but perhaps a couple 100% and in fine with that.",1593561602

To anyone in the situation, I would recommend pushing your own key rather than looking for a group. No one is going to invite a 460 &lt;1500 io DPS to a 15 group. You’ll spend hours looking for a non existent group lol. If you’re 460, though, you should be good enough to push your own key to 15 and complete it (even if it’s not in time).

It’s absolutely astronomically harder to pug your way up as a DPS, but it’s definitely not impossible.

Like I mentioned in my comment above, I was lucky to have friends essentially boost me so I didn’t experience the heartache of pugging. I’m planning on boosting a Druid when I get home from work tonight (BfA is $20 right now and gives you a 110 boost) and not connect it to my main’s io. Going to try to pug my way up the io ladder and see how miserable of a time it is.

Blazing Fest banners started to have some effect on PVP, more units being released after Tsunade V2 started to have better/viable speed with abilities especially BF Hashirama who is a crit machine and can one shot most units in PVP. 


Blazing Bash banners were always on a lookout to see how those new units can affect the meta which BB Pain V2 has and somewhat Itachi as well (if properly supported). PVP-oriented players always needed to watch out for both banners now to see which one will help out PVP the most especially players who lack Kage League units, whether they should spend pearls on Blazing Bash or Blazing Fest banners. 



Then you get the appearance of Legendary Banners the one being 7* SO6P Naruto and 7* Kakashi. 7* Kakashi has some utility on PVP, he can almost KO any unit if maxed out his abilities, but can still be a victim of dodge and jutsu sealing. Kakashi is a great nuker in PVE, but he is not a must use unit to complete much of PVE anyway.




However, Naruto on the other hand game changing. His abilities makes him tank anything, health/speed is top tier, and if you build your team around him getting his ultimate off, it can guarantee you the win. He is also fantastic on PVE content as well. 


Don't forget 7* Blazing Bash Madara, now the developers are adding in 7* Blazing Bash characters? At the moment it is an old character getting buffed, but what is to say if there was a new exclusive 7* Blazing Bash character who can be as game changing as 7* Naruto?




As a result, there might be four banners for PVP players to worry about in the next seasons of Kage League. 



Should they summon on the new Blazing Fest unit? Blazing Bash? Legendary Banner? Or Legendary Blazing Bash Banner?",1593561603

If the game you are running is not so much the over the top action hero genre I can see what you mean. Although for me this is more about the general competence of an NPC rather than them being human or not. 

What I will do is grant them an aspect (as in Fate) and in that aspect they can add a ""wild"" die. I do this because I want to keep full blown wildcards rare but I still want to have special NPCs. So for instance if the PCs need a special item repaired they might hear of a blacksmith in the next town who is known in the region. I might also just give the NPC a +1 or +2 based on them having a particular edge but be careful with going too far. I also tend to simplify my NPCs so this blacksmith might look something like: 

* Garon the Black, Orc d6, Str/Vig d8, Blacksmith d8+d6, covered in soot, impatient. 

This just means he gets a d6 on most rolls except Str/Vigor and ""blacksmithing"". He is otherwise just another extra but if the PCs really want their item repaired they might seek him out. If he becomes a prominent character he might even get promoted to full wildcard status.

I feel this gives me a middle ground between full wildcards and the extras. It also means that I can roll out in the open and not have every extra with a +d6 be a wildcard.",1593561603

There are quite a few articles out about how hard it is to get your song listened to by the right people. And if you somehow manage that, you’ve only got the first 10 seconds or so to get them interested. So it’s tough to actually “make it”.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Stopped at Gettysburg for the weekend at a small motel right next to one of the graveyards. At 2am I go out for ice and see this huge parade of folks all decked out in civil war era garb. There were easily 200 people walking right down the middle of the street. Honestly, after hanging out in the battlefields all day, I thought nothing of it. I gave a few of them a wave and they waved back. No big deal. Went back to my room to see of my friend wanted to go watch the parade.. But by the time she got her shoes on and came outside, the people were gone and it was crazy quiet, like all those people had never been there.

Another time, we go to Maine to visit one of my friends and help her pack up her mom's house. There weren't enough beds so several of us just slept on the chairs in the living room. So all night, the kids are running up and down the stairs, making all this noise because the floors are all bare wood. A few times they came running through the room we were in but mostly they were on the back end of the house where the stairs were. None if us got more than an hour of sleep all night from the noise. So, the next morning I tell my friend who's mom owns the house that maybe she needs to keep better control of her kids. ""I don't have any kids,"" she blinks as I realize that yeah, I haven't seen any kids since we arrived. ""Those were probably the kids from next door,"" she says after a minute. ""They drown back in the 1900s but still hang around between her house and the one next door.""",1593561604

"liberalgunowners","t5_2vjre","&gt;Supported the initial ahistorical reinterpretation of the 2nd amendment. 

Just because you read a blog post in it doesn't make it true...

All the Judicial, Statutory, and Historic evidence from the 17th Century to Modern day supports the individual right to keep and bear arms unconnected to militia service.

Being a direct descendant of the English colonies American law is based off of the English model. Our earliest documents from the Mayflower compact to the Constitution itself share a lineage with the Magna Carta. Even the American Bill of Rights being modeled after the English Bill of Rights.

The individual right, unconnected to milita service, pre-exists the United States and the Constitution. This right is firmly based in English law. 

[In 1689 The British Bill of Rights gave all protestants the right to keep and bear arms.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689)

[""The English right was a right of individuals, not conditioned on militia service...The English right to arms emerged in 1689, and in the century thereafter courts, Blackstone, and other authorities recognized it. They recognized a personal, individual right."" - 
CATO Brief on DC v Heller]( http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/07-290_RespondentAmCuCATOInstJMalcolm.pdf)

Prior to the debates on the US Constitution or its ratification multiple states built the individual right to keep and bear arms, unconnected to militia service, in their own state constitutions.

[""That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the State"" - chapter 1, Section XV, Constitution of Vermont - July 8, 1777.](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/vt01.asp)

[""That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state"" - A DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OR STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, Section XIII, Constitution of Pennsylvania - September 28, 1776.](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/pa08.asp)

Later the debates that would literally become the American Bill of Rights also include the right of the people to keep and bear arms.

[""And that the said Constitution never be constructed to authorize Congress to infringe on the just liberty of the press, or the rights of the conscience; or prevent of people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms; or to raise standing armies, unless when necessary for the defense of the United States, or of some one or more of them; or to prevent the people from petitioning, in a peaceful and orderly manner, the federal legislature for a redress of grievances; or to subject the people to unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons, papers, or possessions."" - Debates and proceedings in the Convention of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, 1788. Page 86-87.](https://archive.org/details/debatesandproce00peirgoog) 

The American Bill of Rights itself was a compromise between the federalist and anti-federalist created for the express purpose of protecting individual rights.

[""In the ratification debate, Anti-Federalists opposed to the Constitution, complained that the new system threatened liberties, and suggested that if the delegates had truly cared about protecting individual rights, they would have included provisions that accomplished that.  With ratification in serious doubt, Federalists announced a willingness to take up the matter of  a series of amendments, to be called the Bill of Rights, soon after ratification and the First Congress  comes into session.  The concession was  undoubtedly  necessary to secure the Constitution's hard-fought ratification.  Thomas Jefferson, who did not attend the Constitutional Convention, in a December 1787 letter to Madison called the omission of a Bill of Rights a major mistake: ""A bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth.""](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/billofrightsintro.html)

In Madison's own words:

[“I think we should obtain the confidence of our fellow citizens, in proportion as we fortify the rights of the people against the encroachments of the government,” Madison said in his address to Congress in June 1789.](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/on-this-day-james-madison-introduces-the-bill-of-rights)

Madison's first draft of the second Amendment is even more clear.

[""The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country; but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.""](https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&amp;fileName=001/llac001.db&amp;recNum=227)

Ironically it was changed because the founders feared someone would try to misconstrue a clause to deny the right of the people.

[*""Mr. Gerry -- This declaration of rights, I take it, is intended to secure the people against the maladministration of the Government; if we could suppose that, in all cases, the rights of the people would be attended to, the occasion for guards of this kind would be removed. Now, I am apprehensive that this clause would give an opportunity to the people in power to destroy the Constitution itself. They can declare who are those religiously scrupulous and prevent them from bearing arms.""* - House of Representatives, Amendments to the Constitution 17, Aug. 1789](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendIIs6.html)

Please note Mr. Gerry clearly refers to this as the right of the people.

This is also why we have the 9th Amendment.

[""The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.""](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_States_of_America_1992)

Article I Section 8 had already established and addressed the militia and the military making the incorrect collective militia misinterpretation redundant.

Supreme Court cases like US v. Cruikshank, Presser v. Illinois, DC v. Heller, and even the Dredd Scott decision specifically call out the individual right to keep and bear arms unconnected to militia service.

[This is further evidenced by State Constitutions including the Right to keep and bear arms from the Colonial Period to Modern Day.](http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/beararms/statedat.htm)

[“The Constitutions of most of our states assert that all power is inherent in the people; that they may exercise it by themselves, in all cases to which they think themselves competent, (as in electing their functionaries executive and legislative, and deciding by a jury of themselves, both fact and law, in all judiciary cases in which any fact is involved) or they may act by representatives, freely and equally chosen; that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed; that they are entitled to freedom of person; freedom of religion; freedom of property; and freedom of the press. in the structure of our legislatures we think experience has proved the benefit of subjecting questions to two separate bodies of deliberants; ...” - Thomas Jefferson’s letter to John Cartwright, on June 5th, 1824](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/98-01-02-4313)",1593561604

"mildlyinfuriating","t5_2ubgg","&gt;Disabled dog abandoned in São Leopoldo has 20 interested
 Animal Protection Secretariat has scheduled interviews with potential adopters this week.  Tintin is taken care of by the Municipal Kennel team.  Police investigate abuse by guardians.
 At least 20 people showed interest in adopting Tintin, the dog with disabilities in the front legs abandoned twice in the same day in São Leopoldo, in the Metropolitan Region of Porto Alegre.  On Monday (6), the Animal Protection Secretariat (Sempa) scheduled interviews with possible adopters until Friday.

 Sempa is in no hurry to find a new home for the dog.  So that Tintim does not run the risk of abandonment for the third time, Secretary Anderson Ribeiro decided to apply a questionnaire to distinguish who wants and is able to adopt the animal from whom he was just moved by the repercussion of the case.

 ""He is very well in our care and will only be released to those who really deserve it"", highlights the secretary.

 Sempa should investigate whether there are street or community animals where the adopting family lives, whether there are more animals in the house, what their temperament and size, if they are adopted, among other issues.

 ""It is more the social aspect that will be taken into account,"" says Anderson.  ""There is no logic, for example, to have five animals in front of the house, not to give water, not to adopt, and to adopt Tintin because he is famous. First adopt the animal from your street"", says the secretary.

 ""Therefore, the process will be conducted calmly and calmly and the family history will be evaluated very well.""

 Another care that the secretary emphasizes is the requirement for a type of floor that suits the dog's needs.  “Due to the deficiency in his paws, he drags his neck a lot on the floor.  The adopter's home must have tiled floors, with no gravel or grooves to avoid hurting his neck.  We want conscious adoption. ”

 On social media, in the profile of the NGO Ampara Animal, the actress and comedian Tatá Werneck also showed interest in adopting the dog.

 The 1st São Leopoldo Police Station received the police report and investigates the case.  Witnesses have already been summoned to give evidence.

 According to delegate Ivair Matos, the police investigates possible ill-treatment, a crime provided for in the Environmental Crimes Law, whose penalty varies from three months to one year in prison and a fine.

 Despite the commotion perceived by the secretary in recent days, the secretary for Animal Protection hopes that this will alert to other adoptions.  “The kennel has 30 amputated animals, another 20 with paralysis, and 10 that are blind.  Therefore, we have other dogs with difficulties similar to Tintin's that need shelter ”, stresses Anderson.

 Tintim awaits adoption at São Leopoldo kennel

 Sempa estimates that there are about 6,000 homeless dogs in São Leopoldo.  Of these, 300 are in the municipal kennel.

 Those interested in adopting Tintin or another dog should schedule an interview",1593561605

He should be picked for his keeping first and foremost. And he's streets ahead of both Bairstow and Buttler with the gloves. There's something integrally wrong with English cricket if they're picking blokes for their secondary job.

During Australia's Gilchrist era, there was a fella kicking about in reggies called Darren Berry, who is widely considered to be Australia's best pure keeper of the past 20 years, probably since Healy. Some reckoned he was better than Rod Marsh. He was brilliant. He never played a test. Gilchrist was a pretty good keeper, but he wasn't great - Berry was way better. Berry was a meh bat, though. He only averaged 21 in first class cricket. But Gilchrist averages 48 in tests. For a good keeper, to average nearly 50? That's nearly impossible to refuse. In cases like those, you've gotta go with the better bat.

Similar situation here. But Buttler? He averages 31 in tests, not 48. And Foakes? He averages 38 in FC, not 21. It's a no-brainer, really.",1593561606

Yes, but there’s nothing wrong with discussing communist theory.

Nor should any fan feel entitled to know every single diagnosis and detail about the players health overall. 

If you found out you had an STD, would you go into work and announce to everyone at your job you have one, or would you only tell the relevant and necessary people AKA the short cute blonde you work with and casually fuck after work once and a while?

"mead","t5_2rcsz","This picture is from a couple days ago and the mead is currently sitting in two one-gallon carboys for secondary. I got about 1.7 gallons yield from a 3.0-3.3-gallon primary (tough to measure with co2 pushing the cap up) and topped off the second carboy by pressing out the blueberries and racking onto some campden in the hopes I avoid oxidation. At worst, I have at least one carboy that won't oxidize. I will say, this community is incredible. I have learned so much lurking for the last couple months that I was confident enough to go after a no-water mead for my first shot at meadmaking. Luckily for me, the fermentation was low and slow and produced (other than Blue Berry White) the best melomel I've ever had straight out of primary! No jet fuel! Between Tosna, YAN calculations, punchdown schedules, fruit treatment (freezing and thawing), etc., you all lay a pretty incredible blueprint for the beginning meadmaker. Anyway, I cannot attest to how balanced this will be once it clears (I imagine the blueberry matter in suspension made it come off more tannic than the finished product will be), so I might add oak at next racking and maybe even an acid treatment at bottling. Who knows. Recipe is as follows:

12 pounds orange blossom honey

19.6875 pounds wild blueberries, frozen and thawed

2 packets Lalvin 71b rehydrated with Tosna calculator's recommended amount of goferm and  fermented at 64 center of must

Tosna 2.0 targeting 150ppm YAN (wasn't sure if this was ideal, but it worked) with a mix of Fermaid K and DAP

Twice daily punchdown/degas for the first week

Volume was somewhere between 2.9 and 3.3 gallons. I wasn't too strict about determining exact volume and only thought to do so once the fruit cap was elevated. I do not know the starting gravity, but it finished a touch over 1.060, right where I wanted it. Anyway, that's my Ted Talk. Thank you all for being a phenomenal resource for newbies. I read The Compleat Meadmaker, but I honestly think that almost all the knowledge I used to make my first mead came from here. Cheers! -Matt",1593561607

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","They had a whole preliminary hearing on June...4th I believe. Look up that hearing and you will see how foolish your claims are. 

I very much doubt you know as much about this case as you claim if you still believe the chase began for any other reason than what Greg claimed when be thought he was free. 

I've also followed this case closely. 

In fact you can check several threads (suggest those dated after the hearing) and learn more about the case (or less if you solely go to spin)

"PlantedTank","t5_2szbf","Dosing of fertz is known to harm nerites, and indeed many invertebrates.  Tabs are typically the safest option if you have to fertilize and don't have a large tank.  Some people claim its the copper that kills the inverts, but this is unlikely unless you don't have a planted tank.  Plants will readily absorb most heavy metals, and usually the amounts found fertilizers aren't enough to cause issues (there's copper found in many fish foods as well).  The rapid chemical swings may be what cause the issues.   Additionally, a lack of GH or KH can cause issues as well.  You may have rapid PH swings as plants ""go to sleep"" for the night. 

Instead of nerites though, I would simply use pest snails.  They are kind of a nuisance though, as they are hard to eliminate since they breed readily and some can breed asexually.",1593561607

"AskAChristian","t5_2s79d","&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  Yes, assuming, a consistent, true, genuine, loving relationship with Jesus. This is the hard part. Any Christian can claim they have such relationship, but they still desire earthly things, which is normal, but sometimes in excess, as those people you mentioned above. Even if say they genuinely do have such relationship, people can't avoid from sinning. 

A no true Scotsman, or appeal to purity, is an informal fallacy in which one attempts to protect a universal generalization from counterexamples by changing the definition in an ad hoc fashion to exclude the counterexample. 

&gt; Yes. Because Christianity seeks to change people from within. The outside will take care of itself. 

I seek to change myself from within every single day, and I don't need Jesus to be a decent person. I know I am not any better or worse than anyone, not Hitler, not Elon Musk, not Einstien, not Gandhi, not even Jesus, I am human too. I do not overindulge myself, I do not eat fast food, I do not eat very much meat, I do not drink except on occasion. I do not steal from people, I have a few positions, I give my time to help others when I can. I do not cheat on my SO even when given a literal free pass to from them. I am hardworking to constantly improve myself every day at work, NEVER accepting that being on top of all the key performance indicators is good enough. Finally, I am a pacifist and believe that patience is one of my strongest qualities. The only thing I am guilty of, in your Christian view, is not accepting Jesus any more than I accept Harry Potter into my heart. 

&gt; I don't think so. I never heard of this, but a quick wikipedia lookup Hitler had a warped screwed up view of Christianity, and actually could be described as anti-Christian. 

This Wikipedia is quite long and I don't believe you actually read it. I will grant you however that he did use the shit out of it to control people into justifying his own action. The Bible can be twisted in so many ways it can fit and be used to manipulate anyone when used correctly. That was my point bringing that up.",1593561608

I have PCOS, age 34, overweight 30 years, and have successfully lost 80 lbs without any medication either. I did this by counting calories (I weigh literally everything I put in my mouth down to the gram) and being active, tracking everything to make sure I stay in a deficit. You know, science. 
When I hear people say that they just don’t eat anything and still can’t lose weight, what they really mean is that they have no idea how much they’re actually eating or how much they’re burning, so have no clue what their calorie goals should really be. You’re getting negative comments on your post because it flies in the face of the excuses some people want to make to themselves about why they aren’t losing weight. Yes, PCOS can make weight loss a little more challenging. But just as you said, it’s not impossible.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Your brother's life expectancy is still severely shortened. Lungs are not like other organ transplants, the body *will* reject them eventually. It can be slowed by medication but it cannot be stopped. The *median* survival rate is 5.8 years after a double lung transplant. There is a very real chance that he will not make it to 35, and you need to accept that and take it into consideration.

If you really care about yourbrother you will understand that his outcome is better when he is mentally in a better place. There are few things more stressful than thinking that you could leave your spouse homeless and destitute if you don't survive another ten years. 

You're going by the letter of the law and doing what's right for the *trust*, but you're not doing what's right for the benefactor of that trust. What is right for your bro is to know that his wife will not be on the street if something happens. What is right is to give him that peace of mind. 

You need to be the better person. A massive trust will do your brother no good if he doesn't survive long enough to inherit it or if he can't use it to provide for his wife in the event of his death.

Buy the damn house. Put it only in his name with the stipulation that she won't benefit from it unless bro passes. Let it go to her if your brother dies. Give him that peace of mind. Would you really feel victorious if brother passed in 5 years and you got the whole trust and kicked SIL out? Would it make you feel better? Because if it does YTA in more ways than one.

The  screenwriter is the same for *Romance of Tiger and Rose* so while it has a different theme, the tone is similar and is relatively fast paced.   The leads have nice chemistry, as it's their second project together.  And ML is still a good drama kisser 
* *Parallel Love*: ignore some logic gaps and bad hair &amp; fashion, this is a sweet &gt;!time travel!&lt; romance.  Enjoy the sweet bickering between a competent female lead and a childish but doting male lead. 
* *The Bad Kids*: the most serious drama I'm watching now.  Well-done weighty crime thriller drama
* *Legend of the Condor Heroes (2017)*: I had long planned to watch some Jin Yong adaptations and was given an extra push to watch this for Chen Xing Xu (after watching *Goodbye My Princess*).

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","There's a bunch of different pieces at play here, so I'll try to quickly address each of them. I won't touch the newbie trying out a brawler part because you seem motivated to work with the class and understand the basic approach, if not quite the execution:

* &gt; ""Why am I feeling weak now at low levels?""

    Because, simply put, no martial character in the game is able to function offensively right out of the box. Dodge and Combat Expertise are both defensive feats, and one actively hampers your offense. 

    I think these are some crossed wires that come from reading guides that assume a basic knowledge of Pathfinder character design. Dodge, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, etc. are good feats for Brawlers to take because they open up other feats to flex into with Martial Flexibiliity. However, they are NOT good as the **only** feats a Brawler takes.

    At a bare minimum, take the Power Attack feat ASAP to trade accuracy for bonus damage. 

* &gt; ""How do I level into the mid-game?""

    You should also find an offensive feat chain to invest in to make sure you scale. For example, working towards [Pummeling Charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/pummeling-charge-combat/) will let you dive across the battlefield and full attack for lots of in-your-face damage, or [Dragon Ferocity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/dragon-ferocity-combat/) for lots of strength-scaling damage on your unarmed strikes when you use Brawler's Flurry. Or a feat chain associated with combat maneuvers, etc.

* &gt; ""How can I use my WIS?""

    A couple ways:

    * You can just enjoy having a strong will save and do nothing.
    * You can take a one-level dip into a martial class like Unchained Monk to get WIS-to-AC + some bonus feats if you're already unarmored (but brawlers are typically going with Light armor).
    * You can take a one-level dip into a utility class like Inquisitior to get some skill-based utility, like using the [Conversion Inquisition](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor/inquisitions/inquistions-paizo/conversion-inquisition/) to be able to use WIS for some social skill instead of CHA, plus some free skill ranks.
    * There are tons of cool [Style feats](https://aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?Category=Style) that have neat powers locked behind high WIS score prerequisites. The AoN link seems to be having some issues on my end, so a partially complete alternate list can be [found here instead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/style-feats/), or by searching ""Style""+""WIS"".

* &gt; ""How do I stay relevant late game""?

    There's two halves to this: ""Have big enough numbers to still contribute"", ""Lubricate your action economy"", and ""have out-of-combat utility"".

    * ""Big Enough numbers"": Accuracy is how to contribute mechanically to the game. If you miss, your action is wasted. Whether its an attack roll, a spell, whatever. Figure out ""what checks do I need to pass to contribute"" and keep that number as big as you can without sacrificing elsewhere. For a Brawler, that's going to be your melee accuracy which depends on your STR.
    * ""Lubricate your action economy"": Actions the name of the game. You want to do as much as possible in as few actions as possible. Avoid anything that says ""as a standard action &lt;mild benefit&gt;"" because not taking a full attack action is going to be cutting your damage by 50% AT A MINIMUM, up to 85% late game. Free actions and rider effects are desireable.

    The opposite is true for how you interact with foes: the game is about denying them actions. If you kill them, obviously, they can't take actions, but sometimes it's good to deny an action right now than to try to go for the kill

    * ""Have out of combat utility"": Combat's not the only way to contribute to the game. Super late game, you might find it difficult to feel like a co-equal player to your wizards when they can stop time, teleport across continents and planes of reality, etc., and you can only punch for big numbers. 

    Even in combat, you might feel... hollow when your spellcasters completely debilitate foes with crowd control spells and you just clean up the mess. If your whole identity is ""I'm good at combat"", and then you feel you underperform in combat, you're going to get frustrated by that mismatch between concept and execution. 

    Invest in developing a cool charater, fun releationships, and ways to contribute out of combat: social encounters, environmental encounters, etc. Invest in support, so that the team's success feels like your success.",1593561612

The war doctor didn’t come across knowledge of The Moment by accident, nothing that happens to The Moment is an accident.  The temporal vortices, lining up and priming the ideas of working around of Armageddon and of the paintings?  Absolutely intentional.  The simultaneous arrivals just in time of two tardises before the war doctor pushes the button?  It’s not just convenient - only advanced temporal manipulation could achieve it.  Everything that happened was planned by The Moment, meticulously.

Once or twice a year it's so bad I become an old man, I literally double over in pain, I need someone to hold my hand to help me get in the car, I've needed help bathing (from a girlfriend, not my mom or sister like is the trend on AITA)

Usually it sets in overnight so I just call in sick but one time I had mild back pain, went into work, I sneezed, and next thing I know I was in so much pain I couldn't breath. I was really embarrased by it too. Like I hate feeling that helpless. So I tried to tough through it. At lunchtime I couldn't take it so I asked to go home because I was having trouble breathing and couldn't even work because reaching for a piece of paper or having to get something off the copier 5 feet away was agony. 

They let me go home because I'm a good worker, and they trust me. I think if I had just said hey I just feel like using some time they would have let me go. But I was definitely getting the side eye and skepticism for telling them about my back.. I'm a young guy and very physically active so people don't expect me to be brought down by a ""simple"" back problem.

The PSA is the US “Democratic” faction, that is a fact. Doesn’t change the fact that it isn’t inherently a Democratic society. (Jim Crow.) A society can call itself Democratic all you would like, and if you would like to make the argument that the Jim Crow Laws and voter suppression in the PSA don’t disqualify it from being a democracy, then go ahead.

"KingdomHearts","t5_2s3jo","u/Remster101 already answered this, but the novels aren't canon. They are just retellings of the games with a little extra fluff. I haven't actually read any of them myself yet, but from what I've heard, they just expand on things that are neither important nor confirmed to be accurate. One of the more common things I've heard from people who've read the novels is that they expand on Vanitas, (in a non-canon way) although I don't know what lengths it goes to. There's nothing important story-wise. If you're still interested though, I think everything (including X\[chi\]) has been adapted and KH3 is the only one that has yet to be translated to English.

Also, just so you know, the manga, which is written by the same person as the novels, isn't canon either. Not to mention, the manga skips the four games between 358/2 Days and KH3. Funnily enough, it does have both original and Final Mix versions of the manga too. Unfortunately, it looks like there's still quite a bit of it left untranslated, so that kinda stinks. Again, nothing too important. I already liked Kairi, but something I hear frequently about the manga is that apparently it makes Kairi more likable for the people who hated her, so that's a bonus, I guess.

"politicsdebate","t5_2t3ox","&gt; But the protesters aren't engaged in mob rule?

They are, my original point is that they went up via mob rule and are coming down in the same fashion. I'd prefer a vote, but tbh I'd rather they be taken down by force than allow them be allowed to stand because a city voted to not take it down. 

&gt;The protesters themselves aren't the majority, either. They're extremists by the standard of the majority. So if we can dismiss the minority of the protesters, why can't we dismiss the protesters in general?

Tearing down confederate statues is about a 50-50 split

&gt;Let's assume this view is completely correct, and that slaves earned their own actions by demanding assistance which led to the Civil War. To do this you have to ignore the decades of conflict leading up to the Civil War, of course, but we're pretending this is a solid idea.

But the Lincoln monument isn't a monument towards those decades of strife (to some point you can argue this too was prompted by African Americans like Douglas and others who ran away to tell the horrors of slavery) the monument is towards Lincoln literally breaking the chain of bondage holding down an enslaved person. That is what they are talking about. Their argument is emancipation proclaimation specific. 

&gt;The people who are tearing down his statue, on the other hand, are doing exactly that. It is being simplified by the very people you are defending. What the scholars say is irrelevant to the facts of what is actually happening in the real world.

I disagree. Anyone interested in the subject should read a monograph or listen to a credible source. The idea that the average person is incapable of this is a cop-out. A statue is put in a public place to glorify, whereas a book is there to tell a complete story of that person. They have different purposes and to tear down a statue is to rebuke that persons/symbol is not worthy of glorification. 

&gt;You don't get to complain about sources after linking me to the SPLC. Not going to accept ad hominem considering I was willing to discuss a source from the lying hate group you provided

You literally did not accept it, but ok. My bigger problem is citing a book review when you have no read the book. Take away the SPLC and I had 4 monographs cited. You gave one source and it was literally a review site dedicated to conservatism. I only ever cited the SPLC because it was easier to link to than monographs you'd have to buy. As for if they're a hate group? Not a clue. 

&gt;More simplification. The South did fight for state's rights. It was one of their excuses to justify maintaining slavery. But it doesn't surprise me that you'd try to pretend that part of history didn't happen either, because it doesn't support the ""everything is racist"" narrative.

They literally did not. The South fought to preserve slavery and whatever other ideology happened to help them with that. For example, many in the South were for states rights when it came to reintroducing the slave trade back into the United States right before the onset of the Civil War,
 or the ability for a state to help fund filibusters to conquer nations in Latin America with the hopes of spreading slaver. However they fought against the State's Rights to decide if they were a free or slave state, and every single confederate state blamed in part their decision to leave the union on the federal governments reluctance to enforce the fugitive slave law harshly enough on the North. In case you missed that, that means that the South wanted the federal government to force the northern states to enforce the fugitive slave law. 

The states rights mantra is an invention. If we really wanna get into rewriting history we can talk about the K-12 history books that are pressured by Southern lobbyists to reduce the amount of focus slavery has on the Civil War. 

&gt;This is rather simple to prove, in fact. If the parties switched, you should see a total flip in party platform and demographics...those who were Republican before the change should have become Democrats and vice versa. But such a swap simply didn't happen. Some switched, but it was a minority of both parties, and only in localized areas. The Republicans that lived in California prior to the southern strategy mostly stayed Republicans after, and the Democrats did the same

Yes in California they largely stayed the same, but the South flipped. Race wasn't the primary issue for California republicans, but it sure was for Southern Republicans. Let's look at who voted yes of the Civil Right Act of 1964 in congress if we sort by party and by geographic region:

Dem/Union

House: 95%

Senate: 98%

Republican/Union

House: 85%

Senate: 84%

Dem/South

House: 9%

Senate: 5%

Republican/South

House:0%

Senate:0%

In both the South and the rest of the country Republicans were more likely to vote against the bill. It just so happened that the Democrats were the party of the South and were overrepresented there. 

No one is suggesting that people woke up one day and went ""shit I guess I'll switch parities"". Party loyalty is a deeply engrained thing. What the party flip means is that the Repubilican Party used the Southern Strategy to flip the South and destroy the New Deal coalitions. 

&gt;But it's effects are grossly exaggerated to paint Republicans as the ""racist party."" The truth is that there were (and still are) racists in both parties, as well as plenty that fought for racial equality.

Sure. I've never said dems were great. Republicans were significantly worse though, as pointed out in the Civil Right Act data. The South was also miles and miles worse than the rest of the nation and the Republican party went on to use that to their advantage, and continue to use that advantage to this day. 

&gt;And historians, who are overwhelmingly liberal (pdf), are not immune to this sort of motivated reasoning.

In Marshall's view, letting the public know about how badly and corruptly the country has been governed under Trump, with almost complete Republican acquiescence, is vital to discrediting Trumpism as a political option.  It's also essential for restoring our international standing, which has taken a huge hit under Trump.

When an average coach comes in, \*of course\* they don't do as well. They're not Wayne Bennett. But I shouldn't be a prick about making that point.

There are always mitigating circumstances to Wayne leaving, all the way back to Souths Brisbane (where my old man was involved) - mostly around who has final call on decisions (his absolute refusal to sign Wally Lewis at Souths was the beginning of the end there, for example). At Canberra he was clearly the head coach but they wouldn't give him the recognition because of Furner's status. Things were already falling apart under Tinkler towards the end of his Newy stint, which can hardly be blamed on him. And so on...

But the fact remains he rarely leaves places on great terms and that's at least partially on him. It's difficult to frame him as a mercenary when he spent a 20 year stint at one club, but he is. 

The Broncos framing him as the villan of the piece is woeful and, on this matter, I am 100 per cent with Bennett. His second stint there was plagued by White's relentless efforts to water down his influence, so it's incredible they then blame him for decisions made when he was marginalised.

In any case, thanks for the call out - I pride myself on respectful debate but have been a bit steamy about this issue for a while now.",1593561616

Seems nice but only have Max-q variants and just for the 2070 and a 15"" screen its over $2100, and i'd be getting less RAM and smaller SSD

Great bundle and everything for $2000, my concerns with Eluktronics is i've heard there can be bad backlight bleeding and the quality control can be hit or miss. Also says it comes with 2070 Max-q, not sure how that compares to the 2070 super max-p at least for the one i was seeing on Amazon. I was looking into the Max-17 which has similar specs but is $300 more to get the 2070 super variant",1593561616

"DeclineIntoCensorship","t5_24hif5","Question for the purveyors of this sub/ post: 

Does your distain for censorship apply to concentrated efforts in disinformation? When these companies know that hostile actors use there platforms to sow division in a effort to poison our societies, should that be allowed? 

Think about radical conspiracies like Q-Anon, like the Anti-Vax movement and foreign nation-states that try to use social media to influence our elections? Are things like these supposed to be allowed? I can understand abiding hate racism and general bullshittery that people often spout just for the fun of trolling but is there a line anywhere? 


I personally believe there has to be a line somewhere...

Historically speaking our current cyberized society reminds me of Europe in the 15th century after The Gutenberg Press became standardized and widely used. This technological advancement greatly accelerated the literacy rate across the continent. There was however a dark side to this. As pamphlets and tabloids became more and more plentiful so too did the competition between the writers and publishers of this media. Soon both parties understood that salacious stories about witches, warlocks and demons sold more copies. This propagation of fear mongering soon led neighbor to turn against neighbor - if a woman was seen in the woods alone she was a witch - a man who muttered to himself was casting curses and raising demons. The screams of the innocent arose night after night as people were tortured and burned alive. 

The fervor brought about by these publications were only tempered when the publishers became aware of harm they were facilitating and choose to institute a level of self regulation, that they shouldn’t print things without some sort of proto-fact checking. 

Now, hundreds of years later, humanity has created a new form of communication, one that is far more reaching than its predecessor. I believe these new publishers like Twitter, Facebook and even Reddit must come to terms with their culpability of the damage that is created in our society when they allow disinformation, conspiracy theories and unchallenged hate based ideologies run rampant through their networks. And if they don’t then I believe the people should demand the government step in and regulate these quasi- utility companies. 

If this doesn’t happen, who knows how bad things can get...

Most animals are very scared of loud noises, as they typically aren't heard much in nature outside of thunder. Especially the more north you go thunder happens less often.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules

&gt;/r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

Maybe start with a child psychiatrist or, hell, anyone born before 1970. Your naivety is utterly baffling to me. Your argument is still somehow that the ""average"" 10 year old born prior to the internet would have been sheltered from the concept of rape??? Despite the fact that I've shown countless examples that it would be in papers on their kitchen tables, on TV/movies, on TV nightly news, in the dictionary, in their bible, talked about church, talked about by their parents....

You're right. All 10 year olds prior to 1995 lived blissfully peaceful innocent lives and could NEVER have done or thought of such awful things. That time Jeffrey Dahmer ""decapitated the carcass of a dog before nailing the body to a tree and impaling the skull on a stake beside a wooden cross in woods near his house"" as a child in the late 60s/early 70s, definitely never happened. Because where would a child have even learned about decapitation from? Eye roll. 

(Also are you really trying to tell me that not a single 10 year old watched All in the Family, which had a five year consecutive run as a number one show on TV? Have you ever even met a Baby Boomer? Why don't you go ask some millennials how many of them started watching Friends before the age of 10, because I'm betting it's a fuck ton. Just like plenty of 10 year olds watched All in the Family.)",1593561619

If there's dirt/dust settling in places you don't like I would use a gravel vac to suck it out. 

If the water stays cloudy, if it's green it's probably free floating algae, and if it's white it's probably a bacterial bloom.

Bacterial blooms aren't uncommon in setting up a new tank, especially with nutrient substrates.
When you set it up a bunch of the nutrients get kicked up into the water column, and so bacteria multiplies rapidly to consume it.

Usually beneficial bacteria lives on surfaces, so this free floating bacteria is a bit of an exception. However, with time the bacteria will find surfaces to stick to and start working as normal. That's why it might be important to keep the filter running, the water movement and oxygenation will help the development of beneficial bacteria on surfaces in your tank as well as the filter itself.

If you do have a bacterial bloom then don't do too many water changes as that will prolong it a bit. But it'll clear up by itself regardless.",1593561620

I’m aware this is a bit passive aggressive, but curious if I’m really an AH. Keeping things somewhat vague because some family is on Reddit. 

A visiting family member has been having extremely long (2+ hour) speakerphone conversations almost daily. She usually talks on the phone in her room, but either doesn’t close the door or does but is so loud that the conversation can clearly be heard throughout most of the house.

I haven’t directly asked her to stop (blame my non-confrontational personality) but gone and closed her door multiple times, and have had not very subtle conversations with others in the house about it. It seems like a small thing, but it’s getting to the point where it’s distracting me as I work from home, and I was raised in a way to be more courteous when in someone else’s house.

Today, after at least 2 hours of her being on the phone, I went to my room (next to the one she’s staying in) and started playing music very loudly—truly just with the intent of not having to hear her phone conversation. After a few minutes of this, though, I heard her get up and leave the house for the day. I’m not sure if this was planned or if I “drove her out”, but AITA here?

It can be a straight line, then just walk in when the sand is directly over head, as long as it's a straight, tight line (it's a lot more forgiving than I'm making it sound) you'll activate the warp pad.

I’d love to move past this and just have a debate on what a more equatable tax system might look like, but it’s kinda the crux of the matter. I don’t think that the work put in and risks undertaken by Bezos to create amazon, which should be rewarded, should net him what he has. As a company grows the value any one person bring to it shrinks. So I don’t believe Bezos has added $90B of value to Amazon or the US since 2017 and I would design a tax system to reflect that.

If you live alone, sure it works fantastic. However if you game, you won't be able to watching videos, download files,  browse IG/Reddit simulateously. This is mainly to the modem suffering from buffer bloat. 

*Before the quarantine they were reliable with consistent speeds, but now its hit or miss. I had to reboot my modem like 5 times for it to work properly. 

If you're referring to Amplia. Yeah, their service is pretty solid. 

2.  Flow is a hit or miss imo. Their service has greatly improved as they are now using a hybrid network. Fiber to a local node and then copper (coaxial) for the last mile. 
Speeds and latency with NA, and Europe has significantly improved. Suffers greatly when compared to servers in China/Asia. 

The latency in game is highly variable when compared to a fiber service but its still impressive.

"TranscribersOfReddit","t5_3jqmx","So I was scrolling and saw someone asking for ways to

have extra income for their household. There were a few

people commenting make this, bake that, etc and a few

suggesting different MLM companies. One lady said Oh look

here come the MLM folks with a shark gif posted with it.

I know these companies (as a whole) got a bad rap when

Tupperware Tammy was messaging you none stop about her

products, or Norwex Nancy was adding you to parties that

you didn't want to be added to. Mary Kay Mandy and

Senegence Sally were posting non stop about why they had

the best products. Avon Alice and Scentsy Susan are always

showing up in your feed, and you roll your eyes scrolling on.

Let me ask this, have you blocked the Walmart ads? Bath

and Body Works? Sephora? Chevrolet? Ford? Montanas?

McDonalds? with the same disgust you have for your fellow

neighbours who is trying to find a way to be a parent and a

monetary contributor to their house hold?

When someone suggests a new hair care or house hold item

you can pick up at a chain store do you think to yourself 'Oh,

there's pushy Pat trying to get me to buy something else'?

I'm not asking you to support everyone in your friends list by

purchasing something. I'm just asking you to have an open

mind about why they began that journey and be open

minded to what they are trying to accomplish for

themselves and their families

I mean what sense does that make? People breaking the law are gonna put out a shingle and figure the undercover squad would never figure this out, even though it allegedly was in an FBI document 13 years ago?

Also what are some other underground systems that utilize the same words to represent the same things for decades? If this is true, why did Allies and Axis have different code terms for submarines? Don’t all people across the globe use common terms and symbols? Do all drug cartels even in the same country have some unspoken rule about common code words and reusing those same words indefinitely? Assuredly not. This has never stood up to reason, even if there WAS once a code system online using these words *within a particular group of criminals*.",1593561622

It's why conservatives still keep trotting out the silent majority line decades after it was no longer relevant: the reality they aren't the majority by a long shot is too troubling to consider so they assume they have a secret base of supporters hiding their views waiting to be freed.

If you endorse them sleightly, it gives that bullshit belief hope that other random strangers don't view them as a MAGA asshole.

"Iteration110Cradle","t5_3j7t8","Being Eithan, he's not just doing one thing. He doesn't want to depend on the Arelius family anymore and is developing his own resources. He also needs to keep his plans secret from his formidable enemies. My personal theories are:

1) He wants rare materials for advancement elixirs, but also materials he can trade for the things he doesn't have.

2) He's planning for more members of his merry band and is preparing for how to catch them up (if necessary).

3) He's creating a garden where natural spirits can grow (and not just Sylvan Riverseeds).  He's seen how a Sylvan can make the Blackflame path safe and he might be looking to develop other Twin Stars artists.

4) He's going to try and replicate Ghostwater's Dream Well and start making Presences.

I can't really say that she's a villain to me, however. The way that I see it revolves around the stakes in what each character does. If I were a person living in that world, what Joel did potentially harms me directly. Even if I never interacted with anyone in the games, the vaccine would impact my life, and I would be mad at the person that took that option off the table. Abby's biggest crime, though, was murdering Joel in retribution for her father's death. I can't say that I would see her as a villain disconnected from what I know of Ellie's story.

Like I said, though, I totally understand if others feel differently. Abby did some terrible things, but--to me--the scales don't quite tip into ""villain"" territory.",1593561625

"GlobalOffensiveTrade","t5_2y6r4","We're sorry, but the title of your post is incorrect in some way. Your title must appear *exactly* like this: [H] Item(s) you have [W] Item(s) wanted

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses ""()"" or braces ""{}"" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only ""[W]"" but not also ""[H]"" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.
6. [Discussion] - If you are asking the community to contribute and discuss something relevant to everybody.

"fo76","t5_jrw25","10k XP per week is pretty low.

Bear in mind, in addition to normal XP boosts (sleeping/canned meat), the addition of public teams boosts the XP a lot.

A public team (building) that is bonded (takes about 2 mins) gives +4 INT which affects your XP gain.

Alternatively, if maxed on INT, the events team will give double XP for completing events, or the hunters will give double XP for legendary kills.

Because of being able to run a public team, you can use the inspiring perk card for +15% XP

You can also use the herd mentality mutation for +2 INT increasing your XP gain.

Given most players have a mutation of some sort, you can also use the strange in numbers perk to increase your INT further.

Lastly, some of the rewards are those lunch boxes that give +25% xp (1hr). Description says to friends nearby. Tested with someone on team stood next to them - we both got the bonus. Dont know if being on a team is required, or if theres a radius. So if you're playing with someone you actually know, you can stagger out who activates one so you both get the benefit.

Played this evening for ~ 2.5hrs (15 INT, herd mentality, 1x lunch box) and hit 10k xp three times (300 score).

Having said that it got me thinking about my current OPT application I'm waiting to get approved.

I have by no means intended to abuse CPT or use it as a form of employment, but it has happened that ever since last summer , opportunities for research have arrised with the same company I did CPT with in 2019. Since then, I have had CPT in each term (ending it everytime school quarters are over of course). I've have had a total of 4 different CPT's with the same company, and reading your comments got me a little worried. Each of this I have received authorization and developed different studies/reports for my researchers. Should I be concerned about this, and if you happen to know what documentation I will need to provide in order to have everything clear?

&amp;#x200B;

I should add that the OPT I recently applied for is for my master's and with the same company I did my CPT's with, there is approximately a 3 month gap between my last CPT and the OPT I'm trying to get.

The bows will probably be a little quieter, as it's germanium. I think it will be gritty and beautiful, I really like germanium stuff. I don't know how loud it gets but EQD pedals are usually plenty loud. It will add a lot of gritty natural sounding overdrive, would also be sick.

If you'd ask me I'd go with the Bows, I like stuff like that with my setup. If I could afford both if try both and I'm sure I'd keep em both lol. They even sound like they could be really nice together. I run 2-3 overdrive's and the hail Satan deluxe on my board usually so I guess I could be biased toward owning lots of dirt pedals though lol",1593561628

I'm sorry for my assumption--lacking the context of what you meant, I just couldn't follow your logic and assumed it was another case of something I see often with that word. 

Anywho, I don't disagree that Obama is still pretty neoliberal relative to the whole political spectrum. But that's not saying much. Globally, his promotion of free trade falls in line with that, but domestically he *did* try to tighten up on regulations more than his predecessors. I'd say that was actually the key ammunition for his opponents and the impetus behind many conservatives equating him to some power-hungry dictator (as far-fetched as it is, that was still a popular narrative). Trump's brand of populist nationalism capitalized on this, among other things, which kind of turns the whole claim of neoliberalism on its head. One of the things Trump has been most effective in is the re-regulation and dissembling of oversight for corporations. I don't know if we can comfortably call Trumpian politics a pushback against neoliberalism when we're seeing a corporatocracy in full swing. 

But all of this gets particularly messy, of course, when we acknowledge that Trump has no well-defined ideology or even goal beyond what personally benefits him and his brand, so trying to define his politics by anything other than chaotic amoral egotism is going to be inherently self-defeating. It gets messier still when trying to follow his base's intentions, since they're prone to fall lock-step with him while also asserting they have a strict ideology themselves.

The main reason I don't like playing CNs is that the AI is very aggressive towards nations in the new world, and it's hard to get any allies to deter GB, Portugal, Spain, and France from declaring on you in a conga line. There's also a lot less there in the new world to conquer, unless you release near Mexico or Peru, or you hold off on releasing the CN until there are quite a lot of other CNs in the area.

That said, its an interesting challenge to play as them, and it's basically an easier version of playing as a native American nation - while the early game is less interesting than say, the Aztec, you can set your new country up really nicely and don't need to worry about reforming or waiting for the Europeans. Once you've released the nation, it becomes very similar to playing as a reformed native. 

The other benefit is if (like me) you're from one of the countries that are colonial nations in this time period, it can be fun to play as your actual home country or one near it a lot of the former colony formables have powerful/interesting ideas.

Maybe Abby should’ve come to terms with her actions effecting people before she beat Joel to death with a golf club and then bizarrely just let Ellie and Tommy go?

It also sounds like J may have jumped to conclusions about B, but of course we're missing context on exactly how B approached it.

This just isn't true though. The US' legal system is just a slightly different version of common law, which isn't actually followed by many countries in the world. Contrast to Napoleonic law, which is the legal foundation for hundreds of countries across the world.

"vulvodynia","t5_2tv3i","Yes, I have anterior wall pain! When I press on it it burns and sometimes feels hard. I've been tested several times for UTIs and its ways negative. This started for me back in October 2019. It felt like a UTI with urethral burning before and after peeing but not pain while peeing. Burning in and around vaginal opening. Tender lower pelvis. Anterial vaginal wall pain and burning. And in always feel like I need to pee! Also I sometimes get a weird pulling/tugging sensation on my bladder when I stand up or twist my torso in certain ways. Like there is a string pulling down on my bladder. 
 The pain is intermittent and usually fairs up around when my period starts. I'm currently in a lot of pain at the moment because my period is supposed to start anytime now. 
Treatment so far:
3 rounds of antibiotics which did nothing. 
2 rounds of diflucan, which did nothing. 
3 months of pelvic floor PT. This helped slightly but I still have pain. 
I thought maybe it was interstitial cystitis, so I did the IC diet for a while and that was no help. 

I'm now scheduled for a laparoscopy in August because suspect endometriosis is causing this. I also think I have adhesions that are causing this pulling sensation.",1593561632

This covers everything that isn't consumed, and doesn't have a price tag.

For anything that is either consumed during the casting, or has a price tag, you keep track of those separately the same way you'd keep track of how many rations or arrows or whatever.

If your spell calls for a 100 gp diamind, then you need to say that you have 3x 100 gp diamonds. And then you can cast that spell 3 times before you're out.

If the spell says it requires powdered ruby, then you need to say you have 3 doses of powdered ruby.

But if the spell just says you need rose petals or a bit of fleece, then you can safely assume your Component Pouch has enough of those for your current needs, and you can safely assume that you restock those items whenever you have a chance. So you don't need to keep count, you just need to keep your Pouch.",1593561632

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","The things that I observed helped, on me and multiple progress reports:

Nutrition:

Eat more protein. 1g per lb and up. Measure it, preferably with a scale. CICO is not exactly CICO if you account for calories needed to digest proteins, you could lose weight on your current diet if you switch macros around.

Don't drink calories. That includes shakes. Protein powder is a good option only if you are on a budget. Use an elimination strategy to see what foods are bad for you. If you experience bloating, gas, diarrhea, eliminate from your diet.

Track cheat days the exact same way you track normal days. A cheat day is not for stuffing yourself with no guidance, it's for enjoying quality meals with different calories/macros than your normal diet.

Rearrange alcohol consumption, especially if you enjoy beer which has a lot of empty calories. Drink higher proof, quality alcohol on the rocks or with no calorie mixers.

Supplements:

Limit. Do some blood work to see if you are vitamin/mineral deficient, use cron-o-meter or some other tool to view what you don't get from diet and only supplement that. However, the following is proven to work:

If you are on a caloric deficit you should supplement a good quality multivitamin. Bloodwork and diet can also dictate what you should take. Vitamin D, zinc, omega 3 in addition to a general multi.

Protein powders are only if you are on a budget, it's the lowest cost per gram of protein. It's also not exactly a supplement, more in the nutrition category.

Creatine is very effective if you respond to it. Might want to test it. 30% of people are non-responders.

Caffeine is great for a multitude of reasons. Best pre-workout, but avoid expensive powders that tack-on unproved gimmicks.

Green powders are great as a substitute for a multi, especially when loaded with herbs which are very micronutrient dense.

Most other supplements are a waste of money if not taken to improve a medical issue.

If they stood to your right, their voice would come from the right and they were more quiet the further away they were.

I always thought that was really cool, but Mumble isn't as widely used as something like Discord or TS and I haven't seen many more intances of a system like this in other games. It's kinda freaky but it's also really cool.

I never played multiplayer games with ""vanilla"" implemented proximity chat like you talk about though, is the audio directional as well or is it just sitting in the middle like normal voice chat?",1593561633

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No. I'm in my mid thirties, I've been working since I was 13, and I currently own a staffing business. If someone with 1 year of experience and someone with 10 years of experience are doing the exact same job the pay is usually identical when we place them. The biggest differentiator is the person with more experience may ask for more money where the less experienced person is more eager and thankful to have simply been hired. Our focus is IT and engineering. 

I should add...We don't negotiate their pay with them, we ask them to tell us what they are seeking. We only work on a markup so if they make more money, we make more money.

It's an entirely different thing if someone has additional responsibility because their experience gives them a greater scope of knowledge and more is asked of them, but if their duties are the same, their pay is the same.

Edit: I don't work in customer service or retail(anymore), but you see it there a lot too. The call center rep that's been doing it for 15 years rarely makes more than the one that's been doing it for 2. I also see the opposite of tenured pay happen.. Someone younger with newer skills making more than someone that's been on the team for longer because they are bringing a harder-to-find skillset to the table.

I don't think people realize how important negotiating your pay is. Know your worth.",1593561633

 [Obviously all lives matter. No one said they didn't](https://i.imgur.com/UyCmhSx.png). However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is \~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

Surrogacy is not just some willynilly shit either. Nevermind about the permanent physiological changes that take place when a woman gets pregant, carrying the baby for 9 months, laboring for days, and risking death to deliver the baby. Surrogacy requires a shit ton of preparation, lasting a year or longer before it can even take place. Morgan would have to have a baby for herself and be raising that baby before she can even qualify to be a surrogate.

This is the first iron banner since i picked up the game (D1-HoW) where my experience is, i dunno, bad... like really bad.

Not boring bad like after osiris dropped, but unbalanced bad.

Im a notch under average. Typical crucible match I get 13-18 kills , finish 3-5 on my team. Every now and then a really bad game, and likewise an occasional god tier game where i can hit upper 20’s. When IB rolls around I typically do slightly better... IDC so much about w/l just how i perform.

But this IB... im doing REALLY good if i get 10 kills, im ineffective, nothing works right, and its no fun. 

No. Fun.

I guess they changed the match making to connection based, and Im a potato in the flowershop.  I wanna play with other potatos and be average, not get shit on every. Single. Game....

"MadeleineMccann","t5_368lu","You are mistaken about a key component of DNA analysis.  It is possible to separate the components into 3 individual DNA profiles.  During meosis, DNA strands from the parents are broken into segments then reconnected in a sequence that is unique to the offspring.

Source:https://www.genomicseducation.hee.nhs.uk/education/core-concepts/where-does-our-genome-come-from/#:~:text=Your%20genome%20is%20inherited%20from,do%20not%20look%20the%20same.

Madeleine's DNA can be differentiated from a mixture of her parents' blood.  Madeleine's genome is unique to her precisely because of meosis.  The unique genome allows scientists to be able to determine the source DNA with a sufficient sample. However, if scientists do not perform the tests properly using the correct technology, the results may not be able to be determined to match a source with sufficient statistical probability to allow a definitive identification.

This is what has happened here.  The correct technology has not yet been used to analyze the DNA samples.  An expert with the ability to apply this technology, Dr. Perlin, has offered to analyze the DNA sample sequences in the McCann case to attempt to determine the source or sources of the DNA samples with a statistically significant certainty.  Scotland Yard has not accepted Dr. Perlin's offer to evaluate the DNA sequences free of charge.",1593561635

"weddingplanning","t5_2rv3t","It looks to me like you asked for a very dramatic look with a lot of makeup. It's really cool and I love it, but it looks best with perfect photo lighting and photoshopping, like the model has. If you look up unretouched photos of, for example, Kim Kardashian at a major event, you will see that her makeup looks pretty strange and heavy. That's just kind of the nature of that style of makeup.

You might have better luck with a more natural base and brown and gold smokey eyes, rather than aiming for maximum drama. I also have fair skin and makeup like that looks muddy on me too.

The specific parts that don't look right to me in your picture is 1) the foundation doesn't match your neck; 2) there's too much (and too dark) bronzer; 3) the blush is a little too low on your cheeks; and  4) the eyeshadow isn't blended well. Keep in mind, though, that smokey dramatic eyeshadow always looks a bit off when your eyes are closed which is why beauty models do that half-closed look.

Hop over to /r/makeupaddiction if you want more input from makeup-savvy people!

It ended up at the principal and when the principal asked why we didn't try to tone it down, I said that I tried and the principal had nothing else to say and we left.

It turned out that the kid's father died some months later and I think that might be why he acted like he did.",1593561635

If you don't have much skin to pull yet it could be more difficult. What I do is just hold the skin just barely between my fingers and roll the end in such a way that it is ever so slightly wrapped around thumb or index finger depending on which side I'm tugging. So the skin tries to pull itself back but when it does it kind of latches onto my finger just a bit.

I know people probably tried to put you off WXIII but I like it a lot, and if you liked film 1 more than film 2 I'd give the third one a try still. It's a nice little sendoff for the canon imo in how it's just a return to the Patlabor world through a side story centred on other characters. It's a kaiju film not a mecha film though.

&gt; It wants to be sad so badly that it forces its characters to be stupid beyond belief.

I do think the writers meant it that way. They drop hints that Claudia’s solution is still part of the loop (I’m sure in a rewatch there are more than just the two I pointed out). They also specifically start episode 7 by talking about Schrödinger’s cat (which doesn’t really connect to anything else). Also if it truly was all about time loops I don’t think they would have ended it like they did, with the time loops we’ve been watching all disappearing. I don’t think that could sensibly happen with only time loop logic. Only using superpositions and a shrodingers cat situation where the superposition collapses does it make sense for the timelines to disappear. They specifically bring up predetermination and grandfather paradoxes throughout the series. The creators are definitely aware that the characters within the loops shouldn’t be able to break the loops without breaking their own time travel rules.",1593561638

(Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can. COVID-19 is still a very real threat, not only to you, but those you love and everyone around you as well!

The reason they don’t do that is because too many people would actually be turned off from the game and it would result in lost sales.

The system would get abused by the few but the main reason is simply because for the people who would use it honestly which I think would be many, it would result in too much money in lost revenue for most of these devs.

Demos to me are the very easy solution and unlike the ps2 era when demos were at their peak there’s no upfront cost in doing these (making demo disks or putting demos in other games).",1593561639

Rules does not necessarily equate to the EULA, latching onto that only makes me think you really don't understand what's going on at all. I guess if you really defend hatchlings you'd have to not get it, so I digress.

Let me spell it out for you since you're having difficulty- Tarkov's a hardcore survival game with looter shooter instances and MMO mechanics tossed in too. The rules that players play by is the inherent contract of progression: to progress in a punishing hardcore game quickly you have to risk something. This is a standing defining rule of the hardcore genre. If you want to call the game hardcore, which the devs clearly do, it has to at least meet that definition. Suicide runs go in the *exact* opposite direction of this and really only complete morons don't seem to understand that as they load up for their 250th hatchet run whilst complaining about ""muh sweaties and meta gear ruinin muh Tarkov."" That's about as basic and simplified a definition of this I can give. I'm aware it probably won't change your mind, but honestly I don't really care. The devs are already going out of their way to reduce the viability of that style of play and the people seeking to *exploit the lower risk and higher reward* will swap to whatever else is the objectively easiest style of play. Then hatchet runs will *actually be difficult*. Again, this is *not a question of the style itself* it's the *rules that we, as players, play by to progress.*

It's a perspective that I share with the devs, devs who have a *more* punishing design than I do. I'll take ""shares perspective with the devs"" over ""well it's my opinion!!!"" anytime if it's a discussion about the fuckin' game lmfao.",1593561639

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","So I'm not entirely sure what you are trying to say, but I think you are saying he should have just sold the item. 

I don't remember if your quest stays if you sell the support item and then buy it again. According to the wiki, you lose 50% of the gold up to 80% depending on how much you farm (50% + 1% loss for every extra CS per five minutes. Starting at 20 CS/5 up to 50 CS/5). The average CS/m in Silver (my ELO) is just above 5, which means if you are cs'ing at an average rate, you are losing almost 55% of the minion value. 

An average wave at 15 minutes is worth 147 gold. Even at 50% that means you are losing out on almost 73 gold per wave, and waves spawn every 30 seconds. So you lose 240 for selling it (minus the gold you already got from the quest/passive, and plus the extra 2 gold every 2 seconds.) Assuming that you got 0 gold from the quest/passive to make this math easier, you are presented with this formula: -260 gold + 147 per wave - 30 per wave (from the passive gold lost) vs keeping spellthiefs which puts you at 81 gold (147 x 55% rounded up) plus 30 passive gold. 

Minion Wave (from 15:00)| Selling Spellthief | Keeping Spellthief
|-----|:------------------:|:--------------------:
0| -260| 0
1| -143 | 111
2| -26 | 192
3| 91 | 273
4| 208 | 354
5| 325 | 435
6| 442 | 516
7| 559 | 597
8| 676 | 678
9| 793 | 789

So it does end up taking about 4 minutes before you make up the difference. Of course, my math is incredibly simplistic here, because you will rarely get the max amount from a wave, and if you did, you would be losing more then 55%, plus the wave is worth more after every few waves, and after minute 25 every wave spawns with siege minions. But this shows that its actually a lot closer then I thought. I would say, with imperfect farming, the difference would be made up even earlier. But it at least shows a rough visual (albeit not accurate). 

I still think selling Spellthief is the better call, or not taking every farm and trying to maximize on siege and melee minions when you can.

If there is actual interest, I can make a better table when I get home and put more thought into it, but its already a pretty silly concept.",1593561639

The shortened version of the job, you have charge of the ship on behalf of the captain. The expanded version is, this includes safely navigating, responding to emergencies, having understanding of the weapons system, knowing the engineering and trouble shooting. You are an officer, so there are also divisional responsibilities where you must manage and look out for your personnel.

How do I feel about it all? I'm an introvert with a quiet voice (Much louder now. You can hear me even more when I'm angry), who has a hard time taking control of things, also I have anxiety. You'd think I'd hate this job, BUT I don't. Not at all. I love driving the ship. I also love working. Especially when you're under training, it's the best time you have in the fleet. Sure, you lose a lot of sleep. When you're under training, people will both help you and take advantage of you. Which sucks, but it's all about learning. Some people are better and stronger in the job, but if you put in the effort, any one can succeed. A lot of people's complaints have to do with people not getting what they expected or wanted. Before I was sent to the fleet I encountered someone who was under training but also releasing who didn't like the sleep schedules for under training and how much work is involved. I'm not kidding, there is a lot of that going on, but that has never made me want to stop. Everything I've experience I feel like has been shaping me into a stronger person. The job definitely changes your personality. It's the only position in the navy that allows you to command a ship, so you need to learn how to make decisions whether they are good or bad. We are a tight knit family too. Everyone knows each other or knows someone else you know. 

It may not be the right fit for everyone, and it's harder to maintain a home life, which is probably the biggest reason why people leave the trade, but people either make it work, or they don't.",1593561639

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","I practice tithing and have done so since 2005. God actually says you can test him in tithing and see if he wont return it. (Malachi 3:10)
I was younger and just getting into living by faith.  
I got upside down financially and couldn’t pay for anything but bills and my tithe.  It sounds so stupid... but I learned how to use my faith from some cassette tapes of kenneth hagin.   
I was broke and on my way to lose everything I owned including my fishing business.. 
I kept tithing and speaking the promises that the Bible said applied for the tither every time I started to worry.. constantly , day after day.  
I got a phone call.... bank said my stuff was about to be repoed..
So I kept speaking the word by faith... it was not how I felt... I felt like I was a fool... but it’s not based on what I feel, it’s based on what God said.. so I put him to the test. 
Few days later I got an email from a corporation needing my address, so I gave it to them. 
They sent me an envelope with a thirty two thousand dollar check in it, wrote out to me. 
It was just enough to pay off all my stuff and a 10% tithe.  Timing was impeccable 
Wasn’t a coincidence to me...  exactly what I was speaking by faith is exactly what happened. 
That was the 1st miracle I personally experienced .",1593561639

"electricians","t5_2slrm","Personally I wouldn't have an issue with it, and in the eyes of the regulations it's very much okay, worst case realistic scenario is the MCB trips.

Similarly with domestic lighting and socket outlet circuits, you could have a total connected load far, far exceeding 32A (for example 10 socket outlets would have a total connected load potential of 130A), but realistically are you ever going to have every socket with a 3kW load connected? Not really, and if you do, the breaker will protect the circuit from overload.

With your cooker and cooking equipment for example, you'll also have heating elements switching on and off as temperature is met and maintained, smaller loads rather than full power settings (e.g. simmering a hob rather than tanning a fry up) so applying diversity makes sense.

When it comes to applying diversity in commercial premises it's much less forgiving since it's very likely you could have very high utilisation (e.g. a few kW of chip fryers running constantly, a toaster carousel churning out toast all morning etc.); which in that case sounds reasonable; horses for courses.",1593561640

"singapore","t5_2qh8c","Generally military equipment and weapons system have  sky high costs thats why comparing military spendings to other sectors such as education or public services is pretty unfair, but considering how SAF places a huge emphasis on maintenance and care for equipment and that most equipments are usually kept in use for a long time (several batches of nsfs) kinda shows that it isnt the crux of the problem. 

From what I heard from some regulars, private companies and contractors usually mark up prices for SAF since they don’t expect much haggling and resistance and that the army will still buy what it needs regardless. Part of this problem probably stems from the “not my money” attitude that some have when it comes to indenting supplies etc.

That being said, there also seems to be a surplus of regulars that seems to be just there for the rice bowl and hold pretty redundant and unimportant positions. (Eg. new csms every batch, bunch of new 3 yr contract sgts, random enciks etc.)

Also the fact that they don’t seem to look towards cutting down the service duration of nsfs as a means to cut costs. (I mean wtf, literally typing this in bunk while doing nothing.) Most nsfs can probably relate. Especially those in combat vocations, that training can be streamlined and alot of downtime and pointless days in camp can be cut down on to shorten the overall 2 years or 1y 10mths anyways.",1593561640

"thesopranos","t5_2sd3j","I don't think it is repetitive, I feel it is a great way to kind of sum up the whole show in the last 9 eps. He starts to be a better person after his coma then after giving up Vito and starting to cheat on car again, he sling shots into being worse than ever. 

He elevates Bobby bc he knows he can actually trust him. Adrianna dying ruined his trust with Chris and Bobby is now the closest thing to family to T in his crew and he knows Bobby won't turn on him. The whole show he has denied his negative feelings toward his father and at the end it's all coming out. I believe him turning on Hesh and Paulie is really about his feelings toward his dad, as is him becoming a degenerate gambler, the one thing his dad always said not to be.

When he kills Chris, it is finally T sinking to Livia's level, really the end of T's arc. The last fight with Carm really shows where he is at with her saying he doesn't give a shit what happens to her after he is gone. And the way it is clarified that his therapy has just helped him cope with being a sociopath and help him be better one is brilliant. I thought it was a great way to kind of show a microcosm of the whole show in 9 eps.",1593561641

Another issue I had with the film though, back then and even more so now, is Cameron's story arc which hinges on a naive (or dishonest) portrayal of depression/anxiety/mental illness. There is something seriously wrong with Cameron, and I can accept that the movie makes fun of his exaggerated ailments as this is a comedy, but he goes from lying in bed in agony to attempting suicide to deciding to stick up to his father and quit his self-loathing after his buddy takes him to a Cubs game and a museum.

Most of the homes in SF are smaller than Oak Forest. Lots of 3/1 layouts with no master bath, more thru traffic, small garages, some flood concerns closer to the bayou. 

Hard to get a home in SPP/CP (the neighborhoods are pretty much smashed together. The only difference is sidewalks) at that price range. Unrenovated homes in that neighborhood literally last one day on the market before they are bought by an investor. Renovated homes would likely be out of your budget. Absolutely love this neighborhood though! Do be warned, pretty involved HOAs in both neighborhoods.

Prices in OF really depend on a couple of things. School zoning, what side of the bayou you're on, etc (closer to Ella = higher price typically) all factor in to the price. OF west is more affordable, but not as close to the fun yuppie areas and not zoned to Oak Forest elementary. Lots of people your age live here. Also, Most homes across from TC jester park on the east side flooded during harvey, so be careful when you see the lower price there. 

GO is crazy. McMansions right next to original builds, some renovated, many not. The newer builds will likely be out of your budget, the original homes are hit and miss and typically smaller.",1593561641

The dealer I worked had a huge overstock room that was filled with NOS accessories from as far back as the 80s. Ultimately it's a business and parts that don't sell don't get reproduced sadly. My guess is though, someone like Spoon or Honda will start making repro part numbers for the S2K and NSX just like Nissan and Mazda are doing for the GT-R and MX-5 and Spoon with the EG parts.

More recently, I became kinda bitter about it, cause I’ve seen people saying some kinda... much more intense things. Like, “all Japanese people are racist. They hate foreigners and never apologized for even one of their crimes.” Over time, reading things like this were frustrating to me, because I feel that they aren’t true in Japan today. Studying, working, and traveling in Japan today has given me chances to visit many parts of the country. I’ve had great experiences wherever I go. It seems that most all museums, textbooks, and history books are pretty honest about the past. I don’t think they’re trying to deny anything. Sometimes I feel sick reading those stories. But, I think that there are some outliers, like the museum at Yasukuni Shrine, which paints Japan as a just country in the war, removing any instances of wrongdoing. This is really messed up. But a museum funded and controlled by an insanely evil group trying to rewrite history really is in the minority.",1593561642

Only hormones and social expectations prevent you from seeing the kids you have as a cost to your resources and even in the case of women a cost to their bodily integrity. (Women can experience injury and even death in rare cases)

I think it's also a leading cause of post partum depression, people and the mothers themselves have stupidly high expectations of motherhood to automatically be happy with their new kid. They blow the importance up so high no human woman can even begin to meet the lofty expectations themselves and others lay on them. Especially when the reality of carrying the kid, birthing, then raising sets in. The chore that child raising is becomes more apparent contrasting badly with the fluffy golden expectations from others.

"memes","t5_2qjpg","Hello /u/Ravioli_Maker! Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules

&gt;/r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

Turmeric chicken and dumpling lemon soup: 


I wanted to see if my gnocchi recipe would hold up to a heavy liquid recipe like soup, it worked wonderfully! Not the prettiest picture but it was super delicious. This has a unique flavor slightly different from traditional chicken soup, i really liked the heavy thyme, hint of lemon, lingering turmeric and the creaminess of the heavy cream. The gnocchi made a great dumpling stand in! Would be good to cut them up smaller and try a minestrone ketofied!

* 6 cups chicken bone broth. 
* 1/2c heavy cream. 
* 4 table spoons lemon juice. 
* a few sprigs of thyme. 
* a bay leaf. 
* a leftover parmesan rind (you can buy these at whole foods). 
* 2 cloves garlic minced. 
* 1/4 onion chopped. 
* 2-3 stalks of celery chopped. 
* 1/3c sliced carrots (mone were par cooked in microwave. 
* 2 tbls olive oil. 
* 2 cups cooked chicken or Turkey (i used smokes turkey we made this past weekend). 
* 1 tsp turmeric. 
* 2 1/2 servings of homemade gnocchi (about 50 pieces). 
* salt and pepper. 

Sautee onion and celery with oil. Add garlic, thyme, bay leaf, and turmeric. Stir to combine. Add lemon juice. 


Add chicken bone broth, cream and carrots, bring to a boil. 

Add in chicken/ turkey and gnocchi. Return to boil for 3-4 minutes, until gnocchi float to the top. Salt and pepper to taste.",1593561644

Him and many other players hated playing for the jags and as such was reflected in their play as of late. Once he gets a full year in the rams system, especially with a new dc to work with him that defense could really be something. Also r/nfl acts like “oh the rams are doomed to cap gel for the next 5 years!!!!!” However after next year the only dead cap that we’ll have to account for is 8 million for Gurley, and after that nothing. And as for “they don’t stand a chance in the toughest division” argument, the cardinals defense is one of the worst in the league, and deandre Hopkins won’t fix that (not to mention they beat them 34-7 last year). If Greg Zeurlein doesn’t miss that field goal week 4, Seahawks don’t even make the playoffs after getting swept by the rams. Also 7 of there wins were by 6 or less points, against some stellar teams such as the bengals, Steelers, browns and panthers. As for the 49ers they are the ones with the best shot of a repeat, however the loss of Buckner hits hard especially if linkage doesn’t develop, but other than that 9ers are stacked",1593561645

It becomes more of a pragmatic choice than emotional one. Since I have a couple of E30 BMWs it reminds me of the situation with those cars. A lot people, most people, modify them with the M-tech appearance package because the looks improve so much. No one is trying to fool people into thinking they have an M3, it’s just the ideal appearance of the car. They look underbuilt or unfinished stock.

The Civic hatch suffers from the same problem. The short, stubby rear gives a look of incompleteness. The wing elongates the form factor and makes a better overall shape. I think the one caveat to this is not using a full sized wing because they are ridiculously oversized for the non-CTR.

"law","t5_2qh9k","First, when SCOTUS permitted the gay baker to discriminate, 7-2 although not on the same opinion, because they didn't like the *process* I thought that was utterly absurd. How is it possible that a state *saying* something or even having supposedly bad analysis should affect a *party* who deserves a stab at justice? Shouldn't SCOTUS simply correct the ruling itself rather than scolding them and leaving the gay people to suffer?

Second, when the Trinity School was given a right to the rebate for its playground, it didn't seem quite outrageous but I was concerned that this 7-2 precedent would be used for a more blatant integration of church and state, and so it was.

This 5-4 case seems to combine the worst of the two and force taxpayer money directly to religious schools.

If I were to decide this case, I would let the state supreme court decision stand, although I might 'repair' the reasoning, which arguably should include striking down the state constitutional provision. I would NOT go directly against the long-standing prohibition of religious funding and force such payments.

That's taking advantage of the situation in favor of religious schools because:

1. Striking down the entire law would force the legislature back to the drawing board, whereas

2. Leaving it in place could lull the legislature into a sort of status quo of in action, thereby keeping the religious funding in place.",1593561646

&gt; Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden&amp;#039;s campaign on Tuesday criticized U.S. Senate Republicans for blocking legislation to require campaigns to report offers of foreign election help to the FBI, saying it could open the door to interference in the 2020 contest.

&gt; Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Republicans had stripped language he added to an intelligence bill intended to prevent actions like those by Russia that U.S. intelligence services concluded were an attempt to undercut Republican President Donald Trump&amp;#039;s rival in the 2016 campaign.

&gt; U.S. law already makes it illegal for campaigns to accept anything of value from foreign sources.

It's a painful thought in itself.

Now there's a pandemic, which opens up these worries much more. I haven't really ever thought of anything new to cope with these sorts of feelings. It's fear and it's grief, and those are fragile emotions to manage. I think it's important to note that if you ever do stumble across a situation like this and you don't know what to do, try reaching out. It's a messy world we live in but hopefully those who know you and aren't impacted by the situation can think more clearly and would be able to figure out how to help you out.

I didn't say a full body workout was the optimal way but it is a way of training and if done properly it's not necessarily worse than a 3day P/P/L split.

It's easy to blame on genetics for other people's success, lack of equipment, lack of time, etc. Most people do that and that's why for them it's impossible to have this change in just a year. You need consistency.

But you don't need top 1% genetics to achieve what the guy in the photo did. You just need to give your all with no lazy days (a rest day is not a lazy day. A day where you were supposed to train and you only do a third of your plan is a lazy day)",1593561649

The thing is about 8 ball pool is that the best tables to play are the ones where skill matters the most (Berlin and Venice but mostly Venice since all shots are called). Some Berlin players that I've played wouldn't stand a chance in Venice. It sucks that players have to pay to play there. The flukes and lack of skill is also why some pool players refuse to play with the guidelines. If I played Miami, I'd probably only have about 5b. I'm worse there than Berlin because of golden breaks and flukes. I wish there was a call pocket no guideline table (probably in 9 ball). I wish there are 8 ball tables with no guidelines.",1593561649

I had a good background though, having attended Cisco Networking Academy for their CCNA curriculum, working in the field for a number of years, and obtaining CCNA r/S in 2009, only to have let it expire in 2012.

In fantasy I'm me, but my flaws and shortcomings are amplified considerably. The fantasies are often either third person or from the viewpoint of other characters who are my friends and who love me anyway, in spite of and because of my shortcomings. They're never fantastical, I usually work in whatever job I have now and come home to this made up house to my friends who I houseshare with. I'm never rich or famous, and other people in the fantasy are usually people I know in real life, and they dislike me like I'm used to, but the made up friends defend me. 

The most fantastical they get is if they're set back when I was a kid in high school, and I kind of replay all the traumatic stuff I went through and try to 'rewrite' it as if my characters were there too, and it's kind of healing.

When someone hurts me in real life I start doing what you described and imagine one of or all of my friends is in the room supporting me. I used to do this a lot when I had a job at a cocktail bar and I'd have both my manager and customers screaming at me, I'd imagine these fake people stood at the other side of the bar encouraging me lmao.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","I have two friends like this. They have chosen to live free and easy lives because they are too ‘creative’ to be tied down to a normal job. Fair enough, choose your own path lads. 

The problem is that we (our extended friend group) are all in our late thirties and early forties. Most of us have chosen the ‘normal’ job and stable lifestyle and these ‘free spirits’ have started to see us as crutches for their unsustainable lifestyles. 

They’ll turn up empty handed to your house and launch scathing diatribes about the ‘system’ and the ‘wage slaves’ on the bus. All while happily drinking your wage slave beer and eating your wage slave dinner. 

I’ve taken these guys in before when I was virtually penniless because I didn’t want to see them homeless. I’ve given them good jobs with me on good wages to try to help out, even tried to teach them my trade. All without judging their choices. But they’ve never really tried to help themselves and have started to act like they are entitled to my assistance. When I can’t or won’t give them a handout they play the victim card and say that I’m lucky to live in a house or have money and I’m cruel to let them be homeless and starve. 

And honestly the victim card worked on me for years. Decades even. But at some point recently I realized I wasn’t their friend, I was a doormat. My kindness had been seen as weakness.

And guess what happened when I stopped being the doormat? I never heard from them again.",1593561651

Out of all people, buu, at least to me seems like the last person to repent for their actions. The guy was pure evil unironically.

 Buu, at least the version that died, is also almost pure instinct, and doesn't really have ""reason"" to him, so he may not have the sense of mind to be able to refuse repentance.

 And as far as bringing other enemies back, the general fan base (at least as far as this subreddit is concerned) indicates they don't want that.

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","&gt;This may be correct, however the few examples of attempts at socialism using awful dictatorships do show what socialism has actually provided

The attempts at communism have. In the limited attempts we've seen. I'm not advocating trying communism again, so not applicable. It's like saying there's been attempts at Fascism that have failed so we shouldn't have capitalism. It's not a good argument because, first, there haven't really been enough attempts to be able to sort out any conflating conditions and, second, Fascism isn't indicative of the whole of Capitalism. 

&gt;It doesn't necessarily have to end up a dictatorship, but historically it does for one reason or another.

But it doesn't have to. We could just... you know.... do it without a dictator this time.

&gt;Life under capitalism is better in every measurable way.

Absolutely not. Prove that. 

&gt;Capitalism made is so that even those classified as poor live more comfortably than the wealthy of decades or centuries past.

Well, no. Extreme poverty exists in Capitalist countries. And even communism largely eliminate poverty in the USSR. This is setting aside how irrelevant this point is. It doesn't matter what capitalism has done in the past, it's about where it can take us. It provides a worse outlook than socialism. 

&gt;Families living below the poverty line in the US typically own dishwashers, clothes dryers, refrigerators, air conditioners, color televisions with cable or satellite hookups, and cell phones. 

Fun, now discuss what capitalism has done to Somalia, Yemen, Russia, etc. And BTW, the average Soviet lived better than most people before them. And that's with a shitty version of socialism. 

&gt;Under capitalism infant mortality rates have dropped.

It has under Cuba's communism too. You still haven't stated any reason capitalism is better that socialism can't also do. 

&gt;The lifespans of all people, including the poor have been extended.

Not true, look at the declining lifespan of Russians after capitalism was introduced",1593561653

So most activities they are taking aren’t used. Instead we get 3 raids, one of which is one most destiny 1 vets love, we get a new location never before seen (we got moon but it was revamped rather than brand new), not to mention any other dungeons they add.

"podcasting","t5_2s41r","Great question. There are two key types of soundproofing that are required to properly treat a room, diffusion &amp; absorption. 

A lot of it is going to depend on the shape of your room and it's characteristics, however there are a few general pieces of advice I can provide. 

1. A deflection material behind the microphone (in front of the speaker) - this is going to help prevent sound reflections bouncing back into the diaphragm of the mic and increase the clarity. 

2. Absorption on the wall in front of the microphone (behind the speaker) to minimise the sound of the room, and to help absorb diffused sounds. 

3. A diffuser above the microphone. Whilst I understand that mounting a diffuser to your ceiling isn't always an option, if you are able to, this will help make the room sound more natural. 

4. Bass traps in the corners. Bass traps use absorption to minimise the lower frequencies in the room, which will drastically increase the clarity of the recording and make the room sound more lively and organic. 

In regards to materials, the products online (unless they are reputable and expensive) can be substituted with home made alternatives with materials from your local hardware store. With some pine, corkboard, fabric and fibreglass insulation you can make a great sounding room. There are plenty of helpful tutorials and walkthroughs on YouTube.",1593561653

"StudentNurse","t5_2vqzl","I do the practice questions online that the book gave me a code for. Other than that, I feel like they aren’t that useful since they usually ask about certain diseases I know won’t be on the test. The teacher gives us an outline, or review, of diseases that will be on the test. Usually it’s about 20 of them or so, so everyone seems to wait for that to focus on. Bad thing is he gives the review 2 days before the exam. First round everyone failed despite reading every chapter. So we all said nope, we’re not wasting our time with that. The few that did pass said they focused on the review. I focused on the review, but I used an NCLEX review book I thought would’ve helped me with the last bit I had to review. Such a time crunch. But for the others, I did concept maps focusing on patho, side effects, interventions, labs, medications used and therapeutic measures a nurse could take to help. What I didn’t do, though, was read off of the Med Surg book. Despite classmates saying reading the chapters didn’t help, perhaps I should have skimmed through or gotten the information for each disease out of that instead of my NCLEX review book + Davis Edge Skyscape app I bought. I’ve been told doing practice questions help but I’m not sure where to get those, since they have to be about what the review is going over if that makes sense.",1593561654

People who want cheap games.  Compilations sell big time - we see it in other media all the time with music and movies.  Video games are just an extension of that.  Trouble is that software developers would rather you buy individually which is why they only offer compilations of really older titles that aren't best sellers - best sellers get their own releases individually.

She wants to escape whatever happened with Sic Mundus and Martha/ Jonas' son, sure, that makes sense. But then for some reason, she then goes back to Sic Mundus, seemingly of her own volition, and stays with them til the end. 

Why does she kill Noah and leave Claudia's team? What does she want from either Adam or Claudia? Does she agree the world needs to end so the loops will stop? Does she know she's a product of a perpetual family loop? Did she consent to a relationship with Martha's kid, or was it rape? Where did she go towards the end of season 3 when Adam sent her off to do something? We see her in a suit in the reactor hall with Silja, what is her role?  

It's frustrating, because with the killing of Noah and being revealed as the wife of the Origin child (in both worlds no less) she is positioned as someone important who has a lot to add to the story, but she's just bobbing about in the background like a Deus ex Machina.",1593561654

I'm thinking of bringing some water to change as I go along, so I don't have to run the filter while the car is moving as well, so I'll try to do a water change somewhere 2, 3 days into the trip with the water I bring. I read online that bottled water (poland spring, crystal geyser or w/e works, is that true?)

I'm thinking about just using the small 2Gal tank, putting it in a bigger plastic box with plenty of bubble wraps around it to keep it secure and keeping the temp constant. Is that arrangement reasonable? I'll be running the heater in the hotel, but I can probably plug it into the car's AD outlet on the move as well.

is oxygen an issue? I'm assuming it should, so I'll have to get a air pump for the fish on the road right? Probably bring loads of batteries to keep it running. I'm not sure how ""powerful"" it has to be.

what I'm most worried about is the tumble and start/stop of the car. do fish get car sick? should I keep the tank in a ""dark"" place so the fish don't freak out and swim around crazy and tire itself to death? those are my biggest worries, how the fish might survive the roughness of the road, as a normal day would be about 8-10 hours of driving, followed by 16 hours of ""resting"" at the hotel before on the road again.",1593561656

""daddy!!!~"" Guy Fieri shouted, his eyes going wide and heart racing

he had been waiting for two days for his Daddy to come back to the playhouse. Daddy had been on an especially long business trip, and Guy was really horny. Daddy had made him pinky promise not to pleasure himself while he was gone. he wanted Guy to wait for Daddy, like a good boy.

""Hello my little spiked gummybear."" Sonic the Hedgehog laughed as he walked over to his little boy. “You look so potent.”

He breathed in his musk nice and deep

Guy was wearing the cute little lacy blue thong and matching collar that Sonic had given him for their 3 and a half week quarantine anniversary. it made Sonic excited to see him in that outfit.

Guy stood up from the pillows he was lounging on and tiptoed over to where Sonic stood staring.

""Daddy, you know what I want from you."" he whispered into the blue cursed ear. “Breeding.”

""now Duckling, you know you don't get to make the rules. that's not how Daddy runs things."" Sonic growled as he grabbed Guy's ass with his gloved hand, finger exploring

Guy's cock twitched at the touch of the fellow spiked beast on his tight buns

""please put your super fast cummies in me Daddy!!"" Guy begged. “I want to birth. Birth for you.”

""well if you insist. I guess I'll have to do what you say."" Sonic smiled as he started to pick Guy up and bring him to the bed of pillows.

Its just really hard not to get angry when you cannot learn anything from a frustrating experience of getting rejected.

I would play this game again if they introduced an economy based mode. But I’m more so hoping for just a better overall game to come out with one than CFX.

There are like 10-15 different Crossfire game modes, like TDM, search and destroy, juggernaut l, and zombies. Not a single one mentions any economy system.

# Comer e beber

Em geral, você encontra a maioria dos bares e restaurantes bem reputados nas ruas Itapura e Emília Marengo, há também algumas coisas na Coelho Lisboa. Como você vai morar na parte baixa do bairro, pode utilizar as linhas [372U-10](https://web.trafi.com/br/saopaulo/onibus/372u-10-sao-paulo-onibus/metro-tatuape-vila-santa.-isabel/EYJwzgDg+gzA7AJgKoFoCMAGAfgretA=) (para acessar a Emília Marengo a parte superior da Itapura) ou [3763-10](https://web.trafi.com/br/saopaulo/onibus/3763-10-sao-paulo-onibus/metro-tatuape-term.-vila-carrao/EYJwzgDg+gzA7ANhgWgIwAYB+AmTfNA=) (para acessar a Itapura no meio ou a Coelho Lisboa). A 3763-10 é também muito útil para acessar a Praça Nsa. Sra. do Bom Parto, que abriga uma igreja católica e a [Marco Polo](http://www.marcopologelateria.com.br/), um café-sorveteria bem fofo, vale a visita se você gosta de sorvetes artesanais (gelatos).

Ainda sobre sorvetes, a rua Itapura abriga a [Bartô](https://www.facebook.com/bartogelateria/), outra sorveteria simpática, mas com um ambiente mais despojado e clean em comparação com a Marco Polo. Eu também cheguei a assistir algumas apresentações de jazz (ou algum crossover chamado de jazz, enfim) na [Vitrine da Pizza](https://www.facebook.com/vitrinedapizza/), que tem preços meio salgados, mas oferece um ambiente bem tranquilo. A Itapura também abriga a pequena hamburgueria [Real Burger](http://realburger.com.br/), que é bem honesta na proposta: tem cardápio direto, ambiente sóbrio e costuma ter rock tocando no fundo.

Descendo mais um pouco na Itapura, há o [La Buena Onda](http://www.labuenaonda.com.br/), um excelente tex-mex. Você pode levar amigos e dividir uma porção de nachos. O lanche La Gorda é o meu favorito, mas ele é bem grande e pode servir duas pessoas. O ambiente do La Buena Onda tem decoração simples e é absolutamente casual e tranquilo.

Na Radial Leste, entre as estações Tatuapé e Carrão, você encontra a [It Burger](https://itburger.com.br/), com um ambiente muito caprichado, bom atendimento e preços um pouco salgados. É uma opção legal para comer um hambúrguer sem dar muitas voltas no bairro, eu acho. Uma outra opção que eu gosto (e já fui bem mais vezes) é o [Garage Burger](http://garageburger.com.br/), já no fim da Emília Marengo, pertinho do parque Ceret (mais sobre ele depois).

Sobre padarias, o Tatuapé oferece várias e acho que as duas maiores são [Big Bread Prime](https://bigbreadprime.com.br/unidade-tatuape/) (bem no Tatuapé mesmo, perto da Estação Carrão) e a [Casa Nápoles](https://www.casanapoles.com.br/) (um pouco depois do Ceret, praticamente já na Vila Formosa). Eu gosto bastante da Casa Nápoles, o ambiente é excelente (ela é uma padaria faz tudo, serve hambúrguer e pizza a sushi) e o atendimento costuma ser bem bom, além disso, a variedade é ótima e sempre tem algo fresquinho. As baguetes recheadas e pizzelas são boas e não custam muito caro (R$ 10 em média). Outra opção de padaria, provavelmente bem mais perto do apartamento que você adquiriu, é a [Lisboa](https://www.lisboa1913.com.br/), na Praça Sílvio Romero, ela é tradicional do Tatuapé e acho que é ligeiramente mais em conta do que a Nápoles, no entanto, ela é pequena e comer no local pode ser meio difícil.

Se você gosta de comida japonesa, a [Temakeria Paulista](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Japanese-Restaurant/Temakeria-Paulista-365281500199267/), entre a Praça Nsa. Sra. do Bom Parto e a rua Emília Marengo, é um lugar legal. Você faz o pedido via iPad.

Fico devendo na listinha de bares, pois não bebo.

# Compras e lazer

O Tatuapé tem uma [unidade 24 horas do Sonda](https://www.sondadelivery.com.br/delivery/LojasFisicas) na Apucarana. Já fui lá entre 0h e 1h diversas vezes. Os preços do Sonda não são aquela maravilha, mas também não é um Pão de Açúcar (mas se quiser um Pão de Açúcar, o Tatuapé conta com um, além disso, há outro maior ao lado no Power Center Regente Feijó). Indo mais cedo, você encontra várias coisas na rotisseria, que podem quebrar um galhão. Perto da Estação Tatuapé, você pode contar com três mini-mercados: Extra na parte baixa da rua Tuiuti, Dia na Praça Sílvio Romero e um Carrefour Express na parte alta da rua Tuiuti, perto de uma Kalunga.

O trecho da rua Tuiuti entre a Praça Sílvio Romero e a Estação Tatuapé, que também cruza a rua Platina, é aquele mais vocacionado a um perfil popular de comércio, então você tem por lá loja de roupas e calçados, salgaderia, pastelaria, ótica, dentista, perfumaria, [loja de guloseimas](https://www.manosdoces.com.br/) etc.

Fora isso você tem o [Complexo Tatuapé](http://www.complexotatuape.com.br/) com dois shoppings integrados à Estação Tatuapé, um mais completo e cheio e outro complementar e mais vazio (Boulevard). Nenhum dos cinemas surpreende, mas o do Boulevard é menos pior. Dependendo do caso, é melhor pegar a 372U-10 e ir até o [UCI](https://www.ucicinemas.com.br/Cinemas/UCI-Anália-Franco/info) do [Shopping Anália Franco](https://www.shoppinganaliafranco.com.br/). Se chamar um carro por aplicativo, a corrida não deve levar mais do que 10 minutos.

Já que eu falei do Shopping Anália Franco, na transição entre Tatuapé, Vila Formosa e Jd. Anália Franco/Vila Regente Feijó, ele é quase vizinho do [Ceret](https://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/esportes/ceret/index.php?p=8631), um parque agradável e que vale a pena conhecer. Parte do estacionamento do Ceret é utilizado para quem quer aprender a pedalar e andar de skate, que não são permitidos dentro do parque. O Ceret era um antigo clube, então ele possui quadras de esporte (algumas em melhor condição do que outras) e piscinas.

A Praça Sílvio Romero é também um ""point"" para comer cachorro quente e acho que isso está um pouco associado à vida noturna da Coelho Lisboa, que também abriga um fliperama [Lord's](http://www.bilhareslords.com.br/localizacao_tatuape) (não tão grande quanto o [Lord's da Vila Formosa](http://www.bilhareslords.com.br/localizacao_vila), entretanto).

# Transporte

Caso precise sair do Tatuapé em direção ao Centro Expandido no pico da manhã, além da Linha 3-Vermelha, você terá a opção da [CPTM](https://www.cptm.sp.gov.br/sua-viagem/Pages/Linhas.aspx), com a Linha 11-Coral e, dependendo do caso, até a Linha 12-Safira, por exemplo, você pode seguir para a Luz para utilizar a Linha 4-Amarela ou a Linha 7-Rubi em direção à Barra Funda. Seu acesso ao aeroporto internacional também estará facilitado, seja pelos ônibus da EMTU ou pela CPTM (Linha 12 + [Linha 13-Jade](https://www.cptm.sp.gov.br/sua-viagem/Pages/Aeroporto.aspx)).

As linhas 3763-10, 372U-10 e [3762-10](https://web.trafi.com/br/saopaulo/onibus/3762-10-sao-paulo-onibus/metro-tatuape-jardim-iva/EYJwzgDg+gzA7ANgEwFoCMAGAfkretA=) devem cobrir os principais pontos da face sul do Tatuapé.",1593561659

Of course. What they don't have is *gay* privilege either institutional or in broader society. This is kind of my point.

In the event of an impending nuclear explosion, if you have time, open ALL the windows and doors in your house (and the hole up in the strongest part, usually a room in the centre, or in a corner of the basement).

Opening all the windows and doors will reduce the pressure differential, and will allow the blast wave to pass as much through the house as possible.

After the blast and the backdraft have come and gone, THEN lock all the windows and doors (assuming you still can).  Your house might still be damaged, but much less than it would otherwise have been.",1593561660

That's illogical. At worst you can simply disagree since me implying you almost get it can't by definition be a mischaracterization of your argument, because I'm not reinterpreting it in any way whatsoever. 

1) You brought up a random ass example where the woman is successful and the man is the manager, I brought a random ass example where the woman is successful and the man is the manager. If your random ass comment has validity so does mine. If mine doesn't neither does yours.

2) True, let me explain. ""Mind your business kiddo"" is not used in the same context or for the same reasons men call women sweetie in a patronizing way, so comparing the two is a false equivalency since the experiences are not comparable whatsoever. ""Mind your business kiddo"" is inherently confrontational, while ""sweetie..."" is used towards women in literally every single situation possible by men who patronize them just because they're women. ""Sweetie"" can also be a very lovely term of endearment, but I doubt xQc was simping for ninja's wife lmao. 

""Mind your business kiddo"" is a very masks off way of calling someone immature, which isn't a sexist thing to do.

Shannon Gilbert being a big one, and two after the storm as well.

Also Natasha Jugo. Who shared a lot of similarities to Glibert's death. Her body was found washed up on Gilgo beach in March 13'. She claimed people were following her and her clothes and belongings had been found on the same beach the day before. I know the wiki said the police believe she might not be related but I am pretty sure one of the podcasts on this said she was being looked at again after some new info arose she may have been a sex worker on the sneak.

Rest of the story also plays out the same only with Joel in Tommy's place.  He leaves alone to hunt down Abby's group, Ellie can't bear to let Joel go alone even if they've been having friction so she follows his trail with Dina taggin along.  

Same flashbacks occur to fill the audience in on what's happened between Joel and Ellie.  Maybe even psyche out the audience by having Abby shoot Joel in the head like she does Tommy (only for him to show up alive later), etc.

"Divorce","t5_2qipv","In in a similar situation to you. My marriage has been on the rocks a long time, but unusually we just ignore conflict so on the outside everything seems fine. For me, I've done some soul searching and realized my husband and I are not right for each other. We literally disagree on almost every political and ethical point of view,  we dont talk or connect at all unless we are drinking together. We have different views in how to raise our kids etc. I've been thinking about divorce a long time but too scared to do anything about it. Turning everything upside down is not something to take lightly. But this quarantine has helped me realize some things. I've so t so much time talking with my friends on video chat because I am so lonely.  In my home with my husband who has been home with me for the duration. That is not normal right? Then by accident through one of our group video chats I met someone who I really connected with. As friends, we just had so much in common etc. Then feelings developed.  So its definitely complicated things. I am ready to divorce, but not for this other man. But, because he helped me realize what a real loving relationship should be like. I should be able to talk to my husband at the end of a bad day. I should enjoy his company at least as much as my best friends. But I dont. I respect him as a man and he has provided for me well. But its not love. I know it's going to be so hard. But I think I owe it to myself to get out and be happy.  Be independent again. Let go of all the resentments and anger. Let my kids see a happy mom and hopefully dad too. Maybe someday they will see what a loving relationship should be like. I dont know if this is your situation, but I wish you the best. I hope you figure it out. Either this is just a crush and you can do some counseling to focus on your marriage, or it is your brain trying to tell you, this is not the right person for you. Obviously I'm jaded on the subject. And rambling...",1593561663

We're fortunate in that we own a home and are able to keep a roof over our head and food in our pantry but money still gets tight sometimes if there are unforeseen expenses.

Students from Middle-Class backgrounds, I think, are stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to financing education. We're definitely privileged in that our families make enough money to meet our basic needs and even splurge here and there, but we do not have the finances to fund a university degree. Thus, we take out loans. Trust me- it's not something we like to do but the financial benefits of a bachelor's degree outweigh the loans we have to take out.",1593561663

"pics","t5_2qh0u","[Obviously all lives matter. No one said they didn't](https://i.imgur.com/UyCmhSx.png). However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can. COVID-19 is still a very real threat, not only to you, but those you love and everyone around you as well!

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","I believe ""The left's"" approach here is highly exaggerated. ""The left"" is a hugely diverse group of people with a wide range of views, I'd say we argue with ourselves the most. 

While I can't deny that people do get caught in the mob of justice, it's ridiculous to think that all these people desire the destruction of anyone who tows the line.  I am sorry that you feel this way, but we need to remember that our society cannot be so easily categorized. 

We are dealing with the same corrupt/decaying socioeconomic structure that has made few changes despite the expansion of education and rapid advances in infrastructure, and the internet. There is an undeniable shadow that hangs over the world today.... Mostly about the horrible shit that happened in the past... and oftentimes in the name of stability we sweep that shit under the rug and go about our days. The legislators/proponents of Jim Crow for example stayed in their positions and mentored the next generation of lawmakers/activists. While America pulled through with the 1964 CRA and the likes, it always failed when it came to approaching the hard topics that would severely disrupt (but mend) American society.

We need to keep in mind that ""the left"" and ""the right"" exist in this same corrupt and crutched system, framing the issue as left vs right only legitimizes its existence. 

It has an awfully shitty affect where we develop our POV in the context of left vs right, which effects our daily interactions. This directly contributes to the greater conversation at hand. Other people in the same position will also receive these messages, and through that ""left vs right"" perspective, they develop a ""left vs right"" conclusion.

Your position on how ""Rights"" and ""Lefts"" behave is really warped. It isn't hard to sit a leftist down, just don't be edgy, and get ready for a lot of venting. I grew up in the rural midwest and I can assure you those broad generalizations are not true. In HS we literally bullied the gay kids and hazed them out of sports, people actually believe that you could not have a moral compass without God in your life, we looked down on people with substance abuse issues and instead of coming together as a community and helping them, we effectively excommunicated them and didn't offer them positions in our ""humble"" communities.

I strongly urge you to revisit these ""leftists"", but instead of approaching them as a leftist, approach them as someone who is stuck in a tumultuous and toxic socioeconomic system that is offered little room for political expression. Someone who, like many of us, do not get the opportunity to discuss serious issues like race/ethnicity/sexuality/nationalism/ideology.

"Dogfree","t5_2ud8e","I understand your viewpoint. Yeah I’d prefer a warning before a situation escalates (I’ll explain why later) but I think most people don’t like them growling because sometimes people aren’t doing anything intentionally to the dog or trying to provoke it yet they get growled at. People don’t like it and especially those who don’t like dogs. 

For example, if someone was minding their own business and walk past a dog that begins to growl. It indicates the dog is not trained. It’s aggressive or fearful, etc but the circumstance that it happened doesn’t make sense to the person walking by because they didn’t do anything. A dog should be able to have a stranger walk past them without them growling at them (basically warning them they might bite) 

I had an incident where I walked past a dog in the stairs. I was going down, they were going up. This dog walks past me successfully but goes back down the stairs to sniff me again (when my back was turned) and then decides to take a bite of my pants. There was no warning and it only began to growl and bark after it toke a bite. I was not happy about that. If it had warned me first, I would’ve given them space to go up first. But this dog didn’t seem to be bothered by my presence so I figured it was fine to walk past it. Nope. And the owner was already up the stairs while the dog was near the bottom. Owner told me she didn’t even know the dog bit me when we spoke weeks later.",1593561664

What it does is it makes _you_ feel better about what definition of ""progress"" you've chosen to subscribe to but the way you frame it is entirely within the worldview of people who really have no substantial stake in that ""progress"". 

You're asking people to ""wait"", ""as long as is necessary"", essentially. Wait for whom? Wait for what? Whose timetable are you going by when you paternalistically encourage people to ""wait""? I ask again...wait for whom and for what?

What are we waiting for? For someone else to ""benevolently"" bestow upon us the opportunity to fully participate in the American franchise of ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness""? 

Do you not see what narrative you are propagating? Do you think we got where we (Black people) are today because they decided they were just gonna stop being white supremacists one day or did we fight, bleed and die for _every inch_ of progress we attained today?

One perspective (yours, whether you realize it or not) removes all agency from those who have been perpetually and systemically wronged by the way ~~white~~ American society is structured and the other (much more in line with conventional Black American history and its subsequent freedom movements) restores that agency and says, as the history books say, that we have largely gone about this on our own...

What worldview do you subscribe to and how much of _your_....upbringing is that a product of? I should note at this point that, while I'm not immediately biracial, my maternal lineage is more white than black (as a consequence of generational rape rather than wilful unions of matrimony)",1593561664

Also, I have traveled to Tibet and spoken to Tibetans about how they feel being part of China. They're highly supportive of the PRC and nearly everyone I spoke to there (save for some monks) only ever talked about how their lives have improved since the re-incorporation of Tibet into China.

Prior to incorporation, Tibet was a very harsh feudalistic society with a caste system, forced servitude, and maiming as a common criminal punishment.

When I got to plat 2 I noticed I kept falling out because I wasn't playing at the higher game speed. When I sped up, I made more mistakes. Sort of a damned if I do, damned if I don't scenario.

What helped was choosing to stick with the higher speed and focusing on maxing my speed in custom training, even if I missed 5 or 6 times in a row on an easier shot. I think what happens is when you start playing faster you FEEL as if your mechanics suffer by whiffing but really you're challenging your mechanics to be consistent at a new, faster level.

Another thing I do is I have a 6 year old who plays on the casual modes, so the MMR there is SUPER low. When I feel about warmed up I will run a game or two in that mode. It's super one sided of course (I try not to be a show boat with it) but is really good transition from the controlled training packs to seeing if I can read the ball and react quickly. Plus, playing at such a low level forces you to be so fast you outpace your teammates since they will smack the ball away from you any chance they get.

"MLS","t5_2rbnb","&gt; You just said a woman who has been dead for 34 years has been canceled. Deservedly so, by the way. Let's get all these ""God"" bullshit songs outta there. Also, fuck off with playing shit by a woman who recorded a song called ""That's Why Darkies Are Born."" There's plenty of other songs we can use.

Yes, they tore down her statue and eliminated her from pregame ceremonies, but they’re still singing God Bless America so religious connections have nothing to do with it. . I’m not interested in rehashing this *whole* debate, but she was a woman in in the 1930s entertainment industry, I don’t think she really had much of a choice over what songs she sang. 

&gt; Don Cherry is old and seems pretty racist to me. Regardless, it was just easier to hire somebody who was younger and less likely to offend the younger audience with his racist, xenophobic shit.

Your argument wasn’t that “these whole deserve to be cancelled,” it was that cancelling doesn’t happen. 

&gt; Katai. You listen to what CJ Sapong had to say about Katai? Maybe you should.

Sapong’s argument was that Katai was racist because he squared the ball to another teammate besides him, who scored a goal anyways. That’s a really weak argument. 

&gt; Madley's back in League One and Two this year. After a few years, he'll probably be back in Premier.

He’s also lost his FIFA badge and his promising international career as result of being sacked, and will never get it back, not to mention the years of recovery he’ll have to sit through to get back on the premier league. And that’s not even including the moving to a different country, the mental health strife, the threats made against his family, the [thoughts of suicide](https://twitter.com/sjohnsonsport/status/1230480529176367105?s=21)...

And you’re acting like that’s no big deal?

&gt; When something gets ""canceled"", it rarely comes back. So why does it seem to be so common for these cancellations to come back?

Literally none of the examples I have have “come back” yet. And even so, if they need to go through hell and back to do so, that’s *still terrible* even if they do come back eventually.",1593561667

You said that you are not in the US, so there's a high chance that your country offers health insurance and unemployment benefits to employees so this is not the only job she can get that has health insurance. 

Her situation sucks but what she's trying to do sucks more. Being a single mother doesn't mean that you can ask someone to quit their job so you can keep it. If she is also trying to manipulate you to do it, is utterly disgusting. 

You can help her by recommending her to HR connections if you have, or ask your father if he knows of any companies or job openings.

He was the figurehead of an intense political campaign to get Governor Davis recalled during the middle of a term, successfully engineered by the Republican party, for which Arnold was selected and groomed to be the ""friendly"" Republican replacement who happened to be socially liberal and thus more likely to appeal to moderates.

We had to have a special election over it, tons of money was burned, and it set an ominous precedent of recall-by-referendum in the state that still hangs over elected officials, and generally destabilizes the election process as a whole. Many people felt that the office was stolen and this recall effort undermined the legal vote they'd already cast.

Then after he was in office he was not that great.  Like, he wasn't bad... he wasn't the Republican clowns in DC right now. I genuinely think he's a decent person and that he was proud to serve the state of California.  Also he was more pro-environment than most Republicans.

But his tenure was hugely controlled by special interests, and our state budget was in the tank for years. Once Jerry Brown got into the office we had to make up the debt and build up a rainy day fund. Some of that was helped by a better economy nationwide, but Arnold entered office in 2003, five years of prosperity before the recession. He left in 2011.",1593561668

From a strategic perspective Lee had the wrong idea about how to prosecute the war.  General Longstreet on the other hand knew exactly the precarious situation that the Confederacy was in.  He well knew that the North had the manpower, industry, and will to push as far into Southern territory as possible.  Whereas the south was deficient in all of these aspects.  The only real way that the South had a chance at winning the war was to establish borders at more defensible positions, and NEVER push into Union territory.  From there they could've sued for peace, and exacted heavy tolls on the Union.    


Lee instead opted to try and invade the North, twice, to disastrous effect.  Antietam was tactically a draw, but the South's losses could not be replaced as easily as the North could replace theirs.  Not to mention the South's supply situation varied from day to day, and pushing North just into Maryland and Pennsylvania required that supply chain to be stretched and overtaxed even more.",1593561668

Naturally, the 6-10 different cars make that lap time in different ways and, consequently, will produce different results at tracks that favor one performance aspect over another.

Sometimes I wonder if this is all in some way a coordinated plan between the dowager, the Professor, Komatsu, and/or the leader(s) of Sakigake. As you mentioned and has been discussed previously, it's interesting how all these people seem to have access to incredibly large amounts of money, and maybe there could be a connection there.

Still respectfully disagree, I’ll be more civil this time.

GAO study: so 107k is enough to retire on? Obviously not, despite the fact it’s all a lot of people have. Also note that the average person doesn’t only have 107k near retirement age because they were paid way less than you. Americans are very bad at personal finance. Also kids, divorces, life events are expensive. Many rob their retirement to redo their kitchen. You don’t seem like the type to do that, so good for you. But you’ll have some $ at retirement from common sense, not from earning well. 

Health: I’ll give you some credit here. Perhaps aging won’t murder your money before you. But your medical expenses will still go up. 

Mortgage: yes that’s the idea, have a paid for house in retirement. You can’t count on that - see above. Life is expensive, you may move and wind up extending that note. And move and extend again. But if you can pull it off, great for you. 

Bottom line, your post was about teachers not being underpaid. We’ve agreed you can have a meager retirement, IF you play your cards right - meaning live your adult life in the same rural house, never rob your retirement for a renovation, wedding, kid related expenses, etc. and generally use common sense when it comes to money. You’ve seen the stats - most Americans, even with higher paying jobs in cases, don’t pull it off and wind up with not much at retirement. I still believe you deserve better than that given your job and education.

"PRINCE","t5_2qoju","Yes you are right and I also know that by the late 80s a lot of dance songs were including heavy sampling (Ride On Time by Black Box springs to mind) without giving credit until forced to. So maybe Sheila wouldn't have had to cite the source when the album came out. What was irritating was Warner Music (I think) trying to tell me that they owned the rights to a chunk of audio when I provided the actual source of it, and their artist never credited where she got it from then or, presumably, still. 

If you look up Madonna's album from the next year, True Blue, on either discogs or wikipedia it mentions that the song White Heat samples the movie of the same name which starred Jimmy ~~Stewart~~ Cagney. It seems like she mentioned that at the time too, and probably had to license it to use the lines of dialogue like she did. I never understood the legal part all that well though.

"coolguides","t5_310rm","There's so much wrong with this.. 

The traffic being unencrypted at the endpoint as a con for tor, well what the heck do you think happens at the VPN endpoint? And at the VPN centralized servers? Guess what, totally unencrypted!

Paranoid about governments spying on you? Relay all your traffic through a single private company which pinky promises to not look at it and sell it. Oh and also the government won't be able to read the traffic*! This is totally a pro compared to the boring old TOR which had been created by the government and surely isn't as safe as a centralized VPN with no public means of auditing the code or nodes..

(*Depending on the juristiction this may vary. If the company can be held accountable in the US they are required to give unencrypted access to the data without notifying the user(s) in any shape or form. This in turn requires companies by law to lie about not giving the government insight into the unencrypted data).

If you want Netflix from other locations or a fast torrent for illegal stuff, VPN is right for you. You know what you're doing, they know what you're doing (remember that part about decrypting at their servers? That's how they _know_ what you're doing and not just guessing), don't pretend that it's about security or privacy or censorship. Use a DNS Server other than your ISPs (There's 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8 and tons of others) if you don't want sites to be censored and TOR for privacy. Tor blocking flash and making torrenting hard isn't to annoy you. It's to keep you anonymous. These things leak sensitive data. It's not a con, it's a big fat pro. The TOR browser bundle cares. Same resolution for everyone, same user agent for everyone, same everything for everyone. Annoyed about that? Check out browser fingerprinting. Your IP being hidden by using a VPN isn't worth anything if you can be fingerprinted. If that's not enough visit check2ip(dot)com and watch them deanonymize you without any problems. And if you're on Chrome there's nothing you can do about that. Check out HSTS fivgerprinting if you're still not convinced.

TOR is for people who want to be anonymous.

VPN is for bypassing region restrictions and illegal torrents.

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","I was the kind of TBM who didn’t mourn over death (however, I never had anyone exceptionally close to me die.) I’d just say I knew where they were going and meh. 

I still haven’t experienced a close relationship ending from the death of one party. Personally I enjoy reincarnation. I like the idea that some people are part of your past lives.

And I've slowly seen reddit just become more and more restrictive and enforcing what is effectively thought policing. This move here is the mods flexing their new found power. I won't doubt it if I get banned just for saying this. But this kind of shit is how reddit dies. Not respecting its own community and users. I think in 3 years this site will be half the numbers it is currently and dead in 6 (set reminders). Because this has happened with plenty of other sites before this.",1593561671

"DBZDokkanBattle","t5_384a7","I tried to talk about this topic in the past, but usually got the answer RGN is RGN.

Some suspicions from my side and why I think so.

1. Dokkan rewards the first few purchases per account:

On my first GLB account, I almost grinded the whole quest mode in order to get AGL Rosé. Did not pull him. Purchased my first stone back and got him on this multi.

Made my second purchase during 2nd anni (actually many). Rainbowed both SSJ4s with less than 800 stones.

Also had a JP account once and made one purchase for 3rd anni. Immediately got INT Vegito on which I spent all my f2p stones.


2. Each seed gives you at least 2 units unusually often and some units seem impossible to pull

Everytime I go deep into banners, there are at least two units I rather pull often. Sometimes the new unit, sometimes trash. On the other hand, some units will never show up. Examples:

2nd anniversary initial account: Rainbowed both SSJ4 with less than 800 stones.

300M DL celebration initial account: It took me 3000 stones for one copy of LR G&amp;F. However, I pulled 4 copies of the unfeatured LR PHY Trunks.

350M DL celebration initial account: 1000 stones to get one copy of Gohan, 2500 stones without Cell.

2nd account:

SSBKK Goku banner: Rainbowed two DFE units completely, no Goku with 2500 stones.

SSJ2 Goku Banner (approx. 800 stones): 4 units Trans Goku, 5 units SSBKK Goku AGL, 5 units of the new Gohan. No LR, which I was chasing

In most cases, I have at least one unfeatured unit that I pull several times.

3. Seeds are depending on several factors

I could observe several factors:

Time: especially when I once rerolled for a JP account. During a certain time each day, seeds seem to reset, as the units I got unusually often changed. This was at a different timing as my ID reset.

IP: If I switch off WiFi or after ISPs ID reset time, there are usually other units I get more frequent. This is however only visible after I restart Dokkan. If I restart Dokkan without changing the IP however, no change is visible.

This is of course no statistical evidence, as I don’t collect data, but also seeing YTers vids, people need to realize that something seems off.
One thing I can confirm however are the total rates. I once selected data for all pulls I did and rates were always as stated in the long term (+/- 0.x%).

However there clearly seems to be an uneven distribution of the units (sometimes for good, sometimes for the bad).",1593561672

"WhiteWolfRPG","t5_2u6fa","I love that game. I've played, and been played by, far too many Hours.

No, seriously. I've been considering how to do this myself - right now I am writing a Hecata chronicle that uses some of the lore from CS. 

One of the main antagonists are a mortal faction with a touch of power - the power gained from their Hours, which I represent as incredibly old Wraiths. It doesn't jive seamlessly - I patterned it more after what you'd find in Geist: the Sin Eaters than what you find in Wraith, essentially a Wraith that has moved up into something more, something that's become fettered to the underworld itself (yes, I know, that's not supposed to be possible - roll with it).

The fettering to a certain aspect of the Underworld is what gives the Hours their power, and allows a limited occultism to cross the Shroud into the skinlands. It also attracts Wraiths to them, hungry to escape the clutches of Oblivion as it's being fettered to the Underworld itself sounds like a good idea. Of course, these wraiths represent the spirits that the occultists summon, though I don't do anything so no the nose as calling them a, ""Maid-in-the-Mirror"" or a ""Hint.""

Being that it's a Hecata chronicle, it's obviously V5, but I feel the same is doable from the aspects of many different splats. I prefer them as antagonists though - weird rituals, strange summonings, dark pacts - that has all the makings of a dangerous antagonist group that isn't the same SI/Church kind of Hunter. It puts characters on the back foot, I feel, because they aren't necessarily hunting vampires to expose them or because they think there's anything wrong with them - it might be a necessary ingredient into a ritual, or merely to advance themselves in the service of their chosen Hour. I also like this approach because it doesn't allow the PCs to easily 'make friends' with them. They're unpredictable, based on ancient and unknowable dead things, who've really lost what it means to be human, but aren't spectres.

Anyway, I haven't finished writing my notes up on the chronicle, and it's really more of an interlude to give our current ST a break and some time to play. So no idea when I'll run it, but I'm looking forward to player feedback on it.",1593561673

"Scotch","t5_2qq65","It took me far too long to finally get around to trying out Kilchoman. We spent a few days on Islay last autumn and sadly did not even get to glimpse this small family-operated farm distillery. Kilchoman are the new kids on the block on Islay, having just opened in 2005. In the short span of time since, they have garnered a reputation for doing everything the right way, with a range of young expressions punching far above their weigh-  er...age. A few days after tasting a sample of Machir Bay, their entry level expression, I stumbled across this limited release from 2019 at the local liquor store. I have been fascinated with the process of STR (which stands for shaved, toasted, and re-charred...a method of rejuvenating spent wine casks by shaving down the inner layer of the staves, toasting, and applying a fresh char), and figured I had to give it a try.

**Kilchoman STR Cask (2019 Release),** Islay, 50% 

Aged in shaved, toasted, and re-charred wine casks for 6 years.

**Appearance:** gorgeous dark amber

**Nose:** bright and inviting with lots of fresh fruit and a little vanilla and spice. Wisps of Islay peat smoke

**Palate:** delivers exactly what the nose promised. Fresh berries layered over rich vanilla. Conjures a mental image of droplets of wine residue working their way through the toasted wood into the whisky. It's like if Islay tried their hand at bourbon.

**Reduced Palate:** With a few drops of water, the vanilla takes a back seat and the fruit intensifies. Raspberries and red apple. The peat smoke is assertive but gentle. 

**Finish:** medium length, giving all the above flavors a chance to meld and integrate. Fades out with ashy campfire smoke.

Fantastic. Not at all complex, but a truly excellent combination of flavors. This is my new favorite sweet / peat combo, and one of my top 2 purchases of the last year, alongside the 2019 special release Talisker 15. I enjoy exploring whisky...I have a lot of open bottles and I rarely reach for the same thing repeatedly, but this I could drink over and over. It's only 6 years old, and I don't feel like it needs to be a day older. What Kilchoman has managed to do with their young stock is incredible. The STR effect is unique in a number of ways. For one, the toasting and re-char of the wood produce the bourbon-esque notes that make this expression work so well. Secondly, it is without any of the sour winey notes that I find so off-putting in other wine cask matured whisky. If you see this, buy it. 

**88/100** (as I mentioned in my previous review, I am working on devising a new scoring system. For now, I will grade this an 88, for being very very good at what it does without being necessarily ground breaking)

I haven't looked this up, but are there profiles on the different counselors that we have? I think at the very least it would be beneficial for us to choose counselors that think we can relate to, or would be comfortable with. Each therapist also has an area of expertise I think knowing what you're getting into might be nice.


1000% agree with the lack of trauma therapy, I'm going to try and find out if they have specialized people for these and how many and likely share the existing resources they have so that the information is at the very least easier to find.

Throwaway account.

Background: My (18F) mom covers my housing costs for university and my dad is not in my picture. 

I didn’t succeed much at my remote college classes this spring. My mom and I agreed that I should go back to campus if at all possible in the fall. I was nervous about returning because the last couple weeks of living in the dorms were a nightmare, but I need to pass my classes.

My university just announced that they are waiving the residency requirement next year. That means that I can live off campus now instead of waiting until my junior year! This would mean that I could attend the in-person lectures but live in a lower-risk environment. My mom was furious that I want to live off-campus.

We’ve been arguing for two days. So far the arguments are:

Hers:
-I need my college experience to be on campus. (There would be no college experience, gatherings are banned.)
-I shouldn’t have rushed my sorority if I’m not living in the house. (I didn’t know about the pandemic when I rushed and also pay my own dues.)
-Security will be worse in an apartment, and walking around at night would be unsafe. (Dorm security was very lax, ie no guard, and strangers frequently wandering in. A lot of my friends already lived off campus, so I already safely walked at night with friends and pepper spray. She then said that if I want to be stupid it’s my choice.)
-I’m not mature enough for an apartment, even if living alone for a year already went well.


Mine:
-I barely left my dorm room the last couple weeks before leaving. I didn’t eat for days at a time because the dining halls were so scary, and I almost cried when I had to cook in the communal dorm kitchen. An apartment would be better for my mental and physical health. 
-It would be cheaper for her. An apartment would save her literally thousands of dollars this year.
-Instead of sharing a bathroom with 15+ girls and communal living spaces, I would share them with 2 other people. The virus risk is so much lower. 
-I could pay 50-75% of the rent and utilities, and all of my living costs. 

She has said that she would:
-not help me with anything monetarily or skills-wise
-kick me off our health insurance 
-not help me get back to campus 
-have her heart broken and never forgive me 
-bill me $12,000 (including Uber charges I never racked up and past payments of car insurance)

I’ve worked since I was 13 so I have savings. I can get a second job on campus. The $12,000 bill, finding health insurance for my medication, and the lack of a relationship with my mom and grandparents are the problems. I do feel like an asshole for causing so much trouble, but it would be so much safer, better, and cheaper for me and her. I’ve been told that if I decide to go into an apartment and pay for it myself, I would hurt my family in a way that would never be  healed.

AITA for wanting to move into an apartment, ignoring the help my mom is willing to give me if I live on campus?

At the end of the day the dungeons are meant for those who are late game the majority of these people have played for years and have gone through all the hard times. They should have more idols solely for not giving up when all there was to do was non stop fp's. It's not going to benefit anyone if it's lessoned if anything it would hurt the majority of players as it would then take even more idols to justify doing the idol dungeon. Atm it takes roughly 600t to make the dungeons worth it if you can cap normal fp's that's quite alot and then it will take a while to make it op if you want to call it that but keep in mind the insane costs of talents at that point. The talents late late game cost well over a q and if your only getting 7t to 12t a run on normal fp's that's going to take forever to even get one level. Now they can finally get levels at a normal speed and your trying to nerf it you'd lose alot of the community if that happens.",1593561674

"Enough_Sanders_Spam","t5_3fmhe","&gt;I'm sure the gay community wouldn't be so onboard with your ""let them continue"" strategy.

Well for one, the gay community isn't one hive mind and there is a pretty large separation depending on what letter you are and your age. Older gay men and lesbians are going to tend more anti-trans for example, especially given the prevailing sentiment in the 80's that trans was another axis of male oppression wholesale appropriating the bodies of women and the practice of gay men to have ""tranny"" parties or celebrate general transvestitism and generally use that word. I note a significant difference in opinion between say a 40-50 yo gay man and a 25 year old. But no one is going to think it's ok for violent speech to occur, that's pretty obvious, but when I ask for specifics it's because I don't trust politically biased accusations, even when they come from my ""side"" as every group interprets things as uncharitably as possible, removing context, taking things literally etc to score points. I don't doubt some heinous ban-worthy shit has been said but I've browsed CTH looking for ""content"" - ie dumb shit that looks bad to use against them and it's not like there was an overwhelming amount of racist/homophobic stuff there really. LOTS of dumb takes inherent in their ideology but not as much along the oppression axes. The caveat to this is I admit that I wasn't browsing during the time Pete was competitive with Bernie so likely missed a large wave of homophobia early in the primary. 

I'm just aware that things we call racism and homophobia we also gild the lily a bit. I jab Bernie supporters on the ""low information racism"" but I do this knowing full well that a LOT of Bernie supporters have arrived at that talking point by looking purely at the education demographics of voter support during the primary without a racist thought involved. It's just an easy thing to twist given the lack of AA support he had. I am aware of these political tendencies in all groups. In *myself*. So when I say I want more information, I really mean it in the sense that I want to ascertain the factually correct and right opinion and position. 

The easiest way to be misinformed is to take things from your ""own group"" at face value because the trust factor is higher. I fight against the tendency to misinform myself with the comforting lies of my own ideology by demanding the same integrity of data and argument I'd demand of someone advancing a Republican talking point.

It's very easy to slide into being ok with censorship. My base desires *want* to ban CTH and T_D. I am biased that way so I fight those desires the best I can until I have the data and argument that means I can no longer push against my biases.

&gt; I genuinely don't get why people calling for murder

Again, I'd need to see examples before I comment accurately but I have no problem with incitement to violence being removed. Free speech has never covered yelling ""Fire!"". This isn't even a question. I'd just need to know the specifics to ensure it wasn't uncharitable interpretation, systemic and and admins had been warned about the way the speech was being interpreted if it was at all unclear.

I'm completely happy to be proven wholly ignorant of the extreme extent of what was tolerated with a dump of horribly violent discourses that were completely condoned or propagated by admins. I'm not defending them, I'm just saying I want the data before I give my full throated support.

Also, I'll just add, /MoreTankieChapo increased their subs by 37% in the last day or so from 17233
to 23607 so.. Is pushing those Chapos into a more extreme sub that calls CTH ""larpers"" not radicalizing?",1593561675

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in LGPE and Sw/Sh:

1. Do not discuss trades over PM or chat. This is prohibited by [Rule 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_4_-_do_not_discuss_trades_privately.), as scammers often contact other users privately to avoid having their actions seen in public. Please report anyone violating this rule to the moderators. 
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner are using, it is important that you double check that you have paired with with the right person.
3. You must have been granted [Poké ball](https://i.imgur.com/XgAhEXa.png) level flair or higher (10 or more approved trades) to make trades with shiny or event Pokémon. If you have sufficient flair and are trading shiny or event Pokémon, please make sure that your post and other users’ offers contain the full details required by the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pokémon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report them so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

In addition, once you're done trading in this thread, you can mark your thread as closed by commenting `[close]` as a top-level reply to your post to update the flair and let others know you're not looking for further trades. This is completely optional and you don't have to do it if you'd like others to continue to offer trades in this thread!

It's the matter of the post, to make a great deck in modern, great again. But you can get the political phrase or not getting it right at all.

The best build seems the one showed short time ago in Starcity vs which you can fight on YouTube, but they are not veterants with the deck so others options can be taken into consideration. Adding a green splash can add strong cards for side but boy sure if for maindeck. 
Also testing on cockatrice, x mage or online would help a lot. Bazaar is very good but I'm doubtful about 3 drop who does to bolt and with the cost of splashing blue but is such a good effect that it needs to be tested.

"religion","t5_2qh39","I was probably around your age when first started to seriously question religion. I'm nearly 25 now and still question religion, but with curiosity and interest rather than in fear at this point. I don't currently practice any particular religion (though I have interest in Judaism and may convert one day) but would describe my religious beliefs as [pan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism)([en](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panentheism))theism, [agnostic theism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic_theism), [ietsism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ietsism), or [ignosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignosticism). In short, I believe in God or a higher power of some sort, but I don't pretend to know the specifics. However, there are a few premises I have about this God/higher entity: 

1. All of existence is either part of Them or a product of Their creation. **Defining ""God"" as the mind that determines the course of existence, there is a piece of the divine in everything,** since everything can affect other parts of existence. 
2. **God endowed us with the gift of curiosity and in particular curiosity about Them.** If God did not want us to question Their nature or existence They either a. would not have made us curious or b. would not be worth worshiping. If it is the case that any doubts, questions, or alternative forms of worship lead us to Hell, then God is cruel and cruel entities are not deserving of worship. So, the God worthy of my worship wants us to question Their nature so that we may become closer with Them. 

So, at least to my mind, learning is a form of worship. You can learn from the Bible, from Christianity, Judaism, or any religion, from the secular world, the natural world, what have you. As long as you are seeking understanding and connection, a God worth worshiping won't smite you. 

There are many, many people who have questioned religion, and many who have written on it. Since you are seeking God through Christianity,  there are great number of thinkers that have perspectives that may interest you. Some famous Christian thinkers include [Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo), [Boethius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boethius), [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes#Religion), [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal), [Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas), [Pelagius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagius), [Erasmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus#Beginnings_of_Protestantism), [Kiekegaard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard), and [C.S. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis). There are even more Christian authors whose works are resonant with Christian themes despite not being about Christianity in-and-of-themselves. For instance, *The Lord of the Rings* [has many Christian themes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themes_of_The_Lord_of_the_Rings#Christianity) as, though he was opposed to the overt allegories of his friend Lewis, Tolkien was a devout Catholic who often thought about the nature of God.

The thing with religious beliefs is that its very unlikely that any two people who even attend the same church have the exact same ideas about the nature of God. Millions... Billions of people follow Christianity, but they obviously don't all believe the exact same things. So while your version of Christianity may differ from your parents, if you believe in Christ's divinity (or perhaps, at the very least, his teachings) you have no less a right to call yourself a Christian than your parents do. Further, if you decide you're not Christian, what you *are* religiously does not need to be anybody's business but your own. If you decide you want to become a part of a religious community, you can always wait until you move out from your parent's home to formally convert or join a group.",1593561675

"MGTOW","t5_2sjgc","&gt;I like that story because I feel like there's something to it. How genuine is a good deed, if it's done for the purposes of gaining reward in the afterlife, is it not a mere business investment then? 

That genuinity of it is left up to Allah, in Islam. You can call it an investment if you like, but think of this. You can't see God, you can't hear God, and you can't talk to him either. We are just here in this world, and for Muslims they are told to believe in the book called the Quran. Disregarding everything that is written in the Quran, wouldn't you say that there is no guarantee that there is even a God on the other side? So, considering these factors the chances of such an investment to fail are incredibly high, afterall you have no one's word for it except what is written in the Quran. So, if someone disregarding all these factors decides to pin his hopes, his faith, and all his dreams on to God, and doing everything with the intention of being rewarded by God, despite there being no guarantee of your actions ever being rewarded. You could even consider such an investment foolish. Thus, I dont think that anyone has the right to call such a person's actions ingeniune, other than God himself. Because, afterall everything the person does is to please God, so that whole matter is between nobody except that person and God. God himself will judge whether that person's intentions were really genuine or not.


&gt;From what I've seen, it's fortunate if people care about their children, even more fortunate if they care about their partner, but to expect people to care about strangers, that's too much in most cases. So, do religions ask for dishonest behaviour? 

I think this saying from the Prophet of Islam perfectly answers your question:

""Actions are according to intentions, and everyone will get what was intended. Whoever migrates with an intention for Allah and His messenger, the migration will be for the sake of Allah and his Messenger. And whoever migrates for worldly gain or to marry a woman, then his migration will be for the sake of whatever he migrated for.""

Hence, no matter how many good deeds you do, how many people you help, if you have alternative motives, I.e. to show off. Then it will all be in vain, as it will not be counted as a good deed.

This verse from the Quran says the same thing:

""Allah will not call you to account for thoughtlessness in your oaths, but for the intention in your hearts; and He is Oft-forgiving, Most Forbearing. "" [2:225]

&gt;You say that it can be a blessing in disguise if one is ugly, because then one won't be tempted by being lustful. About this, I've read something in a hungarian piece of literature, called ""traveler and moonlight"", quite famous. The main character talks about how ugly nuns are disingenuous, because allegedly they sacrifice their lives for the sake of serving god, as they do not whore themselves around out of lust but help the poor/sick/orphans or whatever, but aren't their sacrifices disingenuous, if they didn't have the actual opportunity to behave that way in the first place? Would a genuine, honest nun not need to be beautiful, because in that case, she's actually sacrificing something? It's like how a weak man proudly proclaims that he doesn't engage in physical violence as it's beneath him. Wouldn't it be more genuine and honest for a strong man to claim that? In other words, if you do not do something that is considered immoral, you not doing it can be because of your virtue only if you actually have the opportunity to commit that allegedly evil act. 

Alright the 1st thing you should know about God in Islam is that he knows everything, he knows the past, the future, what you would do in hypothetical situations, he knows everything. This is what Muslims believe. Now taking that into consideration, all of it goes back to the intentions of a person. For example, currently, I personally don't know what I would do, if I suddenly gained a lot of money, I do have plans of my own, yes. But I don't know for certain, whether I would still give money to the poor (as it has been written in the Quran). Or would I hog the money for myself, and spend it as I see fit. Afterall I won't know, unless I am put into that situation. But, God will reward me for my intentions (if my current intentions for both the present and the future are good), and he will not reward me if my intentions are bad (however in this latter case God will not punish me, as I have not committed what I had intended to do yet). That is because of God's mercy.

In the Quran, God has said that he won't punish a person for the things they have not done. So, as long as the intention of a person, while refraining from a sin is not because ""I am not popular with women, so I can't get them anyway even if I wanted to"", but instead ""I won't sleep with women whom I am not married to, because God has commanded that in the Quran"". Now, if that same person is thrust into a room full of women for over a year, would he still remain faithful to his wife? These things only God knows, but God will not discredit the person's earlier sincerity, if that person is actually put into that situation and happens to commit adultry. So what matters is, your intentions for the present, I.e. ""I will never cheat on my wife"", by never means, not now, nor in the future. If a person honestly believes that and has that intention, then God will reward him for it, afterall God knows even the deepest secrets of man. And as for boasting or showing off, these are one of the acts that God hates, hence whether it's giving charity to the poor or helping a poor person, if a person does these deeds to show off, then that act would be counted as a sin. This is why in Islam, Muslims have been recommended to do these things in private. Because the main intention is not to please anyone except God. Hope I answered your questions. 

I just want to affirm that I am in no way an Islamic scholar, however, I genuinely believe  in all the teachings of Islam, and that it is the correct religion. So, there may be things that I may not be able to explain to you well, so please don't take my own inability, as proof as to why Islam is flawed. I 100% recommend you to research about Islam yourself, if you have any questions. I myself am answering your questions using the things I have learnt through my own research about Islam. Anyway, if you do have other questions just privately message me on Reddit (as I am worried our conversation is taking a massive amount of this comment section).

I think it's safe to say that a vast majority of Americans would react very strongly and negatively if this happened in America. 

But I'm genuinely curious what the method of thinking is with European lawmakers; how do you balance the humanitarian act of letting refugees in while keeping your voters happy?

We aren’t talking about a super tiny town. Silver is actually a progressive community, compared to most in Southwest New Mexico. People from all over the country go to Silver to retire, on purpose. Silver City itself is just a small college town. There are no secret groups that run the community. No “Three Kings” or wild pagans or Illuminati. There aren’t any saloons and the streets are paved.

I mean, maybe I’m wrong, but it’s a lot of data you’re passing around, mostly on WiFi (for an iPad) unless you use weird expensive external connectors....

Assuming there is only one switch for the fan, the red is the power/hot/coming into the switch box, and the black is the hot wire to the ceiling box (based solely on the black wire in the ceiling). The white neutral wire must be tied somewhere other than in the switch box. Confirm if the on/off slider switch can control the fan.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/afp5f1/negatively\_gearing\_with\_a\_dssp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/afp5f1/negatively_gearing_with_a_dssp/)   


I guess I want to know where te ATO draws the line on the definition of ""genuinely for income-producing purpose"". From general consensus, if you genuinely expect the company/trust/ fund to pay dividends/ distribution but they decide not to, it's still considered an income-producing purpose? However, if you make a conscious decision not to receive income when given the choice (participating in BSP/DSSP, buy gold trust), then you cannot claim the tax-deductible?

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","&gt; I did have some issues with the book because some of Verity's actions seem driven more by humor than sense.

I'm a massive fan of Seanan McGuire, but this sort of thing is definitely my biggest issue with her books.  All too often, major characters (particularly antagonists) feel like they are acting in order to progress the plot instead of actually trying to advance their own interests.  Like, there's one example (not in this book) where the big bad legitimately wins everything that they wanted offscreen without anyone even realizing that anything happened at all, but the big bad's attempts to ""shut up"" mcs that didn't actually know anything forced the mcs to keep digging and eventually resulted in the mcs taking down the big bad.  Like, dude, you won.  If you literally just didn't do any of the stuff that actually happened onscreen, you would have been completely fine.  But since you did do that stuff, you lost.  Good job.

But yeah, overall, seanan mcguire is great fun.  I highly recommend her books overall, even if I like to nitpick this one aspect.",1593561678

"LeopardsAteMyFace","t5_3jp3p","&gt; Isreal literally calls itself the national home of the Jewish people. It has laws that treat Jewish people differently from others particularly surrounding citizenship. Ethno nationalism plays a huge role in it's domestic and foreign policy and it is engaging in apartheid. It's an ethno state. 

Israel is a state for Jewish people. But it does not (by law) oppress any Muslims, Arabs, Christians and Druzes that live in Israel. The whole point of the country is - Jews need a homeland. They've been hunted down literally since the first day they existed. Nothing changed. The world will treat them again and again. If not for Israel, history will repeat again and again. And about the Apartheid, I forgot to address this earlier but Israel is not an apartheid state, literally I have Muslim friends going to my school, Muslim doctors, Muslim workers and way more. And for some reason Gaza and ""Palestine"" don't have Jews there, I really wonder why.. Why does Israel have better human rights to Muslims than Palestine could ever offer? This is a good question, if Israel wanted to treat Muslims as lesser, it would've. But it doesn't. The whole conflict is not even about that, it's about Gaza specifically. That's the only place with Major problems.

&gt; None of this is even touches on the fact that Israel is constantly colonizing the west bank and engaged in apartheid. Nor is it relevant to the point that being anti Israel is not being antisemitic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you really think there's even a problem at the west bank though? I went there. I am actually going there again in 3 days ( I am not really allowed but I can pretend to be Russian so I can go to some places). People there live seriously well, they are happy as well. Besides all the terrorist posters I've seen there (Like Yasser Arafat), they aren't the main conflict. Okay now about my point - I am not saying every anti Zionist is anti Semitic. I am sure you aren't. What I am saying though, and hear me out correctly please, is that this issue has so much attention to it, and it has to do with the fact that it's surrounded by Jews. The thing is, I don't care about the attention, nor the criticism, I am just explaining to you why this conflict is even so popular in the first place, literally Syria which is sharing a border with Israel has hundreds of thousands of casualties and NO ONE seems to care, at all. That is actually sad. No one cares when it's the same race of people killing each other, it's only bad when it's those damn Jews. Again, don't mislead my point for being anti Israeli criticism. My point is the nature of this conflict outside of Israel. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Israel tends to depict many of these Palestinians as terrorists but much of the rest of the world doesn't categorize them as such the way Israel does. A big part of the reason for this is the fact that Israel is generally the overall aggressor here. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That is highly untrue. The majority of Gazians support terrorism. If you don't believe that they are that violent you can just read about the 2 intifadas. Also, the reason Israeli casualties are way lower is because Israel knows well enough how to defend itself. Literally almost every year Gaza shoots rockets at civilians, luckily Israel has invented the Iron Dome which protects us and let's us live. Most terrorist attacks look like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/hf062i/video_of_the_ramming_attack_yesterday_near_abu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) though. Therefore, Israel has less casualties. I just want to know if you realize that Hamas, and a huge amount of Palestinians are calling for the ""death of all Jews"" right? While Jews are no where near as radical.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They are constantly pushing people out of them homes, relegating them to a smaller and smaller area, contributing to impoverishment of their communities and brutalizing it's citizenry. The entire conflict is a tragedy obviously but to try to paint Israel as a good guy here is laughable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Israel has pushed Jews out of their homes as well, what's your point? Even tho the west bank is a better place to live in than Gaza, it is still run by a terrorist group, as well. Why should Israel tolerate that? Why should Israel try to treat a terrorist run territory fairly when it's so dangerous to it's own citizens. And about relegating them to a smaller and smaller area, please, for the love of god, read about our past offers. It started of as 50% 50%, and became way more in favour of Palestine later, all rejected by Palestinians. Why? Because they don't want a state, they really don't. They never did. What they want is for Israel and  the Jews to get out of there, or die.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; ""There are problems elsewhere so the apartheid here isn't a problem."" Get the fuck out of here what a terrible excuse. Yeah a lot of countries have a lot of problems. We can care about those and this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like I've stated before, that wasn't my point. I am not against anti Israelis because of that, I am just explaining why this argument, having so much attention is based around the fact that it involves Jews. Please do not twist my words like that.

"infertility","t5_2saej","Here's how mine was:

The night before I took an Ativan they prescribed before I went to bed. I woke up at 5:30 am and showered. Took the second Ativan they prescribed and 2 extra strength Tylenol as instructed at 6:30 am. Was at the clinic at 7 am. Chatted a bit, got walked through everything once last time. Changed into two gowns - one covers the front and has a deep scoop neck and the other covers the back. They put in my IV and ran saline. They had me go pee. I came back and sat in a comfy chair while I wanted to be taken in. My husband provided his sample around 7:15 and was brought by to say bye to me before having to leave the building. By 7:30 I was on the table. They played nice music and everyone introduced themselves. We had met before but with the surgical gowns and masks on it was hard to tell who was who so that was nice. The lab folks were new to me so it was nice meeting them. I got into position flat on my back with my legs in some very comfortable stirrups. They were different than normal stirrups. They were like fancy boots for my legs. They put a sensor on my finger, sensors on my chest, and started my IV meds. They have me Fentanyl and Midazolam. I was awake for the procedure. It didn't hurt at all. I felt the pokes but they didn't hurt at all. It was the same on the pain scale as if I had been made of marshmallow and someone poked me like the Pillsbury Dough Boy. It was super crazy weird and cool to be able to feel it all. I was very stimulated and at one point they had to push on my abdomen to access something in my right ovary. I didn't feel any pain. It was like I was awake and conscious but also like I had had several glasses of wine. It felt really good. I think I fell asleep for a bit closer to the end. When it was done they took off all my sensors and I walked, with assistance since I was loopy, out of the room and sat in the chair. They took out my IV and I sat in the chair for about 15 to 20 minutes and they monitored me while I came down from the drugs. They told me my husband's semen assessment details for his sample (we have MFI). They told me ICSI was starting immediately. They had me go pee again and tell them if I was bleeding. I didn't bleed. I changed and they walked me out and handed me off to my husband. We drove him and when I got home I slept for a few hours, woke up, watched TV, then slept for a few more hours. I didn't have any pain. It's been 5 days and I got my period today exactly like they said I would. The period SUCKS. It's crazy heavy and I have cramps and I'm miserable about having to use a pad. I can't have anything in my vagina for 2 to 3 weeks after retrieval - that means to tampons or penis.

Good on you for trying to get help in dealing with it, for yourself and for him.
When my depression was bad, I was numb, which some people think sounds awesome. The really bad stuff doesn't get to you, you don't stress... However, you also don't feel like a real person, because you don't feel anything. Every feeling, good or bad, just floated on past me and I couldn't grab any of them. No matter what anyone said to me, it made no difference. Anti depressants for a few years and learning to recognise my own symptoms and think positively to turn myself around, is what made mine manageable. My grandmother on the other hand, her depression made her inconsolably sad. Like, sobbing for entire days on end, not even being able to leave the house level sad. She was on anti-depressants for 40 years and they barely made a dent. Getting a job after my grandfather passed away helped a lot, but she still has bad days.
The main thing that helps in my family is that we talk about it. There's no stigma attached to mental health in my family. ""I'm down the tubes/a hole"" is a common phrase for us to share when we're all texting each other and ""you're not going to top yourself, are you?"" is a common response. Not meant as flippantly as it sounds, but it makes talking about mental health stuff so much easier when you know there's no judgement/shock, just love and support.",1593561681

 I'm 31 weeks today, so I still have about 8 weeks to go.  I feel like I am a little bit better prepared mentally for my numbers to go up and play catch up with Insulin as the pregnancy goes on.  My Dr. is also putting me on NPH (?) insulin to help with fasting and breakfast numbers. 

I am meeting with a new dietician next Monday! the previous one I met with twice was very little help. It felt like such a waste of money. I hope I can get a better sense of what I've been eating that makes me spike and when/how I can experiment with different foods.

This week I've decided to cut out fruit in hopes of keeping my numbers managable, and also help tracking carbs and amount of food. 2100 calories without carbs is really, really hard for me to eat! I'm lucky if I can get 1600 on most days.  In the first couple weeks I lost 3 pounds, and I've lost one more in the last two weeks.

I hope with insulin I can start adding some more calorie dense foods so I don't have to eat as much, but still get some more good nutrition.",1593561681

My grandparents have a home on a lake near my parents' house. It's not where they live, and it only occasionally gets used - mostly if my cousins are in town or my grandparents are entertaining.  

Since I've been living at home recently and things have been cramped between my parents and two siblings, I decided to start using it as a hook up spot. That way we don't have to worry about getting too loud or hiding from my parents. It also works out better anyway because usually we are not one and done. We'll have sex, relax and then start again, and that's not possible at either of our homes.  

Using my grandparents' home turned out to be a great idea. The lack of stress has made things more enjoyable for us and we've been taking out my granddad's boat and having some fun on the lake. 

My grandparents know I use the house, and they are fine with it. They even gave me my own set of keys and told me to make myself at home, but my parents didn't know I'd been using it. 

They showed up one day and walked in on my girlfriend and I while we were completely naked and she was giving me oral. I don't think I've ever felt as sick as I did in that moment - the embarrassment of get caught like that combined with the surprise. 

My parents were furious. They told me I'd turned my grandparents' home into a ""sex den"" and should be ashamed of myself, but I tried to defend myself. I told them that my granddad had said if I wanted to bring over a ""lady friend"" I could. 

I think they are being assholes about this, but they feel the same way about me. AITA?

"Tekken","t5_2s7yn","Paul is a bit ""slower"" in the sense that his versions of generic pokes (df1, magic 4) are slower than true pressure pokers like Kazumi, Law, or Shaheen. So trying to outpoke those characters is a losing effort.

Deathfist and Demoman are pretty slow as far as moves in jab range goes (15f startup). This means that you have to set them up with frame advantage, otherwise the mixup loses to faster moves. Moves for this purpose include f+1+2, qcf+4 (aka ws+4), 3, b+1,2, b+2, qcb+3,2, 1 and 1,2, df+1,1. Also, because of the Clean Hit property on both moves, Paul's best range is that jab range. Your ideal situation would be conditioning an opponent to duck after specific moves, or in a specific situation, so that you don't need to mix them up and can just deathfist them right away.

Paul can be played both offensively or defensively. The former depends on the above moves to set up the mixup constantly. Naturally, that doesn't work well against people who can out-poke Paul. Playing Paul defensively amounts to block punishing with 1,2 and b+1,2 and going in with a mixup, rinse and repeat, and whiff punishing with deathfist.",1593561681

"DragonballLegends","t5_h1zup","&gt; You know that if they do dedicated servers you are more likely to lag even if you have good internet than now 

That's not the case at all, p2p is way worse for lag than dedicated servers. Your scenario comes from the idea that there will be barely any servers set up if they do move to dedicated. And that would only be the case if they skimped on servers, which would defeat all the effort of setting them up. 

&gt; I’m pretty sure dedicated servers also mean that we will only be able to have one nickname 

No clue where you got that idea from whatsoever.

&gt;Toshi at some point in a vids and stuff already stated they have no plans for a dedicated server

Why does it not surprise me that the devil himself refused this idea. Oh yeah because it would mean spending some of that immense income that DBL generates to actually improve the gameplay. Scamco wouldn't be pleased there. 

&gt; People really only lag because of themselves 

No. Just no in every way possible. P2P lag is out of your hands if the game sets you up with someone far away from you. It is neither players fault in that scenario. Of course there are times when it is purely one player's connection, but even then 1 of the 2 players in that match has nothing to do with the lag he's now experiencing. 

&gt; but that only happens once in every 20 games

Enough for 8

**Ingredients**

* 1 soft roll, cut into small cubes (or 2 slices white bread, without crust)
* 1/2 cup whole milk
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 3 cloves of garlic, minced
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1/2 cup Kraft Natural Shredded Cheddar Cheese plus 1 1/2 cups for stuffing
* 1/3 cup chopped parsley
* 2 eggs
* 1 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 1/2 lbs ground sirloin
* 1 1/2 lbs ground chuck
* 14 slices of bacon

**For the glaze:**

* 1/4 cup ketchup
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar

**Instructions**

**Make the glaze:**

1. Mix all the ingredients in a small bowl. Reserve.

**Make the meatloaf:**

1. Pre heat oven to 350F degrees.
2. In a large bowl, combine the bread pieces and the milk. Let it soak while you work on the veggies.
3. In  a medium skillet, heat the olive oil and sauté the onion and garlic  until softened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Reserve to  cool.
4. Once veggies are cool, add them to  the soaked bread and then add the parmesan, cheddar, parsley, eggs,  Worcestershire sauce, mustard, chili powder and paprika. Using a fork,  mix until evenly blended.
5. Add the meat and  season with salt and pepper. Using your hands, mix everything just until  combined. You do not want to overwork the meat or your meatloaf will be  dry!
6. Turn 2/3 of the meat mixture into a  broiler pan and, with wet hands, pat the mixture into a loaf  (approximately 9 by 5 inches). Press the center in, creating a rim  outside of the meatloaf and fill the inside with the remaining cheddar  cheese. Then, add the remaining meat mixture and gently close the gaps,  pressing the sides to seal in the cheese. Use your wet hands to make  sure the meatloaf is smooth!
7. Brush the loaf  with the glaze, then arrange bacon slices over the loaf, overlapping  them slightly and tucking them under to prevent curling.
8. Bake the meatloaf for 1 hour and 30 minutes or until the bacon is crips and the inside temperature is 160F degrees.
9. Cool for 10 minutes before serving!",1593561683
"Unemployment","t5_2qvh2","The $600 FPUC applies to claims (through July 25, 2020 in California) for regular UI, PEUC, and the EB they're working on rolling out now (and PUA too). So right now, someone could theoretically receive at least 52 weeks of benefits depending on when their claim started (26 weeks regular UI, 13 weeks PEUC, at least 13 weeks EB). The EB is automatically triggered in CA when the 3 month employment level reaches a certain threshold.

From the government guidance:  
""**4. Basic Qualifications and Temporary Changes to EB Program Requirements.**

a. Basic Qualifications for EB. EB is payable only after exhaustion of PEUC and other UC as explained below. During the period that PEUC is available, an individual must have exhausted PEUC entitlement before commencing receipt of EB. To qualify for EB the individual must have:

*   exhausted all rights to regular UC under state law;
*   no rights to regular UC with respect to any UC law of another state or Canada;
*   exhausted PEUC;
*   wages in the base period (with respect to the regular UC claim that was  
exhausted) that includes one of the following: (1) 20 weeks of full-time covered employment; (2) wages higher than 40 times the individual’s most recent weekly benefit amount; or (3) total wages in the base period equal to or greater than 1.5 times the highest quarter (see Section 202(a)(5), EUCA);
*   no disqualifications that would prevent the individual from being eligible for EB (see Section 202(a)(4), EUCA); and
*   at least one week in the benefit year that begins in an EB eligibility period (see Section 203(c), EUCA).

1. Temporary Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) Payment for Weeks of EB. Section 2104 of the CARES Act provides for a $600 supplemental FPUC payment each week to eligible individuals, including eligible EB recipients, for weeks of unemployment beginning after March 27, 2020, and ending before July 31, 2020. *See* UIPL No. 15-20.""

The power didn’t come back that night, or the next day, or the day after that. It was on the third day that it came back on. (I did run my generator for a bit on the first day before we left so I don’t recall how many hours of not running there were.)

Sure, I agree.

But when someone makes a fem presentation that fits the cis style, *and* calls it presenting feminine *and* wanting to do it all the time, but at the same time they say they don't want to be seen as fem, how do you call that?

In my head someone agender would never get closer to what they're trying to run from. And if it's about conquering it, then it's a different attitude, a non-conformist or something like that, that needs to be added to the agender stuff, because that's the opposite of an agender attitude (even if it's only towards presenting).",1593561686

Keep in mind that US Thermos and German Thermos aren't the same companies. I like how easy it is to open, but closes tightly when you screw on the cap. Well, in the end the lid is only one of many aspects on which a thermos will prove itself. And regarding the dents: it might suck that they can't handle it well, but always keep in mind that your thermos is only then really yours when it has an individual scratch/dent somewhere. It reminds you of the personal connection you have with it. I once was on top of a tower and lost the cap, it fell some 20 metres, and I deemed it lost already.

Did I? Or is the common usage section at the top where you can see it without scrolling?

&gt; when in reality, I’m not an agent provocateur. I don’t work for an organization. I’m a registered Democrat, for fucks sake. 

Ah, so you're hung up on the whole ""agent"" part is that it? Would it help your feelings if I just called you a provocateur? I still think it was fitting being that you volunteered on behalf of r/conservative. But no, you're right, its not like they were employing you to come here an make an ass of yourself. You did that for free!

&gt; My coming on here in the manner I did was to highlight the stupidity of  the members of this community by pretending to be one of you and  inappropriately labeling the OP from [r/Conservative](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/) as a racist to show exactly how easy it is to get you silly little fuckers on a “FUCKING BIGOT” train. 

This must be that projection thing conservatives are so well known for. ""Watch me get the members of this hive-mind frothing at the mouth just like our ours does!"".

&gt; Unfortunately, I commented elsewhere in the thread and outed myself. 

Are you sure it wasn't that you posted that comment in the very thread this post was referencing? lol

&gt; I can’t believe you actually wrote this out and thought “got him”. God damn what a failure the school system is.

I didn't have to insert the swab far at all and the head of the Qtip is thinner than the Qtips you would buy at the store. There was no discomfort, if anyone is worried about that.

I've had a steady dry cough for about five or six days now. It's not unusual for me to have a cough like this but as a precaution I figured it was best to get tested. Results take 2-5 days.

I've heard different things about the accuracy of tests. Unfortunately, it's hard to know what to trust right now so I can really only go with what I'm told.

 Nah, just come outside and completely expose yourself. I don't think he could argue (to me anyway, not sure what their local laws are) that he was scared for his life/only had the weapons out to protect his family, when he could easily go inside where there's more cover and less protesters. Even though he's still on his property, bc he left his house to brandish his gun, that makes me think he just wanted an excuse to shoot someone.





 If it were me, it'd be: family inside behind as many locked doors as possible with one of the two firearms, while I'm either with them or one room in front of them with the other firearm. 





 Both of them coming outside, her having bad trigger discipline, and both of them having terrible muzzle discipline, makes me thing neither of them have any kind of training whatsoever. And that scares me more than the protesters.





 Edit to add: I guess I skimmed over you saying they were outside having dinner, so to slightly alter my point/clarify: that means they either went inside to get the firearms, then came back outside (which also points me to the conclusion that they just wanted an excuse to shoot someone), or that they were just having dinner outside with their rifle and pistol (which I find extremely weird), and then instead of going inside, chose to pick up the firearms and sweep them over a crowd (which brings me back to the ""they clearly have no training and are more of a danger than the protesters"").",1593561689

When my Grandfather was a young man - mid 1930s or so - he was renting a house for his young family. By the back door, the landing before coming inside was an enormous slab of rock. Norway has lots of rock (but, according to my father, built an opera house with stone quarried in China. I don't know why). Stone was a common building material back in the day - and useful today, I'm sure.

Anyway - that slab had been there so long that the decades of people walking across it had hollowed out the center a bit, allowing a puddle to form when it rained; a puddle would subsequently freeze. He had a mini ice rink right outside his back door. Obviously not an ideal situation.

So, one day he got ambitious. This was a big slab and lifting it was no small feat. Still, the way he figured it, with a pry bar some leverage, a bit of rope and a little help, he could probably flip that thing over and get years worth of use out of it yet. Sure, he was renting, but slipping around outside the back door sucked.

So, one weekend that's what he did. He enlisted some help and went to grunting. They did get that slab flipped over. The other side of it was more hollowed out than the (recent) top had been.

Just how many years had feet been walking across that one piece of stone, I wonder? I wouldn't be surprised to hear that if you're talking about a big slab of granite, we're talking about hundreds of years.

I love that town.

I know those big buildings to the left are the Olympic buildings put in place for the Winter Olympics of 1994. 

I have a similar picture from a road closer to Mjosa - a fair ways downhill. And lots of photos of the walking/shopping street. I have trolls in my cabinet, one I've had since the early 1980s, once since 2004 (my youngest daughter's....I'm holding it for her).

One of the best days of my life was the day I boarded a train from Brumunddal to Lillehammer and spent the day by myself (all the family left behind - solo time for me) wandering about that town. There was a diner there that had great fiskekaker, potatoes &amp; gravy &amp; vegetables. It was just down the road from the Birkebeinere statue - [that building across the street - the gray one if I remember right, but it might have been the red brick one. So long ago](https://exviking.net/man/large/lillehammer.htm).

The thing that shows the devs don't play the game is the fact that the gameplay and events are designed like shit.

The devs think everyone has crappy weapons and no ammo, so they create events where like 10 enemies spawn and you have to beat 5 waves.

When in reality every fucker in this game has some bullshit overpowered build/legendary that will one shot anything in the game so every event is just some guy waiting on the spawn point for those enemies, one shotting all of them instantly, and then waiting afk for a minute for the next wave to respawn.

If the game was designed with them in mind, if the devs actually knew how fucking powerful most players were - we'd have events with 100+ enemies at this point that are actually fun and challenging.

Fun fact, (they didnt show it),but the 'instep' to jam is put into this technique for 1 reason. 
  
It brings the attackers head down. So when you are doing this in panic mode, it's so well designed ed for the natural human body, that even the barely trained will time it so the head comes down, just as the elbow comes up into the nose.  
  
This technique was designed to remove you from holds and disable the attacker.

What about the Romans, the Chinese, the Arabs? They built their empires through dialogue? 

I’m not saying all historical figures are morally equivalent. I am saying that generally speaking figures from medieval and ancient history at the very least deserve the benefit of the doubt of the context of the time period they were living. 

Genghis Khans legacy is literally immense. It affected so much you can’t even imagine. Even the Iranian currency sub-unit of “toman” is directly from Mongolian influence (Genghis organized his forces in “tumens” which were units of 1,000).

Water is moved up a trunk via tracheids, the diameter of which shrink in size the further up a tree you go. Taller trees are also more likely to develop embolisms, which further constrains their maximum height. As per this, the tallest a tree can grow on Earth while still looking like a tree is roughly 140 meters. Extremely tall for a living organism, but nowhere near what you want.

One way to increase the size of a tree might be to lower a planet's gravity. This means less comparative pressure is required to drive water up the trunk before the tracheids funnel it too thin.",1593561691

I'm experiencing [list a few main symptoms], and with my diagnosis of celiac disease in March, I'm worried that I'm not absorbing my oral iron supplement enough to improve. Would you be willing to prescribe an iron infusion and help me develop a plan to address these concerns?""

I recommend both requesting the IV and putting a plan together to address the issue in the long term. An infusion won't fix the root cause of the deficiency, so it's important that you have a plan for how you'll handle things until the root cause has been identified and addressed, or until the damage heals.

However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can.

Ter pessoas atestadas com covid numa fábrica, não necessariamente imputa que o foi produzido está contaminado

Você sabia que existem mais de 100 que exportam carne pra China.
 
Por exemplo o mato grosso, em que a incidência está relativamente baixa comparado com outros estados.

Sem falar que isso só mostra a diferença entre um país que faz estrito controle sanitário, de países que não fazem.

Vide a África, e a peste suína do fim do ano passado.

Quantas vezes você ouviu falar de abate de dezenas de milhões de animais aqui no Brasil?

Repito. Testaram as carnes aqui antes de embarcar e não encontraram traços de Coronavirus

Testaram na hora do desembarque e também não foi encontrado traços de Coronavirus.

Fora isso a própria Oms já afirmou que não existem evidências que o Coronavirus possa passar de alimento pra seres humanos.

Se a oms não for suficiente. Tem a Anvisa que afirmou a mesma coisa.

Fora a Anvisa. Tem A EFSA que é a agência sanitária da Europa.

Não tem nada a ver com ser malvadão ou não.

Agora estão afirmando uma coisa que não tem nenhuma evidência e você simplesmente comprar como verdade, beira a inocência.

Se está comprando como verdade
Já parou de comer carne? Se não é seguro pra eles, tampouco é pra gente.

Ah. Pare de comer frutas e legumes também. Já que é impossível não ter um lugar que não exista algum trabalhador que não se contaminou

E em relação a água? Encontraram traços de Coronavirus em esgotos. Vai parar de usar banheiro também?

I can see how the stuff being now may seem anti-white. I honestly really do. But I was born in the countryside to Chinese immigrants and just ask for a little understanding of what some of my experiences were/are.

I did my time, deployed to Afghanistan, am an EMT on the side, but work directly with COVID research. If it weren't for my skin color, I'd probably be the epitome of the American dream (parents had nothing but 100 bucks coming to this country).

And yet, about 97% of the land in the US is rural, and I'm legitimately weary of traveling there (my hometown included). When someone starts throwing racial epithets, I don't know if it's going to escalate to violence, I don't know what ground I should stand to defend my dignity, I don't know if there are others that are like minded (it is the country). These are all things I have to deal with everywhere but a handful of cities and suburbs. And even then, those places aren't necessarily safe for me to walk without the chance of harrassment for being Asian (I dont even have the defense of being a different type of Asian, I'm Chinese so the fears of COVID and the Communist government have stoked that divisiveness. And the rhetoric purported by the President doesn't help either).

I joined for a lot of reasons but partly because I figured if I was a Marine and deployed to Afghanistan, I'd have earned my place in American society and nobody could question it. But I've realized, that no matter what I do, I will only first be seen as Asian and not in a positive way.

I dated a German (straight from Germany) girl and she was hyper critical of the US (honestly part of why we broke up). But if me and her were to walk anywhere, who would people gawk at today or be told ""go back to your country""? Maybe not as much in the 3% urban/suburban areas, but in the 97% rural bumfuck country, you can't tell me walking down the street she'd be harassed more than me.

I remember distinctly when I was about 5 or 6 (some sort of after school program) the whole eyes thing. That's the first time ever I realized that my differences were something to be ashamed of or something that's mocked. There's a point in every minority's life growing up they'll come to that. While the white people their stories from what I've heard have been framed around their differences and accepting others, ours have always been how to deal with others dehumanizing you.

But hey, these are only a handful of examples. PM me if you want more man",1593561694

And I remember Firefox developers changed a few releases away the click to select on the address bar to match Windows behavior.

I don't understand why this was left out since is another thing that could be easily done to match the Windows behavior and not have people like me who try it and see that it doesn't work thinking there is some Linux problem.

1.Join solo lobby and set the closest spawn to the casino

4. If you see that youre not getting it, pull off the Ethernet cable and confirm till you enter the story mode. The earlier you pull it off, the better, but you have ""plenty"" of time till it saves. Near stoped still worked for me

5. Connect to social club and join solo lobby again (loads faster)

A tip. If you can use controler in PC, try to use it. There is a way to ""aim"" with the wheel. Dont know how efective it is, but maybe works better!

Typically the deductible is double that of in-network and the reimbursement is usually 50% or lower. Also that reimbursement is of the usual and customary charge, not whatever the therapist bills. 

For example, if the UCR for counseling is $75 and your therapist bills $125, you would get reimbursed based on the $75 value, not the $125. Only $75 or less will accumulate to the deductible. 

Out of network claims are commonly reviewed and audited, and this is somewhat common of an occurrence. If you are not prepared to pay the full bill rate of your out of network provider, you should seek in-network care. 

This has nothing to do with the pandemic, they are adjudicating claims based on the contractual terms of your plan.

"ajpw","t5_3f5xa","The belts were beginning to fall apart because they were never updated from the original 3 titles. Motoko wanted to preserve what was left of the originals but let them keep the Triple Crown name and make a belt combining the likeness of the three belts. The timing of it and her return right after Shiraishi left is interesting but things were kept nice in the press. The 2013.08.25 Suwama vs Go Shiozaki match was the last defense with all three titles.

They have all the trademarks and got the old deals so they do share the same lineage even if it is technically a new company, or at least owned by a new parent. Sometimes people will get technical and say Baba's AJPW technically died or shut-down six years ago. Some marketing played on that like this 2015 brochure which says [""1st Anniversary""](http://img20.shop-pro.jp/PA01298/605/product/94353604.jpg?cmsp_timestamp=20151009202716) but they no longer do that. Not sure what Shiraishi still owns, if-anything.

Also yes he worked a public punishment in the undercard of the show with Suwama vs Go but it's not as interesting as it sounds. Chono &amp; Doering looked deflated working with him and it ended with an STF. [Here's an article about him screaming being stretched by Fuchi in-training](https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/167540/) and another of [The Gear](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505175918978007073/707898504156020778/EXaEpyAXQAAL04j.png) he wore in the match.

It might be that more of the missile might fall down with it as part of the heavy metals used to increase kinetic energy with the explosives, so the total weight of the object falling may be more than the 2 ton warhead. The speed might also be *much* higher than Mach 10, since the article only says that it's *higher* than that. For instance, South Korean media initially reported the speed of the Hyunmoo 2 series as over Mach 4-5, but the actual speed at impact is around Mach 7 like the Iskander missile. That would increase the kinetic energy significantly.

Right now I personally think that it's more likely that the real kinetic power would be about 10t-20t of TNT, which is in line with kinetic bombardment.",1593561695

"economy","t5_2qhpn","""Masks are a double-edged sword,"" the president told The Wall Street Journal in a recent interview. ""People touch them. And they grab them and I see it all the time. They come in, they take the mask. Now they're holding it now in their fingers. And they drop it on the desk and then they touch their eye and they touch their nose.""



What a joke, people touch a lot of things and then touch their face.

If anything, even disregarding the potential it has to stop you from infecting others or vice versa a mask just like gloves gives people an extra psychological barrier to cross before doing something like touching their face.

E.g: ""Oh, I just took of my mask or gloves, I should probably wash my hands now.""

Or: 

""Oh, I was about to touch my face to scratch an itch but I saw my gloves and remembered why I'm wearing them, touching my face with them is probably a bad idea.""


Et cetera.

People don't consiously seem to think about when they touch their face, but every single time I'm out and about with a mask / gloves I can stop myself before I do it because of the hard to ignore reminder.


I can't think of any other words for what he is doing except for ""dangerous"", ""unethical"", ""pathetic"" and just straight up ""dumb"".


He could be saving lives yet chooses to promote the opposite.


Hope people find the common sense to not blindly follow this ill-given advice and take whatever precautions they need.

It's not just about you or wether you're part of an ""at risk demographic"".

You come into contact with people in ""at risk demographics"" on a probably daily basis and you taking steps to protect you and them can quite literally save lives.

If you read about htem you'd easily understand why. It's easy and free. For example, ebola. Very deadly, the problem is it kills people before they can spread it, and the symptoms are very obvious

Covid 19 on the other hand, has a 2 week period where you may be shedding but are symptom free.

The traits a virus needs to wipe out tons of people are: highly contagious, long incubation period, eventually deadly. bonus points for mutations that make vaccine development difficult, and symptoms that look like other, lesser diseases.

Ran into some missionaries in the park and I got so excited because this secular sally was excited to talk Mormon history until I remembered that they wouldn’t know/believe the cool parts.  So when they asked me what I found so interesting about Mormon history all I could say was, “I find it interesting that a church that was defined by persecution and judgement would persecute their LGBTQ+ members.”

Silence...  Until one guy stepped forward and offered the idea that it is gods one true church lead by imperfect people.  Then I had to hold my tongue and not snap back “then why call then prophets” 

When they asked for my info I told them that I believed the idea of attending church is antithetical to religion because you should feel free to commune with God anytime you feel the spirit and not just in specific places at specific times but I appreciated that they were passionate young men who believed in something and that passion is important.  

Anyway they offered to pray for me and I was like “hell yes gimme that free prayer” because who am I to turn my nose up at free prayer!  While they prayed for me, in my head I pretended I was conducting them like an orchestra...

However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can. COVID-19 is still a very real threat, not only to you, but those you love and everyone around you as well!

&gt; Regarding the last question, i'm asking this because in every debate about prostitution basically the anti are saying ""they sell their body it shouldn't be allowed"" and the pro are ""they just provide a service"".

The problem with that is most of the people debating that have no experience, no real information, and no business trying to dictate our lives. 
Ultimately, it's human interaction for a price, which is inherently unique. It's not just a service, and its absolutely not selling our bodies- you gain access for a price, within certain constraints, if we decide we are ok with that. 

&gt; read some topics were a bit shocking (in my opinion) with an escort explaining how she was proud that she made her client cum with her hand in less than 5 minutes while he booked for an hour and denied him another round. 

Link? Thats not great in my opinion, but its not a scam. Just the particular sexual experience that happened. Scam is really not a good word for that. 

&gt; I've also checked a reviews website explaining this kind of behavior was the main reason behind the creation of this kind of websites.

We fucking *hate* those websites, the men who use them try to extort unsafe or free services using those sites, and are generally entitled pieces of shit. They are a poor representations of escorts and clients- lots of those are straight up lies, and most of the original creators of those sites are in jail for one reason or another- the creator of the most famous review site tried to have an escort killed.

In a Homebrew world I'm building, Orcs, Goblins, and Hobgoblins are all related and their green skin is specially adapted to not give them sunburns (protects against solar radiation). Their primary habitat is plains and their skin also helps them to blend in with their native terrain.

Similarly there are different versions with different colorations that are adapted to different terrain:

**Wetlands:** Worcs, Woblins, and Hob Woblins. These might have a swim speed.
 (The unofficial name for wetland/river Goblins would be Roblins :)

**Mountains:** Morcs, Moblins, and Hob Moblins. These would have cold resistance.

**Desert:** Dorcs, Doblins, and Hob Doblins. These would have heat resistance.

*As a side note, the plains orcs highly detest to being called Porcs, and so that name has largely been dropped*",1593561698

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in LGPE and Sw/Sh:

1. Do not discuss trades over PM or chat. This is prohibited by [Rule 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_4_-_do_not_discuss_trades_privately.), as scammers often contact other users privately to avoid having their actions seen in public. Please report anyone violating this rule to the moderators. 
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner are using, it is important that you double check that you have paired with with the right person.
3. You must have been granted [Poké ball](https://i.imgur.com/XgAhEXa.png) level flair or higher (10 or more approved trades) to make trades with shiny or event Pokémon. If you have sufficient flair and are trading shiny or event Pokémon, please make sure that your post and other users’ offers contain the full details required by the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pokémon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report them so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

In addition, once you're done trading in this thread, you can mark your thread as closed by commenting `[close]` as a top-level reply to your post to update the flair and let others know you're not looking for further trades. This is completely optional and you don't have to do it if you'd like others to continue to offer trades in this thread!

Then tell her what exactly bothers you about the idea of marriage right now. Again, make sure you introspect so you know the nature of the fear and so it’ll be easier to communicate. I’m sure she’ll understand. My guy and I had this conversation the other way around in April—we started out as fwb and ended up in a long-term relationship last year and this year I kept having the feeling that I liked him more than just a now-boyfriend so I told him, hesitantly and haltingly, but nevertheless out there and it worked out!

I have a question though, I just got “cycle day 21” labs done (7DPO) and got a result of 6.4ng/ml (equivalent to 20.4 nmol/L) for progesterone level. This appears to be within the reference range they gave on the results but on the low end, and I’m getting mixed messages from googling. Can anyone put this in any kind of context for me?

They attempt to interpret and align things in the original booklets to a more 'usable' form, but that interpretation and alignment does away with the magic that makes OD&amp;D special, namely the gaps and inconsistencies that both allow and force a table to create their own take on how the game is played. 

The wonderful thing about OD&amp;D is that in never really tried to be a complete set of rules as we know it today. It was a loose guide that focused on the things that might be contentious in play as opposed to outlining an entire procedure of play, and that sets it apart from every other system I've seen. It sparks creativity and imagination in ways that other systems don't by virtue of what's left out. If all you want is a consistent rule set based on the OD&amp;D tables and crunch...I dunno, pick one. They all probably play fine.

In short, I think the attempt of authors to make those original documents legible and usable by people not willing to dive into the originals guts the source of the things that really makes it unique and creative.",1593561699

If they actually wanted to play Saliba they could've done, but it seems they are more concerned about money that they aren't even entitled  to.

I'm sure we'll make it clear to Saliba that we wanted him to play the final, but ASSE prevented it by asking us to pay them 2.5m. We aren't in a strong financial position and 2.5m is worth more than a year of Saliba's wages. You're right, it's not about being kind to ASSE, so why does our revenue mean we should be paying them a fee for no reason? It doesn't matter if they ""need it more"".

"DarK","t5_2qj1h","&gt;The biggest plot hole, in this clusterfuck, is how come Claudia breaks the loop? If we have two loops going back and forth into infinity. What happens to Claudia that she figures out how to break it. And if one character is able to get new information inside those two loops, then they are not loops, plain and simple. Her breaking the loop would make sense if every loop is a bit different than the other, and all the small changes will once contribute to a larger one. 

In another thread, someone gave an in my opinion reasonably compelling explanation for this particular issue: it's not only that the two parallel loops are the result of a split (there are two Jonases and two Alt!Marthas, and in either case one of them rules his/her own reality while the other dies in the reality of the other); but the loops themselves as a whole are in a quantum state: Claudia simultaneously *does* and *does not* kick off the events that lead to breaking the loop; and this may only happen at the moment of the apocalypse. In the reality where she is successful, the loop ends because Jonas and Martha are sent back to the original timeline and save Marek and Sonja. In the reality where she doesn't, everything begins anew.

In other words: the setup of these two intertwined loops is always 100% identical and infinitely repeating, except this singular element. And if we want to go full Schroedinger's Cat on this interpretation: the same way the probability of the cat being dead once you open the box increases; the same way Claudia succeeding becomes more and more likely.

[This](https://old.reddit.com/r/DarK/comments/hiojnm/what_an_absolute_clusterfuck_of_an_ending_how/fwillon/) is also a pretty interesting explanation, though (albeit I don't fully agree with it).",1593561700

"islam_ahmadiyya","t5_da00y","So children in Pakistan were dating back then in class 5. I'd have to call them child couples. Given that the person I am talking about was brought up in a heavily Islamic, with a touch Ahmadi, training, I have to say that it might have influenced his response to the school culture.

What did you find disrespecting in the passage? What vitriol are you referring to?  If respect means that I cannot explain my concerns clearly, then respect is wasteful. Ahmadis follow Islam, and it is part of Islam that the most disrespectful questions and topics about religion were not considered taboo. Hazrat Ayesha has related several Ahadith that would be considered disrespectful by Ahmadis, and there are Ahadith to the tune that in terms of questions about religion there is no disrespect. The only disrespect is in fundamentalist brains that want to kill people over blasphemy... in which case Mirza Ghulam Ahmed sahab deserved death for blaspheming against Jesus Christ repeatedly.

So you haven't read the books in Urdu and depend on someone to tell you what they are about? You are at a definite handicap then. Ahmadis rarely ever translate work that can shed light on their regressive teachings. However, there are bits... for example, if your mother is a feminist, does she accept that Ahmadis do not consider a female witness as a full witness? Or that a woman can never ever be a Caliph? Or that the share of a woman in her father's estate is half that of a man? Or that the Jamaat enforces strict gender segregation? You don't even need to read the books to see all this in practice. As for reading the books, I can help you out in that... but if you are going to insist without reading up and analyzing the ideology Ahmadis push, then I'd consider it a waste of both of our times.

Interesting. Can you share who in the Jamaat forbade domestic violence? I can share with you that none of the Khalifas take away the Ahmadiyya and Islamic right of a husband to beat up his wife. Must be a local policy to conform with American law.",1593561700

\*\*Type of Bug\*\*: Omen ult exploit 

\*\*Description\*\*: Omen Ult can teleport inside barrels near A site on Ascent.  The barrels are facing the breakable glass.  While inside you can shoot out and kill players but you cannot be seen.  Could completely break competitive games by have an invisible omen killing a team off while they are confused.   Video doesn't show the shots but it was tested with a friend.

\*\*Video/Screenshot\*\*: [https://youtu.be/8YDd8IP0HtI](https://youtu.be/8YDd8IP0HtI)

\*\*Steps to reproduce\*\*: Aim Omen's ult at the corner outside the breakable glass at A site on the map Ascent, the side with the stacked barrels.  From the corner with the barrels, using Omen's ult slowly move away from the corner while LMB and it will teleport you inside the top barrel.  To see shots outside of barrel as second person is needed, as when you are in the barrel it looks like your shots are just hitting it, but even the classic penetrates through.  This only works with his ultimate.

\*\*Expected result\*\*:  Ultimate teleport either on top of the barrels on the ground next to them.

\*\*Observed result\*\*: Ultimate teleport lands inside the top barrel with perfect vision of the area around, as well as being able to shoot out of the barrel to kill players.

\*\*Reproduction rate\*\*: 100%. Worked every single time I tried in a custom game.

\*\*System specs\*\*: Asus Dual OC Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 super-08-Evo, Intel I9-9900k, 32GB DDR4 2666Htz RAM, Corsair MP510 M.2 SSD.",1593561701

Edit: when I come to think of it, you can stream files from a NAS directly in the files app as long as the file type can be previewed within the app. Biggest drawback is that it doesn’t work with MKV.

Edit once more: I just downloaded the VLC app to see for myself. It can stream from a NAS without using the Files app. There is an option to add a file server right in the app.",1593561701

    [vCloud]
    vcd02.XXXXX.XXXX.XXX.xx

Secrets.yml is fine having un/pw how you do now.

running the play at that point would turn into:

Truth be told, you are the one acting out of hostility, because of your preconceived notion that I am a racist.

&gt;Well, your fancy private education taught you yo think along privileged lines

I see you are a fan of jumping to conclusions and assuming the worst. I was homeschooled. Not necessarily a ""private school"" in the way you're thinking. My parents taught me to think for myself and question everything.

&gt; I am working to remove racist systems and institutional racism

What exactly are you doing to fight all this racism, pray tell? Nuking police precincts and terrifying the officers and their families? What about the shop owners whose businesses are in flames? Hospitalizing random people and killing others simply for the color of their skin and how you perceive they're treating you? Hmm.... That sounds familiar. I'm thinking about 300+ years ago. 
Yeah. You're doing a great job. 

&gt; I rarely engage with individuals, because of exactly this....it is just exhausting and has little payback.

I agree with you on this, although I am attempting to broaden my horizons by posting controversial opinions and then discussing them with other redditors to see if there are any points I've missed and to change my opinions if necessary. So far you haven't done too well, but I will make an effort to read that book, because you assured me it's not sensational. 

&gt;Would you choose to change places with ANY person of color? If not, why not?

No - because I'm content with myself, how I treat other people and how other people treat me.
BUT - that doesn't mean I would suffer if I traded places with a black dude. I work with a black dude (sort of) and he's totally fine. I live across the street from where a black dude that's sort of a friend works - single dad, at least 2 kids - he's fine. I used to be friends with a black girl who was adopted by a white family - she's fine. 
I'm not saying there aren't any black people in bad situations, but I will say it's closeminded to think that only black people are affected by poverty and hard times.",1593561702
"homelab","t5_2ubz7","Another reason would be that usually, in the enterprise to mid-grade gear, the fans are oriented to blow air out the back, creating a vacuum that pulls air in from the front/side openings. Most Cisco switches I've had do this, along with the power supply fans. Of course, there are models that do the opposite so you have your jacks facing the rear of  the rack. Check to see if your fans are blowing warm air out the back, if so, I'd recommend rotating it 180 degrees so that cooler air from the bottom is sucked in and exhausted out the top. In a closet or any space that doesn't have good ventilation, this can keep the hardware consistently cooler and also keep dust out as the fans are blowing up. Cheers!",1593561702

*****
&gt; HAVANA - A raft of Cuban dissidents, artists and journalists said on Tuesday that state security agents had staked out their homes to prevent them from attending planned protests over the killing by police of a young Black man.

&gt; The calls for protests on Tuesday were triggered by news last week that police had shot and killed a 27-year-old unarmed Black man, Hansel Hernandez.

&gt; Critics have denounced the government for not holding police to account by launching an investigation, especially given how quick officials have been to condemn U.S. police brutality, with extensive coverage in state media of the Black Lives Matter protests.

A hard day for a worker in the store is very often standing for hours or lifting heavy boxes when stocking, on a double shift because management messed up the schedule, in very hot or cold temps (depending on whether they're in the freezer or the stockroom), hungry because they had to skip their lunch because a half hour isn't long enough to eat and run the errand they need to do.

I’ve struggled with these types of feelings and haven’t made much progress myself. But, the two things that have given just a little relief is social-distance socializing (zoom happy hours, 8ft backyard hangs, etc) and forcing myself to answer honestly when people at those hangouts ask how I’m doing. I tend to keep it in because of my position and because I don’t want to put it on other people, so when I decided to try being honest about it, I surprised myself with how a tiny bit of support goes a long way.

Also, at work, we got sick of venting to each other pretty quickly for the reasons you of shared, so now we check-in often and ask for a positive and a negative, or a struggle and a win. Adding some positivity to the discussion gave us something to celebrate with each other and also made us more comfortable sharing a struggle sometimes (because it’s not all about it all the time).

It just immediately descends into accusations of bootlicking and juvenile insults without a single instance of rebuttal.

There isn't a single piece of evidence used to convict him that didn't have glaring flaws in it.

A sexual assault nurse examiner test on Ligons, who claimed Holtzclaw forced her to put his penis in her mouth “for about 10 seconds,” (because that's how blowjobs work /s) came up empty for Holtzclaw’s DNA. Sex-crimes detective Kim Davis explained away the negative SANE results by noting that Ligons had told her that Holtzclaw “did not ejaculate.”

But in the police interrogation video, Davis had warned Holtzclaw: “Do you understand that you don’t have to full-blown ejaculate to get something out of the SANE exam?…We can get skin cells. We can get pre-ejaculate. We can do all that and still get DNA.”

Davis pressed him: “Did your penis go in her mouth?” Holtzclaw firmly answered: “No. It did not.”

The forensic evidence backed up Holtzclaw, not Ligons.

She claimed Holtzclaw forced her to put her hands on the hood of his car during the stop. She also alleged that he put his hands on the roof while purportedly assaulting her as she sat in the backseat as he stood on the rear passenger side with the door open. Extensive fingerprint and DNA tests all over Holtzclaw’s vehicle — again, just hours after the alleged assault — also came up empty.

The forensic evidence backed up Holtzclaw, not Ligons.

The women he's convicted of assaulting also include:

–Sherry Ellis, who testified under oath at a preliminary hearing that her attacker was “black” and short (Holtzclaw is light-skinned and 6’1″ tall), and who could not identify that attacker as Holtzclaw while he sat in the courtroom.

–Tabitha Barnes, who described Holtzclaw as “dark-skinned” and had not reported any inappropriate behavior — until a sex-crimes detective informed her about the Holtzclaw investigation, supplied her with a date and she changed her story. Barnes testified positive for PCP on the morning she testified at trial. She had also ingested hydrocodone and marijuana.

–Carla Raines, who denied seven times she had been the victim of any inappropriate police conduct — until a sex-crimes detective informed her about the Holtzclaw investigation and she changed her story to claim that he had forced her to expose her breasts.

–Terri Morris, a drug addict diagnosed as a “paranoid schizophrenic with depressive features” who couldn’t pick out Holtzclaw from a line-up and described him as having skin with a “dark color,” either “Indian” or “Irish” or maybe “white” and in his “thirties, forties, I don’t know, fifties.” She also misidentified Holtzclaw’s patrol car, told the investigators to “leave me alone,” and called their questions “bulls—.”

–Shardayreon Hill, who had been rushed to the hospital in December 2013 at the behest of Holtzclaw and his assisting officers after she crushed a vial of PCP in her mouth and spilled more PCP on her skin. Hill called police in September 2014 alleging Holtzclaw had sexually assaulted her — only after the Ligons allegations went public and only after she faced felony charges for destroying evidence and intent to distribute PCP.

–A.G., a 17-year-old girl who excitedly told her mother that Holtzclaw was a “hot cop” with whom she was going to go on “dates.” She came forward to allege that Holtzclaw vaginally raped her — but only after her mother was contacted by sex-crimes detectives who told her in advance she may be a victim of police abuse and only after her mother searched the internet for news and a photo of Holtzclaw.

All of these women have something to gain from a false accusation, either by reducing or eliminating their charges, for monetary reasons if a lawsuit is successful, or simple revenge against their arresting officer.

The discovery of A.G.’s DNA on the crotch area of Holtzclaw’s uniform pants was touted as the prosecution’s “smoking gun.” But the skin cells were derived from a minuscule sample that measured a billionth of a gram and this “evidence” continues to be brazenly mischaracterized. In closing arguments, prosecutor Gayland Gieger falsely asserted that the DNA came “from the walls of her vagina” and “was transferred in vaginal fluids.”

But the State’s own crime lab expert admitted on the stand that no testing was done to establish the presence of vaginal fluid on the pants.

“The only thing I can tell you is it is a biological material that originated from” the teenager, Oklahoma crime lab analyst Elaine Taylor testified. “(H)ow it was put there or how it got there, I wasn’t there, I didn’t see what happened so I can’t really tell you exactly what happened.”

As Wright State University biology professor and president of Forensic Bioinformatics, Dr. Dan Krane, a leading DNA expert, emphasized, indirect “transfer is a well documented and real possibility.” Yet, no testing was conducted anywhere else on the pants to rule out this phenomenon of secondary or even tertiary transfer due to casual interaction such as a handshake or other indirect contact. (Holtzclaw had searched A.G.’s purse.) Nor were the pants fluoresced or tested for other body fluids.

Furthermore, prosecutors failed to note the presence of at least three other sources of DNA on Holtzclaw’s pants, including an unknown male’s — a glaring omission now being raised on appeal that further bolsters the innocuous transfer theory. Prosecutor Gayland Gieger sneered at the transfer DNA phenomenon in closing arguments, again in direct contradiction to the State’s own crime lab expert, who acknowledged under oath the possibility of secondary transfer and its extensive documentation in peer-reviewed scientific journals.

Excerpt: 13 Women Couldn't All Be Lying: Investigators and the public frequently point to the sheer number of similar accusers who all had seemingly similar accusations. This seems pretty damning on the surface and was exploited to the fullest in the local and national media headlines. However, the similarities lose their punch when you realize the only reason the accusers have the same profile (black females with a history of drugs and prostitution) is because those are the only people investigators went out looking to interview. Additionally, as supported by the audio recordings and police reports of those interviews, investigators told the women up front (and even told their family members and loved ones) that they believed they may be a victim of a sexual assault perpetrated by a police officer they had contact with in the recent past. This, even after the allegations against Daniel and his face had been shown on the news. If you only interview women who fit a particular profile (that you completely made up) and you tell individuals up front what type of information you’re looking for (inappropriate sexual contact) then you’re creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Investigators and the prosecution knew their case was only strong if they piled on ‘victims’ – even if those ‘victims’ allegations were shown to be lies.

More Accusers Shown to be Uncredible than Credible: The public has been told of the 13 Daniel Holtzclaw accusers that resulted in criminal charges. They are even often referred to as the ""OKC 13."" What the public hasn't been told is that there were actually 21 accusers in total and that 62% of all accusers were found to be not credible. That's right, 8 of the 21 total accusers were eliminated almost immediately because they claimed to have been assaulted after Daniel had already been placed on administrative leave and had been relieved of his badge, gun and patrol car. Most of whom later admitted to police they lied. Of the 13 remaining accusers, 5 were not believed by the jury and resulted in acquittals. Eight plus 5 equals 13 women who either eventually outright admitted they lied or were dismissed by the jury. Thirteen of 21 is 62%.

The above doesn't show, by itself, that the other ones were lying, but it does show that it is not difficult at all to easily find multiple women who are willing to lie about sexual assault in a highly publicized case. Having multiple accusers doesn't increase the likelihood of guilt.

A rundown of some other problems with the conviction

As for the example you gave:

At a base level computers work on 1s and 0s. Computer processors take in values and do things to them based on other signals it gets. Obviously it is super hard to program complex things when you're just working with 1s and 0s. 

Programming languages are a way of making it easier to write code. Its a short hand for the computer. And when you compile the code (prepare it for the processor to use it) the computer takes apart to code and turns it into instructions the processor can understand.

Object oriented programing is how some higher level programming languages work. They're higher level short hand. a way of organizing things. The object oriented part basically means that when your programming you push things into lots of boxes.

You have a box of your program that handle date calculation, another one that handles financial transactions. And in those boxes you have smaller boxes that do littler things. So in the time keeping box you may have a special box that just calculates leap years.

That's probably way over simplified, but i hope it helps on the sort of visceral understanding level. I'm only programming literate haha, not an expert.",1593561705

Hi /u/littleredsmut!


Your submission was removed per Rule 4:

&gt;####RULE #4 - NO UNVERIFIED OC

&gt;* Do not post yourself unless you are prepared to verify with us.

&gt;* Don't post or claim to know someone in the photo unless you can verify permission to post the photo.

&gt;* Don't post someone you know from Facebook or Instagram or any other social media platform. If we find out, it violates this rule.

#**PLEASE NOTE:** New and low karma accounts cannot be verified (See rule 8 of the subreddit rules). If you've only been on reddit for a short time, have low karma, and/or you haven't done much NSFW self-posting on reddit, you'll be asked to build up your posting history for a couple weeks before verifying here. Posting nudes isn't for everyone, and we want you to ""get your feet wet"" by posting in some smaller subs before you jump into the deep end of the pool.

---

[Please message the Moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmateur&amp;subject=Verification%20Request) with proof that:

`A.  You are actually the girl in this photo`

#**-or-**

`B. You can verify that you have the girl's permission to post this photo.`

**Any further submissions by you, without verification, will result in a ban.**

---

#**[\*\*READ THE FULL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS HERE\*\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amateur/wiki/verification)**

#Verification must follow these simple rules:

Please provide `3+` photos of yourself, from `3` different angles, holding a paper sign with your user name, today's date, and /r/Amateur written on it.

* The paper should be crumpled and smoothed, yet still readable.

* Your hand(s) should be visible holding the sign.

* Shoot the pics from as wide an angle as you can manage. Photos cropped in close will be rejected.

The photo does not have to be artsy or nude, but please show as much of you as possible. If we can't match the body depicted in your verification pictures to the body in your past and future posts, then it's not a meaningful verification. So while you do not have to post your face, we do need to see a good amount of your unclothed/clothed body.

---

Thank you for your cooperation!

I became the AM at my training store after 3 months as MT. When the AM at the time was promoted as manager at another store, it became pretty apparent that I would become the new AM. The full-timer, who had been with the company for almost 8 years, showed a little animosity toward me. He had been completely cool with me before all that. However, I somehow balanced the line of being a friend and his boss and it didn't take long before he started showing me respect. The previous AM seemed to belittle him a lot. About 14 months later, he became AM at another store in the district and about 8 months after that, I followed him as his manager. He was thrilled to have me be his boss again. I think the key was being a friend and a boss. I would delegate to him and respected his knowledge and wouldn't overly criticize the little things.",1593561707

"neverwinternights","t5_2umg9","Looks simple enough. Allow me to add a few suggestion.

Ignore all the rogue skill except for UMD and Tumble. (and maybe just get search to 10). You do not need to use up all your points. They can be left unused, and dump into tumble and UMD whenever you level as rogue. Since warrior gets so little skill points every level, it is really hard and not worth it to level the other rogue skill. There is no special item to pickpocket from. You can bash open 90% of chest and door with a weapon that have elemental damage. There are a max dc of trap to disarm and set if you do not have the required level of rogue. For those high damage chest traps, just shot at them with some elemental arrows to avoid being hurt by the traps. You can also leaves a couple of points every warrior level to dump into UMD and Tumble during rogue level.

Your best bet is to max discipline. Trust me, as a melee fighter, YOU WILL NEED discipline. Else you will find yourself constantly on your backside from knockdown or constantly losing your weapon from disarm. Put points into taunt as well whenever you level as paladin. It reduces opponent's AC as well as gives them a % of spell failure.

You do not need to start with such a high strength. There are tons of strength items in the game. And there are a lot of potions. Do not hoard the potions, use them as you find them. Trust me, you will finish the game swimming in potions.

Starting with 14 strength is enough. If you are playing with paladin level, you should actually start with 14 in Charisma. Paladin have divine grace, with allows you to add charisma bonus to your saving throws. This is a godsend for warrior, who usually have low reflex and will save. With 14 Cha, you will have a permanent +2 to all your saving throws. At later levels, when you get a stronger version of the gnome ring, that will become a +6. Don't you want a +6 to all your saving throws? Don't forget, Cha also adds to your persuade, UMD and taunt roll.

Taking 13 Dex solely for dodge is not worth it. You will get plenty of dodge bonus from items. (there is a max limit as well for dodge bonus, the most anyone can stack is +10) Dex 12 is more than enough for someone who's gonna run around in heavy armor 90% of the time. You will get reflex bonus from your Cha anyway, and since you aren't gonna level your rogue skill anymore, Dex can largely be ignored.

Level 3 paladin gives you cure disease, which is pointless since you are already immune to disease. What level 3 paladin DOES gives you is, turn undead. Of course, your turn undead DC will be useless since you only have 3 level (which is equal to 1 single level of cleric). But, if you take Divine Might (you have one extra feat now since you didn't take dodge), you can now add your Cha bonus to your melee damage for a short time. Just note that Divine Might requires you to first take Power Attack (which you did), and it is only available for paladin. Thus take paladin during a feat giving level. (6,9,12, etc)

Don't take exotic weapon, it's a waste. The normal weapons are more than enough. You can forge a +1 halberd with sonic damage in chapter 1, with the upgraded version a +4 with sonic damage and stun in chapter 4. If you go shield and sword, you can forge a +1 morningstar that slows opponent, and can be upgraded to +4, slows and deal cold damage in chapter 4. (you do not need to keep the original weapon to upgrade. Any magical +1 version can be used) Also, the second expansion have a Holy Avenger longsword.

p.s. NWN:EE do not requires special stats to multi class to paladin. Only requires at least 11 in Wisdom if you START as a paladin.",1593561708

I'd incorporate weight lifting into my workouts, not  just cardio. 

If you don't want to work out and lose weight purely by diet, I'm just going to say you should eat HEALTHY, maintain reasonable CICO and take it slow!

The basic instructions that make up what a GPU can do are pretty much the same whether the card is labelled for gaming or compute. Each generation improves how quickly those instructions are processed, sometimes add new instructions, and have different quantities of compute ""cores"" and memory to accommodate various power demands. Other than that, there is very little difference between the ""consumer"" and ""pro"" cards under the hood. There isn't even that much difference between the ""pro"" and ""consumer"" drivers, as they can be used for each other's cards and offer very little difference in performance and features.

Our backyard is next to a daycare's playground which is separated by a 10ft fence. My (21M) dad (55M) got mad at the daycare next door because the kids sometimes accidentally throw balls into our backyard from their adjacent yard. They throw about one ball over every few days on average. My dad wrote a letter to them and demanded that they remove the balls from their playground so they don't come into our yard. Our backyard is relatively big, and the part that they throw balls into is only about 1/3 of our yard which we rarely use. There's nothing in that part of the yard other than grass. We don't have any pets or anything that could get hit by the balls either. I asked him why he would make such a demand, and he got angry at me. He said ""because it's my property!"" and said he didn't want to have to throw the balls back over. He's healthy and has no physical problems preventing him from throwing them back over. I told him he was a bad person because, while it might be in his right to make such a demand, he could be taking away the fun of many children without any real justification at all. Am I missing something? Was I too harsh?

*****
&gt; Researchers have discovered a swine flu virus in Chinese pigs that may be able to jump to humans and are sounding the alarm for another potential pandemic as international public health experts still struggle to contain the coronavirus.

&gt; Chinese and British scientists found that the new virus, G4 EA H1N1, shares characteristics with the H1N1 virus that caused the global pandemic in 2009.

&gt; Researchers analyzed nearly 30,000 nasal swabs taken from pigs in slaughterhouses in 10 Chinese provinces and another 1,000 nasal swabs from pigs with respiratory symptoms from 2011 to 2018.The new virus was detected in 2016 and its antibodies were present in workers who handled the pigs, indicating that they may have been infected by the virus at one point.

It is true.

&gt;how come those voters went to the AfD and not die Linke, who for decades have had the economic platform you blame Merkel for not having?

Because voters are stupid, and don't make the right decisions when Democracy hangs in the balance, like it increasingly does.

History proves that.

Without a great, inspirational leader like FDR, who implemented EXTREMELY generous social programs and VERY, VERY high taxes on the rich (marginal top tax rates over 96%!!!) in order to ""save Capitalism"" (and was very nearly rewarded with a Coup D'Etat led by the treasonous leaders of the ""Business Plot"", who started trying to buy arms to equip a rebel army of disgruntled WWI veterans to overthrow the US government and institute a Fascist regime to replace it- Bush's grandfarher among the plotters: https://www.npr.org/2012/02/12/145472726/when-the-bankers-plotted-to-overthrow-fdr) democracy tends to self-destruct, *specifically* because idiotic voters usually swing to the right, towards Fascist/Nazi/Authoritarian ideology, rather than towards the left, with Democratic Socialism (and when they *DO* move left, they gravitate towards its most Authoritarian, extremist ideologies- such as Communism) in times of crisis like this.

This is true of non-democracies as well, by the way.  Russia became a Communist state when the status quo simply became *unbearable* during World War I, because they were *already* a Monarchy, and that made shifting towards right-wing Nazi-like ideology less appealing (because they could already see that right-wing ideology wouldn't help them any: Monarchies are *inherently* right-wing institutions, hence why in America's early history it was the conservative parties which were friendliest towards the British Empire...), so they swung all the way to Communism instead (had they stopped at more moderate Democratic Socialism, instead of extremist Communism, history would have turned out very, very differently...)",1593561712

"TigerKing","t5_2frea4","Honestly you probably haven't been watching alot of animals in the wild and their babies. There is baby abandonment, and killing of their own too. The actual mother may not always be the best mother. And the fact that Tigers are solitary creatures and don't really hang out with their family after a certain age. I think you are over-dramatizing how cruel this is to the Mother Tiger. Tigers are loners in the wild and they don't stay together as a family. As for handling of a Tiger cub, I would say it's like domestic cats. That's why you raise it in a human home to get them used to handling. 

A big cat, like a domestic cat, can be happy in a home with very little space, as long as they got food and water. Tigers in the wild starve for days and don't know when their next meal will happen. I just read today that tigers in Indonesia are all getting poisoned to death in Indonesia. Because they are attacking the farmers livestock. They do not have a better life in the wild at all. IF they are, they would not be going extinct in the wild. As for the space that Joe had for the Tigers. It's a zoo and not a Safari. The cages are USDA standard approved. What more does he have to do? 

You ever heard of John Varty who houses his Tigers in the Safari of the South African Wild? His tigers keeps constantly get hunted down by poaches, despite his high electric fences and security to keep them out. He even had his tiger die, because one poacher darted one of his tigers and his other tiger killed the darted tiger. 

By Joe's own explanation, he said that for the cubs survival, it is safest to take the cubs away from the mother as there are plenty of snakes in that region that could kill the cubs and he has lost cubs to snakes in the past. I have seen videos of Joe treating snake bites on adult tigers in his zoo. 

The point is, if you put two animals together, and they naturally mate. Who are you to say it's unnatural? 

It's their choice if they want to mate or not.",1593561712

If for some reason your skill is not transferring well, you can start at the bottom by learning Lili or Lucio, they are the easiest healers to play.

One of the issues you will encounter in HOTS vs League is that lanes are not static, you will be expected to rotate more frequently than you're used to. Some maps have a ""watch tower"" in the center, which is basically like a free Ward, these are often (but not always) the best place to go to at the start of the game. Otherwise you should basically just go mid and see where the action takes you. On 2 lane maps, there is usually a solo laner and the healer isn't it so just go with the rest of the group.",1593561714

Personally I think your chaos res is overkill, I think you can get slightly more life and just deal with ~0% chaos res (plus amethyst flask as needed, such as for Al Hezmin). Most chaos damage is balanced around 0% res, or avoiding the attacks entirely, which you can kind of do with sunder's range.

I think you can do better by getting out of your cluster jewel, and pathing to the purity of flesh notable, which will give you the int to free up your anoint, and make up some chaos resist anyways.

If your mapping is breezy and bosses are the only issue, I think impale is absolutely worth it, some nodes + the support will add a huge chunk of damage. I would think Natural Authority would be the weakest link and can be dropped for some impale. 

I would also drop soul of steel, and use the points for Juggernaut, or see if you can get the Slaughter notable. It's a lot of damage going there and the onslaught will speed up your general mapping.",1593561714

"darksouls3","t5_2w3z3","Both of you are making valid points, and I agree with both. In a nutshell:

1. Yes, there are steps you can and should take to minimize the risk of being one-shot. Not coincidentally, most of these are steps you should take for PvP in general, regardless of whether or not you are worried about one-shots (more vigor, better armor, ToD, etc) - realistically you aren't going to be one-shot until you're over SL 100-ish anyway (unless your vigor is laughably low, and then it is your own fault; a bare-handed riposte can one-shot if your vigor is low enough)
2. That said, I agree that the 1-shot can be quite annoying. It's very frustrating for me to fight a parry spamming host with 15 estus who gets to erase the damage from his whiffs, and then after he's down 12 estus, he finally lands the lucky parry (his 30th parry of the encounter, first one he landed) and end the fight and 'win'. Oh, and did I mention? With estus canceling this type of crappy parry fishing is even more rewarded, since losing health carries almost 0 risk, when you can estus cancel back to full. 

I have special contempt for the pocket dagger, as it does so much damage yet has virtually no carry weight. A dark build with a hornet ring and chaos dagger makes the L2 button too powerful IMO. Yes, ripostes should do a ton of damage. But, I think it does too much and incentivizes this poor parry fishing behavior.

Lastly - the fact that invaders find this feature helpful isn't really enough of a reason. I'd find it helpful to shoot death rays out of my LKSS at gank city, but that doesn't make it reasonable.",1593561714

I don’t know enough about the “Shame on a N***a” guy or how he was treated to have an opinion really, but based on what you said my initial thought is that one must always be mindful of unintended consequences.  There are some people for whom any use of that word by anyone is hurtful, and I think everyone—white people especially—should be considerate of that.  For example, in this very paragraph I felt mildly uncomfortable even using the word masked with asterisks, even though it’s a direct quote of the title of a song.

I would prefer if we weren’t divided, if nobody used slurs regardless of whether they were a member of the slurred group or not, but it’s their word not ours so if they want to use it then so be it.

If you look at companies like Stripe, Lyft, Airbnb, Pinterest they all are valued at well over $10B but have under 10k employees. That means at least $1M per employee. Once they cross that mark, they are a more matured company without much of a competitive edge in terms of compensation.

On the keto diet they talk about ""the keto flu"", where your body is right on the edge of whether it can survive on carbs for brain fuel or if it's starved enough that it has to convert into the metabolic process ketosis. For that reason even if you can get by on 20-50g of carb in keto, they recommend 0-20 during the start (named: induction) in order to not have the body dally on the edge and prolong the carb withdrawl symptoms. 

Seems a similar thing here. I should have more water, extend my fast a few more hours, cut down on fake sugars in order to give my body clear instructions: we are doing this and we're not teetering on the edge of changing a metabolic process, we're doing it.

If you notice stabilization or regrowth and you suddenly get worse, you are probably going through a shed and you may recover over the next few months.

If you want to be 100% certain of your response, take fin for two years. If you steadily get worse over this period and you need regrowth, I would discontinue fin and give up altogether or move to dutasteride.

For caucasian men, in rough numbers, after two years about 1/3 get noticeable improvement, 1/3 get slight improvement that is hard to notice (but measurable), 15% just maintain, and 15% get worse (tho they probably get worse at a slower rate).",1593561717

I'm thinking the OP wasn't aware of being an authorized user, the relative did it when OP was much younger to help OP's credit rating for the future, and the relative recently cancelled the card or became seriously delinquent on it (or even just maxed it out without becoming delinquent on payments).

I see ""healthy,"" ""wholesome,"" and ""nutritious,"" used much more frequently to describe the trend you are talking about.

In any case it seems better to call those descriptors what they are rather than calling them all ""clean."" If you think about it, using that term implies that other food is unclean, and cleanliness certainly is used ascribe moral value in many contexts of our society.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Honestly, I don’t think the House could enforce its own subpoenas, and here’s why:

First, there’s the issue that [there isn’t exactly a way to jail people for refusing to comply with subpoenas from Congress](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/15/how-would-congress-jail-trump-officials-history-says-its-not-easy/%3foutputType=amp). There isn’t really a Capitol Jail, so the options are trying to get DC to jail them or to keeping them in some rooms, but not really jailing them. Either way, attempting to jail people would probably backfire.

Going to court probably wouldn’t work either. They’re in the legislative branch, subpoenaing people from the executive branch. Both are arguably acting in their discretionary capacity as political actors. A court hearing such a case could dismiss it under the [Political Question Doctrine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_question#Origin). Even if the House Democrats won when they filed the suit, they would still have to fight and win at least one appeal. It’s likely that the Supreme Court would grant certiorari and rule on the case, which means they would need to win there as well. Plus, any order enforcing the subpoena might be stated until the resolution of appeals. It would probably take months, if not years, and there’s still a good chance that no one would have to testify unless they felt like it.",1593561719

Instead of getting financial independence, they will be enslaved to their husbands or sold to prostitution.

Do you think they'd be sent to school if they were fired?

Nah, they'd be sent to work in much more dangerous jobs that pay a fraction of what they get making shoes.

But blaming Nike for employing ""slave labor"" is ignorant af. Don't think you're doing any favor to those workers by trying to ruin their livelihood.

Back to McGrath. I'm not sure she  legitimately won the primary and I wouldn't put it past the DNC/dem elites/liberal MSM to have helped rig it for her, just like they have others with smear campaigns, voter supression and exist poll discrepancies pointing towards election shenanigans, but I'm sure they feel if they can't influence people to vote for their moderate/corporate dem, they will just rig the vote if necessary. Afterall, they don't need to provide fair and impartial primaries and the errors and incompetence at polling stations that keeps happening year after year which  tends to hurts progressives and benefit moderate dem, isn't by accident.

"learntodraw","t5_2ub51","This is cool, I like the expression! You’ve got some nice skin tones, I think the main thing that would help improve the piece is a bit more definition in 3D form. Having some reference for the planes of the head open while you’re painting can help you figure out where the form is turning And where to place little shadows to seperate features (google “Asaro head” for a good example).

Some parts like the eyes and teeth should actually be set a little deeper into the head, and would be a little more shadowed - people often don’t realise how thick eyelids and lips are. Eyelids kind of stick out and hang over the eyelids, creating an obvious bottom and top plane between the eyelid and eyeball (see http://www.stanprokopenko.com/blog/images/draweyes/cornea-push.jpg).

One other common thing is you don’t want so much contrast between light and dark on the teeth - it’s really easy to make teeth look grubby If you shade their edges too much - you can think of them almost as a big single block and only create very subtle indications of the lines between them to avoid this.

"tutordotcom","t5_35y5y","This is really interesting! I can't speak to the math, but I've done async for essays for a few years. For async essays, there's no live student interaction, just an essay to comment on (asking questions to help the student as they revise, offering a few suggestions on higher-level stuff, maybe pointing out a pattern of error if it's really getting in the way of readability). It isn't doing the writing for them or editing out all their errors, just leaving comments to help them improve. Sometimes students would ask for help on a specific area of the essay or just send me a prompt with ""i don't know how to start please help,"" but usually it was a mostly-done thing.

For async math, my \*guess\* would be that you'd be sent an assignment or specific questions to either explain how to do/where to start/offer resources (e.g. ""I don't understand how to solve quadratic equations in general can you help me get started""), or you might get sent mostly-done assignments to just look over and leave comments on (e.g. ""I'm a little confused about  types of t-tests, can you just check if I picked the right ones?).

From there, they shoot people from smaller towns and villages with terms such as ""backward, villagers, primitives, fools, idiots ect"".  Celebrities who support the civic platform have a terrible aversion to Poland, they would like Poland to become a member of Germany or the European Federation, every year on November 11 the great independence march takes place in Warsaw, the march is referred as the fascist march and such a narrative prevails among ""progressive Poles  "".  By the time the civic platform ruled, there were still police attacks and escalating violence there, when the ruling party had seized power, no incident occurred.

"mmt_economics","t5_2t76b","Price gouging means that the customer is willing to purchase the item as well.

It's also a continuous rise in the prices.

""Good faith"" Demand pull inflation would seem to arise from competition for \*inputs\*. Competitive markdowns on pricing is one thing, but bidding up the cost of inputs so that your competition can't produce as much is how inflation happens at full employment. The expectation is that a firm may start hiring people from other firms if demand is high. If demand is high overall, both firms may keep bidding up the cost of their inputs without increasing output in aggregate. This is further exacerbated depending on how many workers (people with high MPCs) they're doing this for. If its a lot of highMPC workers vs a few low MPC professionals they pay a lot, the demand may keep increasing as prices and wages increase. The price increase step is hard to imagine even happening at that point. All firms have committed to their wage increase, if they sell all of their products, but the profit margins are not as desirable as they would have hoped, they may raise the price. However, if they don't sell all their output, they may have the mindset to lay people off to cull back investment. (obviously depending on how big the loss is, they're not always going to fire people if they're not getting returns they want at any given time, that would be really sporadic, but if the trend is there, sure). They can also produce unsellable inventory but still produce profit depending on the price level and the amount of consumers willing to accept that price. And there is also an expectation that decreasing the price may result in lower demand. See Veblen Goods. (It's interesting to think about how pricing and class interact. Like, how there are certain goods that only rich people can buy, whereas you could lower the price and sell more units to more people with different incomes, but who's to say that anyone would continue to buy the goods if they stopped being a sign of high class. That's just one facet of pricing, though.)

It's not so concrete and cut and dry in reality as there are many things that firms are considering and hiring isn't all done at once.

There's also the price-wage spiral that could be blamed for high inflation during a supply shock which I would rather take steps to relieve supply bottlenecks before attenuating demand.

So demand pull can be seen as self-imposed cost-push. While cost-push inflation is a conflict for the real income % generated in production. A price gouge isn't inflation. Inflation is a continuous rise in the price level. And we're not even worried about stable inflation. We just don't want an accelerating rise in the price level. You'd think that it'd be easy enough to just say ""hey stop raising prices"" or put on price controls.

But that just may not work depending on the circumstances.

"techsupport","t5_2qioo","You’ll (obviously) need a greenscreen, and I’d recommend using OBS. In OBS, create a new scene. Right-click in the sources boxy thing, and select video capture device. Give it a name and click on OK. In the pop-up menu, select your camera and hit ok. After that, you can change the position of your camera. Right click on your camera and click filters. In the Effect Filters, right click and select add —&gt; Chroma Key. Give it a name and click ok. Now make sure Key Color Type is set to green. If so, you should disappear into the background.

Now, go back to the main screen of OBS and add another source. Here, you can either choose for a display capture (your entire screen) or game capture (with this, you can select any software that is running at that moment. If you select this, it’ll only record that software). 

You’ll also need a mic input. Right click on sources, select audio input capture, and select your mic. Hit OK. 

Last but not least, you need to layer your sources. In the sources menu, the order should be (from top to bottom):

- audio capture
- webcam
- software

You condemn Israel's treatment of Palestinian refugees. As do I. A lot of your points are valid; the Israeli government is playing a detrimental role in the living conditions of Palestinians living in the territories, and this is neglecting their human rights.

Palestine's barrage of missiles hurts the claim that they value the land, and outweighs Israel's negative actions against Palestine. While the IDF targets military locations and ignores the subsequent civilian casualties, Hamas targets Israeli population centers. Considering the number of missiles fired into Israel from Hamas, odds are these missiles would kill (conservatively) hundreds of Muslims and destroy multiple Mosques. It is important to consider that [almost all of Israel's attacks are retaliatory and/or target missile sites/tunnels/arms caches/etc.,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Israeli_attacks_on_Palestine#:~:text=Gaza%20strip&amp;text=2000%3A%20Muhammad%20al%2DDurrah%20incident,September%3A%20Operation%20Days%20of%20Penitence) and I have yet to read about one that targets civilians. On the other hand, [almost all rockets fired into Israel by Palestine deliberately target population centers and are aimed at harming civilians.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel)

We both can agree that Israel's treatment of refugees in Palestine is abhorrent, and there is ample evidence that Israel's loose grip on its own soldiers is resulting in further human rights abuses. That said, I would argue that the Palestine's deliberately civilian-targeted attacks on Israel outweigh Israel's failures to control the IDF.

Also important to mention - you claim that Israel historically belongs to Palestine? How do you respond to the fact that the Quran confirms that Jerusalem was established first as a Jewish city? Historically even Christians have an older claim to Jerusalem than Muslims. [Jews first established control over Jerusalem around 1,500 years earlier than the first Muslim Empire.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem#History)

**Edit: Looking at your profile, I realize arguing with** ***you*** **is like a brick wall. You are a devout Muslim and obviously there is an extreme bias in your argument.

But I just want to talk about the sixth. On March 1,  2014 some extremists from Xinjiang slaughtered 29, and injured 143 at the train station in my own city, and I was just miles away. This is all over the news and I’m sure you can find it. Six years later when I tell people I’m from Kunming they still ask me about where I was when that happened and if I knew anyone injured or tragically killed. These re-education camps help those people know how they can make a living decently in a modern world, and of course western media will report this as concentration camps. Did they report that we Chinese eliminated a whole desert? If Uyghurs are discriminated against or in real trouble in my country, how come one of our hottest stars is a Uyghur?

We are sensitive about the bias of ml as ml researchers, especially these days, and it should be evident to us that media bias is real and huge. When we make ethical or critical claims, we should at least consider both sides of the story.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Those numbers don't support you at all. Look at them as a ratio of number of kills per capita, and you'll understand what people have been saying. Black people only make up 13.4% of the population, whereas white people make up a whopping 73.6%. If you take those numbers in your stats page and measure them against these percentages, you get some really dismal results.

[The US Census from 2019](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219) had the following statistics:

328,239,523 total population 
-------------------------------- 
- 250,446,756 white, or 73.6% of the total  
- 43,984,096 black, or 13.4% of the total  

If we pair that to your statistics from 2019, we get the following data:

- 250,446,756 white, with 370 police killings
- 43,984,096 black, with 235 police killings

If you calculate the number of police killings per 1 million white people and number of police killings per 1 million black people, these are the results:

- 148 per million white people  
- 534 per million black people

That's over three times as many black people killed by police, per capita. Now do you understand why your numbers don't tell you the whole story?

Edit: originally, I represented these with a total for the four years' worth of police killings. I've edited it to only include 2019, as that matches the year of the census.",1593561725

We met when I went to college for a semester and he simply showed me that I wasn't cut out for the working life. He has graciously provided a house and food for me and only asks for me to take care of it and him. His work has always put him under a lot of stress, and I don't want to add to it. He can get a bit angry and shout at me when he's really stressed but he doesn't actually mean it. And when he super stressed, he stays out of the house and comes back at night or the next day after he's cooled down because he's being considerate to me.When he's not angry he is very affectionate but it mostly depends on his work. I don't go under nearly the same stress he does so I don't really have the right to judge him. I love him very much and he means the world to me.

However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can. COVID-19 is still a very real threat, not only to you, but those you love and everyone around you as well!

&gt; The new strike capability will be acquired to defend Australia and its allies against a number of threats as part of the new strategy, which focuses the nation on protecting itself and its allies in the immediate region of the Indo-Pacific.

&gt; Some lesser defence contracts will be cancelled to save money for the new weaponry, but experts are bound to question the adequacy of the new budget promises.

&gt; The release of the new defence strategy comes after the government announced on Tuesday Australia&amp;#039;s chief cyber defence agency would recruit 500 new staff under a $1.35 billion package.

It appears you’re new to the sub, so I’m here to help you out.


First, if you haven’t already, please [check out the rules of the sub for buying and selling.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pmsforsale/comments/fd49zd/meta_please_read_before_posting_rules_v30_the/)


Second, although it isn’t a rule, new sellers and traders usually ship first to **established** members, or they use a trusted middleman such as /u/spockdad. Then after receipt of the items, they’re then paid. I want to stress the importance of established members only. 


If you would be willing to do this, I suggest editing your post to let everyone know.

This month they've closed 4 coal-powered electric facilities and left around 5000 people without a job just because they want to look eco-friendly in the eyes of the public. Meanwhile they are buying electricity from plants in neighbouring France and Morrocco that also work with coal so basically the impact on the planet is exactly the same as before.

The previous government spent more money in rescuing banks from going broke than it did on any other state budget affair. The same party left 300 of our soldiers to die in Iraq in 2004 because they wanted to have a good relationship with Mr. Bush btw.

"nononono","t5_2w1gn","I'm saying you're most likely wrong. 

Those pins are fucking tough. You're more likely to have problems from tire slide on the wet ramp or from the trailer lifting the back of the vehicle. Handbrakes typically only do the rear wheels and if it's a rear wheel drive vehicle, having the rear wheels lifted/lightened means you're free rolling on the front ones, regardless of gear or handbrake.

It's also way more likely the truck is a manual (and would therefore have no park) and he just didn't pull the brake hard enough.

But not about using your handbrake though. It's a good habit to be in when parking an automatic on a hill because it lessens the pressure of shifting into gear and cuts down on wear.",1593561730

This was in the pre-dawn hours of Twitter and Tumblr, when AIM was in full swing.  Newsground was still fairly popular, YouTube had just opened its eyes to the world, and Reddit basically didn't exist.

I once was part of an Otherkin community as a rarity that lurked on unknown PHB and vB boards, rather than a fact of life, even when I'm not one myself.  I just had an interesting exploration phase in my late teens early 20's.

Most everything could only be found on dedicated Usenet postings or forums, and so it was exceedingly difficult to find any info.

The Internet has changed since then, but when I originally started questioning, it felt like everything I could find was for MTF.  I mean I, have no problem with that, but they were def the vocal majority, and it made possible FTM me feel unwelcome.

Turns out I'm genderfluid and I'm finally-almost-happy with that.

Luke: Vader... Is the dark side stronger?

Yoda: No, no, no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.

Luke: But how am I to know the good side from the bad?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I posted this last month and I'll post it again because some people let me know that what I wrote could potentially end up helping someone. 

I was never tested, but from all of the symptoms I had and from talking to two separate doctors multiple times, it's safe to say that I had coronavirus. Ever since I was a little kid, I was sick with bronchitis, pneumonia, and other illnesses, but this one makes the others look like a walk in the park. I have no idea where or how I got infected, but from mid-March I started to feel a little tickle in my throat followed by occasional coughing. I assumed it was just allergies, but once I started to have a fever, I knew something was up.

I was too scared to go out, so I used an app to talk to a doctor and that's when she said that I most likely had coronavirus. At that point I felt incredibly nervous/scared because I live with my parents and I was afraid of getting them sick. I started to self-isolate in my bedroom, but things quickly got worse.

The fevers became more frequent and at one point my temperature was regularly 104 F. I was generally in control when dealing with these fevers, but sometimes they were so bad that I was delirious. At its worst, I forgot where I was and I wasn't making sense when I talked to either of my parents.

The worst of it was being unable to breathe properly and dealing with 20-30-minute-long coughing fits. What sucked about the coughing was that I wasn't hacking up phlegm and they were generally very dry coughs. My energy was drained and I couldn't do anything without feeling out of breath or having to deal with a coughing fit. Everything took a lot of effort to do and sometimes I’d have to take 5-10 minutes to build myself up towards doing what I needed to do.

It doesn't compare to having a ventilator, but a $20 fan I bought from amazon a few years back helped me feel a little better. Whenever I was coughing up a storm, it was very difficult to get a breath of air in, so I turned up the fan to its max level and aimed it towards my face.

At one point I was left unable to use the bathroom because I was too weak to walk to the toilet. I’m a bit ashamed that it got to this point, but I had to use diapers and eventually moved on to using a bucket. It was incredibly humiliating to get to this point, but all I cared about was trying to be as comfortable as possible without being left winded or with more coughing. It was disgusting pooping/peeing in a diaper/bucket, but it was better than coughing up a storm and not knowing if I’d be able to breathe again.

On top of being sick and being worried that I was going to die, I was worried that I’d get my parents sick. They surprised me and kept caring for me despite me coughing and most likely being contagious. They'd regularly come into my room with masks/gloves and did everything that they could do to make sure that I was taken care of/comfortable. It helped me realize that my parents love me much more than I previously thought and that makes me want to be there for them as much as I can. Thankfully, nothing ever happened to them and they're one of the reasons why I eventually got better/felt cared for during a difficult moment in my life.

As if being sick wasn't bad enough, it also triggered panic attacks, so that was really difficult for me. The panic attacks are nothing in comparison to being breathless and feeling weak, but it didn't make things easy for me at all.

Things were so bad that I thought I was going to die, but it got to the point where I wrote up a last will and testament. I also filmed myself saying some words because there were nights where I didn't know if I’d wake up the next day. On these nights I contemplated going to the hospital, but it was complicated. I live in a heavily hit area and I heard stories of people going to the hospital and not leaving or not being sick and getting sick thanks to visiting a hospital. Not only that, I had no idea how I’d even get to a hospital. I have no car, taxis would probably refuse to transport a visibly sick coronavirus patient, I was too weak for public transportation, and an ambulance would be incredibly expensive. I realize that thinking about money/debt in a life or death situation is ridiculous, but that’s where my mind went while I was in the middle of this. Fortunately, I never had to go to the hospital because my parents were somehow able to help calm me down enough to the point where I could go back to my room and try to relax.

You'd think someone dealing with this illness would be sleeping as much as possible, but it was hard to get comfortable, so I was awake for lengthy periods of time. For the most part, the few times I was able to fall asleep was because the fevers more or less knocked me out. Other than that, I’d just stay in one position in my room while watching a lot of movies/tv shows.

Everything was horrible to deal with, but the worst of it was not being able to breathe properly for minutes at a time. I have no idea what helped me out the most and chances are that I’ll never find out, but my parents tried home remedies because we were desperate. We already had conventional medicine that was prescribed by my doctor, but it still didn't prevent every bad thing from happening. They bought me a humidifier to breathe in eucalyptus oil, they gave me pretty rough back massages, and they used VapoRub to see if that would help. I realize many of you reading this will think it's stupid to try home remedies in the face of an illness such as this one, but we were desperate.

Now that I’ve more or less been better for around a month or so, I’ve had a lot to think about what I went through. Every once in a while, new details of what I went through come back to me and I try to jot them down in my journal. I recognize that this is a historical event, so I’ve been trying to write in my journal as much as possible. I’d like to be able to publish it someday, but I don't know if that'll end up happening.

One of the things that's been on my mind is why was I able to get better when so many other people succumbed to this disease. I’ve heard stories of people my age (late 20s) that are much healthier or even athletes dying and it leaves me feeling like shit. I don't know if it's survivor's guilt or something, but it's strange to think that someone that's in much better shape than me wasn't able to pull through. I’m thankful that I’m alive, but it's something that I think about on a fairly regular basis.

At this point I feel as if I’m just rambling on, but all I know is that this illness is not just the flu or whatever bullshit idiots are calling it these days. This shit is serious and dealing with it was one of the worst experiences of my life. There was just a lot of really bad stuff to deal with and it's too much to type it all up here. I have forgotten some things that I went through, but I know I’ll remember the general experience for the rest of my life.",1593561732

*Also* it’s worth noting that almost EVERYONE feels their hands are too small for the instrument at first, i have gigantic hands (and did for my age at 8 when I started playing) and remember thinking the things my guitar teacher was asking me to do were impossible, but after a couple weeks of practice I found my hands could pretty easily stretch to where they needed to be, and I see this happen consistently with students of all ages and all hand sizes.",1593561733

The chance that he didn’t do it is vanishingly small, in fact it’s much more likely that there are a lot more victims out there that didn’t come forward because they feared the police wouldn’t take them seriously or would retaliate.

* Thought Chan Hyuk already suspected Eun-hee was holding back her feelings, but looks like he is totally clueless.
* Yoo the fruit guy isn't in an affair with Jin-sook, but Jin-sook is really close to his wife.
* VP wasn't getting back at his (ex-)GF; he just doesn't know what he wants. While I don't believe he slept with his ex (that was probably a lie), it's still very weird why he went a whole week w/out contact with Eun-hee
* Song-shik is raising is his own biological child. But at least I got the part where he isn't Sang-shik's child right. XD

&amp;#x200B;

That said, these two episodes are VERY insightful because now we know... if the show is hinting to play a certain development straight, we know it really is a curve ball instead. So knowing that, let's make some guesses!

1. Jin-sook looks to be having an affair still with Eun-joo's father -&gt; nope, just another misunderstanding
2. Chan Hyuk finally makes a move to Eun-hee and they finally get together -&gt; nope, Eun-hee deflects his advances
3. Eun-joo looks like she's going to be doing some diabolical things to get revenge on Tae-hyung -&gt; nope, she's just ""destroying"" Tae-hyung's connection to her family, because he said before he feels burdened by such bonds
4. Ji-woo says he has a girlfriend -&gt; his actual 'girlfriend' is either someone he met in League of Legends, or a character he made his 'waifu'",1593561733

&gt;  
&gt;my point is, with your car, since i do not have a current belief my default position is ""non-belief"" until the time in which valid evidence is provided in which i can become convinced of a belief.

I think I still may be missing your point.  Do you mean you have a position of ""non-belief"" on the proposition ""his car is red \[or fill in color\]"" meaning that you believe ""his car is not red""?

So, I don't know what color your car is or if you even have one, but I'm ready to state a belief that your car is not hot pink because that's just really unlikely.   

There are a lot of things where the correct answer is ""I don't know"" but also that I have a belief.

For example, was there a person born in New York City in 1902 and given the name ""William Smith.""  I don't know.  I don't have any information about this one way or the other, but I also believe there was because a) that's a very common name and b) there are a lot of people in NYC.

&gt; Coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci on Tuesday issued a stark warning to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, saying the US could see new cases of coronavirus rising to a level of 100,000 a day.

&gt; &amp;quot;We are now having 40-plus thousand new cases a day. I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around and so I am very concerned,&amp;quot; Fauci told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee during a hearing on the pandemic, according to CNN. Fauci expressed dismay over people congregating in crowds and not wearing masks and inadequate attention being paid to guidelines on reopening.

&gt; Fauci said that he can&amp;#039;t make an accurate prediction of the number of cases and deaths the US will see before the pandemic is over, but said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s going to be very disturbing, I will guarantee you that.""

"wiedzmin","t5_4bjgm","I'll just copypaste the comment I left in his comment section:

""There are some good points you made here. Like the ""conjuction of spheres"" But also you made several ""booboos"" that really undermines your argument:

1.Your White Wolf argument is really weak. Because if them both being albinos, having white hair and being called White Wolf is enough to be called plagiarism. We also must call Elric's author a plagiarist. There is a French history novel from 1843 Le Loup Blanc about an Albino guy becoming a soldier/warrior called the White Wolf who forms a band of peasants to fight against the tyranny of nobles. (Also he is hated by most people)

2.Your Master Mirror argument is really bad. Master Mirror is based on ""Pan Twardowski"" a polish literary work dating as far AS FUCKING 1495. In which the titular charcter the noble Twardowski makes a deal with the devil in exchange for his soul and ultimately escape to the Moon so the devil can't get them. (That is why the moon imagery is present in that Witcher 3 DLC)

3.Geralt also has a beard in (for example) the book ""Time for Contempt"" but that was a nice strawman. Also Geralt is not a mercenary he doesn't fight in wars or in conflicts between nobles he is an exterminator that just doesn't exterminate rats but extra-dimensional monsters. That comparison was really stretching it.

4.And if being a reluctant hero is the standard we should should throw 50% of literally heroes in this category. That Trope is old even Moses represents this hero type.

5.Order vs Chaos argument is really grasping at straws because it only works in the English language. Witcher 1 was written in Polish first (that is why the first game had such a bad translation) and the word for an Order in Polish is ""Zakon"" that has nothing to do with Chaos vs Order dichotomy. Not to mention the Order of The Flaming Rose is based on Teutonic Order with which Poland had problems and had fight against for hundreds of years.

6.But even so the Dichotomy of chaos vs order can be traced to things like Gnosticism that started around 2000 years ago. The duality of good vs evil, creator vs anti-creator is one of the features of gnosticism and everyone could draw upon it. Pretending that somehow Moorcock invented it is just ludicrous.

7.The conjuction of spheres in Witcher 2 isn't gone it is still the central issue with Wild Hunt using it's effects to travel between worlds which is even more explored in the third game. And is seen many times during Witcher 2 the animated cutscenes. But that being said I believe that Sapkowski is an asshole and an arrogant egomaniac that stole some things/elements from Moorcock for his books and will never admit it. But this isn't a strong enough case for a claim of plagiarism. Your initial claim that similar name and appearance is the only thing needed doesn't apply here. In the comic book case it was clear case of these people knowing each other's competition very well. Here you would have to prove without a doubt (that he read the book before writing the first draft) that a writer from Eastern Bloc intended to steal Moorcock's work. And that would be very hard. Again character with SIMILAR NAME and SIMILAR APPEARANCE means that Elric is a plagiarism of Le Loup Blanc character ;)

EDIT: On an additional note: I would not overemphasize the role of Witchers vs Eternal Champions because the word ""Wiedźmin - Witcher"" comes from the slavic ""Wiedźmarz or Wiedźmak"" who were basically in slavic mythology people that fought forces of evil like monsters from the cemetery, witches and demons. But they weren't purely benevolent and would sometimes turn on the people they were suppose to protect sending illness their way or harming them by taking their life force. Something similar is in Bulgaria with Sabotniks - which fought vampires and other monsters but could turn evil themselves and drink energy from the people. And this sounds kinda Similar to Elric doesn't it? Thing is Sapkowski took elements of slavic mythology he found useful so Geralt being a force for good but also a double edged sword that brings disaster to the people he should protect may have it's source in the old slavic stories and not in Moorcock's work.""",1593561736

"Steam","t5_2qwis","Killer Instinct? Probably one of the better games, but unfortunately steam doesn't have ranked crossplay for it. Good gameplay and good netcode.  Lots of fun and a good selection of fighting styles/characters. Unfortunately never got picked up because it was Xbox exclusive.

MK11, no offense, is good if you're really casual and just buy it for gore and 5 minute matches with 3 minutes of cutscenes. If you don't like watching movies and actually want to play a game, don't get it. Even some of the basic throws in the game take 30 seconds to wait out. The only pros to this game are the netcode and the fact that it has a mainstream presence because of the gore, so the community is ""there."" Side note: Dedicated block button. I find this disgusting. My friend says its necessary for the gameplay, but I steer away from these games so I don't try and find out why; it's unnatural. Definitely ""visuals"" over gameplay for this. The upside is there will be fresh meat, and if you're a veteran (read: played one fighting game for a little bit!) of fighting games you can do pretty well in ranked, even if you're not good. 

Edit: Yeah, so I just remembered the one way I described MK11 when I played with a friend, and I'm sure other people have said it, clunky. so... CLUNKY. Maybe not even the just controls, but the visuals. It just feels so clunky and not fun.

DBFZ is good, but I think the community has really dwindled. I don't mean you'll never find a game, but I mean you'll probably never find a game you'll win. Also, too many gokus. What're there like 12 gokus in the game now? Still want to pick it up, but personally would stick to just playing with friends. I'm a sucker for the good arcsys visuals (the good ones; i'm looking at you arcsys).

I don't do 3D fighters (tried them and they're just not my thing) so I can't comment on the rest.

---

The other person mentioned a couple of games:

Injustice 2. I grabbed Injustice for free because my friend let me know. It's a really dumbed down fighting game if it's anything like its prequel. It's NRS, so yeah, if you're looking for depth it's not there. Cinematics are annoying, but nothing near as bad as MK. The story is corny as fuck... if you're not a big superhero fan, yikes, but other than that in the first one I had some fun playing multiplayer, but a four button fighter isn't for me. I don't know if it's overly convoluted or incredibly brain dead simple, or if those aren't mutually exclusive. If you pick it up, just play Scorpion since he broke the game with back to block. Input doesn't feel super responsive in the first one and it was definitely visuals over gameplay, so knowing what your opponent was doing without 600 hours of studying frames, just wasn't fun. 

Skullgirls. Incredibly niche and dead community. It's fun, but the art style is a bit... much. Following along with outside of the game drama is stupid so I'm not commenting on cancel culture. Netcode is really good and each character brings something to the table. Good systems in place although some will disagree (people can't loop you to death with the same boring combo because it lets you press a button and break out when it detects it). Love being able to fight 1v3 or 2v3, etc. Small roster though. Inputs and gameplay are natural and feel responsive and good. I don't admit it but it might be one of my favorites with how good the gameplay feels.

---

I guess USF4 is dead now but it's one of my favorites. I played 5 and it just didn't feel as good, but maybe I'm biased. Probably incredibly dead by now anyway. So no comment.",1593561736

"CompetitiveForHonor","t5_3bbel","u/KingMe42 It is clearly stated that there would not be ranged gb's that come from out of the screen because of range nerf it is one of the main points in this thread please read.

Also ranged zone attack is more considered like a hybrid between kensei's, raider's, and shaolin's zone with sligthly better hitbox which would be in line with what we have in game that is not considered op.

I don't understand what you mean with the sickle rain lights if they don't damage you it should be a net positive. Also they are now accessible from the kick to ranged gb mix-up so they should not be considered strictly as ranged attacks. It is okay though to make the lights heal 5hp per hit, also there is nuance, I said that it would drain stamina, so if you do the lights your almost out of stamina (that was my point), it's difficult to express clearly so sorry for that.

And finally when it comes to Yama Uba it becomes really situational, it depends on number of opponent's around you. I'm not against nerfing the healing to 60 or 50% on last increment when all the ennemy team surrounds you. It's a tier 4 dude.",1593561737

Miracast requirements: Graphics driver must support Windows Display Driver Model WDDM 1.3 with Miracast support. Wi-Fi driver must support Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) 6.30 and Wi-Fi Direct. Windows 8.1 or Windows 10.

The difficult bit is the Wi-Fi card, as desktop chipsets don't often support this. Few cards even tell you if they support this. Your best bet is to find a card with a chipset that matches a laptop chipset that works perhaps? Perhaps you can find something that does state it is compatible on Amazon?

One further tip. The Roku works OK for this if you want to stream video. There will be significant input lag though. If you want a good experience for general PC use you want to use the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter v2 (not the v1). It has low latency extensions that Windows devices can use and is amazing. It also works at basic laggy speed for non-Windows devices, but even then it's the best client end Miracast dongle out there.",1593561737

So while some some of the tracks are undeniably good, it is the album I least come back to. 

That was my least favourite until Aurora came, Aurora just feels like all my favourite BB songs have been ripped apart. The strings and everything on the tracks might have suited better if they did a purely acoustic album instead like Three Days Grace did with Acoustic wood Insight.",1593561738

"ABCDesis","t5_2yfr0","Hey there OP, 

I’m sorry to hear about this situation. IMO, you should certainly push back as much as you possibly can to help dispel her of her anti-blackness. Oftentimes, it’s mostly just out of naive ignorance that these kinds of comments come up as opposed to her maliciously trying to spout of this type of rhetoric. If you dont mind, I’ll address your points step by step— 

&gt;* Commenting that she'd be fine with marrying or dating a non-ABCD White person, but not ""anyone else"" and it was implied that meant someone Black or Hispanic.

I think you should address is as a “why” question— “why” does she feel like a White person would be OK, but another MOC wouldn’t be? I know plenty of black Americans (presuming that you both are in the US) who don’t necessarily “have a specific ethnic culture other than black American culture” so why is she alright with dating a White guy but not a Black one? Many of them are in the similar boat where they dont have a strong “ethnic” culture similar to newer immigrants— black Americans who were brought over in bondage and White Americans, many of whom have immigrated and assimilated as “Americans”. 

I wouldn’t throw her under the bus for sexual preferences — but, saying that, people need to understand that these preferences dont come out of nowhere. There is a complicated web of biological hardwiring that is heavily influenced by socialization by outside factors of family, media, etc. so people shouldn’t completely push aside the notion that they need to critically analyze the “why” of sexual attraction since many times, attraction to people can be precipitated on how closely they are conforming to Eurocentric beauty standards which exclude POC. 

&gt;* Constant comments about ""shady"" city neighborhoods and people who ride public transit which I find really irksome since she's super sheltered and lives in the suburbs (by choice, which is fine but she has no business talking trash about neighborhoods that she's never been to and never lived in???).
* etc. those are the ones I can immediately think of recently but there have been others over the years too.

She needs to understand that decade of [redlining](https://www.vox.com/2016/6/6/11852640/cartoon-poor-neighborhoods)  and centuries of varying types of oppression against Black people in particular have made this country very heavily segregated. White places = higher property values and black places = lower ones (which means less investment in these areas, particularly because many of the “equalizing” social programs we have in public schooling are heavily based on local property taxes.). Black people were enslaved, thrust into sharecropping and then during the Jim Crow era, were not allowed to use GI benefits post WWII, even though they served, which means that they were barred from moving into white suburbs and a key wealth building factors were taken away from them (no subsidized college, no FHA mortgage etc.). They have not had the same opportunities to build a nest for themselves that white people have had— a full generation yet hasn’t passed since the 60s when they were afforded full voting rights. Racism and exclusion has been baked into the DNA of the US since it’s inception and she needs to understand Black people’s positioning within that particular context — history compounds their disadvantaged status compared to the white advantage. 

I hope this is a good starting point— feel free to DM me if you want to take further about this or need more suggestions. Good luck and you’re doing good work of working though the naive and ignorant antiblackness she’s espousing.",1593561738

"SluttyConfessions","t5_33rc6","That's the problem with looking for niche things on popular places, You'll get a lot of replies but no quality ones. My advice would be to take some time for yourself, just you and then when you feel like you're ready, if you still want to try the lifestyle start reading up more on the psychological aspect , particularly with regards to spotting red flags, some simple ones:

&amp;#x200B;

1. He starts communication being anything other than polite and cordial, you may be a slut but even sluts have self respect
2. He talks about the act before establishing any boundaries/safeties
3. He doesn't know his terms, if your Dom says he likes ropeplay but can't tell a half hitch from a frog knot then he's just looking to get his dick wet
4. He reacts with anything other than acceptance and understanding when you reach a hard limit, especially one previously established
5. He puts the one person or aspect ahead of the other, Even too much aftercare can be a bad thing, you should know what your partner likes and is comfortable with both during the activity and during the cooldown
6. His life doesn't reflect his image, Big one here people, Successful doms tend to be people who are competent and have their life in order, in the opposite of this, when someones life is a mess and they seek control through sexual control it will always go bad
7. Just cause you're the sub in the relationship doesn't mean you don't have to put effort in, relationships take two people, and if you arent helping your partner you should be supporting them without forcing them, a good dom or sub is someone who understands your relationship dynamic doesn't change peoples base need for companionship and support

For Iz*one I feel like it’s Hitomi. I think because she’s a little more reserved in personality. A lot of people tend to not like quieter members. 

For Twice i’d say Jeongyeon she’s constantly praised within the fanbase for her vocals and how talented she is and how beautiful she is but i still don’t think she has as many fans as the others. She has been getting more time to shine lately but not as much as other members do. Same with Chaeyoung. They aren’t talked about as much besides being called underrated (which is never a good sign).

For CIX i’m a fairly new fan but i’d think it’s Yonghee. Yonghee doesn’t get as much screentime or lines in their songs. And he usually gets the same song structure part in their titles (the refrain? or prechorus idk what you call it) I can’t see much other reason. Maybe because he’s calmer compared to his other members. Even though they’re a pretty calm group as a whole. I love Yonghee though 🥺",1593561738

All these tales of “poor” Jews in the Soviet Union were invented by your State Department! Most of the leading positions in the past and now are held by people with well-known roots. And they left ""in the mass"" - the forbidden fruit is sweet, many had or could have problems with the laws that existed at that time.

 And the word ""Negro"", which you despise, in Russia means only people with dark skin color and does not bear any negative. In the country, funds were often raised for them to “help the unfortunate”, “organized” all kinds of (propaganda!)

If a doctor says otherwise or something along the lines of it being illegal / HIPPA violation ask for a waiver. They have them. If they still refuse then you should push back.

Something you might want to look into is ""Power of Attorney"". Simply put this will give whomever you want the ability to legally do things as you/on your behalf. This will cover doctors visits (talking) but will also cover things like making decisions for treatment options so if you are incapacitated decisions can still be made.

I was zonked out of my mind when I did chemo. Weeks and months would just go by without me registering anything. It was basically an endless cycle of sleep, chemo, and forcing myself to eat (Eating is important. Don't ever stop eating. Mix protein powder into your regular food, you'll need calories).

Also, taking a cut of the profits is potentially a much worse deal for them. What if the bar is a complete failure? Builders are in the business of buildings, they don't want to be involved in the business of everything they construct.

So, this is all inconsistent. And when you describe them as either avoidant of you or ""Standoffish"" (your word), that makes me think that absent some warmer, more neighborly feelings, you're taking their use of the spot personally.  So maybe you're reacting to that?  This isn't like your driveway in that the complex is shared space, even if you own a piece of it.

Would I be mad?  Probably not ""Mad"", only if they were taking my spot and as a result, I had no where to park.  Would I be miffed?  Maybe.  But more that they knew it was mine (or at least, not theirs), and I would address that with them, first by eliminating the ""Standoffishness"" by introducing myself and making that neighborly connection.  And if I still felt miffed, I'd remind them the spot is mine and would like them to respect that.  But I don't think i would elevate this to the landlord (just yet) bc that always gets taken the wrong way, even if legally you're on the right side of this.

My answer for OP but fits better here:

Woman wanted Girl Child to dress up , do its hair, decorate it with ruffles and bows, so it would look perfect in family photos next to previously acquired Boy Child, Woman, and Man. Girl Child would be the perfect final accessory. Girl Child would allow Woman to fit into her perfect mental image of the perfect family to show off to her perfect friends and be the perfect image of success to anyone who might look. Also so Boy Child could get degrees and have a high paying job to support his future family (Grandchildren for Woman to dress up for photos) and not worry about Woman and Man since there would still be Girl Child there to take care of them in old age. 

Man wanted to not have to endure Woman's inevitable constant tantrums if she didn't get to complete her set so he said yeah. And they paid a lot of money to get Boy Child and Girl Child from blue eyed, caucasian incubators in hope that the Family would look normal together in the perfect photos. They also made sure Boy Child and Girl Child knew that asking about the incubators would hurt Woman's feelings so to never do this, because Woman's need to feel as though her family was normal and definitely hers outweighed any possible feeling or need that might arise for the acquired photo props.

&gt; Nearly a third of Pakistan International Airlines pilots were grounded for holding fake licences.

&gt; Regulators have barred Pakistan International Airlines from the European Union for six months after the state-run carrier grounded nearly a third of its pilots for holding fake or dubious licences, officials said Tuesday.

&gt; The European Union Aviation Safety Agency told PIA &amp;quot;It is still not sure&amp;quot; if all the remaining pilots are properly qualified, and &amp;quot;They have lost their confidence&amp;quot; in the airline, PIA spokesman Abdullah Khan told AFP. In a statement, the EASA said it had suspended PIA and a smaller private Pakistan airline &amp;quot;In view of the recent investigation reported on in the Pakistani Parliament which revealed that a large share of pilot licenses issued in Pakistan are invalid&amp;quot;.

&gt;Majority demographics include but may not be limited to:

&gt;* 20-30 year olds
&gt;* Neurotypical people

What I will tell you is that sometimes there is a clear diagnosis from test results but very often there is not. Even before you have a diagnosis, you can see if the usual first line treatments help improve your symptoms. They are generally over the counter. Try each one, one step at a time, for up to 3 weeks. If something doesn't really help then stop taking it after 3 weeks. If something makes things worse, then obviously you should stop taking it. I strongly recommend that you avoid trying to get prescription medications without working with an allergist or immunologist. Don't bounce back and forth with your treatment plan. If you take something for 2 days then stop, or add 2-3 medications at once, you won't learn anything and you'll just get frustrated. Make a careful plan and stick to it. The only thing that is not in the article below which I would recommend if you are having painful, loose bowel movements is Diamine Oxidase, take 1 or 2 pills with each meal.

Although, his family is dysfunctional and abusive as well, with the mother being extremely submissive. My boyfriend's ex-girlfriends were always submissive as well and in those relationships, he told me it was always his way or the highway.

I was never like that though and always stood up for myself, had my own mind, and pursued my goals. He had a problem with this though because he told me I was ""too individualistic and relentless"".

At one point he literally told me that he raped me because he wanted to break me down so he could rebuild me... But he later dismissed it by saying ""I've said a lot of fucked up things.""

I'm not even sure if I still enjoy it or just play because I wasted too much money on it. That's part of the reason, and another part is I'm too lazy to get into another Moba. For where I am in life, mobas are the perfect game because they aren't a huge time commitment and can be played whenever you have time if you're super busy, unlike MMOs.

* Blue gives you NBCSN (Premier League games), FS1 (Bundesliga but that's now going to ESPN), TNT (some Champions League games) and a bunch of other channels.
* Orange bundle gives you ESPN1-3/deportes (Seria A, MLS, and Bundesliga next season).
* Best of Spanish gives you BEIN/BEIÑ sports (La Liga, Ligue 1, Cops Libertadores, Cops Sudamericana, Turkish League), La Liga channel, Universo (Mexican league games and Premier League games I believe).
* The Sudamérica add on gets you tycsports (Argentina's league) and some of the other channels might get you other Latin league games.

I pay $12 for the Hulu. ESPN+, Disney+ bundle. Varying on what leagues you want to watch your price will differ. If you're interested I can [save you $5](https://refer.sling.com/s/Daniel204335) for 3 months (no I'm not sponsored).

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","The interesting question comes one generation deeper than your analysis as well- the royal heirs. Cersei was kind enough to supply Robert with three allegedly trueborn heirs, and regardless of whether or not Robert could petition for a divorce based on reason X, if that reason is _not_ incest, thus establishing the twincest children and Baratheon heirs actual _official_ bastards, then Joffrey and Tommen maintain their claim to the crown. 

This means that putting Cersei aside for _any reason_ beyond twincest/any adultery setting the Royal princes up as bastards gives House Tyrell _no real benefit_ to marrying off one of the realms most prized bachelorettes, and Renly’s plan is stupid- unless he’s planning to murder Cersei, Joffrey, and Tommen. Any male children Robert and Margaery had would be at least two places down in the line of succession. Since most of these marriages are performed with the intent of child heirs to lands and titles, it eliminates House Tyrell’s motivation to marry Robert. It’s extremely unlikely that Robert would put his trueborn heirs aside just because he remarried, unless the children were marked in some way as well- bastardy. 

On the other hand, the claim to inheritance of the throne passes through Stannis in the event of publicly acknowledged twincest bastards. Because Stannis doesn’t have a male heir, inheritance is tricky and in Westeros there have been wars over this: does the female heir take on a consort and inherit, or does the next male down the line of succession get it? In this case Renly is Stannis’s heir as you’ve said, and Shireen has very low prospects as a homely ugly child (poor thing isn’t a prize “in and of herself”), and of Stannis can’t produce a male child it goes to Renly- Stannis even suggests this during their meeting before he dies. By that point Renly has already made an enormously beneficial match for himself to House Tyrell, but if he hadn’t that likely would’ve been the game plan if the two brothers stayed allied. Renly as a bachelor, heir to the throne, and Lord of the Stormlands is pretty impressive and means his children with Margaery become heirs to the throne. Together he and Stannis would have quite a massive army, and as we saw Robb never wanted a crown and Renly was a friendly negotiator, unlike Stannis, they have the thing in the bag.

So it is very questionable- did Renly know of the incest all along? If so, _why didn’t he mention it to Ned_? Unlike Stannis we know Renly doesn’t really give af about seeming self-serving unless it’s a massive PR fuckup- unlike Stannis’s excuse for not telling Robert, which is that his brother wouldn’t believe him due to his bias via claim to the throne. So what’s Renly’s excuse for maintaining the secret, if he did know? Any alliance of Robert and Margaery doesn’t really strengthen Renly’s position, unless Robert can’t get her pregnant and Stannis can’t have a son. However, he seemed well aware that Cersei would oust the Baratheon brothers as soon as Joffrey became king, so he was probably going to lose his place at court and head back to Storm’s End. Is that enough reason for Renly to try the replacement? Maybe. But once Cersei is taking control, and he and Stannis have to fight for the crown, acknowledging the incest as Stannis tries sets the alliance of all of Renly’s forces under Stannis, by law. While in actuality who knows how many men he’d lose, it would introduce some mistrust and strife- so by the time of open war against Cersei and the throne, it does Renly no benefit to admit it openly.

On the other hand if he did know about the twincest, he’d still have to make the case that it was long term and responsible for both Joffrey and Tommen’s conceptions- which happened almost 9 years apart. There’d be no reason for him not to share this info with Ned before running away from KL- if anything his argument to join forces could, in his mind, be bolstered by letting Ned “in on” the secret- except that Ned and Stannis together would be the Honor Squad, and eventually if Ned threw in with Renly, won KL, and Stannis took the throne- now Renly has their combined honor establishing Stannis as king and his likely removal from the small council because of Stannis.

So ultimately we have Renly trying to keep replace Cersei with Margaery, and possibly maintain his place at court; then we have Renly suggesting controlling Joffrey and Tommen as heirs via Ned- which establishes the same thing. Finally when it’s clear Cersei will stay in charge because Ned won’t capture Joffrey, he doesn’t throw in with Stannis- which would place him a spot back in the line of succession and Stannis probably wouldn’t keep Renly around on the small council- instead Renly just bypasses Stannis’s legitimate claim, goes after the same exact alliances and benefits he’d get by marrying Margaery as Stannis’s heir- which is the move they’d have made anyway.

So it looks like Renly was just saying “fuck it, I want to stay in KL, I don’t want to lose my spot at the table, and I don’t want to wait around and risk losing out if Stannis has a male heir. He’s only going to win _by conquest_, so I may as well do it myself, plus motivate House Tyrell by a more secure claim to the throne.”",1593561747

Sorry, this is just not true at all, even after you published your new sale numbers. You have gone from 0.97% to like 4.7%. So 90%+ of all the tokens ARE NOT available ""to the widest set of users"".

STOP BS'ing, nobody is buying this. Get ready to be called centralized ghost chain. That's what it will be for quite a while.

Now I get that you intend on using most of those Foundation and other token allocations that YOU control, to pay developers and onboard people, but that's not ""the widest set of users"", and it sure as heck isn't egalantarian as you guys also claim. 

Understand that Centralization means somebody controls most of the network, and that's you guys + foundation, which you guys elected.

#**As is, here's how Avalanche  is centralized:**

**1. STAKING:** You guys will own the vast majority of all the tokens thus also all the staking rewards!

**2. FUNDING:** You guys decide on who gets hired, which projects get funded. Why couldn't you just sell 85% of all the tokens to the public and create a Cardano like treasury to fund projects as voted by the community? Now THAT would fair and open access to the widest set of users and egalantarian. Instead you design a top down approach, where you  guys make all the important project decisions. 

**3. GOVERNANCE:** You guys own the vast majority of the tokens so you will essentiall have veto power for whatever protocol decisions or other decisions will become available down the road that can be voted on.

**4. DEVELOPMENT:** You guys are the sole developers of the avalanche client and network code, as there are no other independant teams. Ethereum has over easily over 10 INDEPENDANT development teams. Tezos has like 4. Cardano has 2 or 3 as well.  Monero has several.


In short, stop insulting our intelligence us by telling us you are so decentralized and egalentarian. It's just untrue until the above items change.
I've been watching this project for 2 YEARS! I honestly really wanted this project to be in the top 5, but I just can't see how it will get there with so much centralization.

You guys ""claim"" that you don't think you could sell too many tokens, because COVID-19 and people losing jobs. I would bet money your 4.7% of tokens being sold sell in 1 day, probably in minutes if not seconds. It's a BS excuse. What you should do is put up 85% of all the tokens for sale and IF they don't sell, then you can claim them back into your ""team"" and ""foundation"" or whatever other pockets. At least you could then say that you honestly tried to distribute the tokens to as many people as possible. This is what other large projects have done. Even better, if you wanted to assure widest distribution, you'd remove the cap all together. Maybe you sell only 250M tokens, but it will be much more widely distributed % wise.",1593561749

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","""Why is it that muscularity (six-packs, biceps, etc.) on men is attractive to women.""

Well, ""attractiveness"" is something people study scientifically.  Let's check out what the results of those studies are.  This is a quote from the New York Post:

*Almost 90% of the women rank kindness highest among desirable qualities, followed closely by supportiveness at 86.5%. Intelligence received about 72% of the vote; level of education had 64.5%; and rounding out the Top 5 is confidence, with a little over 60%.*

*Notice “attractiveness” did not top the list. That might explain why the “average” body type was vastly preferred over “very muscular” types, with 44.8% versus a marginal 2.5%, respectively.*

"PhiloTV","t5_3pz06","I just sent my DirecTV receivers back Tuesday after trialing Philo/YTTV for a few months with DirecTV suspended. In spite of the increase, it was the right decision for us but still not happy having to pay for the added stuff we will never watch. I suspect DirecTV will also soon announce their semi-annual rate increase. LOL.

In our situation Philo and YTTV make sense since we have a second home and neither gets much OTA reception. With YTTV/Philo we are able to subscribe and \*legally\* use the services in second location.

And yes it irks me that that there is so much overlap required to get everything we like to watch, but since there is no ""a la carte"" , we accept it .  If Philo were to add Smithsonian, A&amp;E and Nat Geo, it would  be a game changer.",1593561750

"CODWarzone","t5_2clyzt","This is just my experience but I just did my platinum run on SMGs and the Aug is ‘viable’ but nowhere near how it used to be and it doesn’t have its clear ‘niche’ anymore. 

It has a more significant recoil pattern than the other SMGs, it’s largely less mobile than the rest, hungrier for ammo and it has a more demanding attachment economy. You have to take into account ADS speed when you calculate your TTK and not just base TTK. I’m not sure what Aug loadout you’re running but in my experience when you factor in ADS time the other SMGs get on target far quicker than a viable build Aug, so unless you’re facing someone using say the P90 in a SMG/SMG contest you’re still on nearly even footing TTK wise. I used to love the Aug but post nerf it just feels too demanding to use when compared to the performance of the other SMGs.",1593561750

They would either get bored of a guy, meet someone more interesting or get rejected. Neither of them liked each other and I couldn’t generally hang out with both of them at the same time lol. They were pretty similar and the one admitted that’s why she didn’t want to be friends. I’m still friends with one, the other we just drifted apart. They both settled down at this point and I’m still here with four relationships at 28 and single 😂 I think they were doing something right. They’d literally go through 1-3 guys a month (not all hitting relationship) but ended up finding the right one that didn’t make them feel like they should run or hurt them.

&gt; Les Friction is an independent music group that spawned from Helmut Vonlichten, who had previously collaborated with his brother Franz Vonlichten in their group, E.S. Posthumus which produced cinematic style music. In July 22, 2010, it was officially announced that Franz had died. After giving notice of his brother's death, Helmut stated that while there still may be one or two unreleased songs, the group would no longer be active. In November 2011, it was officially announced that Helmut Vonlichten has formed a new band called Les Friction. On the 24th of January 2012, Les Friction released the first self titled album with 9 tracks, and, optional, the same 9 tracks without vocals. Read more on Last.fm.

This is something that is implicitly done in OpenMP or explicitly done in C++ for example. I don't remember if it's implicit or explicit in Apple's Grand Central Dispatch / libdispatch but they use closures as well (and had to extend C to support them).

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt; I never said energy did not exist what I said was the probability of any unification happening and leading to anything after the point of 10 30 kelvin is absurd and that is why we leave it at the realm of “theories” because we say it could have happened but most likely didn’t. 

Let me explain this a different way. At 10^30 kelvin, there was energy. As the universe cooled down, at much LOWER than 10^30 kelvin, matter can form from coalesced energy. Where’s the problem with “leading to anything”? It would help if you give me the source you’re getting this from because this isn’t really an objection anyone else has ever raised to the big bang.

&gt; God exists because this is all way to complicated for God not to exist.

No but why does he exist? He didn’t have to create Earth or any of this. Why does God exist instead of not exist? Why doesn’t some other godless universe that doesn’t need a God exist? Why does God have the attributes he does? It just pushes the problem further.

&gt; The likelihood of the beginning of the universe than evolution tot he point of use even having the conversation is unlikely. It would have literally had to be perfect hypothetical events back to back and the probability becomes so low mentioning it is wishful thinking. 

You keep making these claims about how low the probability of these events happening is, but how do you know that? Do you have another universe where things turned out differently that we can compare it to? How could you possibly evaluate the “likelihood” of events happening in the only universe we have ever seen? What if the likelihood was 50% or even 100%? 

&gt; . This universe is to big and we are to fragile for it to not have been created with us in mind. Another intelligent creature would have found us by now and destroyed us.

99.9999999999999999% of this universe is the deadly irradiated vacuum of space. Even then, 99.999999% of all astronomical bodies in the universe like stars, planets, and asteroids are utterly inhospitable to life. This universe is not finely tuned for life. We exist on a thin shell on top of the Earth, in the only place we can. Whoever made this universe did a horrible job of making it friendly for life.

But once we’re on Earth? The chances of us surviving are extremely high. Earth is protected from that radiation and has an atmosphere. It’s not surprising that we do well on Earth.

Why would another intelligent creature find us? What motive would they have for destroying us? It’s unknown if interstellar travel between stars is even possible in a timely manner. 

&gt; Too many variables could happen when you leave nature to itself and the possibility of us being wiped out is higher than that of us surviving.

Why do you keep asserting these claims of probability? How could you possibly know the likelihood of these things happening? 

&gt; There was an extinction event before and I believeGod is the reason there isn’t another. 

Or maybe the reason is that no kilometer long asteroids have hit us lately because that’s a super rare event that took hundreds of millions of years to happen before one killed the dinosaurs.

I’d take that with a grain of salt; a lot of the black community in madison has come from the diaspora of failed housing projects ripped down by Mayer Daley of Chicago in the 2000s. Madison is just now hearing the voices of this population and can hopefully provide better social services than Illinois to lift these people out of poverty and allow them to prosper.

However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

I did slip up quite a bit for the first year and a half but eventually, I came to the point where my passion for God and His kingdom completely disabled my care for the sexual desires of this flesh. It doesn't bother me AT ALL anymore and I am not tempted to touch myself or whatever. 

Sometimes lustful thoughts come when I see a beautiful person, but it's very rare. I just rebuke Satan and take them captive unto Christ. So, to respond to this post, you do not need to masturbate... In fact, your body DOES NOT need frequent discharge. I do not have many nocturnal emissions anymore either.

They still happen every now and again, but like I say, it's extremely uncommon. So, maybe it's just hurtful because your body is still not used to not  having sexual activity? I remember it being a bit difficult after I stopped.

It gets a lot easier particularly when you seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. Old habits and passions are no longer desirable and the power to overcome AND His grace is sufficient. God bless.",1593561756

*****
&gt; TOULOUSE, France/PARIS - Airbus is cutting 15,000 jobs within a year, including 900 already earmarked in Germany, saying its future is at stake after the coronavirus outbreak paralysed air travel.

&gt; &amp;quot;The number of job cuts announced by Airbus is excessive. We expect Airbus to fully use instruments put in place by the government to reduce job cuts,&amp;quot; a finance ministry source said.

&gt; PRODUCTION OUTLOOK. Airbus said in April it was reducing output by a third, but has raised that to 40% as it presses the case for job cuts.

"supersentai","t5_2skzg","Those are honestly completely different things. Police Super Sentai, like all Super Sentai, are stories about heroes. They depict all their characters the way heroes are supposed to be, police or otherwise. And obviously police in America in reality are not idealized heroes. 

As for Zootopia, if one is calling that police propaganda they have completely missed the entire point of the film. The police in the film, like most fictional depictions, are not corrupt; it’s the mayoral administration that has corruption infested in it, and the movie is about bigotry. The local governmental corruption is an offshoot of the people’s prejudice. 

Now you can absolutely argue that our media largely propagandizes the police because it totally does and we were all raised to automatically consider policemen as heroic and right and good. But just because that isn’t true in real life doesn’t automatically mean that you can backtrack and claim that all fictional police ever were actually corrupt.

"LogHorizon","t5_2yppv","Dude, you don't know if the monsters are weak. We don't have all of the zone information for all the area of the map. You can just assume that they are weak. The ONLY information monsters that we have seen on the coast was from the noob training arc, and that area was specifically selected for the noobs. You cannot just extrapolate that the entire coast is like that when the only information we have was from a hand picked destination for the training. Secondly, how do you know there isn't any trails? They you can see sever time that they are traveling on trails while on the mountains. that there are road from our world because of the half-gaia project so right away there is some infrastructure through the mountains. Also the people of the land could very well have built road and made some trails though the mountains. Considering how they have been through the mountains and we have literally seen roads built by the people of the land, once again it has been shown that there is infrastructure in the mountains. There may not be as much as on the coast but if there is a village then there are roads connecting to it. Also the planet is half scale, the mountain are smaller, and yes I know the coast is also smaller. But that also means the difficulty of traveling through the mountains is reduced more than the difficulty of traveling along the coast. Yes, technically you move faster while on the coast instead of on mountains, but that doesn't mean having part of the path go through the mountains won't speed up travel time, in fact that concept of optimizing time in traversal of multiple is a well known mathematical concept known as [Snell's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law). This mathematical law makes it an inevitability that a more efficient route involves some traversal across the mountains, that is unless the coast was practically a straight line to Susukino. Next, THEY DO HAVE MAPS, there are scribes that literally make maps on paper so people can use it to navigate when out in the whid and no longer have access to a minimap. YOU SEE SHIROE MAKE ONE. Hell, you even see Shiroe looking at maps in the beginning episodes of the anime while planning a route. Also, you act as though climbing mountains means you are climbing up a cliffside. Most traversal through mountains is just walking up hill or downhill, they aren't climbing a cliff. You don't need special gear for that, all you need when hiking in the mountains is food and water and a compass.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Even in optimal conditions  if you were to walk along the most efficient route on modern road and highways, even if you were to walk 30 miles a day, it would still take 15 days in the scale of the world of log horizon. That doesn't even include that they will be delayed from monster fights.",1593561757

WK sig is a lot more straightforward: it doesn’t do anything meaningful, so it’s bad. You get supers on turn 1 or when you’re taking damage and most of them help you get a board advantage to win the game, and the only ones that don’t and are still good are telepathy and holoflora which make up for having no board impact by giving you two good cards which will. WK sig only gives one and only does anything else if you’re behind, which it doesn’t help you come back from either, so it’s just bad.

As for hg supers, sig requires you to get it turn 1 and have a specific hand to have an impact, iron boarder is just a marginally better standard 1 drop due to not having trick phase timing, ice moon is a lane restricted big chill that doesn’t draw with marginal other upside, and teleportation station is so bad it wouldn’t be played as a normal card.",1593561758

If their relationship didn't completely deteriorate when Mourinho publicly called him out, I doubt the bottom fell out when he didn't play for two matches.

*****
&gt; TOULOUSE, France/PARIS - Airbus is cutting 15,000 jobs within a year, including 900 already earmarked in Germany, saying its future is at stake after the coronavirus outbreak paralysed air travel.

&gt; &amp;quot;The number of job cuts announced by Airbus is excessive. We expect Airbus to fully use instruments put in place by the government to reduce job cuts,&amp;quot; a finance ministry source said.

&gt; PRODUCTION OUTLOOK. Airbus said in April it was reducing output by a third, but has raised that to 40% as it presses the case for job cuts.

First off, he won't drop out, rather instead he'll just phone it in, he's already slipping and stating that Biden will probably be president because people don't like him, and after the embarrassing Tulsa rally, we could see even fewer of them even if he's claiming it'd be safe to do one.

After that as the election gets closer, he'll basically start acknowledging his defeat, but not as in he's conceding, he'll be saying that between the corrupt democrats rigging the election, as well as holding back the economy that he already did everything you have to do to fix it because of the covid, he'll claim that he doesn't stand a chance no matter how good of a president he was because the horrible corrupt democrats held back on letting the country recover just to make him look bad, and just watch because as soon as Biden gets sworn in things will magically get better, and it'll be all thanks to Trump but they'll never admit it (ugh, basically channeled him to write that, I feel like I lost a few IQ points there.)

Anyways, then after he leaves office, he'll basically never shut up about how every good thing that happens in the country from then on is due to what he did in office and how the country got cheated out of true greatness he could have brought with another 4 years because of the corrupt democrats",1593561760

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","""political assassinations"" are not the fitting term.

One of the features of her getting reign in the CDU was to outclass rivals. That includes that she never destroyed a critique or rival, never even tried to humiliate, from what i remember. 

She just presented her party (and later the country) with two   options to choose from. So many of her inner party rivals got still places in politics, but either on a substate lvl (like Governeur in US) or EU lvl, leading to a careerpath not aligned to a direct qualification for chancellorship. (the Names Seehofer, Söder, ""von Guttenberg"" come to mind, several others in the beginning)

I never voted for her, i still have plenty of problems with some of her decisions. But all in all i have to admit she is not only a qualified leader by vote, but shows actual traits one would hope for in a politician in such a position.

She grasped that compromise (which is the art of politics in a democracy) does not only mean getting the minimum of 51% of the Parliament, but disarming both sides disagreeing. (A decision made has to solve a given question/problem, not like unclear Brexit prolonging itself for years because no one was clear about what Brexit should or not should entail) 

For example:

The vote about treating a then ""homosexual partnership"" equal to an ""legal marriage"" was a big thing back then. She took most of the heat of the argument &amp; made it clear before the voting process, that it was not a party line decision for the parliament to take, but one of ""conscience"". And not with a hint to a religion, but a direct Quote from the constitution (GG) from germany, in which said ""conscience"" is a defining element of being a parlament member.

She voted reportedly against treating both forms of marriage equal, but did not flinch when the result came in and her side was overruled.

Some of the ""traditionalists"" still hold that against her &amp; party. For me it was just accepting democracy.

"Aquariums","t5_2rc6i","Pure ammonia OR pure bleach is neutralized by prime, so both work great. Just be careful as some brands have fragrances, surfactants and whatnot added and that's bad. Bleach is sodium hypochlorite which prime neutralizes. Just be sure not to use both (no chlorine gas!), and be sure to neutralize with prime after. Hydrogen peroxide is another method to sanitize as it quickly goes from H2O2 to H20 (water) when dilluted, so it's what I generally use. You'll definitely want to sanitize substrate. 

White vinegar (which is an acid) and cheapie saftey razor blades work well for mineral deposits. 

Versa tops can be found on Amazon or eBay for cheap if you need a new top. I personally toss most chemicals and food unless it looks brand new as well. I've always found I need to replace the tops eventually.

Check your seals and make sure they are still well sealed. Leak test the tank first thing when you get it home outside to ensure its ok to be filled and let it stand overnight. Clean any filter completely before use. Also, if you buy an empty tank make sure it's empty. One time a total asshole sold me an empty 10 gallon tank with 2 inches of water...and didn't tell me there were two large common plecos in a large tree decoration inside, so you should always check (the commons got traded to a nice lady's pond the next day, so happy ending for the plecos).

You can't even have an out of state mailing address and a California residence address if you are applying for a Real ID (this is not the case if you are applying for a non-compliant card. In that case, you can have an out of state mailing address and California residence address if you are non-compliant).  But people move.  What if a person moves out of state temporarily?  Will DMV change their mailing address on a Real ID card if they already have one?

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;He didn't though, his parent's did. Amazon was started with a $300,000 loan from his parents. 

Yes, a loan which he then paid back. That's called an investment. Someone giving you a loan does not mean they now own your company. I don't understand this argument. 

&gt;He is the embodiment of the rich getting richer.

Except turning a 300.000 dollar loan into a company valued in the billions is not something anyone can do. If that were the case, everyone would be founding multi billion dollar companies every day. If everyone could expect such a phenomenal risk free return from a 300.000 dollar investment, banks would be giving such loans to everyone with a pulse. Millions of startups fail and go bankrupt each year, ending up with a lot more than 300.000 dollars in debt. 

&gt;You can put in as many fancy words as you want, you can just justify it to yourself all day long, but you can never convince me that ""work or starve"" is voluntary.

Work or starve is completely voluntary. Nature forces you to 'work or starve'. Every living being's metabolism is the cause for 'work or starve'. Every single animal on this planet has to perform useful work in order to perpetuate its existence. This is not a uniquely capitalist thing. 

&gt;It's wage slavery 

No such thing. Slavery requires coercion. 

&gt;Being able to pick one's master is the illusion of choice, nothing more.

Except you can literally do whatever you want. You can start your own small business. You can run errands around the neighborhood, sell lemonade, give massages, cut hair, or just go live in a forest somewhere and live off the land. Many people do. You can even get some of your friends to join you in starting such a business. It can even be a workers co-op if you desire it to be. Voluntarily choosing to become an employee is an act free of coercion.",1593561762

Know all those memes about how guys and girls can’t be friends and that guys think being nice to them when you just want to be friends is leading them on? It’s because we grow up in a world where dudes are taught to see women as targets for dating/sex/whatever and so any kindness from women is seen as desire. Meanwhile, women are raised to 1) assume that they will be pursued so not invest in learning to pursue and 2) form emotionally and physically intimate friendships with other women. 

The end result is that our friendships with women look a lot more like relationships than men’s friendships with other men do, and we aren’t raised to think that any kindness is a sign of friendship, and we’ve all also been burned by dudes thinking that about us so we’re afraid of approaching other women, and we have a harder time differentiating romantic from platonic interest.

"DesignMyRoom","t5_2ux9b","I’m struggling with the decor items in my new apartment. I was trying to go for a boho + mid century modern aesthetic, but I feel like the decor isn’t coming together how I envisioned. More photos of the space: https://imgur.com/a/c7SZmKd

A couple of notes:
* I’m planning to mount the TV and move the leafy aglaonema plant from the ground to the TV stand
* I’m willing to purchase additional decor items (small side table, different art, plants, etc) but the couch, coffee table, and tv stand are here to stay. 
* I’m not sure about the rug (5x7) — it just arrived from Ruggable, and they have free exchanges so that’s an option. It feels like it might be too small for the space? But the next size up (6x9) is $300 instead of $200 and I was hoping to stay under $200 total for a rug + rug pad. This rug is literally my 3rd attempt since I didn’t like the quality of the first two... rugs are hard! :(
* I’m mainly looking for feedback on the living area, but in case you’re curious... I’m planning to put a white floating wall shelf above the desk with some books and a viney plant on it.

I think that some providers are going to be fatphobic and also nervous about baby size. You can always ask “Would this concern you if I were thinner?

"PSO2","t5_2sjei","Leveling fighter rn, specifically DS fighter because storyline reasons. I find that fighters appeal seems to be ""constantly thinking"" for mobbing you're comboing hurricane hurl into rumbling moon/tornado dance/turbine throw/baleful circle. For bosses you're interlacing illusion flurry with acroblitz for the parry frames and rumbling moon for minor repositioning.

The ""thinking"" part comes from adding the whirlwind weapon action into all of that. With mobbing you have to consider whether to activate whirlwind before hurricane hurl or after it, when fighting a large group of small enemies, using whirlwind before hurricane lets hurricane continue to vacuum the smaller enemies who will likely die to the whirlwind anyway. When there's a couple of strong enemies in a crowd, using whirlwind to detonate hurricane can easily cut their hp in half allowing for a quick finish. For bossing you're considering when to double tap hurricane and when to alternate it with PA's. Doubletap whirlwind is quicker but only gives you a lv3 + a lv2 whirlwind, whereas whirlwind &gt; PA &gt; whirlwind will likely give you two lv3 whirlwinds. Add to that the need to parry the bosses attacks with acroblitz, the possibility of parrying with the whirlwind action, and whether or not overload is active means that at any one time fighters are juggling 3-4 separate systems and have to prioritize each separately depending on the situation. Coming from braver where there are only really three combos to remember (nocturnal blossom &gt; lunar flourish on weakpoints, eviscerating bloom when waiting for a counter, flash of the lotus when the boss moves). It's not for everyone and I can definitely see the flaws, but I wouldn't label fighter with a blanket ""not fun"".

The other thing to consider is meta reasons. Nemesis/slave sabers are very cheap right now, there are QoL rings coming out in future episodes as well as skill tree improvements for fighter.

"lingling40hrs","t5_kag0f","Yes, my original comment was not directed at OP, but somebody else who was questioning the validity of this post.

As your comment about interpersonal interactions, I completely disagree. Although cognitive dissonance and projection are both issues that effect interpersonal interactions, they do not make up 100% of what people assume about others. I would not call your take a ""well-examined psychology angle"". 

With something as naunced as interpersonal interactions, the amount of related psychological research is endless. A statement as broad as - ""everything people negative assume about others is a function of something being out of tune inside of them"" is not really helpful or true. That being said, one thing I think definitely effects online interpersonal interactions it is the effects of deindividuation. If you have never heard of Zimbardo's research on Deindividuation, I suggest you check it out. - https://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php?id=77099",1593561765

"Tools","t5_2r8ec","In my experience rear-handle saws (at least worm drives) are more stable especially in longer cuts. Partly this is due to the greater weight, but it also comes from moving the handle further from the blade axis - more leverage helps counter deflection. They're both direct-drive, so the 2830 doesn't have the torque advantage of a worm drive, but they have different motors so it's not strictly apples-to-apples. The 2631 is significantly lighter at 7.7 pounds without a battery versus 10 pounds; it's also physically smaller if that's a concern.

Circular saws are unfortunately a class of tool where there _is_ no single ""best"" choice. It's very dependent on the task and worker, such that many professional or otherwise ""serious"" woodworkers actually have multiple saws of different types for different tasks. For similar reasons I have full-size _and_ compact straight drills, a hammer drill, a low-speed drill, several impact drivers, a hydraulic impact driver, a rotary hammer . . ..",1593561766

But, please remember, everyone is different. For example, not all women like their g-spot stimulated. The best advice I can give you is to open a good dialog with your GF and ask her and have her tell you what feels good while you are fingering her.

For example, my wife does not like her g-spot stimulated until she is right about to orgasm. Otherwise it overwhelms her and is too much and unpleasant.

Some women like being massaged on the inside. Many have a favorite side. Some women like the full feeling they get from multiple fingers. Some like g-spot stimulation. There are also the A- and U- spots as well. Some like fast in and out. Some like slow methodical in and out.

There are bound to be literally millions of people out there that don't understand, or care, about actually being responsible gun owners. You aren't the voice of some kind of super majority, that thinks it's ok to wander around pointing your gun at people because they MIGHT continue to commit a misdemeanor. You're just one of a small percentage of Americans that is too deluded to remember the difference between right and wrong.

Thought exercise. Your wife Jay walks through the street in front of your house, to get into her car that she parked on the other side of the street. A drunk neighbor points a gun at her, while screaming nonsense, and her husband points a loaded AR15 at your wife for good measure. 

How do you handle that? By grabbing your gun, and aiming at the base of your wife's skull, because they have a point, she was just breaking the law? 

Of course not. But you're so fucking desensitized to this stupid shit that you're actually defending a rich white Democrat, in a gated community, unsafely handling a weapon, while she points it at a bunch of kids. Then she points it at her own husband. He doesn't seem to perturbed, because he points the barrel or his weapon directly at her torso several times.

However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

"wallstreetbets","t5_2th52","I am not an engineer, but from what I have gathered, Boeing was playing catch-up against Airbus. They had to rapidly design a larger passenger plane for long(er) haul flights (so capacity AND distance). The had several engineer teams working on different bits of the plane to make the design phase go faster. When they brought all the plans together, the plane that was designed moved the wings forward along the body of the aircraft a meaningful amount. This caused some problems with lift off (if I understand correctly). Which is why they programmed the MCAS; to help the plane with liftoff.  But a problem occurred because they either didn’t install or didn’t activate a particular sensor in the plane (1 of 2) that aids the MCAS in lift off. That contributed to the first crash on Lion air. Then it came out that Boeing hadn’t told any of the pilots that had been trained to fly the 737 Max that MCAS even existed. This was revealed after the first crash. When the second plane crashed, the Ethiopian plane, the pilots were having problems with the MCAS and liftoff  and they were trying to flip through the training manual to figure out how Boeing intended for pilots to override the MCAS in the event that the lift off sensor failed. 

In short, bad wing design, lead to a patchwork software and sensor solution that just doesn’t work. It has taken all of the big Brian’s at Boeing this long to come close to a solution and we still can’t be assured that it will work.",1593561768

*\Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\FA-18C\Cockpit\Scripts\command_defs.lua*

Add two variables to this file, starting at line 711: *EcmModeSw = counter();* and *EcmModeSw_ITER = counter();*

It should look like this when you're done.

    -- CMDS
    count = start_command
    cmds_commands =
    {
    	Dispenser			= counter();
    	EcmDisp				= counter();
    	EcmJett				= counter();
    	EcmModeSw			= counter();
    	-- input commands
    	Dispenser_EXT		= counter();
    	EcmJett_EXT			= counter();
    	EcmModeSw_ITER		= counter();
    }

*\Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\FA-18C\Cockpit\Scripts\clickabledata.lua*

Go to line 443. Replace the first two numbers - 0, 3116 - with devices.CMDS and cmds_commands.EcmModeSw, like this:

    elements[""pnt_248""]		= multiposition_switch(_(""ECM Mode Switch, XMIT/REC/BIT/STBY/OFF""), devices.CMDS, cmds_commands.EcmModeSw, 248, 5, 0.1, false, 0.0, anim_speed_default * 0.1, false)

Now you need to head over to the keyboard and joystick default input files. They're located at

*\Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\FA-18C\Input\FA-18C\joystick\default.lu*a

and 

*\Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\FA-18C\Input\FA-18C\keyboard\default.lua*

In the keyboard default.lua, remove the comments on lines 416 to 422 and add the command name to the action.

    {							down = cmds_commands.EcmModeSw_ITER,				cockpit_device_id = devices.CMDS,	value_down = -1.0,						name = _('ALQ-126 ECM Mode Switch - CCW'),				category = {_('Instrument Panel'), _('Dispenser')}},
    {							down = cmds_commands.EcmModeSw_ITER,				cockpit_device_id = devices.CMDS,	value_down =  1.0,						name = _('ALQ-126 ECM Mode Switch - CW'),				category = {_('Instrument Panel'), _('Dispenser')}},
    {							down = cmds_commands.EcmModeSw,					cockpit_device_id = devices.CMDS,	value_down =  0.4,						name = _('ALQ-126 ECM Mode Switch - XMIT'),				category = {_('Instrument Panel'), _('Dispenser')}},
    {							down = cmds_commands.EcmModeSw,					cockpit_device_id = devices.CMDS,	value_down =  0.3,						name = _('ALQ-126 ECM Mode Switch - REC'),				category = {_('Instrument Panel'), _('Dispenser')}},
    {							down = cmds_commands.EcmModeSw,					cockpit_device_id = devices.CMDS,	value_down =  0.2,						name = _('ALQ-126 ECM Mode Switch - BIT'),				category = {_('Instrument Panel'), _('Dispenser')}},

And in the joystick default.lua, do the same thing for lines 418 to 424.

    {	down = cmds_commands.EcmModeSw_ITER,							cockpit_device_id = devices.CMDS,	value_down = -1.0,						name = _('ALQ-126 ECM Mode Switch - CCW'),				category = {_('Instrument Panel'), _('Dispenser')}},
    {	down = cmds_commands.EcmModeSw_ITER,							cockpit_device_id = devices.CMDS,	value_down =  1.0,						name = _('ALQ-126 ECM Mode Switch - CW'),				category = {_('Instrument Panel'), _('Dispenser')}},
    {	down = cmds_commands.EcmModeSw,									cockpit_device_id = devices.CMDS,	value_down =  0.4,						name = _('ALQ-126 ECM Mode Switch - XMIT'),				category = {_('Instrument Panel'), _('Dispenser')}},
    {	down = cmds_commands.EcmModeSw,									cockpit_device_id = devices.CMDS,	value_down =  0.3,						name = _('ALQ-126 ECM Mode Switch - REC'),				category = {_('Instrument Panel'), _('Dispenser')}},
    {	down = cmds_commands.EcmModeSw,									cockpit_device_id = devices.CMDS,	value_down =  0.2,						name = _('ALQ-126 ECM Mode Switch - BIT'),				category = {_('Instrument Panel'), _('Dispenser')}},
    {	down = cmds_commands.EcmModeSw,									cockpit_device_id = devices.CMDS,	value_down =  0.1,						name = _('ALQ-126 ECM Mode Switch - STBY'),				category = {_('Instrument Panel'), _('Dispenser')}},

Now you can bind either switch up or down, or any of the 5 switch positions.",1593561768

In my view it’s a reasonable exception we should be willing and happy to make as it has zero effect upon a white person’s life. The opposite is true of Black people. 

Coates makes another point here that I agree with. Basically he says it’s just another example of white people seizing the right to set the standards over what Black people can or cannot say.  How’s that for creating racial division?

Edit: Coates also points out that the frustration white people might have by not being ‘allowed’ to say a term sheds some slight, vicarious insight into the world Black people experience daily.",1593561769

"UVA","t5_2rcav","Hey! At UVA you have to apply for the neuroscience major, keep that in mind. This means you need to get into a neuro lab as a research assistant before second year second semester when you apply. 

Here are the official pre-reqs you must have before you apply end of 2nd year 2nd semester:

1.	⁠bio 2100
2.	⁠intro to psychbio (new) or neurobio
3.	⁠chem 1410 + lab
4.	⁠chem 1420 + lab
5.	⁠calc 1210/1310
6.	⁠research lab experience

I’d try to get 1, 3, 4, and 5 done first year. To take #2, you must have taken #1 first, I’d take neurobio second year. 

Also worth noting, only 25 people get accepted into the program. If you don’t, it’s no biggie! Cog sci is similar, and maybe do it with a minor in psych and you’re golden.

For premed, you need the core sciences + labs for bio, chem, physics, and orgo. I came in with bio, took chem 1st year, physics over the summer, then I’m taking orgo 2nd year. That leaves me with a lot of time in 3rd and 4th year to work on other stuff. 

I’d really recommend taking bio and chem together first year, because you do NOT want to take any other class with physics, and you need to take chem to take orgo. Lmk if you have any other questions",1593561770

ATLA says that the first benders were certain animals or the moon. Legend of Korra reveals that this is wrong, and only folklore invented because of the long history and people forgetting the origins. 

Long Story Short, the Lion Turtles would give bending powers temporarily to people for good reasons. Eventually, people stopp returning the power to the Lion Turtles and kept it for themselves. These were the first benders, and where the first Avatar was made. He had a similar idea to you and went to each Turtle. However, he couldn't hold more than one element at a time.

&gt; Getty Images People in Hong Kong could face life in jail for breaking a controversial and sweeping new security law imposed by China.

&gt; Beijing will establish a new security office in Hong Kong, with its own law enforcement personnel - neither of which would come under the local authority&amp;#039;s jurisdiction.

&gt; Under the national security law, many of the acts of protest that have rocked Hong Kong over the past year could now be classed as subversion or secession and punished with up to life in prison.

"INTP","t5_2qhvl","I think it can be accomplished for most still. I do a couple things that I think actively help me develop a more healthy emotional side and be more in tune to my senses. For context, I’m someone who likes to keeps my emotional state as level as possible. It worked for awhile to help me with that awful explosive anger I have once I finally let go, but i also realized I forgot how to feel positive emotions too. I didn’t get excited about things that should’ve excited me, happy, peaceful. Like I was pretty much just always chilling yet somewhat salty. 

So I started trying to elaborate my feelings more while dealing with my wife. I basically mimicked her (she’s an ISFJ) and always talking about her emotional state and how she feels. I’m at the point now, where I’m somewhat good at recognizing the feelings/emotions I’m experiencing which is actually helpful, go figure. 

Another thing- I work outdoors everyday, in all weather types, 4am-6pm. Intellectually, I know it’s a blessing, I know I enjoy, I know it’s beautiful, and I know I’m where I want to be. Problem was, I wasn’t FEELING any of that. So I started looking around more, taking little breaks to just look at the sky or the field or whatever, and remark on my thoughts. “Those clouds are amazing looking. That’s fucking beautiful. I’m lucky. I love my life” etc. . After awhile I starting FEELING like I was looking at something beautiful, or FEELING lucky. 

Also dealing with a 5 year old, a 4 year old, and a 2 year old is basically the challenge of all challenges on an emotional control scale.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","&gt; ""No, I don’t expect everyone who practices and experiments to orgasms 90% of the time, but what I do know, they won’t have a single one without it.""    That's not true.
You want me to share one of my own stories? Okay, the first orgasm I ever had was when I was 11 or 12 while having a dream where I was floating in water. I didn't know at the time it was an orgasm, but it was intense enough to wake me up and do some research later to answer what I had experienced. I randomly had several more in my sleep for a year or so and eventually did self exploration, but never could get myself to orgasm. Then at the age of 18-19, I was lying in bed watching TV with my long time partner while he absentmindedly brushed his fingers against my clitoral area. My mind was about 95% into what was on TV and 5% focused on how nice his caresses felt. After it slowly built up, I had my first awake orgasm. The lesson I learned is to relax, breathe deeply, open your mind, enjoy every sensation and do not stress about making an orgasm the goal. Not everyone will have the same experience as me and shouldn't feel bad if they don't. One friend of mine can orgasm every single time by just sitting on the floor a certain way. Most women can't do that, including me. Are we less than her sexually? No. Another friend of mine has tried masterbation, has had many different lovers, tried many techniques and has never experienced an orgasm. Is she less than me or you sexually? No. She loves sex and the feelings that come with it. There are things she can try to achieve orgasm, but nothing is guaranteed. We're all wired differently. I think I've said all I can say about this, so to each their own.",1593561772

Another guy was able to get in contact with 86Speed and they’re saying that OFP is also on low stock and that it may be 2 weeks until they restock, tentatively. So if you plan on getting one, place your order and play the wait game.

"EDH","t5_2scee","I think it's mainly because aggro tends to be feel bad. Most of the time they can take down one person, maybe the second one, then gas out. The person who gets knocked out first just sits around and does nothing while everyone else continues on with their 1 hour match. If you manage to fire off, you can bring down the whole table, but without some combo, you usually fizzle out. 

And most of the time, players really just want to durdle until they get a massive board and go over the top. That's why people tend to dislike control/stax decks. It prevents them from playing what they want. I guess fast combo decks also falls into this category since they end the game too quickly for people to do anything.

Play as you wish. I have a friend who exclusively plays aggro decks and always makes a beeline to taking my head every game. It causes for some pretty amusing games where people think he's focused on me then they land a big piece on the field and suddenly he's after them. When he took a break, I took over the aggro role with Xenagos. There's gotta be an aggro player to keep people on their toes. Even if they can't win, it keeps the game ""fair""? XD",1593561772

"Seattle","t5_2qhad","I understand the Marxist idea, but I feel like it's often misapplied or overly broad.  The ""small local landlord"" does exist, and in some ways they're a small business owner.  The owner of ""Dick's Bait and Tackle Shop"" and the Walton family of Walmart fame are both ""capitalists"", but I feel there's a very tangible difference between a guy who loves fishing and runs a bait and tackle store, and multi-billionaires.

Regardless, you can't legislate by class, just behavior.  The behavior we want is for people to stop buying single family homes as ""investment properties"" and either leaving them empty, renting them out, or turning them into AirBNBs.   We want them to stop speculative buying, stop creating artificial scarcity, and stop driving up property values.  There's some really sick games you can play.  For instance, buy an entire neighborhood, then list it a few houses at a time for a ridiculous sum, pushing up the value of the whole neighborhood to absurd heights because you literally have a monopoly on it and it's suddenly the ""hot new real estate"".

The Russian mob was big on that in New York, real slimy bullshit investors can do.

So we make that financially infeasible, then they stop.

I don't begrudge the nature of that as there is a reasonable logic that caution is warranted when trying new reforms. Regardless, I think getting caught up in feeling defensive is a mindset that does not puts primacy on focusing on solutions. It's more involved with protecting oneself from what is perceived to be unwarranted criticism. 

In regards to agreeing on the problem, I think in broad strokes people see some sort of problem but I don't think who is right is ever really based on truly objective knowledge. A lot of social problem solving is ultimately who can get the most support but how you get support isn't necessarily based on objective facts or consistent logic. And I don't mean that as a cynical observation, I just mean there are ways to garner support that don't adhere to epistemological principles. 

And how people come to support a solution or idea is often multi-faceted. I think there are multiple valid ways to come to the same conclusion just like there are multiple ways to solve a math problem depending on how you organize your thoughts.",1593561772

(Kalau ada sekolah yang masih ngebiarin guru ngerokok di kelas, mereka mengkhianati filosofi dasar guru dimana guru itu digugu dan ditiru).

2. Pasien boleh menggoda, psikolog ga boleh: apa psikolog bener2 ga bisa ngapain kalau ada pasien ngegoda? mereka bisa milih untuk nolak orang itu jadi pasien sesudahnya kan? Kalau masih bisa, berarti ya hukumnya sama, ga boleh saling menggoda, kalau ada yang menggoda, hukumannya beda antara pasien dan psikolog.

3. Polisi gebuk maling ga dipenjara, massa gebuk maling dipenjara, ini juga tergantung kondisi, kalau polisi gebuk maling sampe mati, ya harus dilakukan investigasi lah (and that's what happened in the US with police brutality), Jadi hukumnya sama, kekerasan kepada kriminal ga boleh, cuma kalau terjadi, hukumannya beda.

"ClashRoyale","t5_3bog8","Here I don't know how to post a screenshot, anyway you can verify this by yourself.
So, I complete some challenges, open the gold chest, when I see the mega lightning chest. I immediately see it is familiar, and then I look at the battle pass chests. 35th tier, and...oh it's the lightning chest!!!!Yes!!
Then nerd like never before to reach the 4 tiers remaining, when I open the free 35th tier...and it's a legendary chest just with lightning. I got so fucking pissed. Imagine if I spent 5€, so like maybe I can have 2 mega lightening chests, and then it's just a random legendary. I'd be super raged.
Not only that, how many legendaries do I need to have in order to have the electro wizard level 13 from 10? 4+10+20. 34 legendaries. This is gonna take me more than going from level 9 to 13 in clash royale. The amount of legendaries I must gain is massive, and I can't earn them by nerding.
Playing for more than 2 hours in this game is completely useless, because your cards are underlevelled, and the overlevveled opponent with mega Knight level 13 is gonna break your backpack.
For sure, Supercell, you should make nerding more rewarding, and give players a reason to play as much as possible, not the opposite",1593561774

"svenskpolitik","t5_2twun","Jag har inte sagt något om flockimmunitet... Men vi är bättre skyddade ifll en andra våg kommer. En lockdown tills ett vaccin kommer är inte hållbart alls. Man måste försöka hitta en mellanpunkt, typ som Sverige har gjort. 

Men läget just nu är osäkert angående anti kroppar. Det är inte säkert om alla bygger upp antikroppar eller om man får någon annan slags immunitet, till exempel T cells immunitet som är svårare att masstesta för. 

En lockdown tror jag inte skulle hjälpa äldrevården. Som du har poängterat i antingen denna eller den andra tråden så har andra länders äldre också drabbats hårt. När det gäller masktvång så skulle det hjälpa i äldrevården. Men kanske inte om det användas i andra delar av samhället (förutom skjukvård då). Maskarna bör användas där de behövs, dvs inom sjukvård och äldreomsorg. 

Sen kan man ju självklart bära mask ändå, men de enkla maskarna hjälper ju inte  som skydd mot viruset. Jag vet inte riktigt om du syftade på mask tvång inom äldrevård eller inom alla aspekter av samhället. 

När och hur mycket man ska öppna upp kommer vara ett problem för länder som har genomfört en Lockdown.... Och tror du inte att smittspridningen kommer minska i en andra våg kommer minska om 20% av Stockholm har haft det eller?",1593561775

That really put a bad taste in my mouth; just because someone *could* be a partner doesn’t mean that they *should* become a partner if that relationship is to go any further. It felt like that statement was belittling the hundreds of things that made her (and everyone else) an interesting and unique individual down to an excuse to say I’m dating someone.

You only know what someone else told you too, &amp; regardless of how well you actually know them, you don’t really have any better information than I do.  So come down off your high horse, you’re no less a spectator than I am.

Nevertheless your friend who was there can only speak for how they felt, they don’t have any way to know how these people felt.  They may have been genuinely afraid &amp; still absolutely wrong about the situation.  That fact doesn’t give them a get out of jail free card either, there’s no defending their actual behavior in the moment.  BUT...  In this country, we have the right to use our own personal discretion in a moment of ‘perceived’ crisis.  The legal system comprised of their peers will decide if they committed a crime.

If so, why are the rates of inter and intra racial crime of all other ethnic groups so much lower?

Nobody is saying that someone can’t defend their life - just that they’d need a license in order to use one particular kind of dangerous device in pursuit of that aim. The right to bear arms is guaranteed within the context of a well-related militia, and that regulation could take the form of a national firearms safety training program, for example.

&gt; You would be surprised how many people drive without a license. Only honest and responsible people take these laws serious. You really aren’t skimming the worst offenders.

And if they catch you driving without a license, they can impound your car or throw you in jail, which removes you from the driver pool. There will always be people who break laws, but that doesn’t invalidate the existence of laws as a concept.

&gt; Licenses prove that you can pass a test not that you know what you are doing.

While that’s true, you’re still removing anyone from the pool who can’t pass the test, and anyone who can’t pass a basic firearm safety test definitely doesn’t know what they’re doing and shouldn’t have a firearm.

"MorbidReality","t5_2tz1e","Found the muslim hater :) 

Ottoman Empire allowed all religious organisations to remain in operation under certain laws that prevented them from overshadowing the prominent religion of the state of course. They also promoted all christian/jew/Muslims to visit the land (especially Jersualem due to the lucrative trade it created), carried out rescue operations for Jews who were slaughtered by Christians (on multiple occasions) and allowed Christians to practice their faith completely autonomously through the Millet system. Also it did not take 100 years to capture north Africa and middle east (which are dominantly Muslim regions anyway? I don't get what your point is) Shall I also remind you what the Spanish/Portugese/French did to the Morroccans &amp; the Muslims in the Spanish lands? 

&amp;#x200B;

To say that Christians were peaceful compared to Muslims is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Neither religion or any society was peaceful during those times up until probably the last century it was just a shit show of anyone and everyone killing each other for the most minor inconveniences most had nothing to do with religion.

&amp;#x200B;

May I remind you there was 46 crusades in total launched by the Catholic church?

&amp;#x200B;

I make these points, not to prove the opposite of your point but to disprove your completely out of touch claims. I think both (all) religions and societies were aggressive &amp; undiplomatic at some stage of history as that was just the way of life back then. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a Muslim, I can connect with Christians more than anyone else I speak with from other faiths because Christianity is so similar to Islam on so many levels we even share the same prophets and also consider Jesus as a prophet for spreading the word of a single god. Islam was formed because the Bible was touched and edited by man according to what was politically convenient to them (according to what we believe that is).",1593561779

"eldertrees","t5_2tclf","... what?  What's your evidence?  You ""not smelling"" weed when you're stoned trumps my evidence of sober people telling me my house smells like weed?

Where do you think the ""vapour"" goes?  Just dissipates into thin air and goes... nowhere?  Smells will diffuse to fill the space they are in.  With regular air circulation, the smell might be gone in 10-15 minutes.  Without that, it's not going anywhere.  Breathe some vapor into an air tight container and check it the next day.  News flash, it's still gonna smell like weed.

So.  My point is, and always has been, that depending on your situation, you might be able to use a dry herb vape and not smell it a short time later.  That DOES NOT MEAN THAT DRY HERB VAPES DON'T SMELL.  It just means you're doing a good job of managing that smell (and very likely either have a window open or central air on).  Not everyone has that capability, and conflating: ""the smell that vapes produce is easy to manage with proper conditions"" with ""vapes don't smell"" is dangerous and wrong.

My uncle has a bunch of stuff of my grandmothers, nobody wants it. I recently went and grabbed some furniture, paintings, crystal from the storage unit. My grandfather died over a decade ago, and while my grandmother was getting ready to move across country, I tried to take some of the books but was told my cousin was going to inherit them. She let me take some of the ones I wanted but had a few classic I had chosen reserved for him. He lives on the opposite coast of these books and doesn’t want them. I would like to go through them again and see if any of the ones I had wanted are still there. I’m going to take the hour drive to pick them up and I was planning on selling (for a store credit) the ones I don’t want to a local used bookstore I frequent. 
My aunts had been selling a lot of my grandmothers old things and putting the money in a trust that I am not a part of.
WIBTA if I sell these books so I can use the books to buy other books (won’t be more than $100 at the very most)

&gt; An Iranian opposition journalist who played an active role in widespread protests that engulfed the country in 2017 and 2018 has been sentenced to death, Iranian authorities said on Tuesday, months after he disappeared in neighboring Iraq and ended up in his home country under murky conditions.

&gt; The activist, Ruhollah Zam, was found guilty by a court in Tehran of &amp;quot;Corruption on earth,&amp;quot; a term often used to describe attempts to overthrow the Iranian government, according to Gholam Hossein Esmaili, a judiciary spokesman who announced the death sentence at a news conference on Tuesday, Iranian news outlets reported.

&gt; In November, Masoud Molavi, an Iranian dissident who also ran a Telegram channel critical of the leadership, was shot dead in Istanbul in an operation orchestrated by Iranian intelligence services, according to Turkish officials cited by Reuters.

"GiftofGames","t5_2tb4r","During the quarantine at the beginning I started by reconnecting with my old hobbies, at the start I revisited making music in the computer, back when I was 17ish I used a cracked copy of FL studio that I found in a forum, now with all the extra steps to secure it and cracking it is harder I had to look for an alternative and I found LMMS which is basically an open source FL studio and I got to trying to compose a little bit of music; spoiler alert I suck at it now.

Then i decided the house needed a little bit of work here and there so during a bunch of days I mixed concrete and got to patching stuff, I made ramps in the house wherever there were steps as well since my mom has alzheimer's and she's lost a good bunch of her mobility and little steps or steep slopes scare her, then I tried picking up more stuff that I used to do when I was younger like drawing, I set a time to draw something every night after a little while I decided I wanted to reconnect with my younger self a little bit more and got back into writing bad poetry and decided to fix the yard a little bit, nothing as fancy as the DIY yard transformations people post in here but more like cleaning weeds and leveling the terrain, moving some plants and such thing. Quarantine has been anything but boring.

I did all that to my usual routine of going to look for little gigs around the neighborhood and with the people I know and of course in the night I play videogames, 4 hours a day tops on a normal day, sometimes I get to play a bit more when my grandma visits and helps me take care of my mom then I just go to my room and go wild on steam.

The game I would like to have is Assassins Creed: Odyssey which is currently on sale in steam for the summer event, its 20 dollars more or less.

"driving","t5_2qpsr","When I was learning to drive my dad taught me to stop a little over the line, not sticking out into traffic but far enough that I could see if it was clear to go. I almost failed my driver's license test for this because I stopped over the line at every stop sign.

A decade later, I think the best thing to do is to stop far enough forward that you can see traffic. If that's behind the line, great. If you have to put your front wheels on the line, so be it, as long as you're not close to any cars driving perpendicular to your road in the intersection. I find that this is a happy medium between rigid adherence to the letter of the law, even where it might not make sense, and safety.

Yes, which is what we have now since there is no vaccine. 

&gt; The difference here is that it is starting to appear that 90%+ of people who contract the disease are unaware they ever have it.

Ok, so fuck the people who do get sick? 

&gt; Vaccines are a huge boost to gaining herd immunity over an extended period of time, but an ultra-transmissible disease like COVID affecting a large majority of people in a short period of time will give a large enough herd immunity boost that we will gain an advantage until a vaccine is developed.

False. Simply untrue. And there have been many other diseases recently which demonstrate this. 

&gt; Herd immunity this way does last forever for the same reason that vaccines need to be reapplied every few years to maintain your defense to that particular disease.

No, herd immunity never lasts forever and the reason you need a new vaccine has nothing to do with you as an individual, it's because of evolution. 

&gt; We see this happen in disease that are extremely transmissible and deadly like West African Ebola over the last where a host population either dies off or gains immunity

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","&gt;A lot of historians credit one of the major Reasons for The Fall of the Bronze Age as the ""sea people"" being one of its main causes. 

The ""Sea Peoples"" were dispossessed victims of the disturbances at the end of the Late Bronze Age, not a root cause. Note that several of the groups are attested more than 200 years before the end of the Bronze Age, often allied with the major powers like the Egyptians and Hittites. In the Battle of Kadesh (ca. 1280 BCE), for instance, the Sherden fought on behalf of the Egyptians, and the Lukka fought on behalf of the Hittites. They were also often hired as mercenaries by the smaller city-states in the Levant. For example, in two letters to the king of Egypt (EA 122 and 123) dating to around 1340 BCE, the vassal king of Byblos complained that the Egyptian governor of nearby Kumidi killed a Sherden within his town (presumably a mercenary hired by Byblos), and the outraged people of Byblos demanded justice.

&gt;*Paḫuru perpetrated a great misdeed against me. He sent Sutean men, and they killed a Sherden and took three men (as captives) into the land of Egypt. And for how many days has the city been enraged at me! And behold, the city is saying, “A deed that has never been done since time immemorial has been done to us!” So send the men (back to Byblos) lest the city commit rebellion.*

There's always more to be said on the Sea Peoples, but I've written about them in a few past posts:

* [What do we know about the so-called Sea People's origins?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8suna3/what_do_we_know_about_the_socalled_sea_peoples/e12geq9/)

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7"," copy pasting from the last time I answered this

Pronouns are a form of gender expression, so while they are connected to gender, they do not define it. He/him can reflect a masculine gender expression without necessarily denoting a masculine gender identity.

Usually, when you see lesbians using pronouns other than she/her, they aren't 100% binary cis women. Lesbians commonly have complicated relationships with gender due to heteronormativity, to the point where some of us (like me) feel so alienated from womanhood that we identify as a woman solely through our attraction to other woman. This is why non-binary lesbians are (and have been for a long time) a thing. And just like other non-binary people, we can use pronouns that best express our relationship to gender, and for some masc or butch lesbians, those pronouns are he/him.",1593561783
"stupidpol","t5_hitz3","There was this IG stream featuring this upper middle class white liberal talking to a black woman. The white chick said ""I've bought the 9 books on your reading list, read 4 already. Do I get my ally brownie points now?""

""How about Huey Newton?"" ""Yeah, he was, like that Harlem renaissance poet right?"" ""Not even close lmao""

""How about Angela Davis?"" ""Yeah! Yeah she was a...uhm...civil rights icon, right?"".

Point is that white liberal is a good model for most of these white ""allies"" who can't stop raving about White Fragility. They're spoon fed harmless liberal figures and books to consume, and pretend like that makes them these shining beacons of light.

My opinion is that in general, the ""All Lives Matter"" type responses are a distraction from the real goal and really shouldn't be entering the conversation, especially from someone with as much influence as Terry.

Absolute garbage management of their community (they dont even have their own forums anymore) and the implementation of features that promote toxicity rather than punish it. Chat isnt toxic in of itself, but soft int/afk/feed is; so why are they focusing so hard on chat restricting people who are upset at all the inting and afking?Priorities are FUBAR.

Also, no voice coms makes communication too difficult for the level of coordination league requires. No voice coms = more toxicity because people have to convey their thoughts through text. Misunderstandings happen so often as a result.

"dresdenfiles","t5_2s64c","You should try [reverse searing your steak.](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/03/how-to-reverse-sear-best-way-to-cook-steak.html) I'll never go back to the old ways again, and neither will most of the folks over at /r/steak.

**For prep, (independent of if you reverse sear or not):**

1. Dry the surface of your steak as much as possible with a paper towel
2. Cover all sides of the steak liberally with kosher salt, seriously you can use a lot, especially if you have a thick cut.
3. Refrigerate on a cooling rack **uncovered** at least overnight (8 hours)

After doing this process, there shouldn't be many salt crystals visible on the surface of the steak, and the surface should be very dry. There are two purposes to doing the overnight dry brining:

1.    The salt will be absorbed into the center of the meat, seasoning the entire steak, not just the outside
2. The water in the steak will be pulled out and evaporated, which results in a very dry exterior that is much easier to sear


**To Reverse Sear:**

1. Set your oven or grill to its lowest setting (I use 200F/93C)
2. Cook your steak in the oven up to 15F/9.5C below your target done-ness (I go for 115F/46C for medium-rare, which takes about 30 minutes).
3. Sear on a smoking hot cast iron for 45 seconds to 1 minute on each side, until you get a really nice crust 
4. Enjoy! There's no need to rest your steaks afterwards like you would with a traditional sear.",1593561785

A few things to note:

1. I came into CIS 120 with practically zero knowledge of coding and I was fine. That's not to say that that was the case with everyone else who did that, but just make sure you know some of the fundamentals of JAVA, utilize TA office hours, and I cannot stress this enough, but try to make friends with people who know more than you do. I know that they can only help you so much because of plagiarism, honor code stuff, but even by just surrounding yourself with these types of people, some of their knowledge will rub off on you.
2. I took Math 116, and while some of the homeworks were an absolute BITCH to do, I don't know a single person who didn't get a solid A in that class regardless of their raw grade. Gluck was very generous in his grading, and I assume he'll continue to be so so keep that in mind.
3. How manageable your workload is is entirely dependent on how you manage your time and what you choose to do on campus. For basically the first 1/3 to 1/2 of first semester it was basically smooth sailing in my classes. However, the week and a half leading up to and during the fall show for my performing arts group was literally hell, and I spent the rest of the semester playing catch-up.

Disclaimer: this happened 20 years ago but came to mind recently and others have said I was wrong.

I grew up with my mom and stepdad as an only child. My mom is a narcissist (multiple therapists have suggested it during my sessions) and my stepdad Jeff is an enabler. They had a very tumultuous relationship, largely due to my mother who just needs someone to hate. So she would flip between screaming at me for hours to screaming at him if he happened to get her attention. Jeff rarely stood up for me because he was just relieved it wasn't aimed at him for a while. They've broken up multiple times but always wind up back together. 

When I was 18 and a senior in HS they were in another fight. Jeff always wanted to have his own kid, my mom would agree to it but always have some goal Jeff needed to reach first (make more money, be a better person etc). I doubt she ever wanted to have a kid with him but she dangled it over his head for years so he wouldn't leave and threw it against him during their fights.

In the fight that prompted my post she said no baby because it wouldn't be fair to me. Jeff asked me as I walked by how I would feel if they had a kid. I didn't want to get drawn into it. But I also didn't want to risk a kid actually happening this time. So I said I don't care if they have a kid, but I would prefer they wait until after I've moved out for college. My mom got a smug look on her face cuz I said what she wanted, but Jeff lost his shit and started yelling about how selfish I was and it wasn't up to me etc. I countered that he asked me what I thought and it's what I'd prefer. I would be going to college the following year anyway, I wouldn't consider this kid a sibling given the age difference, and I don't want to help take care of a kid that isn't mine and I wouldn't be close to. They both flipped out and their original fight ended and they fought with me instead. I eventually went to my room and laid low for a few days. Other reasons I didn't say out loud were that my mom would expect me to come back most weekends to help her and that care would be dumped on me during the holidays as free babysitting. Also I felt there was a good chance I would become the scapegoat 100% of the time instead of sharing that role with Jeff while this new kid would be the golden child in their eyes and I didn't want to make my life worse.

I think it's clear that they shouldn't have kids, they have a terrible relationship. But when I told friends some said Jeff was right and I was being selfish. I feel like, yes I was probably selfish, but he asked and I'm allowed to advocate for what I want. One friend said I was a monster for not considering myself a sibling to the kid. I figured with college/age diff reasons I'd be more of a distant aunt but apparently thats not ok. Was I TA for saying I'd rather they wait?

Tldr; parents w/ terrible relationship, considering having a baby when I was 18 and asked my opinion. I wanted them to wait until I moved out

2. Time. Make them feel time go by and they won't sit and wait for the imp to scout.

2b: exploration rules for time (Angry's Time Pool, which is *excellent* for other problems such as players asking to roll cause the dwarf failed the Arcana check).    
2c: competition. If they wait to plunder that cave the competition might do it first.  


In general, let the warlock have the imp. Let the imp scout. The warlock spent big resources to get that imp, after all. Let the player feel it was a great choice, just like throwing Dex spells at the rogue, rituals at the wizard, known animal shapes at the druid, seducible men and women at the bard, and small hordes of bad guys at the player's with cleave effects or **Fireball**. 

But don't let the player do it all the time, just like you might not let baddies be in range to keep barbarian rage going, might send baddies against ranged party members, have a social character unable to socialize, use monsters on the Enchanter and  humanoids at the giant hunter and lycanthropes against characters without magic weapons.

"cybersecurity","t5_2u559","Not necessarily. In theory, using a VPN may actually make you *easier* to track than if you were using Tor alone. Discounting free VPN services, ie. those you don't pay for or even need to login for, there will usually be an account or a (series of) payment(s) that could easily lead back to you if you're not careful.

 There are primarily two ways one could go about using Tor with a VPN: VPN-&gt;Tor, or Tor-&gt;VPN.  
VPN-&gt;Tor is probably the least anonymity-risking option, but it could in theory make traffic correlation easier; since there are fewer VPN servers than there are internet clients, it could be easier for an enemy to guess that you're using a certain VPN provider and a certain VPN service. Don't know how well this would work in practice, though.  
Tor-&gt;VPN is worse, because those monitoring the target site already know that you're using a VPN provider, and which server you're connecting from. Combined with the money/registration trail, it'll be much easier to identify you. Plus, the VPN provider would know you're connecting to it through Tor, which most people generally don't do. Sometimes it's useful so that a target site doesn't know you're accessing it from a Tor exit node, but don't expect additional anonymity.

Thing is, regardless of whether you use Tor or a VPN, the main thing that tends to give Tor/VPN users away is not a fault in either protocol, but the users' own behavior; such people get caught by law enforcement et al. because they act the same way they would if they weren't using Tor or a VPN. For example, by logging into an account on a site all the time using Tor/VPN, but only once logging in without it and exposing their IP address.",1593561787

"pics","t5_2qh0u","[Obviously all lives matter. No one said they didn't](https://i.imgur.com/UyCmhSx.png). However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can. COVID-19 is still a very real threat, not only to you, but those you love and everyone around you as well!

"texas","t5_2qho4","New York, the one time COVID leader in America, had extensive protests starting May 28th. Their new case count yesterday was the lowest they've ever had since the very first days of the pandemic. Their peak was April 15th, and except for a spike over a few days around April 25th their daily new case count steeply declined after that. Their current seven day average is a fraction of what their peak average was, 769 compared to 10,059. So, since your comment indicates there should be a strong spike associated with the protests, and not the premature bar and restaurant openings, where's New York's spike? Their protests had more people than Texas' protests, too, so NYs spike should be far higher. BTW, it's been over two months since NY had as high a number of daily new cases as Texas had today and has had for four of the last seven days. Texas just broke 7,000 for the first time, setting an all-time new high record of ~~7,434~~ 7,959.

And don't even try to claim NY has herd immunity and that's why their cases are so low. Nobody has herd immunity, anywhere in the world, and won't for a very long time. Herd immunity also doesn't explain any of the other cities and states where there were protests but no spike.

Here are the heuristics i was taught.

All guns are loaded - even if i have checked it myself - even if it's partially disassembled.

There is no such thing as nonlethal ammunition.

All guns will accidentally discharge immediately if a person, animal, or valuable is flagged, even if no one is touching it.

If anyone is within about a 80 degree arc of your target guns point down only.

The individual ideas, but also the behavior, spreads. And that's something that's been on my mind lately.

There is not a critical mass of people on the sub willing to downvote lack of quality over upvoting punching the people they don't like. And it's been an uphill struggle keeping some of that in check as the sub expands.

I think you're right about the intent of the political statement. And being artistic with it shouldn't be a problem. But that's one recent example of a comment that doesn't engage at all with the specifics of a piece. It's ""oh Ted Cruz, here's what I think"" off the cuff.

I explained pretty much in complete detail why ""I don't want to change."" Your concern is around the use of language that is, *at best*, vague and can be interpreted in both ways. Every single criticism you've made has been around a completely **alien** usage of the English language. And notice how you didn't even attempt to respond to the points I made? Instead you go straight to ""just do what people ask you to do so they feel more comfortable.""

But of course, because I don't agree with you, I must be closed minded. Which is the only time people bring this criticism out: ""I failed to convince you, so you must not be willing to hear criticism.""

Both ways state that they are also gay. This analysis is stupid and wrong.

Yeah, they’re extremely leading (and Ingraham‘s comment about the N=~150 “very liberal” sample wanting to “destroy” Mount Rushmore is tantamount to a lie). Kaufmann also grouped everybody who chose the three different levels of “agree” responses on a 7-point scale in the same category.

Imagine a country whose collective memory has been upended, with a new constitution, anthem, and flag, its name changed from the sinful “America” to something less tainted. Far-fetched? Not according to data I have collected on what liberal white Americans actually believe. Only a renewed American cultural nationalism can resist it.

Which isn't hyperbole, by the way. Though hardly anyone noticed due to Covid-19, the lack of exposure of Chinese affairs in international media (because of the language barrier) and since MMA is still somewhat of an outsider in sports: Zhang vs. Jedrzejczyk has become the single most-watched sports event in history that's not a men's soccer world championship finale.

Also, whilst some would argue that Hooker vs. Poirier was more technical thus more interesting than Zhang vs. Jedrzejczyk I actually liked that they had no exchanges on the mat. And not because I don't enjoy a good exchange on the mats as much as the next guy.

There's a thin line between bravery and idiotic stubbornness, but those two gals walked the line beautifully.

As Coronavirus cases are surging in many areas we remind you to excercise an abundance of caution. Pay attention to your local and national guidelines, continue practicing preventative safety measures, do not meet anyone if you have been exhibiting symptoms, and ideally get tested beforehand if able. If you do not feel you can safely meet with someone then it is best not to do so at all. Your actions not only affect yourself and your partners, but also those you care about, the ones that will have to care for you all, and everyone for that matter. Be safe.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Actually it is. The definition of ""white"" had changed over the years from it's original Anglo Saxon distinction to all Europeans and even some middle Easterners and South Americans and Caribbeans that have fair skin. In 1900, Spaniards and Italians weren't considered white, let alone people from outside of western Europe. Once Italians, for example, were considered white, it just meant they were no longer considered a minority group like they once were. Jews weren't considered white until after WW2. The white label allows the person to blend in to the American majority of Anglo Saxons. 

So being pro white is being pro that system. Being pro Italian or pro Spanish is fine. But the only reason blacks are called black is because we don't know our ancestral country of origin. I'm sure any black person would immediately replace their black identity with their Gambian identity if they knew their ancestors were from Gambia. But ADOS don't have that luxury.",1593561793

But a society that’s space faring should have the curiosity to explore space. And we clearly haven’t been able to find any life light years away from our planet. While I’m not saying that an alien society has be democratic it just seems like one of the most common systems. Even if it was a monarchy like government the rulers advisors and the ruler would weigh in on each factor, they could help us technologically while we give them water, food, our own ideas, etc. and if it was an oppressive government a free thinking race wouldn’t stand for it. The race would deal with the infighting before it would even think of contacting us.

While I do believe that there are multiple different alien societies it would be the most plausible for it to be a stable monarchy or democracy and would weigh in options to think on what to do with us.

If you want to just listen to people talk about the game and behind the scenes stuff. I highly recomend you go listed to the Kinda Funny interview with Neil, Troy, and Ashley where they talk about the game. Also the We Have Cool Friends interview with Laura Bailey (Abby). I found it extremely cathartic.

Also Alanah Pearce talks about it on her podcast with Troy, ""Play, Watch, Listen."" And there is an official Last of Us podcast by Naught Dog and Sony.

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses ""()"" or braces ""{}"" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only ""[W]"" but not also ""[H]"" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).

We're meant to identify strongly with one character and then interact with a list of ideals for the other MC, rather than two well-crafted characters pitted against each other, and/or them against the world. And that works well to entertain sometimes, and that's cool. Sometimes you just wanna eat chips.

This is so astute!! You’re completely right. 

And I agree that power imbalances can just throw chemistry out of the window - I’ve DNF-ed a lot of older bodice rippers and haven’t ever been able to give the genre an honest try because of just this - an alpha hero and a weak heroine just looks like bullying/abuse; but an alpha hero and a heroine who stands up to him is a lot of fun to read.

OMG! HAHA. Why do so many writers use Converse shoes as a stand-in for personality traits? 😆

And speaking of real life, I’ve only had that feeling of palpable chemistry once - with my now-husband - and as someone who is usually quite uncomfortable/anxious around people in general and men in particular, I’ve always wondered **why** that was the case - why I felt that sense of excitement/anticipation/belonging around him instead of my usual dread/horror/desire-to-flee. 😊 Maybe that’s why I am so curious about this question. 🤔",1593561794

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","In defense of Boa:

What little we do get have from her (largely feats specific to the pre-timeskip era) I feel it is always important to contextualize these feats.

Boa was able to easily handle Pacifistas during the war, at the time time it took the monster trio working together to handle just one. Boa handled Smoker with ease as well, at the time haki wasn't fully illustrated to us so this was an impressive moment for her (in the modern context of the narrative, handling logia users is less impressive. Granted. Though I would still argue that Smoker isn't and wasn't weak). And she toyed with an entire Marine Battleship crew, with only the commander of the ship (VA Momonga) avoided succumbing to her abilities - and at the cost of wounding himself.

She accounted for herself well during the war. She's never looked particularly vulnerable (not including flashback panels). 

\- She is the only female Schichibukai in the series. And this was important back when that title meant something (and...existed).

 \- She is one of the few characters with Kings Haki (this is still an unexplored power, largely, but it's hard to imagine that it is completely irrelevent to this topic. It doesn't do much yet, but clearly the characters who have it matter.)

 \- Her DF is powerful and unpredictable. It can effect men, women, children, den-den-muchi, cyborgs etc... I doubt we've seen the full extent of her abilities with it.

So, ultimately, the argument boils down to - we know she's strong and she's been foreshadowed to be very strong.; but how does she match up with the top tiers? Very difficult to say as Oda likes to give us so much room to speculate. 

The reality is that we don't exactly have a great grasp of how strong Smoothie is either, most of her recent feats involve her surviving getting pushed down a waterfall. So it's not out of the possibility that Boa is stronger than her - or at least it's not crazy to speculate that her portrayal by Oda has been more impressive. 

Smoothie is a 'commander' but that's such a vague term that it's not crazy speculation to say Boa can, possibly, match her. We really don't have too much to go on for either character.",1593561794

Just want to make sure I understand it right: if you choose to attend that DO school, your parents won't pay for your tuition and other expenses? If no (they still pay), then that's great! However, if it's a yes (they won't pay), then IMO there are 3 options:

1. Talk to them, thoroughly and patiently explain to them how DO is not much different than MD (well, unless you aim for competitive fields like plastic surgery, then I would suggest you reconsider). Otherwise, most primary care specialties are fine with DO. Remember, put yourself in their shoes - they're in an older generation than you are and in their time of practicing medicine, DO is not that popular/well-known as DO now are. If your parents pay for your medical education (and it's expensive!), I believe they at least deserve to be fully informed of what they're supporting and have a reason to choose whether or not to support you financially. 
2. Worst case they still say no and refuse to support your medical education, you can consider taking out private loan for international students. Yes, the interest rate is high but if you commit and work your ass off, you shouldn't have any problem paying it off once you start working.
3. Reapply this cycle to MD schools as your parents wish. But then you would have to consider all the hurdles you have to jump through this year cycle, it's a shit show out there lol.

Best of luck to you!",1593561795

"tifu","t5_2to41","The cabin on most airliners is typically depressurized to an equivalent altitude of what you would experience in open air at about 8000 feet. This helps reduce the stress on the hull since there is much less pressure at 35,000 feet than there is at the ground, and lowering the pressure in the cabin helps minimize the difference and thus the stress. 

Its not so much that humans absolutely can't handle the pressure airliners cruise at, plenty of people have climbed Mount Everest where the pressure is only around 30% of what it is at sea level, it's just that airliners gain altitude *very* fast  (compared to say, a Cessna anyway) and that rate of change is very uncomfortable and doesn't give your ears much time to equalize. 

If you got relief from flying in an airplane, that means that the pressure in your ears was lower than atmospheric pressure.

I had been PTing around 165 (sometimes higher) and was so disappointed. Both times I totally expected to have done better. I lowered my expectations for myself and applied this cycle, but was waitlisted at a bunch of schools. So I bought a whole new set of LSAT books and tried again, only this time I was WAY more serious and did 6 weeks of intense studying (I legit did nothing but study!). I'm happy to say that it paid off and I got a 169 on the June LSAT Flex!! My message to you is keep going!! I didn't think the LSAT would be a huge challenge for me, because I think of myself as pretty smart. The truth is that this test is HARD but it is LEARNABLE.

Friends and I thought it would be fun and a good idea to go out during red flag in lake michigan. Waves were like 15-25ft and we didn't really notice the current until we tried to get out and there was not much we could do besides let it take us. When we entered, the peir was at least a half mile to mile away. I remember being literally 10 feet away from the shore at one point and I still couldn't out power the current.

Only thing that saved us was 1) the pier and 2) we were 18 and in the best shape of our lives. If the current was going out to lake michigan, instead of along the shore line, we would of definitely all died that day.",1593561796

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","Former owner here who profited quite extensively especially when McAfee shilled DGB in 2017.  No I am not wrong at all.  We just disagree and I have good reason to do so while you have not provided any counterargument.

Really, your reply didn't dispute any of what I said.  What does DGB bring to the table that clearly beats out all other dominant assets in their fields of specialty?  It doesn't matter if you try to do everything but cannot excel the most in that field.  To even state that ETH only does smart contracts and nothing more is absurd.  Of course ETH does far, far more.  I'm not sure how you can even argue that DGB is comparable to ETH in that regard.  Try to convince this sub and let us see how that goes. We haven't even brought ADA, Tezos, and EOS into the mix.

Most other projects are decentralized and secure enough for users to not give any concern.  It doesn't matter if there are 5 algorithms involved in DGB's mining. Its decentralization is nothing really special.  You are likely aware of the discussions regarding the findings that DGB's mining has been dominated by a single entity.  I won't delve much on that but wouldn't be remotely surprised if everything were true.

Saying that ICX is a one-trick pony means you do not understand it at all.  It is an interconnecting blockchain that will grow and connect to other South Korean private and national government projects.  There's nothing that DGB does that it can't do better, faster, and more efficiently.  The only thing DGB can claim in this regard is that it's not overseen by a single entity.  ICX is but one of many new coins that has instant, immutable confirmation with extremely minimal fees.  Even Binance only requires ONE confirmation which is instantaneous for ICX.  Your statement, without expounding, simply looks uninformed.

To be realistic, see if you can convince anyone here that DGB's security can even remotely compare to BTC's as well as to any non-mining consensus coin.  The overwhelming majority of new assets coming out today are now moving to variants of PoS, DPoS, ORV, and such.  They make sense.  They are inevitable.

PoW is unsustainable in the future, however long you want to stretch that time line.  This is partly why DGB will have no more inflation after 15 or so years.  But what is the plan after that?  For most assets, adopting a more advanced and realistic form of consensus is an inevitability.  Even Bitcoin will have a similar problem without any tail emission 120 or so years from now but maximalists just ignore that problem now.  Truth is it will be controversial and may even bring about more forks, drama, and absurd developments.  This is also the reason why Monero has plans to forever have tail emission although I strongly disagree and urge the developers to consider a non PoW consensus.

As for Nano, it is the purest, most efficient, fastest decentralized value transfer protocol in existence today.  So simple in philosophy that anything can practically be built on top of it.  It's not encumbered by rent-seeking or fees. The feeless nature of the asset will always give it value. This is exactly the same reason that people keep tabs on and put any value on IOTA.  If coordicide does successfully happen, consider many, many other assets as dead coins.  Take away the feeless nature of these projects (Nano, IOTA, and even to an extent, Loopring), and most speculation and perceived value in these projects will evaporate.  These will forever be thorns to other assets, especially to coins like DGB because they chiefly try to be fast coins.  All of these so-called fast coins fall in the same category with some variant or so - COTI, Nimiq, DGB, GRS, Dash (which I do not like but outperforms DGB in most relevant metrics), and if we add 0-conf to the mix due to slower blocks, you have the coins running on antiquated PoW like BCH, LTC, BSV, VTC, Feathercoin, and the list goes on and on and on.

The bar has been set very high.  If a better, faster, more efficient, sufficiently decentralized, deflationary, and feeless asset comes out that outperforms my holdings in most, if not every comparable and relevant metric, then I will support that coin. DGB does not stir even the slightest interest - not for payments, not for smart contracts capability, not for DeFi, or anything else that is considered ""hot"" today.  Again, it's a jack-of-all trades, unremarkable in all.  You can tout decentralization but even that is suspect for some, and does not matter for many.

We can agree to disagree about it, but I don't believe there's anything more you can add that will convince me or the ones in the know.  But you can most certainly argue and try.",1593561796

"Epilepsy","t5_2s1h9","I'm sorry this happened to you. I deal with acquaintences, friends, family members every day who *just. won't. admit.* they don't understand epilepsy and how seizures affect you. Eg: I had a tonic-clonic last Friday night. The next day my stepfather asks, ""feeling better?"" as I manage to stumble over to the coffee pot in the morning.

He wanted me to fix his computer the night before and was pissed off that I couldn't - he could not understand that I could not just get up and go immediately after regaining consciousness.  I wanted to belt him. 

Point is, ignoramuses abound, we will never be free of them. I deal with the ignorance (really it's just stupidity on their part) by trying to keep in mind that no matter how I react, whether by trying to educate or by freaking out, I won't make any impression at all. It would be satisfying to punch him but that satisfaction won't last.

Even if we did, I wouldn’t make him watch my kids on his days off— ESPECIALLY if he voiced he didn’t want to. I think you need to prepare to have some childcare arrangements for your kids on your days off. You guys are not married. If you were married, I’d say that changes things because your 2 families become 1– but those expectations should be discussed before you even get married. Maybe instead of you having to find outside care for 4 days a week, the compromise is “2 days a week.” You both deserve some alone time. And you both deserve to have each others back and support each other. I agree— moving in together probably not the best move right now.

You people have literally created an anti racism movement completely centered around racism. The second Floyd was a ""Black person"" murdered by cops you guys were just as bad as the perpetrators. He wasn't some black dude, he was a brother, a son, a community member.
The correct response to any reasonable human should have been ""the cops have murdered again this needs to stop"" not ""the cops have murdered another black this needs to stop"" you can't honestly sit there and tell me this isn't about colour.

"3Dprinting","t5_2rk5q","Yes it is. It would use more filament so the Benchy would be smaller because there is a higher density",1593561797
"climbharder","t5_2s5er","Toltec all ends on the exact same final move. It's a lowball with a short approach, but not where I would go in Tahoe for volume of any sort. Erratica softies, lower/middle Castle Peak, Burnside softies, Voodoo Stones, Lake Audrain, even some of the areas off Carson Pass. IMO Tahoe has very subpar bouldering below V7ish and even some of the classics like Fun House are just shitty traverse moves into a 4. Christmas Valley and the Beavers could be good if you're solo.

Pie Shop is gutter trash rock. Rainbow has density and a few solid V4-6 lines but it's mostly forgettable. Also, if you don't have good skin forget about traditional ""volume"" climbing on sharp granite. Given the current forecast and hot summer so far you're not going to have that many burns. I would instead aim for some lines 2-3 grades below your max, preferably 2, and end up with a couple total sends per day.  

Girls on Film is for sure soft all around. It's also on a trail behind a rest stop so one cannot expect perfection. Rated X is a rad problem!

Bliss is horrible rock as well. 

Honestly if you have a board climbing on hot sandstone seems like a poor option.",1593561797

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","&gt; **Can we just have a fun session?** 

Fun is sort of objective. What amuses you may not amuse someone else. Unfortunately, your DM didn't realize this and just wanted to use all the statblocks for all the characters in all the guilds (a bit overly ambitious and without any consideration for player agency). I'm with you when it comes to joining a guild and then working your way up from there, with a more ""us vs. them"" approach rather that ""take them all down"". I'd talk with your DM and the rest of the players to see if you can't retcon something that satisfies everyone.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","[Obviously all lives matter. No one said they didn't](https://i.imgur.com/UyCmhSx.png). However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can. COVID-19 is still a very real threat, not only to you, but those you love and everyone around you as well!

1. Citation needed on the cynical and questioning part. Not sure you are using the right word either, if you could clarify that a bit; that would be great.
2. As far as conservative men playing devil's advocate more often, I'm not sure that's how I would phrase it. More argumentative? sure. More likely to be a troll? Sure. More likely to disregard the opinions of others? You got it. More questioning? Conservative men? Not so much. More likely to strawman their opposition? Very yes.

As for the rest, I think we are mostly in agreement, with most of the facts about some of the differences between men and women, how they react to authority, and how much comparative freedom they have to leave authoritative structures compared to women. That being said, what's rubbing me the wrong way, is the assumption that women not being as free to openly question as men, is somehow an indicator that they are less questioning than men by nature. I don't think that's the case, I think it's a matter of learned behavior from the toxic religious structures they are raised in, rather than a difference from biological chromosomes.",1593561799

Would person 2 have negative coins? well in this case it would be easy to farm coins, you have one account with the starting coins, another which would get the gold, and pass it through more alts, the more alts you have, the more coins you'll gain.

So maybe it should just revert the whole chain? This option would be really frustrating especially in longer chains. And what would happen if Person 2 deletes his user before Person 1 revokes the award?

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; My problem is that these ‘protesters’ are getting violent and there are real people taking real hits because of it. Shop owners, home owners, etc. anyone with a tiny stake in life. These people damage cars, property. I get it, they are mad, but I’m not rich and it costs me a lot to fix my car and etc and so on, so I want to protect that stuff... I can’t afford to have it beaten or worse have myself beaten... so what am I to do? 

I don't defend the destruction of private property, and nor do the **vast** majority of protesters. Only a small minority of looters and rioters actually engaged in full-scale arson and theft, essentially taking advantage of the chaos caused by the protests to do what they wanted.

However, when confronted with this kind of comment, I ask myself: ""OK, I disagree with the violence. So how do we avoid it?""

And then I look back. Baltimore. Ferguson. LA. Detroit. Pockets of racial tension and violence bubble to the surface every few years. This isn't unpredictable. And when the US does little to nothing to actively deal with these kinds of issues, at what point are people and politicians in general to blame?

If you keep kicking a dog, and then the dog bites back, do you blame the dog? Or do you blame the idiot for continuously kicking the dog?

&gt; What about I just fixed my windows and I can’t afford to fix them again?

You don't have insurance?

&gt; Do we protect our property/lives with guns? 

As long as they don't penetrate into your house, or threaten you with direct bodily harm, I'd strongly suggest not doing that.

&gt; The police are staying out of it.... 

The problem is that the police are doing a bad job.

They just are. There is now an entire archive of police acting in brutish and violent ways against peaceful protesters, from LA to NY, and everywhere in between.

The police weren't making the situation any better. If anything, they were making it worse to some extent. They seem to only have one gear: hit things with batons.

&gt; The 1%, the politicians, they don’t care... this hurts the people.

Then in November, go out and vote for people who actively want to invest into better opportunities for poor people, whether that's for access to college, access to healthcare.

Vote for people who are proposing actual police reform, and not just window shopping like ""bans on headlocks"". Actual, measurable accountability.

Solve the problem causing the violence, because if not.... the violence will just start again in a few more years.",1593561800

I would split it like this so i can focus on adding more both pushing and pulling movements to my workouts, but i also don't want to sacrifice volume so i was thinking of doing it 6 times per week. Thanks in advance.

Edit: However the song cranes, which helped create the association between fallen soldiers and cranes, was written in the 1960’s, after the film was released in 1957. On a basic level, the symbolism is that the flying cranes the pair of lovers see at the start of the film and what is seen at the end is a symbol of hope returning. I read somewhere that it could be a reference to Chekhov’s three sisters as well, but this may be a bit more tenuous.

""MASHA: Surely mankind must believe in something, or at least seek for the truth, otherwise life is just emptiness, emptiness. To live and not to know why the cranes are flying, why children are born, why there are stars in the sky. Either you must know why it is you live, or everything is trivial - mere pointless nonsense.""",1593561801

"movies","t5_2qh3s","The one I most scratch my head over is Alfred Hitchcock.  For *decades* he made great films and then, in the late 1950’s and entering into the early 1960’s he seemed to hit his all time high with superb films like *Rear Window*, *Vertigo*, and *North by Northwest*.  Then at the start of the 1960’s, two more absolutely terrific films: *Psycho* and *The Birds*.

But after that...

He seemed to sputter, going another decade and roughly a half making films that, while not necessarily *terrible* were hardly as good as what came before.  *Marnie* was decent but dull and, IMHO, not as focused as it could be.  *Torn Curtain*, featuring Paul Newman and Julie Andrews, was never as exciting as you would expect.  *Topaz*... it seemed Hitch was kinda lost in that film, even (if memory serves) doing different endings.  *Frenzy* is the only “R” rated film Hitch made and many consider it the best of his later films.  His final film, *Family Plot*, was a decent enough black comedy but never terribly deep.

I’m fascinated by those films and wonder what happened to Hitch, to go from being at the absolute pinnacle of his craft to releasing these works in the final years of his career.",1593561802

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Its actually very hard to get rid of heat in space. On earth iirc you do it mostly by conduction - something hot touches the air, so heat is transferred to the air, making the air a bit hotter and the hot thing a bit cooler.          
In space you cant do any that. Theres no air to transfer the heat to. Thermos flasks work this way, with a vaccum between the layers of the flask, keeping the hot thing hot. Heat management is one of the main problems of spacecraft, the only way to actually get rid of it is by radiating it outside the craft in the infrared spectrum via radiators mounted outside.

The RIAA even stopped seeing the benefit of lawsuits (although that was coming anyhow.) When consumers are given reasonable choices at a reasonable cost, piracy goes down.   


The recording industry understood that (fuckin' finally.) Hopefully the video entertainment industry will come around as well. Just look at DirecTV/AT&amp;T. They lost 890.000 subscribers on their premium TV services in ONE QUARTER. That is all revenue that is not going to go to AT&amp;T, and when contract negotiations with the providers come, that money won't be going to them, either.

https://forum.pafoa.org/showthread.php?t=123787

This summarizes it well:

&gt;As to the FOPA transport protection (926A) applying in spite of a different state interpretation for loaded magazines remember that 926A is only an affirmative defense in STATE court. Basically you admit to violating a state firearm law but raise the Federal statute as a tolling of same. To be successful you must convince the STATE court to certify the applicable of 926A and that's where there's an uncertainly. Should you fail to garner that certification, upon conviction and unsuccessful STATE appeals, you could reasonably expect a favorable assignment of 926A protection once you enter the Federal appellant system - IMO.

tldr; if you're traveling through a state that bans possession of high capacity magazines, you are likely to be charged by the state.",1593561802

I worry that i am an apostate and wonder if life is worth living if i am hell bound. I was baptized at 7 and then when i was a teenager stopped church, started having sex, started smoking drinking and drugs, adultery with multiple partners, orgies, satanic music and deep alcoholism. I never stopped believing in Jesus but i never knew he had to be Lord. I was raised once saved always saved. I would get drunk and tell people they just had to believe and that i was a Christian just a bad example of one. I was so wrong and lost. I had no sorrow over my sins and dragged people down with me. A complete party life style, stealing and breaking oaths. At 35 i read the bible and listened to John MacArthur and realized that Jesus didn’t know me like i thought i knew him. I got rebaptised and re joined the church i left around 16 when my mom stopped going.  I have since been plagued by 4 years of searching scripture that there is some hope for me. I had no idea you could lose salvation or apostatize. I was always taught people that believed that where wrong. I have read Hebrews and all the New Testament warnings and i am terrified. I was truly the worst of sinners, yet i believed the bible is 100%truth (though i had only knowledge from Sunday school class and never read it) i still believe but i use to think “super Christians where nerds missing out on life because our sins where already forgiven. Thats why Jesus paid the price because no one can keep from sinning i believed. Antinomianism i have found out its called. I have been to the point of utter despair more than once. Deeply depressed and feeling empty. Causing me to doubt Christ and having to fight to keep what i know to be true in my head. I was constantly blaspheming in my brain and i fought against it daily and hated it. I cant imagine going to hell. I want to serve christ and let him be my Lord, i just feel like 30+ years of pure evil has made me fall from his mercy and grace. Apostate. Ive done everything on Pauls lists of sins that keep believers out of heaven and still struggle with alcohol at times but no where near before. I am currently attempting to abstain completely. I need prayers or petitions to God to help, forgive my sins. Maybe he will have mercy on my soul. I have repented and confessed all the evil and sexual immorality i have done that i can remember.

And ironing out all the bugs prior to rolling out batches is fine, but ironing out all the bugs could take 3 weeks or it could take 5 months. It's just the way it is. That's fine and all, but a good roadmap would/should acknowledge that.

There was also this weirdly phrased bit: ""*If there are delays, we will begin immediate work on the next dinosaur(s) and not wait out until the end of a month to start the next batch.""*

My translation of that is ""if we plan on releasing X in August but there's something wrong with X, we might decide to skip X at the 11th hour and move straight on to releasing Y for September."" I'm no developer, but it really doesn't seem like a good way to manage resources if you're working on a batch and something isn't going right to just drop it and move on to the next thing. Or am I misunderstanding that part? I didn't think they had the personnel to leapfrog onto the next thing while also wrapping up the prior thing, so it just sounds like ""if it doesn't work, fuck it for that month and you maybe get something else next month.. if that other thing works.""",1593561803

What does that have to do with anything?  You're comparing apples to oranges when talking about national defense versus fighting outside the boarders.

MBB numbers may be higher at Tuck and Fuqua, but it could also be Anderson students are interested in other areas as well.  And T2 options are excellent at all three schools as well as tech.

With the Covid uncertainty, not piling up debt is a good idea which leads me to suggest Anderson.  Sure things will be better by 2020 hopefully but graduating with no debt is a nice way to start your post-MBA life.  You're paying that debt back using after tax dollars so a dollar saved on tuition is like 2 dollars earned.

Keep in mind as well that MBB careers usually last 2-4 years for 80% of those who join.  Maybe 10% get to partner.  Your long term success is more based on what you decide to do longer term and it's really in your hands regardless of which school you choose.",1593561803

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","Jennifer Connelly is a good example to me. She was always pretty but she had a lot of facial volume in her teens/early 20s as a lot of people do. She looked cute. By her late 20s and through her 30s, her face looked more defined and she obtained the type of stereotypical features and dimensions of general westernized view of beauty. Now I've seen her in Snowpiercer (current) and she's still beautiful but she's so low body fat and so incredibly thin that she looks gaunt and unwell. It's not age, it's her body fat. She also has  lanugo in this series which is downy colourless hair. It's very fine hair, but it's excess growth and is noticeable. It is usually only seen in newborns, but it's a phenomenon that also occurs in people who are malnourished and starving and in more advanced cases of anorexia nervosa that are causing very low body fat. Not sure if people are discussing her very worrisome signs of eating disorder or at least being underweight and malnourished from any cause, but I saw that show the other day and it was very obvious

She's nearly 50. She looks 40, it's amazing.. bit she has a serious issue. I hope she'll stop starving herself and overexercising. It's very clear that's what she's doing. I can't believe they didn't ask her to gain some weight for Snowpiercer. There's no reason for her character to be dangerously underweight because she's privileged in it. Then you have the extremely poor people on the train who are slim but muscular, or some are just normal weight/body type and they don't have access to real food. It makes no sense",1593561803

I have no reason to believe that WHO scientists (or British and German regulators for that matter) are not intelligent enough to look at the data and make reasonable conclusions, do you?

&gt; The Corona Regional Medical Center is just around the corner from her house in Corona, Calif.

"kpophelp","t5_2vyk1","I think this is it too. I haven't met any hardcore sasaengs, but I knew a woman who rationalised her obsession as benign interest.

The way she talked about following the members around and having contact with them was creepy to me, but she thought this was just the way to be a caring and devoted fan. She believed it was the idols' job to cater to people like her, and she was upset when they didn't. She even said once, ""I can't believe I'm being treated like a sasaeng,"" when she was hanging outside the members' gym hoping to see them.

She also hung out with other, more extreme sasaengs which probably helped her think she wasn't that bad.

Edit: I see her parts of her reasoning in other non-sasaeng fans too, though, even in myself, so I think we all need to be mindful of that. Like so many iffy things are normalised when it comes to idols' privacy, but fans find a way to justify it or think it's not that bad. Like joining mobs to wait for them at the airport or outside schedules, taking or consuming candid photos of them when they're out on the street, etc. It's not hard to see how one thing leads to the other, especially if you're really invested in your faves and you depend on them to feel accomplished or otherwise fill some emotional void.",1593561804

Next day: We're fine here, we love it! The kids love it.. the park is close. So fun being here!

Next day: I WANT OUT!!! IT'S TOO CRAMMED! I HATE THIS KITCHEN. Negotiations start again. We agree to pay more. Sellers take 3 days to decide after a few changes to the contract.

Finally.. They accept. SO EXCITED! CAN'T WAIT TO MOVE!!! Wait? What did we just do?

&gt; Q9: If I only want to photograph reptiles and amphibians that I find on the shoulder of a road or on the unpaved area of a public right-of-way, do I need a hunting license and a Reptile and Amphibian Stamp?
A9: If you capture, or handle in any way, the reptiles and amphibians that you find on the shoulder of a road or on the unpaved area of a public right-of-way, then you do need a valid hunting license and Reptile and Amphibian Stamp. This includes temporarily capturing, or temporarily handling in order to position a reptile or amphibian for photographs.

Note: Violations of the Reptile and Amphibian Stamp laws are Class C Parks and Wildlife Code Misdemeanors. Each violation is punishable by a fine of up to $500 plus court costs.

"Socialism_101","t5_2ys9x","Food is not post-scarcity.

The reason it's not post-scarcity is because the inputs to food production (tractors, machinery, fuel, etc) are not post-scarcity. If we were to remove these things, we likely would need to devote enormous amounts of manual labor to food production again, and it would be like it was 5000 years ago.

Until we build our machines out of something besides metal or our metals are recyclable at 100% efficiency, our fuel supply is 100% solar (including wind) and we can derive solar power without silicon (or recycle silicon at 100% efficiency), etc etc we will not be post-scarcity even just with food.

Post-scarcity is an idea that was developed before the awareness of just how many people on this planet relates to just how little resources we actually have. It's a fairy tale communists tell themselves because it aligns with doctrine that was written when knowledge about our relationship to our resources was in its infancy.

Until our resources all collectively renew faster than we deplete them (or we can convert raw energy into matter), we will not be post-scarcity.

That said, what you are saying about the scarcity of food *after it is produced* is absolutely true (and same with housing).",1593561807

I live with my mom, and asked my brother to return her ladder, so I could use it around the house. I take what's going on very seriously, and doesnt, so I stayed inside. I heard my mom yell ""go help your Brother!"" I pretended I didnt hear her. I KNEW  my brother could easily unload it himself. He owns a gutter hanging business, and brought him and I effortlessly walked around with the same ladies all day. Well, I listened outside the window when he was talking to my mom. He said ""he wanted me to bring up the fuckikg ladder, so he should have helped me"". AITA? I just didnt want to unnecessarily expose myself to him if I didnt have to, and i KNOW i didn't have to.

"Moissanite","t5_35368","I worked in jewelry for years

10k is good for jewelry that isn’t meant to be worn every day. 

14k is better for things like engagement rings. 

the reason is because 10k is more robust and stronger than 14k. this actually causes prong work on 10k jewelry to tend to break off instead of bending. in 14k it bends, but all 4 prongs bend together so you end up losing the center stone less often — if that makes sense 

rhodium will last the same length of time on white 10k or white 14k. people tend to have worse allergic reactions at 10k though. Generally you can expect white gold rhodium to last about 6mos-1yr. 

(i worked in a place that offered free rhodium dipping forever as many times as you wanted it so my tolerance for rhodium fading is very low)

based on what you said, you’re going with yellow gold though so that doesn’t matter. 14k being softer will polish easier than 10k. 

I’d say go with 14k if you plan on wearing it a lot and if it isn’t cost prohibitive. most jewelry is meant to be owned a lifetime, so why not take the plunge and spend nominally more for a higher quality piece?",1593561808

My issue with the article, **using the points presented in the article only**, I am left thinking that Judaism doesn't care about ""rare"", that Judaism at best is neutral on whether a woman should have an abortion or not, that Judaism may demand it when a woman's life is in danger, and at other times it would be completely acceptable and has no comments or concerns about it.

Related: ""a woman's life is in danger"" has in past years been expanded from the woman may die, to a woman is not economically ready for a child.

Like, most American’s think there needs to be some sort of criminal justice or police reform. That *should* be our common ground and we *should* be able to openly discuss different solutions. 

I say abolish police unions (and all GOVERNMENT unions, not regular unions) and we should also give police waaaay more training, better training, better pay, better hours. We should change some of our laws and find a way to fix our prison systems so they don’t end up being colleges for criminals.

Let's talk about truth. For one, correlation does not imply causation. All of those issues you suggest queer people have are far more likely to be as a result of the stigma we face in society, rather than some nebulous idea that loving another man makes you a deeply flawed person. 

Previously you lambasted me for suggesting homosexuality was present all throughout history, but now you willingly point to historical examples of medical misdiagnosis?

After all, medicine in the 1970s was downright *barbaric* compared to today. So what's with the hypocrisy? Perhaps you're just brainwashed to hate those who find love in a way that is different from you?

Let’s look at this a slightly different way. All the social media tomfoolery focused around JKR right now is making it pretty obvious that she’s not a good person right? However, I see no evidence that the things that make her a bad person had any significant influence on Harry Potter, so we don’t need to change it to better divorce it from the no longer wholesome views of its author. And I see the same thing with dnd. I see no evidence that Tolkien’s views on race or racism, whatever those views may have been, influenced how he created the orcs, therefore I see no problem with works that are derivative of his, such as dnd, using orcs in more or less the same fashion as he wrote them. His orcs were a representation of what war did to people, particularly the German people, and he tied that into his cosmology. Dnd took the same premise and gave it a different cosmological factor since their cosmology is fundamentally different.",1593561809

**I am asking $3450 shipped 2-day FedEx in the USA.**

The watch is in excellent condition, with minimal surface wear on the clasp &amp; polished parts of the bracelet.

It was originally purchased from ML Supply Co in LA. I buy a number of watches from them, and they’re great people. It does not come with a box. I stopped buying watches with boxes when I ran out of space for them. As such, this sale is for the watch only. Unfortunately the Warranty Card was lost between when I bought it and when it was shipped. I do however have a photo of it with the card from the dealer's sale, and it was dated Aug 2017, with the serial matching. A real bummer, but life goes on.

I am not a dealer, I just love to try new watches. This one is super pretty, and possibly a perfect summer watch.  
 

**How I keep your purchase safe and simple:**

* I am located north of Boston, MA, and am happy to meet up in person!
* I will provide to you a video of the watch winding, date change etc, with your username tagged in it.
* Prior to shipping, I’ll have you confirm the address I’ve written. 
* You must have a verified PayPal address, and those who have feedback take preference as buyers.
* Shipping will be via FedEx, and will require a signature for delivery.
* I have sold here before, and also have extensive feedback on WatchUSeek.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in LGPE and Sw/Sh:

1. Do not discuss trades over PM or chat. This is prohibited by [Rule 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_4_-_do_not_discuss_trades_privately.), as scammers often contact other users privately to avoid having their actions seen in public. Please report anyone violating this rule to the moderators. 
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner are using, it is important that you double check that you have paired with with the right person.
3. You must have been granted [Poké ball](https://i.imgur.com/XgAhEXa.png) level flair or higher (10 or more approved trades) to make trades with shiny or event Pokémon. If you have sufficient flair and are trading shiny or event Pokémon, please make sure that your post and other users’ offers contain the full details required by the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pokémon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report them so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

In addition, once you're done trading in this thread, you can mark your thread as closed by commenting `[close]` as a top-level reply to your post to update the flair and let others know you're not looking for further trades. This is completely optional and you don't have to do it if you'd like others to continue to offer trades in this thread!

If two teens of the age of consent send each other nudes, they can still be put on the sex offender registry if the AOC is under 18 and they are too.

Hi, I (24M) don't know if I should voice my concerns to a friend of mine.

Context: two friends of mine got together 2 yrs ago and in the first months they keep holding hands all the time. Even when we were out with all our group friends. This is very odd to me: It's the first time I ever seen a couple of adults (they're 24 either) constantly holding hands while walking, at the bar and so on.

No one in our friend group said anything though, since this was their first serious relationship and none of us wanted us to ruin their ""honeymoon phase"".

In a few months I had to move to a different city. In the same period I moved, they started ghosting all our friends group and staying on their own. I managed to keep in touch with them, mainly the boyfriend, who I am closer to. He said to me multiple times they haven't made any new friend in this 2 yrs.

Recently I got back to the city and so we arranged to see each other some times. Well we met and I was a little uncomfortable during the meeting: for almost 2 hours straight we walked to the city, took an ice-cream and chat and for the whole time they kept holding their hands. I get it's none of my business, but it did make me uncomfortable a little. I didn't say anything and I'm wondering if I should mention it. This is not an isolate behaviour.


The extreme closeness of this 2 is worrying me. I'm closer to the guy tbh and since he started dating her, he ghosted pretty much all of his friends except me, and even his behaviour with me changed. I'm not saying he is in abusive relationship, but I started thinking their relationship is kinda unhealthy as they seems to have severed themselves from anyone else.

So WIBTA if I explain my worries to him or would I only be putting my nose in someone else relationship?


Note: I go out with 4 different friends group and in all of them there are couples. In all of the groups the couple's behaviour is pretty different: they kiss or hug or even isolate sometimes, it's natural, but they will do it just a few times when with friends. That's why this behaviour sounds very off to me

"thetagang","t5_27n9fl","To add to the data (since most people on this sub don't like to give their returns), here's my last month. Everyone's profit comes from risk tolerance and patience as well as luck and time put in. Lower or greater gains is not indicative of better or worse trading. Also shout-out to https://fdscanner.com for some good options tools.

*******

From May 22nd to June 26th, I have about 8% in realized gains. Another 2-3% in unrealized gains. I made 70 trades, in which most closed in profit. I manage and track everything in a Google sheet and keep mostly in trades. The sheet has open trades, closed trades, financial analysis, and several screeners. At most, I had 12 positions open. Theta is roughly 1/3 of my overall portfolio and the rest is index trades. My theta account is under $25K, so I rarely open and close on the same day, but I've had some opportunities where if I could freely, I would.

I've been mainly selling short-dated (1-30 DTE) CSPs. Most are around 1 SD (.16 delta). I did a BuyWrite with IVR that turned out quite nicely and got called away early but after dividend, which was more than fine for me. Only was assigned on two CSPs- WFC and WDC. For WDC, I sold a weekly cc which is now ITM and fine by me (I'll take 4% over two weeks any time). WFC is likely going to be a long-term hold which I'm okay with.

*****

I've also made non-theta options trades in a different account and they're not counted in the above profits. Bought IDEX, EWZ, and DGLY puts as well as XLF, NET, and SRG calls that all hit my profit targets. I wish I had gone ahead and bought LK puts because they were so cheap when I looked at them, but I decided not to for whatever reason I can't remember now.",1593561811

"FATErpg","t5_2toez","&gt;If possible, could you provide an example of when an inexperienced GM (like myself) would default to using a conflict,

You already provided an example where you would use something other than a Conflict - mook-only Conflict is never useful. So, I guess I have to give a more compelling.

I had a scene filled with the big bad the players have been chasing for some time. He was surrounded by mooks. But, the players had been in the scene for a while dealing with various other NPCs. Tons of Aspects had built up. Explosions, angry Nazi's fighting cops. Basically, all around mayhem. I asked what everybody was doing when the big bad showed up, listened intently, and laid it out as a Challenge. No big bad fight. Just some satisfying narration for how they cornered him and did what they wanted to do. My players agreed a conflict in that scenario was actually more hectic than they wanted and loved the resolution. Especially since we play 2 hour sessions.

Another scene, I had a notable named NPC who wasn't really interested in a showdown, but would stand their ground. Defend themselves with violence if need be. The PCs were interested in getting to him and showing him what's what. I handled it as a Contest, where the players had to get past various obstacles that the opponent put in their way. But, once they were through the obstacles, the final take-them-out action was a single Overcome roll.

Another time, I had a bunch of full stated scary shadow demons coming out of a portal to wreak havoc on anybody who got in the way of their goal - destroying some property. I asked around the table what everybody was doing. About half sounded like they were creating advantages and half sounded like they were jumping into combat. Although the actions sounded like they were made for a conflict, I said it was a challenge and everybody did a single roll. I picked an order that let the action build over the course of the rolls.",1593561811

So even though nothing new was said and nothing I didn't know, think and say already, I love watching these videos and support them and boost their reach by having them on while I, a woman, nod and probably look bitchy as fuck, while doing my also unappreciated task of cooking a meal. Because we also all know that's mandatory, paltry women's work that got (and still gets) zero recognition until men jumped into it and became chefs and got awards for it. They're gourmands and chefs. Many michelin stars, mucho respect. We're just cooks making homemade gruel and still told to stay in the kitchen, but ""it's just a jooooke"", you guys.

Same dealio as in beauty. Although the sheer perversion of being made to feel flawed and defective and that we need to buy certain stuff to have worth, as if only beauty counts when you're female and as if there's even only one way to be beautiful is far worse and more damaging in fairness. Too many generations of women have felt less than because of their natural bodies and nothing will ever be enough to provide suitable reparations for that.

It's a shame really. We're living through a time where one person's words could theoretically speak to and move more general issues in a more impactful way than any painting or exhibition could. It seems like the people who are skilled enough to do so are just not supported enough to put in the necessary attention to these things.

Possible exceptions to FB Legending are certain 30k-throwback models like Contemptors and Leviathans; I don't think Redemptor variants can replace these conceptually in the way that, e.g., Intercessors can replace Tactical Marines.

All new characters will be Primaris (most of which will not be literally new but rather Rubicon'd FB characters). Later in 9th I expect we'll start seeing Primaris'd Sanguinary Guard, etc. Lore wise, FB aren't going to be made anymore, and so as more and more die off or are Rubicon'd they'll just eventually go extinct like the Thunderwarriors.

They don’t *want* to see a Dem at all, but they can stomach a moderate like her and some of the slightly more open (I)’s and (R)’s may consider her for their vote",1593561813

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","i think Law Luffy and Kid would all have at least 2B. They’re bringing down two yonko, each having over 3B berries on their head. Luffy would be at the centre of it all, too, because of Big News Morgans, so I think Luffy would have about 3.5B, while Law and Kidd have 2B. I know Oda will keep the running gag of Zoro and Sanji’s bounties, so one of them will have 1B and the other might have 995M. Nami will probably still be under the 200M berries. Go D. Usopp’s bounty depends on how comedic Oda will make him. If Usopp does something funny but major to the war, he might put Usopp’s around the 700M mark, but if Usopp does something funny and minor to the war, it will raise to 300M. Chopper’s bounty could go two ways as well. If Oda keeps the gag running, Chopper’s bounty might increase by 100-200 berries. I think Oda will go the opposite way and let Big News Morgans see Chopper’s monster side and raise his bounty at the 500M’s. Robins bounty could be raised to 300M.
Franky’s bounty would also be raised to 300M, maybe 400M if Franky Emperor happens. Brook’s bounty could be raised to 200-300M because he can take the souls out of BM’s homies, which is a great power to have. Jinbe’s bounty will probably go to 1.3B because of his notoriety as a Warlord and a new Straw Hat. If Carrot ends up joining the crew, her bounty might be 100M.",1593561813

Dont own a car. Walk or use public transport.
Minimal savings. Only what I dont spend from my discretionary income.

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","Not really, considering sata 3 is 6Gbps and USB 3.1 gen 2 is 10Gbps. And USB 3.1 gen 1 supports up to 5Gbps, which isn't much worse than sata. So basically worst case scenario you're withing putting distance, and best case scenario you're like 60% faster.

Of course this is theoretical, but then so is 6Gbps on sata, so it really is apples to apples. In addition to SSDs being able to top out this USB speed (given they have an adequate controller for the flash chips), your random reads and writes will be way faster than an HDD over sata, even when accounting for USB overhead.

NVMe is a whole different ballpark, since you're looking at 32Gbps for PCIe 3.0 4x, and 4.0 4x is doubling that to 64Gbps.

Basically, this dude has a point. An external SSD will definitely outperform an external HDD, and it is highly likely to outperform an internal HDD too! And if you have a sata 3 ssd, a really awesome USB 3.1 gen 2 ssd will outperform that too!",1593561814

"traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns","t5_2uog0","I agree with this in kind of a wider cultural sense. I knew trans women existed when I was six or seven, and only found out that being trans as a DFAB person was an option when I was fourteen. Trans groups I've been to IRL are largely transfeminine, pamphlets, resources, news articles about trans people usually focus on trans women - a statement like ""mentruation = woman and no mentruation = man"", while equally offensive to DMAB and DFAB trans people on its own, has only been talked about as being offensive to trans women. People will say ""trans women are women"", but ""trans men are men"" or anything about nonbinary people is only sometimes tacked on as an afterthought. Contrapoints, while I adore her, can barely remember the existence of trans men every five videos or so.

This is 0% the fault of trans women/transfeminine people, IMO, and I definitely don't think the solution is for trans women to talk less or be in spaces less. A lot of the content I saw about trans women as a child was really hateful, and if I hadn't *really loved the idea of trans women just switching genders like magic for some reason* I probably would have ended up being hateful to trans women, which definitely isn't what anyone in the trans community wants. But it's a little difficult to see women like Laverne Cox and, yeah, Contrapoints, as beacons of real and beautiful transness, while DFAB trans people are more often the face of ""transtrending"" and cringey tumblr culture.",1593561815

That means he renigged on the compromise that was already in place.

You are only 25 days in on a very long haul and he is already manipulating the boundaries you need in order to work through his infidelity and lying.

The reality is, this behavior will continue and it will escalate. Because it is abusive and abuse always escalates.  And the longer you enable him and allow for him to push and stomp on your boundaries the harder it will be to pull out of this and the more damage you will absorb and have to work through on your own.",1593561816

Redcloak already knows this, but it isn't common knowledge and will validate Durkon as a messenger from Thor.

That said, I think Redclaok will have a harder time believing Thor.  Thor's message basically amounts to give up your weapon, your backup plan of letting the world be destroyed won't work, but we're totally willing to give you a fair deal.

However, I actually think that the negotiations may work, and Redcloak may begin planning a move against Xykon.  If we assume the end of comic will be a siege of Xykon's fortress, Xykon needs to suffer a major defeat here, and that will be a lot easier with Redcloak's cooperation.",1593561816

The *28 Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-Day Adventists* have 3 enumerated doctrines that references Jesus specifically (doctrines 2, 4, 9). None of them mention Michael.

\2. Will Satan bear our sins? (asking what SDA teaches)

Depends on what you mean by ""bear"". The SDA church means *""blame""* as in *""God shakes his fist at satan when /u/UnassuredCalvinist sins, you should shake your fist at him too.""* (doctrine 24)

Oftentimes people twist this to say *""SDAs believe that satan died on the cross for their sins""*, and that's horsecrap due to people not understanding that words like ""bear"" can have many definitions.",1593561817

There is no point in which renewable energy is more than a surplus added to the power than it is a reliable means to plan out a grid.

"TBI","t5_2xbl6","It's a huge problem for me (10 years post-injury) when I'm not on one of my medications which was actually a hail mary med (non-opioid) prescribed for severe neuropathic pain after pretty much everything else had failed. In my case, I have no sense of time passage even on my med, but it was difficult to distinguish that as a separate symptom from dissociation prior to this med. When I get trapped in a dissociative state, I can end up sitting down in a chair to do something for only a minute, and then realize hours later that I've been there doing nothing the whole time. On my meds, I lose smaller chunks of times, usually measured in minutes instead of hours. The rest of the time, I spend in a  state similar to the veil you've described, although I don't find that as disruptive personally.   


With all of said, it's important to point out that I was further into adulthood when I experienced my injury. Thanks to that and the professional psychological skills I have from years of work, I've been able to look at dissociation \*a little bit\* differently than I might have otherwise. Because I'm easily overwhelmed by sensory input, I treat that dissociative state as more of an asset than a liability. By seeing it as a tool that helps me to absorb the world at a pace I can manage, it seems to lower my anxiety levels to a point where they're not an impediment. With lower stress levels, the veil seems thinner even though it doesn't go away.",1593561817

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","So let's see how I can do. I would ask that you read this with the desire to create understanding and empathy. I'm not attempting to convert or convince you to my viewpoint, just trying to better explain part of my viewpoint.

Apologies for the long ramblingness of this post.

Before I start, I do want to see if I can form a coherent thought for why you are getting such passionate feedback. I'm going surmise part of it is because firearm ownership is actually part of identity. So with many people you aren't talking about just a hobby or abstract laws, but you are actually talking about (and can be implying an attack on) a part of their identity.

I'll see if I can expand on that in a minute, but I think that might be part of what you are seeing.

I will address it as a hobby, as that is what it is for most Americans. It's a hobby that we are passionate about, with a high level of passion. Part of that is driven by the amount of regulation on the hobby, which seems low to you but high to those who practice. Being in a state with liberal firearm laws (very few) but bordering a state with illiberal laws is part of a problem. If I track spent brass in to my car, and it falls out of my jacket and gets wedged somewhere. Then a few days later if I cross the border to my neighboring state it goes from being trash to being a felony since I don't have a license to possess ammunition components in that state. Getting that license is time consuming, expensive and only good for a single year for out of state residents as well.

There's a misunderstanding that it's sort of a single hobby, and not multiple ones. I personally like to collect service rifles, or civilian clones since modern ones aren't generally available. So my collection has several variants of the AR-15, AK-103, AK-74, Galil. Those are clones since they stopped adding new service rifles to the market in 1986 (this is important because it's part of the reason you see people freak out over registration). 

I also own several service pistols that I find iconic: 1911, Makarov, TT-33 (actually a clone), and some WWII rifles like the Mosin and M1 Garand.

I have others but those are probably the ones that ""matter"" to me. Because I like to disassemble, them change parts and tweak them to change their operating characteristics (for the clones) or for the historcial firearms like the M1 Garand and Mosin - I want to keep them as factory stock as I can. Neither of them have been made for almost 70 years, so it feels right to keep in a classic configuration.

Going forward, I sometimes feel like I should grab a FN-FAL to add the ""right arm of the free work"" to my collection and an AKM or SKS. Both of those mainly to be samples of service rifles from that era.

Now, I'm not unique but I'm also not the largest segment. Since I want things that are collectables generally made between WWII and the end of the Cold War, I need to do a lot of searching online and ordering to an FFL who can do the transfer and background check. So requiring all Person to Person sales to go through the FFL system isn't a big deal.

By the same token making all ammunition go through an FFL does become a big deal. Hunting ammo is generally more powerful than military ball ammo in the same caliber. If I run modern 30-06 through my Garand I risk breaking it since it is loaded to a higher pressure. Likewise ammunition made for eastern block pistols they stopped manufacturing in the 70s isn't commonly available nearby. So that directly affects me.

Again this is all written from my perspective. I know folks that are hunters (not very many though, most people who are range members are either into historical firearms (black powder) or modern service firearms) only, I know folks that only own AR-15s for plinking (one of my friends just got their Green Card \[French\] and bought a stripped AR receiver for $50 and built one). I have one friend who is a lawyer that only has a concealed carry and sold off all his modern stuff, but wants to get into lever action rifles and revolvers to do cowboy shooting (he was originally interested in 2 gun and 3 gun which require semi-automatics).

I mention that to give background on who I am and what I enjoy. To try and get some perspective that gun owners are interested in firearms for various reasons.

From a hobby perspective, think of what the response would be if there was legislation at the state levels that passed and with almost 50% of the US House that banned video games from using newer technology than the SNES or Sega Genesis. Again this is mainly for purpose of illistration and not something to think too deeply on. How would you expect the gaming public to react? I would imagine they would be upset, demonstrate and organize a voting block.

If not gaming, maybe the decided that Apple Products should only be allowable for use of government employees and police. Now the police can use them for their jobs, but the exception would also allow them to own them privately (Police are exempt from gun control, and can have private collections of banned to civilians weapons in the current states with Assault Weapons or Pistol bans).

Again I would expect there to be a large outcry of folks who would complain based on the lines we see for people buying the latest iPhone or XBox.

I think they would be correct to as well. Because in the first scenario it's a lot like the conversation of gun bans today. We are talking about banning guns that my great grandfather or grandfather would have been eligable to buy in the 60s or my father in the 80s.

Which when you think about it feels kind of crazy, firearms haven't made any significant leaps forward in 70 years or so and there are things that are now regulated away that.

Now let's go back to the identity part of this. I don't really want to delve in to this too deeply in this post, as I really want to keep writing from the hobby perspective vs deeper philosophical meaning. The gun, in particular the rifle, represents the power of the individual/consent of the govern to many. Again there are a multitude of reasons why that is, I would hope for the purposes of this you can accept it and move on. It also isn't a uniquely American thought either:“That rifle on the wall of the labourer's cottage or working class flat is the symbol of democracy. It is our job to see that it stays there.” - George Orwell

If you will bear with me and accept the identity politics. Ask yourself how the statement ""Hell Yes we are going to take your AR-15"" or ""You don't need that"" feels? Well it feels at best someone saying that your interests are wrong. Which doesn't feel good, going further you can also read in to it a statement that you are untrustworthy.

Now the funny thing is feelings are not dependant on facts or intentions. They are dependant on interpretation. If you tell someone they are untrustworthy, or something they like about themselves is wrong, you will get a reaction. I've heard this called an ""Identity Quake"", if you tell someone who values their integrity or trustworthiness highly, to the point where it makes up a strong part of their identity, and say something that can be INTERPRETED as an attack on that part of the identity they response will be to resist. Generally pretty strongly, and not necessarily in a productive way.

Was there a point to all that I've written? Maybe not, my guess is that you may find it hard to relate to what I've said. Though I do hope it is coherent. I apologize for overusing paranthesis and run-on sentenses.",1593561818

Send group communications to everyone. There are lots of ways to ensure that your coworkers receive your help, feel like that help is equitable, and know where that help came from.

This is the real answer. You *never* share *anything* with just one other person.

You write a email or some kind of document, saying exactly what you did, how you did it, then you send it to everyone, so everyone knows 100% for sure who done did it. You want to make sure that *you* get the credit.

If you publish it and send it to your boss and colleagues, there's no way that they can take credit.

If your boss is the type that says, ""Only send your shit to me and don't tell anyone else about it,"" it is 100% because they want to steal your work, so you need to find another job. You cannot fight it, don't go down that road, it is doom. Just get another job. If you can't get another job, then just take your paycheck and don't do ny more than you have to do. Do minimum work.

If i had to come up with some stupid OP abilities for it...

Set 1

Buff Doublebuff - Every time a buff is applied apply it again.

Debuff Punisher - Deal more damage to enemies that are debuffed.

Set 2

Thunder God's Might - Replace the Shapeshift gauge with a Drive Gauge. When the gauge is 50% full or higher you can transform into Thor. The player gains 50% damage reduction  and 100% damage increase. While shifted the player still takes damage to their own HP. (Basically Tiki)

Thunder God's Fury - Strength, Crit chance, and Crit Damage increase by 10% for every 15 combo. Stacks endlessly

Active skill (Recharges through Shifting or Attacking)

Thunderclap: Deal 150% damage around you then drop a damaging area that hits 75 times for 10% each.",1593561820

Ex. My 6700k is running 4.7ghz at 1.41v but having it on auto pushed voltage all the way up to 1.52v.  
Its best to manually input the voltage your motherboard reads at stock in then increase your frequency up little by little until it crashes, add a little bit of voltage until you can boot then stress test for 10-15 min. then you repeat adding more frequency then voltage until you either get too hot or need too much voltage and hit a brick wall.

As Coronavirus cases are surging in many areas we remind you to excercise an abundance of caution. Pay attention to your local and national guidelines, continue practicing preventative safety measures, do not meet anyone if you have been exhibiting symptoms, and ideally get tested beforehand if able. If you do not feel you can safely meet with someone then it is best not to do so at all.

Ho avuto regolarmente a che fare con quasi tutti gli ospedali di FI fin da piccolo e non ho mai avuto un problema, né conosco qualcuno che ne abbia avuti di memorabili, in quasi trent’anni. Ma la mia o la tua esperienza singola contano poco, in ogni caso, oltre al fatto che già in due commenti siamo a somma zero.

Il servizio sanitario nazionale è un mastodonte variegato che sfugge alle generalizzazioni: nella stessa città ti può capitare un reparto eccellente di ortopedia che magari convive con uno pessimo di neurologia, e così via. A volte c’entra con il personale di ogni livello che manca (una bella costante) o che cambia, o con coordinatori/simili che si trovano a gestire team troppo grossi, e via dicendo. Secondo me l’atteggiamento più realista a riguardo è quello di evitare la generalizzazione, che sia a partire dalle classifiche (ché le storture, come ben esemplificavi, esistono sempre; io potrei testimoniare negativamente per Modena allo stesso modo) o che sia, al contrario, a partire dalle esperienze personali.
Insomma, è chiaro che poi uno fa le sue scelte in base a come si è trovato personalmente, ma non le motiverei con argomenti troppo netti e generali, specie se si parla di città dove la gente, mediamente, sta bene (e mi riferisco non solo a Firenze, ma anche di nuovo a Modena, dove spero non vivrò mai ma dove la gente sta tendenzialmente bene).

Ovviamente, tutto ciò esula dal tuo discorso più personale e mi dispiace per quello che avete passato, spero vi vada meglio ovunque vogliate mettere o rimettere radici.",1593561821

"algonquinpark","t5_2sqx8","Awesome! Thanks for the feedback, it is certainly appreciated. 

For clarification the 8 Litre clean water jug is JUST for camp. I like to filter about 7 litres to use for drinking at camp, cooking at camp, and coffees in the morning. We do NOT carry it full of water, just use it to fill up at camp so we aren't constantly having to filter water and dump any leftover in the morning. We will only be carrying the nalgenes, so 1.5L and filtering along the way when needed for fill ups until camp. 

Our cook kit is aluminum, here is the link: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B071S31CGN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
We could certainly just boil the water in the pot, and am going to do that this trip to confirm the uselessness of the kettle.

The tent is certainly on the heavy end and size wise, it takes up alot of my pack. We camped around new zealand (car camped) in a shitty 30$ tent and got lit up by a couple big storms, soaked right through. Having a weather proof shelter was high on our list after that experience and the MSR Elixir ticked that box. I now do regret the purchase because of the size/weight. All in the learning and I think we may end up purshasing an alternative sleep system when we get to longer hikes and using the Elixir for car camping. We are actually bringing one of the mesh tent similar to that one just to have as an area away from bugs. Honestly didn't even cross my mind to just throw a tarp over it and it's essentially the same thing. We'll try a night out in it this trip, that could be huge. 

2 things of bug spray, they are 100ml each Woods Icaridin spray. Could be overkill again but we got eaten alive in Killarney a few weekends ago so are going overkill on the bug resistance, because we are bringing some bug lotion as well lol 

Definitely don't carry a map book, just have a printed map the section I need.

Yeah I think a lot of it comes down to the inexperience, and once we do this trip we will have a much better idea of what else we can cut out or change. And when we upgrade to longer hikes, there will be more of a necessity to find more lightweight solutions. We do value the comfort at these distances and we aren't anywhere near crushing 95kms in 2 days (that is impressive). 

At some point we will find that distance where those comfort items are lost!",1593561821

"AnimeFigures","t5_2swee","I'm in Canada, and have made a few orders with both EMS and Air Small Packet this month. 

Air SP is cheapest and has been arriving in about 3-4 weeks. All my Air SP packages so far have avoided customs fees. 

EMS is fastest and a bit more expensive (usually about 10 to 20 dollars more). Those packages have been arriving in about 2 weeks for me. In my experience, about 50% of these packages get hit with customs fees.

However, keep in mind that Air SP/PP parcels are only insured up to 6,000 yen, while EMS parcels are insured up to 20,000 yen. So if you are ordering something expensive, it may be best to go with EMS. I have never had a package from Japan get lost, but you never know.",1593561821

If you get enough people to fight for free markets, and you think the Ancap culture is now strong enough to win over all the others

there's chance to win this fight, otherwise i would focus on a rapid expansion of the anti-state culture, until it becomes an inevitable reality  


We had a capitalist president in Argentina(Menem) in the 1990s, but the culture was still with populism.. that's why after this president was gone, we have fallen back to that decadent leftist road, then that capitalist got demonized, damaging more the argentinian culture and the chances of capitalism to come back.  
If the culture doesnt go along with the movement, it's not sustainable and it can be even harmful, we want something that lasts forever.

&gt;As “evidence of justifications” for the changes to early voting, the State offered purported inconsistencies in voting hours across counties, including the fact that only some counties had decided to offer Sunday voting. … The State then elaborated on its justification, explaining that “[c]ounties with Sunday voting in 2014 were disproportionately black” and “disproportionately Democratic.”… In response, SL 2013-381 did away with one of the two days of Sunday voting. … Thus, in what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times, the State’s very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race — specifically its concern that African Americans, who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats, had too much access to the franchise.",1593561822

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in LGPE and Sw/Sh:

1. Do not discuss trades over PM or chat. This is prohibited by [Rule 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_4_-_do_not_discuss_trades_privately.), as scammers often contact other users privately to avoid having their actions seen in public. Please report anyone violating this rule to the moderators. 
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner are using, it is important that you double check that you have paired with with the right person.
3. You must have been granted [Poké ball](https://i.imgur.com/XgAhEXa.png) level flair or higher (10 or more approved trades) to make trades with shiny or event Pokémon. If you have sufficient flair and are trading shiny or event Pokémon, please make sure that your post and other users’ offers contain the full details required by the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pokémon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report them so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

In addition, once you're done trading in this thread, you can mark your thread as closed by commenting `[close]` as a top-level reply to your post to update the flair and let others know you're not looking for further trades. This is completely optional and you don't have to do it if you'd like others to continue to offer trades in this thread!

Besides a very very limited amount of spontaneous inventions, even the most presupposed ""traditions"" are usually the result of some sort of historical cultural appropriation between a low and high power group - be it recently or not. 

But I mean, besides that, ""sharing and inviting others into your culture"" and what you view as harmful cultural appropriation? Because I can 100% guarantee you that you can go to any practically any tradition or discipline on the planet and find a great deal of people happily promoting white people to learn, enjoy, and reproduce it. Speaking as a musician, I've never personally met anybody who responds with anything other than abject glee and happiness to teach white people or any people about their artform - and encourage them to continue to practice and show it off and get more people interested as they go on.

See how that goes... if you survive, that is. 

There are plenty of majority-white neighborhoods a black person can hang out in and they'll be treated with respect. I live in such a neighborhood.

She can know almost every day he’ll be away from now until next year.  It’s not changing without notice it’s just unusual.

Where is the whim in that?  

I have MAJOR issues with unpredictability and flakes.  I won’t plan with people who can’t manage their time to honor their plans.  And when those same people complain that I’m not home when they are or am not with them enough I sometimes have to point out why.

But this isn’t that!  Of course her partner wants to see her when she doesn’t have the kid as much as possible.  He may also want to see her more.  That’s up to him to manage.  

I could see this being an issue if meta was trying to use the time her husband is away to see someone else who can’t host etc.  But that doesn’t sound like it’s an issue.  Or if it was a question if we can never do weekend things because she’s always only child free on the weekends.  

Maybe it’s just me but I’ve spent most of my poly life dating partnered men who fill their calendars in with work and family stuff and then get to dates.  Someone is ALWAYS being the one who accommodates pressing and time sensitive things.  But they don’t have kids, he works from home and she doesn’t work at all.  Come on, as long as she has the schedule they ought to be able to accommodate that 80% of the time.  

What feels unusual here is that the newer partner is the one with unusual availability.  If partner wants to see her alone that’s when he needs to show up.  He can also always say hey Sunday is my day at home and I won’t change that for something small.",1593561825

Only morons would walk away from those thinking they’re in the right for being nazis or white supremacists. What I’m talking about is the racism displayed in something like Song of the South or Birth of a Nation. Again, not saying to ban them, but the racism displayed in those is real and it is harmful. We should be having conversations about that. To compare it to fictional, clearly over the top, nonsensical violence is invalidating the fact that bigotry is harmful, and can be displayed through fiction. I’ll also add that I don’t believe the people censoring things actually care about the issue, and are more interested in saving face, whether they wrote it (Tina Fey) or are just hosting it (Netflix, Hulu). It seems like we’re not really disagreeing here, but I just take issue with comparing senseless violence, which I consider to be relatively harmless, to biases in writing.",1593561825

"FireEmblemHeroes","t5_3imv0","I didn’t use bike, but this is as good a place as any to share my story, I used lysithea, Leila, paired with legendary chrom, and dancing Ishtar. Kind of a weird team, but works really well. Chrom was able to tank the green mage that spawns at the beginning then he could kill in player phase and that was his biggest green threat.  On the left of the map the green dagger and blue tome cav would always come downwards. 

In my first attempt I wasn’t really paying attention just feeling out the map to check for reinforcement locations and stuff. But Leila rused the blue cav in a good spot so lysithea could take a hit from him. That meant next turn I could kill him with one of my units and almost win on my first attempt. 

I say almost because even though I killed seliph I made a dumb mistake with the staff cav late in the map and Leila died so I had to start over. But like I said I wasn’t really paying enough attention, so I didn’t remember my moves so I had to spend about a half an hour trying tons of different combinations to just get past the one blue cav killing lysithea. And when I could get her to live someone else died. Most of my attempts would die in the second turn right when the cav comes down and either killed lysithea or the nearby dagger would kill someone right after. My best attempt by far was my very first try.

When I finally did figure out the right moves I did the first try that same match was when I won the map.",1593561827

"Michigan","t5_2qhtl","Fuck this!

This is a fucking lie.  I was at this protest.  I saw what happened.  Let's go through these lies one at a time.

1) He states that the back window got smashed.  Look   up any of the videos online and that is CLEARLY a lie.  We didn't smash any windows.

2) He states we reached for the handles, which is never in any of the videos.  I saw no such actions taken.  Even if that is the case, that is a piss poor excuse to run over people.  They have car locks.

3) He states the car was ""surrounded"", which is also a lie.  This is a bit tougher to break down though.  I will try and go through this but it's a lot. 

Some of the longer videos show us approach the car blockade they made, which they had no reason for we had been in that same exact street earlier.  There was no reason to block it.  You can see in those videos that we approached 4 cars all in a line running perpendicular to the street.  As we passed the cops, and I want this to be clear that some of the group had walked past them and others were just doing the same, one of the vehicles one turned and moved into the crowd bumping protestors.  It's clear they had to of turned into us as they were now parallel with the street so clearlynthey decided move into us.  Those that got bumped into, at the head of the group and in front of me turned turned around at the vehicle already bumping them and tried and yelled at them to stop.  Seems reasonable doesn't?  Ya know ask the guy bumping you with a car to stop.  Others, moved in around the sides and yelled at them.  The rear was left open so they had an opportunity to leave.  The officer proceeded to continue to bump into the protestors standing there, so they jumped on the hood to avoid their legs getting bent backwards.

Now I bet some of you are thinking, ""Why the fuck not move out of the way?"".  I have several answers for your. For starters we shouldn't have to move.  We are peacefully marching down a street and passed them.  Why do they need to drive through us?  That seems like a better question.  Secondly we did this because it often works.  Earlier in that same protest a vehicle RAMMED protestors on bikes as we made a right turn approaching our second stopping point, Clark Park.  Me and others got to the front of the car and yelled and slammed on the hood giving a clear signal that they couldn't go through us.  That time the officer did what he should do and that was back up and go around.  I want to make it clear that this fucking asshole had the same opportunity.

Now to the events that you most often see.  As the officer began inching forward, this is when most videos start, and show protestors jump on the hood.  It also shows us coming up to the car and him inch forward more.  The officers clear lack of respect for the lives of those in the crowd made us act.  The initial gut reaction you have is to fucking back your brothers and sisters up so we all moved forward.  This whole time though they were inching forward, never looking back or thinking and essentially surrounded themselves.  We did NOT surround the vehicle they drove into a group of people.  When you do that you tend to get surrounded.  That was a result of their bad choice, not ours.


4) The idea that they were scared and needed to get out is silly.  One video clearly shows the officers face and he does not look scared.  Furthermore after running us over he just moved ahead of us and then continued driving in front of our march as if nothing had happened.  Furthermore of the 4 vehicles that were there why is only one needing to drive through us?  If we were assaulting the cops why didn't all 4 drive off in terror?  Because that's not what happened.

5) What wasn't mentioned AT ALL was that two cop cars ran drove into the crowd.  The second one which went through people after the first isn't caught on video as much.  That car hit people as well and then tore through the protestors, such as me, who were trying to run up and pick up injured people and make sure they got to medics.  So I had to dodge out of the way of a cop car that didn't give a single shit I was there, all while I was trying to check to see who was injured and needed help.  Probably not as much video because we were preoccupied with getting to hurt people and several of the people video taping got hit by the first car.

Don't listen to shit these cops say.  They are lying to protect each other.  You can easily tell because some of the lies they have clearly contradict the video evidence.",1593561827

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","I'm going to buck the trend here and say yes, you should be using more current stuff.

Part of the problem with sticking with older versions that's overlooked in this sub is that it looks fine *to you*, but you are not the business. You don't know what feature is in the 2020 build Reader DC or Excel 2019 that your users might find useful if they could access it. Do you know what XLOOKUP is and why it's a huge performance improvement over VLOOKUP? Did you know that Excel 2016 doesn't have XLOOKUP, it's a feature that was added this year? Are there number crunchers in your org who would benefit from this new feature, which would increase productivity and save the company time (and therefore money)? My org is financial services and they work on a lot of large models in excel, so that's just an example from my sphere.

As another random example, sometime in the last few years the free version of Reader gained the ability to drop a scanned signature into PDFs with a couple of clicks. Instead of printing, signing and scanning, a bunch of our internal processes have changed to using a scan of your signature to approve stuff. I use it all the time when a supplier needs a ""signed copy"" of the quote. It's been fantastic in COVID WFH where most people don't have printers and scanners. If we stuck to an old version like we used to we wouldn't have that feature, to the detriment of the business as a whole.

While those are just two random examples, my main point is that we in IT like to think we know what the business needs, but most of us really don't. At best, we know how the business works right now. Ignoring potential business gains because ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" or ""that's how we've always done it"" isn't a strength. 

Give your users the latest tools. If possible, keep an eye on what's being added to your main tools and try to predict who in your org might find a new feature useful, then send them some details and offer to help. Be an agent for positive change.",1593561828

As far as swimming goes please take a look at the following clip from Alien: Resurrection @1:46 https://youtu.be/N1nybz7AGZE. Aliens seem to have an excellent swimming ability inherently. The human spawned alien's hands from Alien are already webbed, but additional fin type appendages may increase its swimming ability further.

The spear-like tail the aliens currently have, been shown to be extremely deadly and sharp enough to pierce nearly anything, including other aliens' own sturdy exoskeleton. I wouldn't swap it for a beaver tail, though I cannot necessarily  say its a better or worse alternative.

~~It doesn't take a hanford scientist to put 2 and 2 together and see cases are strongly trending with the % of migrant workers in an area.~~  (EDIT: Apparently you can't say that on Reddit because its considered hating on the Hispanic community... but that is a fact from data freely available out they simply have a majority of the cases per capita.    Jeez you guys are as bad as climate change deniers)   Only the last question to Insee even addressed this, but it seems to me a focused outreach should be done to reach the Latino community directly.  Why can't he have a Spanish translator for part of the press conference?  That might get the point accross.  His response was only how it's sad the Latino community has been hit hard.

To a lot of extremely misguided and insecure people, it looks like favoritism that they get a special movement and a special parade, and they respond with ""What about me?  What do I get?""  Being asked to consider that someone else's life may also matter?  Their first thought is ""What's in it for me?""

It doesn't help that a lot of them do feel disadvantaged, though not necessarily from racism.  Just by life in general.  But these are people that are rarely able to consider life from someone else's point of view.  They're stuck on themselves and all they see is that they themselves aren't getting what they want.  I can't discount that a few of them actually have problems like mental illness, horrible home life, etc. that are being ignored.  In a lot of other cases, they are simply being immature.  They want to be the center of everyone's attention and priorities, and will get huffy if something is going on on Earth that isn't explicitly about them.",1593561829

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","I do suppose I could end this with what I think may be agreeable in terms of a path forward. Given my interests, I would like to see the Machine Gun Registry re-opened. That was closed in 1986, so that now a machine gun like an M16 will run you 16K easy. It will run a police department about $700 and be 35 years newer for them as well.

I know it sounds crazy doesn't it? But there's an interesting thing about the machine gun registry. We used it for 50 years to track civilian owned machine guns. In the 50 years that we used it the best estimate for murders with those tracked firearms is:

2.

At least one of which was by a corrupt police officer murdering an informant. Of course we seem to have forgotten that police are civilians now, but until 1986 those were registered as civilian weapons as well.

So I would turn the clock back there to start. Part of that is because I would get something out of it. I would also remove the dicky amendment from the CDC. It doesn't actually ban studying guns as part of public health (you can find some studies done during the Obama administration), but it does ban gun control advocacy which has a chilling affect on them creating any recommendations at all.

Assuming we opened that registry, and kept it open then I think we could look at modernizing it and adding other weapons as well as a central tracking system.

You will often hear that registration is the first step to confiscation, and while we have seen that in some individual states. I would say the more pressing concern with registration is the closing of the registry.

If we did that we could also add basic gun safety to the public school curriculum to help with accidents (which is a fairly low number to begin with). The two biggest things to tackle would be homicides, which I think will require us working on new safety nets that help people move up the social ladder. I would think people would be much less likely to murder others if they were able to build a better life for themselves.

Mental illness is the second thing. Two-thirds of all people killed with guns are suicides. We should be emphasising mental health and making it more accessible in this country. Right now it's impossible where I live to make an appointment with a therapist (I have panic attacks \[horrible chest pains\]). I can pay for it, but I had to make do with self-help books and stoic philosophy unless I was willing to have myself committed. Basically unless you are willing to say you are a danger to yourself or others (hint - I'm not, I had help years ago and follow up with a GP regularly), they had no one to help you.

Again, I'm pausing to ask myself where I am going with all this. I guess it comes to what I want to see in my ideal world. I want to see a country where people are free to enjoy what they enjoy and we look at solutions that don't focus on removing things from the public but work on creating systems where there is less desperation.

I'm reminded of my father-in-law that recently immigrated from central asia. He bought some tools so he could work on tractors, and his coworkers have borrowed them. He said the USA is the closest to a communist country he has ever been in because nobody is stealing things. He said every two weeks in Russia or India he would have to replace stolen tools. Here he leaves things in a common area and it's all right there and people bring things back. He was shocked at that.

Which is interesting to think about, we've come along way. I think we can go a lot further too. But I also think we can get there without removing the ability to buy the firearms we can today.",1593561830

Since you're using 2H and D-Swing I would also consider using Stuhn's over one of your sets (likely Clever Alchemist but maybe NMA if your sustain isn't great). You'll be proc'ing it constantly on your spammable and it'll give you fantastic Penetration.

For monster, Balorgh this patch is absolutely off the chain and if you use Big Daddy on a target and have Stuhn's up, you will have ~20k Penetration (assumes also Lover and Sharpened 2H) and simply absurd damage. Or you could sacrifice the monster and use Malacath's as many are doing, especially in BGs and non-CP Cyrodiil.

You could even do something like Stuhn's (or NMA), Balorgh, Potentates jewels, Master's Bow, and Maelstrom Axe as the Maelstrom Axe applies a fairy strong DoT (buffed by Necro passives) after using Critical Rush to gap-close.",1593561830

"kansascity","t5_2qngc","I grew up in the suburbs of KC (which I hated and fled to Austin as soon as I graduated from high school) but downtown KC was just barely shaking the dust off when I moved back and I've enjoyed watching it grow up around me, as Austin did similarly while I was there (only on at much much much faster pace). I have lived in downtown KC longer than I lived in downtown Austin so there's that.. I mean, I loved the walkability of my downtown neighborhood and similarly I love that about Kansas City. I have a strong feeling the things I like about Kansas City probably won't be of much interest to you but there are a lot of really cool organizations you can get involved in and I like that about Kansas City (you might like BikeWalkKC). One of the things I really like about Kansas City over my time in Austin was less about my experience and more about just the people in the city in general. In Kansas City, it is fascinating to me that a handful of wealthy families give bucketloads of money to organizations in the city and try to make the city a better place to live. Kauffman, Hall Family, Kemper (both UMB and Commerce Kempers haaa), Bloch Family (of H&amp;R Block), Jim and Virginia Stowers, and I'm sure I'm missing a few. Lots of cool opportunities for education and career growth here that I never found in Austin. I received a hefty scholarship to finish school from a local nonprofit in KC.. virtually unheard of to give adults scholarships to finish their degrees but the opportunity is there for people who want it. Additionally, KC has free training opportunities for jobs, which was never something I found in Austin (tbh I wasn't looking super hard ha). Full Employment Council has opportunities to learn skills in healthcare and the tech industry for super cheap/free as well as Launchcode, which the Kauffman Foundation helped fund. Kansas City has a really rich history and we work really hard to hold on to it. Austin is a place that would rather forget about history as quickly as possible for the sake of real estate dollars. My friend visited Kansas City just shortly before COVID-19 and hit up the library's Missouri Valley Special Collection to learn about the history of Kansas City. His favorite part I think was definitely learning about the Mob presence in the city.

I think Kansas City is definitely in the early stages of what Austin was in 2006 but I'm slightly worried about our uptick in violent crime of late. Austin was always a place I felt safe walking down the street by myself and never worried about anything happening to me. I used to walk home from La Zona Rosa after concerts quite a bit, never worried. Here, I start to get a little concerned if I'm out alone after 10p and I definitely stick to my neighborhood (which tbh isn't even all that safe lately). But maybe the best part of the whole thing is a drastically lower cost of living. I left Austin when my 400 square foot efficiency's sticker price went from $500 to $2500 overnight. I thought for SURE they'd raze the building quickly after everyone would be forced out but NOPE! Tons of people stayed (because location I assume) and they just tore the place down a year or two ago I think. Insane!",1593561831

With CGT in a super fund at a rate of 15% (assets held for less than 12 months) or 10% (assets held for more than 12 months) a $50,000 capital loss will save you somewhere between $5,000 and $7,500 in future CGT.

SMSF admin costs add up real quick.

ESuperfund appears to be at the cheaper end of fees and charges $999 p.a. Plus the ATO supervisory levy of $259 p.a..

You’ll consume your future CGT savings in 4 or 5 years.

"ladybonersgw","t5_2t4jw","Dear Doingitup,

We're really excited that you posted, but it had to be removed because it violated Rule 2 - our rules are what keep LBGW one of the top visited NSFW sites on Reddit, so we need to ensure that our hot post providers always follow them.

Here is a good way to make sure you are following the rules. Rule 2 means that you must show at least one full feature of the eyes, nose or mouth, and at least 1/2 of one of the other two. For noses, 1/2 means about one cm (1/8 inch) above the upper curve of the nostril. 

One way to ensure that you're doing it right is to draw a line about an 1/8th inch above the upper curve of both nostrils - to comply with rule 2, you need to show all of your face below that line.

A second way to meet the rule is to show the full profile of your face. If you decide to post a profile of your face, it will require that full side of your face (from your chin to above the forehead) in no more than a 90 degree profile.

Thanks for posting and we look forward to your next compliant post.

[We've augmented the rules with pictures to make it easier to comply. Please review the rules here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ladybonersgw/comments/grxt0i/updated_clarified_rules_now_with_picture_examples/)",1593561833

One of these hurdles for example would be the stronger COVID-related guidelines in Canada compared to Vegas. Another might be the fact that many of the people from the arena, cable company, broadcast station are relying on it being there and not having it would be a loss of revenue.

Basically there’s a lot of moving parts but the easiest, cheapest route for the NHL at this point would be to stick to the plan as much possible.",1593561833

"mlb","t5_2qrrr","It's a shame that you're letting your limited experiences mold your opinion of how the world works. Especially given that you were a kid at the time, you have no idea whatsoever about the financial obligations of the African American families that lived nearest to you.

In your example, who are you referring to that is claiming to be less fortunate? You also claim that your parents made extra effort to accommodate your pursuit of sports -- given how you butchered the usage of 'their, there and they're' in your statement, is it fair to assume that your parents didn't make an extra effort to insure that you learned grammar?

No, it isn't... because I don't know the full context of your upbringing any differently than you know the back story behind why the black kid's parents didn't buy him cleats. Maybe they wanted their kid to focus on academics instead of sports because they realized that the odds of becoming a professional athlete are slim. Maybe he played basketball because it's nowhere near as expensive and takes far fewer kids to play than baseball, hockey or lacrosse.

The point is, neither of us know... and in situations like this, it's far wiser to listen and try to understand how others feel than to paint with a wide brush and assume that your personal experience is enough to know what's going on for everyone.

Regarding your two teams scenario, why can't we have both teams? Social justice is necessary and parental involvement is necessary. Social justice can directly impact parental involvement by reducing the number of families that are broken by biased incarceration practices. And given that you had two parents and still have poor grammatical skills, I'd advise against guessing who has parental involvement in their lives and who doesn't.",1593561833

All ships would display a flag identifying country of origin. If a ship pulled into a port and was not of the country they were claiming to be the ship would likely be impounded and the crew arrested. Most ships had papers verifying country of origin. 

Signal flags were used to, well, signal between different ships and between ships and ports. This would help ships determine when they could enter port, and where to go once in the harbour.

Most trade ports would have pilots employed by the port/habour master who would sail out to inbound ships in a light, fast vessel. Once there they offer their assistance in navigating the approach to port and in finding a birth for the ship in question. They did this for a fee.

In times of war there would likely be gun implacements and warships stationed in major ports to deal with and potentially dangerous vessels approaching the port. There may also be barrier defenses at the mouth of a harbour, like a chain, to stop vessels from entering without permission.",1593561837

The inner nerd in me decided to keep a tally of how many times I died on each boss.  Some of these I'm proud of (only died once against White Defender), others... not so much (flukemarm lawl).  

Glad I stuck with it! Radiance took a longggg time.  Felt like I would go ten times in a row without making it to the platform stage.  [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LlIDw_CXPjLvmeC_uvo3zZCYFzcrZM8iu5CDgZTVbuY/edit?usp=sharing) is the google doc for anyone that is as nerdy as me.  

Charms - Quick Slash, Unbreakable Strength, Shaman Stone, Mark of Pride and Sprint Master for every boss besides Markoth (sub quick slash for Soul Eater).

I didn't watch tutorials on any boss besides Markoth, and went with the strategy of wacking him with nail arts and then spamming spells after the second phase.  Still a tough boss.

Gonna set this game down for now... because PoH without charms sounds like a recipe for disaster... but I'm sure I'll be back! XD",1593561839

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","Nobody stands in a museum or buys a Picasso without knowing that it's a Picasso that they're looking at. 

They didn't separate the art from the person, they just knowingly chose to ignore some information in favour of others. 

Depending on your personal values or moral code or upbringing you may choose to respond very differently to various problematic figures. Can we still listen to Michael Jackson knowing that he's a convicted child sexual abuser with more accusations piling up post-humously? Can we still watch movies that was produced by Harvey Weinstein? Can anyone7 still watch The Cosby Show knowing the dad is sitting in jail for rape? Can we still read Harry Potter with the innocence of not knowing JK Rowling is a TERF? Can people ever watch football ever again when a Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest against police brutality, oh sorry, to disrespect the flag and hate America? 

Yeah well some of those examples are not like the others lol but that's what came to mind. 

Sure, nobody is perfect, but some crimes against humanity are despicable enough to negate the good that preceded. Is anyone's art good enough to the point where we tolerate and turn a blind eye to the lives they destroyed, in this case Picasso basically R Kelly-ed a whole lot of women, a few of his wives and children were driven to suicide by his malignant narcissism and misogyny.

""Women are machines made for suffering"", ""For me there are only two kinds of women: goddesses and doormats"". Picasso's quotes about women would fit right in a porno or fanfiction, but this man legitly thought women are born to be his toys. 

Of course I don't think people should be depraved of looking at Picasso's work, but I certainly do think that his work should be shown together with more context, specifically his sadistic, predatory and psychopathic ""work"" process that requires the blood, heart and soul of young women as his pigment and transmute them into paintings so good that the world just casually forgot to mention that he fucked an underaged girl to get it done.

As for Bragg, I really don't get your point because my Google search results say that Fort Bragg was established in 1918, that's way beyond the civil war period. Is there a different Fort Bragg?

Firstly; you're not the asshole for quietly and privately pointing out that the ring is from Etsy. That's a reasonable thing to point out, since cheap engagement rings are sort of a thing.

The point at which you become the asshole is the point where you doubled down and didn't accept her answer. Why on earth don't you believe her? Why did you feel the need to push harder?

When first reading this, I had no idea what your sexual identity had to do with this anecdote. How many partners you and your sister have had seemed utterly irrelevant, and sort of a weird thing to bring up apropos of nothing.

But now that I see you refusing to believe your sister, it gives me the impression you think your sister is naive? Or dumb somehow? I can't see why else you having more sexual partners than her would have anything to do with her telling you she doesn't want an expensive engagement ring.

YTA for not letting your sister just make her own choices and live her own life without insisting that she doesn't know what she wants.",1593561841

But should they get fired for saying ""All Lives Matter?"" Clearly a misinformed slogan and it does cheapen BLM... but is it really a fireable offense? 

What if someone who works for a think tank shares an empirical study saying that violent protests tend to alienate voters away from their cause? Should they be fired? 

What if someone wore black face at a Halloween party in 2018 not to degrade black people but to parody white people who wear black face (similar to what Robert Downy Jr. won an academy award for)?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There are biologic aspects that make men more likely (or increase their likelihood) to be killers. People with the karyotype XYY have increase testosterone, which increases anger and rage (in layman’s terms) and while the condition is rare, their representation in prison is higher than in the population, and as they have the Y chromosome, they are male. 

But there are also social aspects that increase makes to be killers, including emotional repression and attitudes by society. Society placed stigma on men for acting different that they expected, and being told they were abnormal only fueled them to be more abnormal. There have been numerous studies on certain serial killers, and many of then experienced physical or mental abuse, usually by their parents, as a means to make them act “right,” which psychologists think was a factor in their progression towards hurting others. Alternatively, when girls act out if their gender roles, people often don’t scold them, and merely ignore them. Think of a boy 50 years ago who likes playing with dolls or with girls rather than boys, and how their family would react and how they might try to make the boy more masculine, and then think of a girl who liked playing with trucks or with boys rather than girls, and if their family would make them act more feminine. 

As an example, look at the show F Is For Family. The Fitzsimmons’ family has two children, each with behavioral problems. The son starts fights and is hinted at having been molested by the priest (in one episode) but his father ignores the obvious signs that his son has problems and threatens to beat him (and it’s implied he has beaten him before because of fighting).  The daughter is a legit sociopath, yells at her brother to get out of her way or she’ll replace his insulin with nail polish again, has hurt numerous other people, but her behavior is ignored because people write her off as a girl. 

This shows that women can have the same underlying issues, and may act out, but their actions are ignored. There was a woman with severe post partem depression, who killed her daughter, and the police spent weeks searching for the killer before looking into the mother.",1593561843

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","I'm currently DM'ing a campaign for my kids (ages 8 and 4).  One of the biggest factors to contend with is their shorter attention span.  Generally they're good for up to about 60 to 90 minutes of game play (or roughly the length of a kids movie), but after that, they're done and want to do something else.  As a result, we usually try to start playing about 60 to 90 minutes before their bedtime, and once their done playing, they can go to bed.

Regarding classes, Fighter is a good easy class, but don't shy away from letting them run a caster.  My 8yo son is currently running a 3rd level champion fighter while my 4yo daughter is running a 3rd level light cleric.  I also grabbed some kid-oriented character sheets on DMsGuild that have been very helpful, especially the spellcards for handling the cleric spells: [https://www.dmsguild.com/product/245446/Kid-Friendly-Character-Sheet](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/245446/Kid-Friendly-Character-Sheet) 

As for game play, they'll like moving the characters and rolling lots of dice, so provide them ample opportunities to do both.  Some simple puzzles can be fun for them too.

Regarding violence, consider letting their attacks knock out humanoid foes instead of killing them.  It's also good to have some non-humanoid foes like skeletons, twig blights, animated armor, flying swords, fire snakes, mephits and so forth that they can bash and destroy.",1593561843

You dont get to ignore them though.  Jews lost their lives because of Nazis. Around the world and even in america people have lost their lives because of american troops in a million different wars. Similar story for other countries like Russia, China, England, France etc etc. All of these countries have killed innocent people knowingly and lied about it.

"cosplay","t5_2qkju","Congratulations on coming out and happy Pride! &lt;3

This is a simple and cool character design, so definitely a good first cosplay. Going forward, I'm assuming this is Death of the Endless from The Sandman.

I'll break down the cosplay for you the same way I would mentally.

Outfit
-----------
- Black, v-neck spaghetti strap tank top
- Black skinny jeans
- Black leather boots

Accessories
--------------------
- Studded belt
- Studded wrist cuffs (Optional)
- Black leather gloves (Optional)
- Silver ahnk necklace

Appearance
---------------------
- Black shaggy rocker hair/wig
- Goth makeup, eyeliner eye of Horus on right eye

The tank top and jeans can be found at any department store (Walmart, Target, etc.) or thrift store. I would reccomend wearing the closest boots you have, unless you want to be very accurate. In that case, goth boots are available online, on depop, or sometimes Target and other shoe stores.

All of the accessories can be found at a local Hot Topic or Spencer's, homemade on Etsy, or can be made by you.

For the wig, you can look up ""black rockstar wig"" or ""black emo wig,"" if you are not familiar with cutting and styling a wig. If you want to cut and style it, then any black wig will do.

If you're using your own hair, watch some YouTube tutorials on scene hair or 80s hair. You'll mainly just need hairspray.

For the makeup, Death mainly wears black eyeliner and black lipstick. It would be good to start practicing those early.
If you need more help with that, I could make a video tutorial for you based off of her makeup :) 

You're gonna look awesome. Good luck and have fun!",1593561843

I would say that the best thing to do is to straight up as her “how can we support you?” “How can we help you?” She might not be able to answer immediately but give her some time to think or brainstorm with her. Everyone is different. 

Also, I would consider getting in touch with people that are going/went through a similar situation. Maybe a support group? There are things that you (and your family) simply can’t understand and I know it’s hard to admit that but it’s the truth. Try asking her what she needs/wants. 

Also, consider activities that don’t require too much talking such as games (board games, cards, anything).

My (35) wife (34) and I have been together for the past 5 years. Recently, due to the pandemic, I was laid off from my job. My wife does some part-time work here and there and sells some beauty products online.  I’ve been looking for a job, but can’t find anything. Although unemployment helps, we need financial help. This is where it gets tricky. My wife is pretty cute, and I thought she would make some good money on onlyfans. I’ve never been on it, but read some articles. 

Yesterday, we were watching some Netflix, and I casually asked her whether she thinks she could help out a bit more financially. She told me that she doesn’t think she wants to work more than she does now, and is not interested in any full-time position. She had a bad experience in her last full-time position with some Karens. Anyways, I asked her whether she would be willing to do try a work from home gig on onlyfans? She never heard of onlyfans, so she checked it out. She fucking flipped! She swore up and down about her Christian morals. She kicked me out of the house and I’m staying with my brother right now.

"borderlands3","t5_2v0p0","I did them all on my first playthrough just to get the full experience the first time around.  I like the extra bits of story and such.  I then played through TVHM and did only the side missions that interested me.

The good thing about leaving them until later is that the rewards will scale to your level.  However, if you want another shot at a reward item, you can just do the mission again in TVHM or join a friend's game and do the mission with them.  You can also reset your mission progress and do the whole story/side missions over again if you really want another shot at a mission reward (not recommended).

All in all, I personally recommend doing them during your first run, but it's really up to you and you don't permanently lose anything either way.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Is typically only seen as an ad hominem if the personal attacks are not relevant to the point at hand. 

For example, if someone is providing a personal opinion, it isn't typically a logical fallacy to bring up legit questions about their expertise, potential biases, etc. 

As the value of the opinion is fundamentally impacted by the knowledge and trustworthiness of the person offering the opinion, it is typically acceptable for people to raise legit questions related to these areas. That's why we trust the account of an eyewitness more than the account of someone that wasn't there. That's why we trust the account of an unbiased witness more than we trust the account of someone heavily biased towards the defense or prosecution.

That isn't to say that *nobody* in here is engaging in ad hominem attacks. I'm just saying that attacks on Drey aren't automatically ad hominem's if the attacks are directed at things that materially impact how much value we should place in his opinion.",1593561845

&amp;#x200B;

 [https://smashboards.com/threads/rofl-tells-you-how-to-beat-marth.91241/](https://smashboards.com/threads/rofl-tells-you-how-to-beat-marth.91241/) 

&amp;#x200B;

As for Marth, there is not much I can elaborate on as fars as the basics go that ROFL doesn't already outline in his guide, highly recommend reading that post. What I can do is outline certain common situations you might find yourself in against a Marth and what to do when they occur.  


The learning curve for the matchup is steep, but I think its manageable. I can't remember how long it really took to get comfortable with it, but my training partner, Jrad, mains Marth and I learned the MU through living with him for 2 years.  


***Do not fear the sword***  


This is the absolute key to understanding Marth. He has no projectiles, so really attempt to understand his spacing and how you can stand just outside of it. Getting comfortable with this is extremely important, Marth capitalizes on the fear of his range and if you fight the impulse to shield/spotdodge/roll you'll be in much better shape. It sounds counter intuitive, but you actually want to be close to Marth. His attacks are laggy so you want to be close enough to punish when the time comes.  


Marth juggles Luigi extremely well, so its imperative to stay on the ground. In the neutral, they have 2 main approaches: Dashdance into grab/dtilt, or SHFFLed Fair/Nair. Most Marths tend to favor one or the other.  
DashDance/DTilt is extremely hard to deal with, its fast, corners us, and prevents a lot of wavedash approaches. Setting up an Jab/Ftilt wall is the best way to deal with this. You can also shield and WD OOS through the dtilts but the timing is strict.  
If they are approaching with aerials, you can CC until \~45% or so and punish with a downsmash which sets up for a juggle/punish.  


Luigi has several extremely good grab punishes on Marth.  


From 0  
DownThrow -&gt; Dash-&gt;JC Upsmash  
UpThrow -&gt; Dair  


UpThrow-&gt;Uair/Bair + Nair and other stuff.....I can't remember the exact sequence because it changes based on DI, but luigi has an almost guaranteed 0-55% off an upthrow  


At any mid % Forward throw -&gt; Ftilt into another F-Tilt into another F-Tilt or grab if you suspect a shield. Sounds dumb...but it works haha.  


60-75% Down-throw -&gt; Fair  
\^ this leads to many early kills if you are near the ledge when you get the grab  


Edgeguarding Marth is actually very safe and easy.  
Marth's will get just below the ledge and Side-B. Read what they are doing and time a ledge grab for invincibility and bair them. When they catch on, their response is to recover really low so you can just hold on and ledgehog them.  


You can also time a Dair to hit them as they try to Up-B to the ledge.  


Recovery is probably the biggest issue against Marth and if anything, this is probably where i can shed the most advice.  
Fireball is so important. Always shoot one towards the ledge where Marths like to stand and Dtilt/Fsmash. Time it so that you can DJ or Up-B to grab ledge right when they would be getting hit by the fireball.  


Teching is also crucial, and its actually really easy, contrary to what you may think. Luigi's Up-B is only vertical, and has the same speed every time so you don't really need to 'time' anything.  
Honestly, you should do this when recovering against any character.  


***Immediately after inputing an Up-B, mash the joystick in the direction of the ledge and input a tech.***  


This essentially buffers the tech as you Up-B and you'll get it every time.

"Polymath","t5_2shbm","i get what your going for. but knowing you as someone who studies philosophy i can see you very much over thinking it. many words to the point of very complicated.

i believe similar thing tho, i as a child played games some, its like a ""skill tree"" how i thought of it. big category, small sub ones within it.

example is a warrior, sub skills maybe lance, spear, sword, shield, dagger, throwing knifes, sling, etc etc sub skills to be learnt.

or as a ethnomusicologist. take persian music, you have dastgahs which are the modes of music, and within those modes are very common melodies and runs they fit within its dastgah very well. to learn that mode and improvise in it, one would want to practice each gusheh to have greater mastery. its simple

people do that here, a wood worker has many skills to learn

a black smith

a doctor

etc.

now all this being said.....there was a very similar post recently like this on here. of people spending more time compartmentalizing subjects then actually doing any studying or knowing them. you can check that if you want. 

buts its useless. 

become a polymath not someone fascinated by polymaths

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

now that the practical portion is over, if your talking about morality and personal growth. this is really by definition not a polymath thing, but closer to a priesthood.

valuing things as aligning to this or that principle how so? according to philosophy? the problem with that, is its to rule oriented, right is right, and wrong wrong. people are different, every situation different.  i wouldn't try to hit and absolute mark with everything, or its unfair. in this way : two people experience the same thing (traumatic experience, death of someone, etc) but one cant handle it, mental breakdown. your especially kind to that one because there hurt more, you cant tell them how to feel.

practical skills and that of a spiritual nature are two very different things and approaches that should be taken.",1593561845

I think I will give it a couple of months to let the new cat settle into our routines and older cat to accept new cat and see where we're at, and maybe reach out to his rescue to see if they can let us foster to test the waters.",1593561846

And I literally hate my sister she is an awful person and looooves to be the center of attention and fight people as if she is still in highschool since she has ""fond"" memories of beating people up in highschool. My mom would be devastated if I do not invite all my siblings and she hates when we fight even though i always keep to myself my mom loves telling me that us all not getting along is ""killing her"". So to make my mom happy I invited all my siblings but i let my wedding planner know who they are and what they look like and that if they cause even the slightest problem that they are to be kicked out. I told my mom that i am inviting them but that if they make any commotion that they WILL be kicked out and she has no say because it is my wedding. She wasn't the happiest about it but now I feel as though i don't need to worry about what my siblings could possibly do knowing they will be taken care of.

Now obviously the person doesn't understand the movement.. but that's beside the point, because we're only looking at *why they feel the need to respond*. It's the very same reason that people feel the need to respond to people who say ""ALM"".. they want to make sure they're informed and not just spouting stupid shit.

..and then there's the racists, who make up part of the group with ill intent, but an unknown amount of it for sure. We get into a problem when we assume that all people responding ALM are fully informed of the BLM movement and are simply racists. Instead we should be treating every individual on a case by case basis to determine if they're ignorant (not a bad thing, just means they need to be informed) or just plain assholes.

This logic should hold true for all people on all different matters. Never make assumptions about what values a person holds, ask them the questions to figure out where they stand and continue from there. 

We wouldn't shame someone for pushing back against the KKK. So if the person honestly thinks BLM is just a black variation on the KKK.. we shouldn't shame them either. We should educate them.",1593561848
