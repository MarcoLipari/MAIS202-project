Some information about Medicare and its ""efficiencies""

&gt;n 1996, Congress funded an added $548 million over seven years for health-care fraud enforcement. FBI (2001)

&gt;Medicare lost $11.9 billion to waste, fraud and mistakes in 2000, half of what was lost five years ago from improper payments to doctors and hospitals. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2001)

&gt;Fraud amounts to 10 percent of U.S. healthcare expenditures. Government Accounting Office (1992), National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association (2001)

&gt;Seniors and other taxpayers pay up to $1 billion a year in inflated drug prices due to potential fraud and loopholes in Medicare. The overpayments represented 1/5 of Medicare spending in 2000. Government Accounting Office (2001)

Of course, that is probably an insurance shill site, huh?

There is indeed a problem with our society, but not what the poster thinks. Since when has it been ok to ""take"" what someone else has, just because they have more? Just because it is in the name of taxes, doesn't mean that it isn't stealing. Socialism in whatever form is what is ruining the country. The idea that it is justified to take more from those who have more is a fundamentally immoral argument. No matter how well spent that money is, it is still stolen money. The idea that you are entitled to that which you did not earn is in direct opposition to what this country was founded upon. Those who believe that it is the Government's responsibility to take care of you from birth till death will continue to spend more and more of the money that isn't theirs to spend. The surprise is that those who call for more Government control of areas of our life, are the same ones who distrust the Government most.

The answer is not taxing/punishing those who succeed, it is reducing taxes for all Americans, and also reducing the wasteful/bureaucratic government that the collectivist mentality has created.

Wait wait wait.  I may well have missed it, but I don't think anyone was cheering just because *Republicans* got outed--as far as I understood it, that little extra nicety was rather tangential to the cheering.  

I thought the cheering--and very well justified it was--came when politicans who demonize gays and champion laws that prosecute and segregate homosexuality, turn out to be flaming hypocrites who're pursuing this out of demagoguery and self-hating personality disorders, and not just to support some pristine codex of truth and justice after all.  

That they're Republican may well be linked in to their attitudes, and icing on the cake to people who loathe what the GOP has come to stand for in this past decade, but I don't think the people who are cheering would be doing so if the outed person hadn't been attempting such harm to gay rights to begin with, while hypocritically hiding his own homosexual activities.","1193875739"

"reddit.com","t5_6","A physical blow in the head with an ashtray.  People get brain damage and die from splitting their skulls on the pavement after a shot like that.  Even repeated concussions cause brain damage, and an ashtray to the head is likely to give you one.  Shit, boxing with big pillows on your hands can still leave people crippled.  And the hardest blows are the ones you don't expect - if you're not in guard or ready to roll with a punch, head shots with any power are going to knock you out.  What can an ashtray do?


It's very clear you've never studied self-defense in any meaningful form.  The more I box the more scared I am of street fights.  One slip-up like an exposed chin for a sucker punch and you're done for if the person has any strength.  An ashtray can split your skull.  And it's not uncommon in any way for people to die after falling and cracking their heads.


In other words, you don't seem to understand how serious physical blows are, particularly head shots.  I imagine this is because you've never really been in a fight.  If you think trading physical blows for an emotional/ethical one is fair, go to a boxing gym, pick a person, and insult their mother.  Then go in the ring with them.  That should straighten you out.

Now, if the Hannitys and O'Reillys of the world want to glom onto the word 'hate' and use it for their own purposes, that's their business.  That they choose to use the word 'hate' to spread lies about their opposition should in no way, ever, dissuade me from using the same word.  I do not relinquish the use any word or phrase merely because they choose to misuse it.  That is, after all, precisely their goal.  I would point out that you have just done exactly the same thing.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;A relationship in which one needs contracts with the state to enforce fidelity is an illusionary one. 

Or a contractual one.  Before I lay out money for [cable, phone, utilities, paper delivery, appliance, car, or house (construction or maintenance)]  services, I want some assurance that the service will be performed as required.

At times in the past, for better or worse, marriage had some pretty clearly defined roles for men and women.  Presently, for better or for worse, those roles are not so well defined, and a great deal more negotiation ought to happen before a couple enters marriage.  ""For better or worse"" vows mean nothing anymore.  People must communicate and know - before they take  vows - what those vows mean, and what penalties will befall them when those vows are broken.  

Any couple who enters marriage without making some prenuptial agreements is comprised of one or more terribly ignorant persons.  I'm not saying that there should always be a contract, but given current divorce laws, both the groom and the bride must protect themselves as they walk down that rosy path, lest they fall (or are pushed by their spouse) into the ditch.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; Both of these are good things and will do nothing but BOOST American economic growth.

You are correct, but this will be done by devaluing the capital. It is a dangerous game to play.

&gt; America will finally be on a track to net productivity versus net expenditure. The lower rates will cushion any liquidity crisis the recent debt turmoil may stir up,

This is true. It is great for those borrowing money.

&gt; correlated (or weakening) Asian currencies like the yuan and yen will buoy American consumer buying power - just in time for Christmas.

They are weakening because those countries have invested into US bonds. With lower rates, this is a bad idea. They will probably start dumping them, causing a drop in the price. Their currencies will be stronger than ours, and since most goods are now Chinese made, the buying power will drop. The drop in unemployment will not be adequate to counteract the sustained loss of capital.

&gt; And speaking of China - guess what lower interest rates and low currency exchange values have done for them? Double digit GDP growth.

Keeping their people artificially poor, that is what. An average worker in China should have been able to get double the value out of their salaries ten years ago.

&gt; Here in America we have gotten so accustomed to debt financing a strong currency that idiots like you think it's a BAD thing when our currency finalls falls in the midst of strong growth and low interest rates. Absolutely unbelievable.

The sad part is that we have currency that is backed by what effectively are tax futures of unspecified maturity and slowly declining value. It is a risky thing, as a bank run on the currency is rather easy to trigger.

And yes, it is bad if you are holding the actual bills, although that usually encourages investment, in the case of a potential recession, that encourages hoarding of precious metals, which only worsens the economy.

&gt; What would you have bought with your oh-so-strong dollar, anyway? A new BMW?

I buy what I choose. I do not like my savings devalued at such a high rate.

&gt; How about you sacrifice your shiny purchase, invest your money, and help America become strong again? This is the way the game is played.

Bullshit. America is a country that runs on individuality. I will sacrifice my life to preserve the freedoms that this country protects, if I have to. But I will not give money, so that bad management by the government will get a free ride. If there is a tax loophole, I take it. If preserving my earnings means screwing the country financially, well that is too bad. Let the Europeans donate their lives to the greater common good, but I work for myself. You know, at one point, America had a system, where if everyone worked hard for themselves, the country profited.

&gt; The sky is not falling.

It is not falling. Yet. But it may, if the cut the rates just a bit more.

&gt; This is how the global system works.

It is a miracle it worked at all for as long as it does. You know ponzi schemes work too...for a while.

&gt;Central banking exists to react quickly and stimulate growth in all circumstances.

Yes. And ponzi scheme masterminds exist to react quickly to stimulate growth of the pyramid so it does not immediately collapse as well.

&gt;If you don't like it, you can go live in the fucking woods.

I do not like it, and I do not want to live in the woods. I think I will move my money into stocks, as much as I can. I think human productivity and ingenuity is a much better investment than tax futures.","1193877783"

I had hoped that this metaphorical usage would have become clear in the following sentence, when I referred to ""the tools of power.""

You ask: ""Are you really going to argue in favor of spreading hatred?  Seriously?""

No.  I am not in favor of spreading hatred.  I am in favor of granting people the freedom to speak words of hatred, words I find deplorable, words I would never imagine speaking myself.  As we all ought to have learned long ago, from Voltaire, from John Stuart Mill, from Thomas Paine: allowing someone to speak - indeed, fighting for their right to speak - is not an endorsement of what they have to say.

By framing the question as if those are the only two choices, you are gaming the poll.

The reason we protect freedom of expression is so that everyone has an equal chance to make their case.  Others can choose to ignore it if they want, but when they choose to SILENCE it - that is where the problems begin.

Even in a case like this, where the WBC seems so clearly wrong and asinine, SILENCING THEM sets a precedent to silence someone else who ""arguably"" is saying something patently offensive.

I'm sure that there are a dozen posts a minute here on reddit about Cheney or Bush that MANY AMERICANS would feel were borderline treason.  What if someone got around to taking everyone who made those comments to court?

The better alternative is to allow uncomfortable free speech and ignore it.  I didn't hear this trial, and I don't know how they arrived at the violation of privacy - but I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have found for the plaintiff in this case.

What I have been pointing out is the error in people's framing of her reaction solely in the context of ""it's 'just' a stripclub"" and she's making a big deal out of something all guys supposedly naturally do and it should be ok to lie about it.

What I said is that if I were in a monogomous relationship and my partner did the same thing this guy did, even if it was my wife, it would still make no difference to me that he/she was ""begging over and over for forgiveness,"" so long as he/she refused to be honest about whether or not he/she was at fault and did not take responsibility.

More importantly, having some aspects of socialism results in less suffering and death. Of course it is slightly less ""free"" since some money must be collected to fund it. But a few thousand dollars a year is nothing compared to the freedoms that have been abandoned due to the fear of terrorism in the last few years. Not to mention the fact that the current administration is plunging the country into debt to kill Arabs by hiring private corporations (owned by its friends) on no-bid contracts at ridiculous markup.

There are three types 

1. Demand-pull inflation: inflation caused by increases in aggregate demand due to increased private and government spending, etc. - will surely happen according to your point 1

2. Cost-push inflation: presently termed ""supply shock inflation,"" caused by drops in aggregate supply due to increased prices of inputs, for example. Take for instance an increase in imported raw materials. Producers for whom raw materials is a part of their costs could then pass this on to consumers in the form of increased prices. This will obviously happen, since a lower dollar increases prices of imports.

3. Built-in inflation: induced by adaptive expectations, often linked to the ""price/wage spiral"" because it involves workers trying to keep their wages up (gross wages have to increase above the CPI rate to net to CPI after-tax) with prices and then employers passing higher costs on to consumers as higher prices as part of a ""vicious circle.""

Then we are in general agreement.

This is where we start to disagree. I have lost my respect for the NYT through its reporting during the lead-up to the Iraq War and its hadling of the Duke rape scandal.

I consider the BBC and Economist a few cuts above the NYT, but still within the limitations of the MSM.

&gt;And to say that you dont believe it to be true just because the mainstream media agrees with that position it's folly. What if the mainstream media says breathing is good, are you going to stop breathing?

That is not what I am saying. I said I distrust the mainstream media. That doesn't mean I will simply become a contrarian based on the media's positions. Instead, it simply means that I will apply critical thinking and common sense to stories circulated within the MSM and do some independent fact-checking on all important issues.

&gt;While there maybe better sources of information that will help me understand deeper and better about Global Warming, the time it takes for me to find credible sources of information, clear incentives and motives and who the scientisits is researching for, and then read about their studies, I would have read at least 10 articles not just on Global warming, but also internation domestic affairs.

Nice try.  You are sexist, douchebag.  When you have to use a disclaimer just before or after a line you know is a typical invokation of sexism but are unwilling to change it and clarify, you're still a sexist.

&gt;1. I never seriously date a woman who terminated her last relationship because she wasn't ""happy"". Happiness is an emotional response to external stimuli. To break the vow of ""til' death do us part"" over an emotional state that may or may not be another person's fault, is shallow and shows a lack of emotional maturity. It tells me that woman is too self absorbed to be a reliable partner in the future. 

Oh, you stupid shithead.  When you get married out of love, of course not being happy is a good reason for a divorce.  That's why we have ""no fault"" divorce.  Divorcing you is not necessarily attacking you.  *you* have some emotional ""growing up"" to do.

&gt;2. I don't date fat women. Sorry, all you ""BBWs""; get a grip on reality. If you are walking around looking like you have a beer keg stuffed in your pants, you don't give a shit about yourself, so I really don't expect you to give a shit about me in the long run. **Don't give me that crap about how happy you are with yourself, you're not and we both know it.** If you and I had fallen in love twenty years ago, gotten married and had a family and you had put on the weight, I would still be with you, but we didn't and so I see no need to accommodate your lack of character and discipline. 

(emphasis mine).  Oh, so you have first dibs on what another persons's innermost feelings really are?  Some kind of super-psychic, are you?

&gt;4. Feminists. I don't date women who are avowed feminists with a ""you go girl"" mentality. Sorry, but your little movement fucked things up in a major way. I think women ought to vote, receive equal pay for equal work etc. etc. I do have enough sense to recognize that whether by design or chance, men and women are different and since I think that form follows function there is a reason for our differences. I don't want to be around a woman who wants to prove to me she is as good as I am at ""man"" stuff. It is annoying. It makes you look stupid and insecure. 

You don't even know what feminism is.

&gt;8. Anyone who is fanatical about much of anything. If you are religious fanatic, I too believe in God. I have a degree in Theology as a matter of fact, but as far as I can tell, God didn't assign any woman at anytime to be my moral gatekeeper. **He did tell you to be ""keepers at home"",** if you are so caught up in church work that you are making your family the second priority in your life you aren't following your own rule book. I digress, fanaticism of any kind is a psychological addiction and I prefer to spend my time with people who lead a well balanced life. Addiction of any kind is a turn off.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I feel somewhat of a fool for walking into the trap of rebutting the canonical feminist viewpoint, but here goes.

&gt; Why are so many gay people dis proportionally interested in fashion? 

First of all, I'm a bit confused with this connection you're posing about gay men. The only connection I can draw the lines with is that gay men somehow are women? What?

&gt;Don't you think that if there were this huge glut of talented female engineers, overlooked because of sexism, that some company would have hired them by now at a reduced rate, gaining a huge advantage?

I find that answer somewhat amusing from a person on Reddit. When the majority of the programming section seem to link towards places which demonstrate Lisp, Haskell, OCaML, etc. in action, and argue that they are the next cash cow, if you believe that this fundamental lack in female hiring is because women are simply not interested, maybe you should use the same logic and assume that functional programming is a flop, and will never make it into the limelight. (And while I do realize I did a good bit of generalization here, if the criticism does not stick on the author himself, at least it should stick upon the modders of the comment).

Also, the feminist perspective is really very easy to understand if you for a second decided to think about it instead of bashing about how it devalues your sense of accomplishment. The default to think of men and women as equal is as much a mental device as anything. By *assuming* this mental device, it is easier to view men and women upon an unbiased scale. By reinforcing that a certain profession has a propensity towards men or women, and therefore is justifiably male-dominated, is to simply create a Catch-22 to funnel out the very minority that you say is not interested. Now in reality, women on the whole may not be interested in a particular profession, but that doesn't mean we should chuck away a perfectly effective mental device.

Lastly, to give an impression of how different the world was before the feminist movement, [look here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/81/Two%27s_Company%2C_Three%27s_a_Crowd.jpg) . This was meant to be funny, at that time. Yet I'd be hard-pressed to find a modern reader who finds anything funny in the picture. Its a symbol of sorts of how much feminism has changed the global landscape of everything. After two waves or phases of the feminist revolution, to blithely believe that a magic button has been pushed, and that feminism must be stopped, is an argument without proof indeed.

Lyndon Johnson to prohibit 501(c)(3) organizations, which includes charities and churches, from engaging in any political campaign activity. To the extent Congress has revisited the ban over the years, it has in fact strengthened the ban. The most recent change came in 1987 when Congress amended the language to clarify that the prohibition also applies to statements opposing candidates.

&gt;&gt;My point is that I think that sexual reproduction homogenates genetics.

&gt;What makes you think that, considering that every successful pairing produces a unique new combination of genes?

Well in my first post/s I put forth the Amish (and inbreeding as a whole) as evidence (if sexual reproduction is just a unique shuffle of genetic data then why does inbreeding cause the narrowing of genetics that allows genetic flaws to be more easily expressed?). For example why does the *""fitness-biased randomization that takes place during sexual reproduction""* that you mentioned not safeguard us from the dangers of inbreeding?

As to proof.. I dont have any. For the longest time I have had the hunch that sexual reproduction results in the offspring having  a slight disadvantage in the long run because they inherit only a subset of the genetic variation of their parents. Maybe I will have to do some simulations or something to test further (and do more research on what exactly  happens with the dna when forming gametes, zygotes etc).

Just as when Nixon went bonkers, it seems the generals have had to step in once again as Bush and Cheney threaten bussiness as usual. Our hero may never come forward now that the Pentagon won. If Cheney had his way, we'd know all the names for sure. This event was Cheney's downfall. Now Condi and Gates call the shots. Any Iraqi invasion is now off the table since Putin signed on with Iran. We might be able to desteoy Iran's infrastructure within a few hours, but we can't defeat Russia. Congrats to those military brass who hold their allegiance to the Constitution above politics. I find it especially gratifying to hear it was the Air Force that blew the whistle.

My intention is not to compare the soldier's actions with the a child's innocence. Clearly, the soldier was well aware that joining the military could possibly mean he would be ordered to kill people. The soldier did not, however, have any reasonable expectation that he would be giving up privacy when he joined the military. (Privacy in the small sphere, yes -- he might have to use a toilet that has no stall. But not privacy in the sense that he would be subjected to public scrutiny.)

But more to the point, the people affected by the Phelps were actually the marine's family. So, even if you could argue that the marine had a reasonable expectation of public scrutiny (which you can't, but I'm humoring you, here), there is absolutely no expectation by the family of that sacrifice of privacy.

It was amazing.  WBC has every right to be as bitchy as they want as long as they follow the law (which they seem to do, in my experience; they had a permit and in fact police protection).  but we have the right, and indeed the responsibility to drown them out and challenge their message.  They are only a handful of people.  anywhere they go, masses of people come out against them.  They mean nothing, they are not a movement, and their support is mostly from within their family.  It is their infamy, and not their influence that make them so well known.  The best way to beat them is not to make them pay financially, but to show them and the world that their brand of hate is not what we believe in.  They can spit venom all they want, but it is futile.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Is it reasonable to give instructions  for how your remains should be treated, and expect those instructions to be followed?

While when we are dead, we're dead, and no longer can experience any suffering or humiliation, the idea of our body being mistreated by others can be very disturbing. We don't want to be dumped in a ditch; we want to be buried or cremated with due solemnity and care.

How the remains of a loved one are treated also has a direct impact on family members and friends. The perceived disrespect and antagonism reflects on them and tarnishes their memories of the person they've lost. 

Finally, there is an implicit trust with everyone who handles the dead, from pathologists and morticians to med school students working on cadavers and gravediggers, to treat bodies with respect and dignity.

So: violating a corpse is a breach of trust with the original owner, even if they aren't aware of it, an act of dishonesty and disrespect. And it causes demonstrable and serious emotional harm to the relatives, who now have to bury this person knowing how her body was abused prior to the funeral, and that memory will linger on forever. Lastly, the reputation of the hospital is seriously damaged, and they may likely face a civil suit from the relatives.

I think this act is clearly unethical, on both a professional and personal level. It's depraved indifference to the will of others regarding the treatment of their remains, as well as the harm it does others affected by the act.

Please read my comments closer to the top of this topic -- the issue is not about ""silencing"" anyone. It's a civil case where the plaintiffs were arguing that the defendants violated their privacy and conspired to create emotional distress. The government is not ""silencing"" them, so there is no freedom of expression being infringed.

Admittedly, there are certainly limits to one's ""offensibility,"" so to speak. One cannot argue that someone of another faith speaking their mind about their religion was an attempt to create emotional distress. A reasonable person could see that was not the intention. But in this case, the defendants ""conspired"" to infringe the privacy of the plaintiffs. They did this by protesting at the funeral of the soldier, and argued funerals are a public event. 

You should also be careful to remember that this is not ""some judge"" making an arbitrary decision. Indeed, this was a jury of 12 people. Of course, that doesn't mean the verdict was necessarily right, but it does mean that the Phelps family were at least heard by their peers. 

Again: don't misconstrue what happened here. The case is NOT about what the Phelps family said. It's about the Phelps family taking prolonged, concerted action to disrupt this family's rights of privacy. Regardless of how YOU would have ruled, ordinary citizens DO have a right to a certain level of privacy.

"politics","t5_2cneq","My train of thought is something like this:

1. Years ago, Cheney holds secret meetings on our energy policy. Secret why? Undoubtedly because it involves things that the American people would either a) not stand for (like nuclear war to protect oil interests) or b) not understand (like peak oil, oil crash, impending calamity, who knows).

2. We go to Iraq, which is now widely known to have been the plan long before 9/11. Side note: on the bright side, I am thankful for 9/11 in the sense that it woke a whole lot of us up, myself included.

3. Iraq turns out to be a clusterfuck. If it was about controlling oil, doing so in a manageable sense has become nearly impossible with the horrible job the Administration did with the war planning.

4. Iran is right next door, vital geographic area in terms of the assumed goal(s) listed above (all speculation mind you, I don't claim anything as fact).

5. If Iran is just going to be another Iraq, it would be easier to drop a few nukes, flatten the place and control the oil with little-to-no resistance. The use of nuclear weapons would have far-reaching effects regarding the realization by other nations and/or enemies of the lengths to which our leaders would go. These effects, I believe (in addition to nuclear fallout, among other things) could prevent an insurgency like the one in Iraq from ever becoming a permanent thorn in the side of the neocon agenda. Of course the ramifications here at home would probably be many orders of magnitude worse than they are now, as far as our civil liberties are concerned.

This is all based on the assumption that Cheney et al consider world domination (via control of the worlds energy resources through military force) more important than the ideas of real, classical freedom and liberty for our people that our country was founded upon. Personally, I believe the PNAC and other well-known neocon philosophies are examples of evidence that they indeed do consider imperialism more important. I know this might come off as extreme, and yes, it is to someone like me or most, but to people who are part of the elite - the people who are beyond financially secure and are in positions of great power, both financially and in the US Government, who thus are pretty much set for life - it is not so extreme. They will have freedom and liberty whether or not the people of our country and others are ruled under fascist dictatorship, so long as they toe the line of course. They would have every motivation to go global if this were true (and I believe it is - why else would they want global hegemony?).

Personally, I believe that most politicians and powerful people, be it economically or in our government, see the majority of the American people as something akin to farm animals - a resource. We work, be it through physical labor or mental, and the overall net result is that they get to take from us a significant portion of the fruits of our labor. Debt is our cage. They leave just enough for us in the form of meaningless entertainments and what have you (ironically, things on which to further waste our money so it can trickle back up into their hands through the corporate layer) - just enough so that we don't kick up any shit and burn this mother fucker down and start over.

Anyway, it makes sense to me in an extreme way, and as I said, I don't truly believe of any of this as fact. As **vemrion** said, nothing is as it seems. It's interesting to speculate though.

BTW, I absolutely loved the comment this headline points to. It is the best explanation of this incident that I have heard yet, and makes the most sense.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I don't think rape is ""fine"" under any circumstances.  But I do think that

1. society should at least consider allowing consensual sex between adults and children
2. society should not judge premeditated pedophiles any differently than premeditated rapists
3. society should recognize that just like any rapist, a pedophile is succumbing to desires that are a product of forces beyond his or her control.  In other words, a man who desires to have sex with children should not be considered to be any worse of a person than a man who desires to have sex with women his own age.  The first man only becomes a ""bad person"" when he acts out those desires in a way that causes harm to others or breaks the law.

*Edit: I understand that what I'm saying is extremely controversial.  In fact, it makes me a little squeamish myself.  But I don't see any essential difference between raping a child and raping an adult.  You could argue that rape is going to devastate the child more.

Women are more likely to see smaller physical attacks as reasons to call the police.  Men are more likely to hide the fact if they are victims of smaller attacks, even if they occur with great frequency.   Prejudices still tend toward notions of male violence and womanly innocence/victimhood.  Police are more likely to arrest men than women, even when women are the aggressors, and even when women are arrested, they are less likely to be convicted and are less likely to lose homes, children, finances, or otherwise face stiff penalties.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;On your citizenship: congradts! Many Americans would love to get their hands on that, and can't. The Irish don't make it easy :-)

They make it easier than most countries.  Basically all you need are official copies of a grandparent or parent's birth or baptismal records.  I had to go to the parish church in Moycullen to get 'em for my grandfather, but it was worth it because now I don't have to travel as an American, and I was in the area in any case.  

I cordially disagree with regards to Joyce.  One of the things to remember is that he wrote in a different era when a hint was equivalent to what we would now consider yelling in one's face.  It's been years since I read it last as an undergraduate, but I seem to remember that ""The Dead"" ended with a song in Gaelic, and a  quite shocking --for those times-- diatribe on Parnell's ultimate treatment.  These were not ""safe"" subjects at the time, and certainly Joyce was stirring up trouble deliberately.  (The same goes for that story in ""Dubliners"" --don't remember the name-- that's about child molestation, though obviously Joyce couldn't be straightforward or explicit.  My hunch is that he was saying something about the Catholic priesthood that only now, one hundred years later, is even starting to be publicly acknowledged; that's how far ahead of his time he was.)  Anyhow, if you read carefully --and you really have no choice but to do so-- you will find that both ""Ulysses"" and ""Finnegan's Wake"" are saturated with subtle yet powerful images of Irish nationalism, and all this in spite of the fact that Joyce was Anglo-Irish and not even of Gaelic descent.  (I think a great part of his love for Irish culture had to do with the way the Irish use language.  It is one of our great gifts, the bardic heritage, call it blarney or whatever; the English may have invented the language, but it took the Irish to perfect it.)           ","1193882627"

Therefore as the dollar crashes as it is doing, gold will take over until the Amero comes out for US, Mexico, Canada.

All sign languages are ""natural languages"" in that they are exactly as expressive as any spoken language.  See [American Sign Language][ASL] and [Nicaraguan Sign Language][NSL] as examples.  Nicaraguan Sign Language is special because it was [invented][]\* by children in Nicaragua over a period of only 20 years.

For a detailed and easy explanation of chimpanzees and other apes failing to use sign language see Language Instinct by Steven Pinker.  

Here's what Wikipedia says about [Nim Chimpsky][NC], another famous chimp that allegedly knew sign language:

&gt; the study concluded that [Nim Chimpsky] hadn't acquired anything the researchers were prepared to designate worthy of the name ""language"" although he had learned to repeat his trainers' signs in appropriate contexts.

Clearly they were protesting.

If this case is overturned, maybe the next case will be won because they were wearing the color orange. It won't be a case of free speech, but because they were wearing orange.

Clearly they were expressing themselves in public.

Your point is that they avoided the issue of expressing their free speech and therefore its nothing at all with suppressing them from doing this again. They are allowed to do this as long as nobody gets their feeling hurt, correct?

I suppose next you'll explain why we are justified in bombing Iran, not because we don't like their government and it will make a lot of money for some people.

Fear of a bank run, may cause them to do it. Currently they are slowly letting go of the reserves...which results in inflation. If the price starts dropping fast enough, everyone tries to get rid of it at once, as the first person to get rid of reserves first gets the most out of them.

why do you think this isn't adequate? there is film of something hitting the pentagon. therefore it was adequate. what is not reasonable is to expect better than adequate.  that would be what the word means.

&gt;There was lots of terrorist chatter and the US had been struck by major terror attacks in the previous decade. It would be very surprising if the Pentagon didn't take this possible threat seriously

why? the us has been struck by major terror attacks every decade. my point still remains that they had cameras on the building that caught something. why is that not ""adequate""? 

&gt;Your linked article says nothing about retrofitting the Pentagon's security.

of course not. i agree with you that they are secretive about what they do. what i disagree with you about is your expectation for the pentagon's security. it might have been from 1972, or brand new, but the fact is we don't know.

&gt;And as for the second scenario, I'm not sure if I get your point. You're suggesting they deliberately didn't have adequate surveillance? Why?

i'm at a loss arguing with you. i have no idea how to explain my position to you in a way you seem to understand. you seem to believe the government has lots of footage to control, that would implicate them in the attacks. *if they planned the attacks themselves, they wouldn't want there to be any footage.* therefore, why would they even have adequate security on the pentagon? i do not know if that's your thesis, because you've been very vague. i am trying to dismantle other parts of it, to show you how little sense this makes.

1) “For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass the law until all is accomplished.  Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.”  (Matthew 5:18-19 RSV)  Clearly the Old Testament is to be abided by until the end of human existence itself.  None other then Jesus said so.

2) All of the vicious Old Testament laws will be binding forever.  ""It is easier for Heaven and Earth to pass away than for the smallest part of the letter of the law to become invalid.""  (Luke 16:17 NAB)

3) Jesus strongly approves of the law and the prophets.  He hasn’t the slightest objection to the cruelties of the Old Testament.  ""Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.  I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.  Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law, until all things have taken place.""  (Matthew 5:17 NAB)

3b) ""All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for refutation, for correction, and for training in righteousness...""  (2 Timothy 3:16 NAB)

3c) ""Know this first of all, that there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God."" (2 Peter 20-21 NAB)

The headline is misleading, implying that a.) Springsteen's new album is filled with references to Iraq when it's not; and b.) that this is the reason his album isn't getting played. That's not what the story is about, that's not what his album is about, and that's not why he's being unfairly shunned by hit radio. 

The Dixie Chicks aren't part of this story. Their reason for being banned was political (duh), but their situation is different from Springsteen's for several reasons, the main one being that his album isn't ""filled"" with Iraq war criticism.

I think we can both reasonably agree that a political rally and a funeral are two completely different animals and therefore not subject to the same rules and regulations.  Apparently a jury of our peers is also smart enough to realize this.

&gt;just the opposite, I'm supporting the protesters. You're supporting the suppression of the protesters. Only one opinion is given time to speak, everyone else is thrown in jail or financially ruined.

You avoided my point completely.  Your response here is just a knee-jerk reply.  You asked ""Shouldn't the family be more angry at the government that got them into the war that killed their son?""  This is a perfect example of trying to shove your opinion down someone else's throat.  Your question doesn't even have anything to do with whether it is or isn't proper form to protest at a funeral, so is therefore also non-sequiter.

I'm not supporting the suppression of protestors.  They can protest if they want - just find somewhere suitable to do it.  A funeral isn't it.  The family has a right to grieve and that should be respected.

&gt;not when it comes to civil rights.

Yes, even when it comes to civil rights.  Again, your rights end where mine begin (and vice versa).  Freedom of speech does not give you the right to say whatever you want, whenever you want, where ever you want together as one complete package.  Nowhere anywhere in the Constitution does it say this.  Time and place are not mentioned specifically.

&gt;You may think that a time of war (or funeral) justifies suspension of some of our rights to accommodate it.

The way you phrased this is obviously a lame attempt at spinning the issue.  Time of war has nothing to do with it.  you know this, I know this, and so does everyone reading this.  More knee-jerk bullshit just as bad as the GOP.

&gt;In fact I would argue that its a time to reaffirm those rights. The soldier in fact died to keep those protesters free after all.

Your right - protest your little ass off.  But since that soldier died for your right to do so, show him and his family some fucking respect.

&gt;I suppose we should enjoy it now, after the next ""terrorist"" attack I'm sure everyone will agree to throwing away the Constitution altogether.

What does this protest have to do with the Bush administration or a terrorist attack?  Let me answer that for you:

Nothing at all.

It's people protesting the entire country because they believe that we are immoral and are dying in this war because of that immorality.

"reddit.com","t5_6"," You know, back in the slashdot days, there was such a thing. There was even an honor among anonymous cowards. People were making points and sometimes writing up comments that were as long as a blog post of today.


 On reddit, I find the onus is on making brief obvious sound bites. I've noticed that any comment I've made (as a different user) that's over 2 sentences long immediately gets downmodded and then maybe later rises back up again.

 There's also the fact that the quality of debate is very poor here on reddit. Yeah yeah, mod me down whatever... When a person makes a non-sequitur, or a circular logic argument, what ensues even if called upon, is a word calling game with highly volatile tempered people insulting each other more and more. I've yet to carry a single non-trivial thread here and not be assailed by ad-hominems.

 It seems reddit is inhabited by commenters which favor fast, irrational, gut based sound bites over healthy debate of any kind. 

 Modding is also an issue: when on a system like slashdot you were given 5 moderator points, you looked for posts that stood out and were brilliant. Or you shot down posts that were over exagerated. You didn't mod down posts you didn't agree with. 

Honestly, I challenge anyone here to show me a thread that has not degenerated into name calling and stubborn contradiction and has produced a real debate.  A real debate.
 It's sad to say, but the reddit commenting system is just not functional in any sensible way. It promotes drivel.

 I only have commenters I watch out for. Commenters who are for all intents and purposes batshit insane and who will soil any topic they start posting on. Generally speaking, I abandon a thread as soon as I see them marching in.

 I've also gotten a new habbit: I create a user account with a random password for each thread I get into. As soon as I see the batshit mofos, I logout and never look back. It's pretty sad really.","1193885896"

There is an implicit contract between people and those entrusted to care for their bodies after death. Violating a contract, whether or not one of the parties is deceased, is unethical. (If it weren't, there would be no reason to abide by people's wills.)

Additionally, all persons in a civilized society have a *reasonable expectation* that their remains will be treated with dignity. If it is generally held that necrophilia is ethical, then all persons close to dying have cause to fear what may be done to their body (as irrational as worrying about it may seem), which is emotional harm.

what privacy was violated? They were protesting in a public location!

Are you suggesting that negative feelings cannot penetrate a radius around specific people or at least during specific times?

Do two of these radi cancel each other out, like if two grieving families meet at the same funeral. Are they allowed to speak feeling to one another without fear of reprisal? 

Is this only a rich persons tool or are poor people allowed this as well?

&gt; What is at stake is a person's right a level of peace and dignity in their daily lives without undue interruption by others.

We live in a society and interaction with others in unavoidable. We can't allow a few people to gain special privileges above others in their public appearances. The public space must remain public for everyone.

In addition the WSB people never interrupted anyone in any fashion, They were guilty only of speech crimes. You're trying to make it sound like they physically interfered with someone else.

For example, when James Watson discussed the idea that blacks aren't as intelligent. You might have been offended, but by supporting the suppression of his ideas and speech, you're doing more harm than good. You think you're defending black people, but in the long run you're affirming the right of suppression of speech.

Here in lies the problem. Tomorrow the laws become a bit more restrictive and society thinks its reasonable. After all what harm could possibly be caused by suppressing a crazy scientist and some nutty church goers?

Fortune 500 companies and investors pour millions of dollars into the industry, and the live races sell up to hundreds of thousands of tickets per event. It's not a sport in that anyone can't just ""hop in"" a car and do it. It's an incredibly competitive arena of engineering, skill, physical ability, and dedication.

The idea of tag clouds is to show data across multiple dimensions.  Sorting by alpha allows people to look-up a specific tag they want to find because it is organized in a way humans can easily search.  The size layers a second axis of data (usually popularity) on top of the indexed list.

I'm not going to argue that tag clouds are a great UI metaphor, but when you adjust the size and ordering by the same dimension it is redundant.

Russert's question to Obama had the heft of former astronauts behind it (versus *eau de wacky actress*) but got at a similar point (does he believe in little green men).  Obama answered as humorously as Kucinich then went on to talk about people he wants to help.

An Installer package that puts stuff in /Library must, of course, require administrator access.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Bad as this kind of behaviour is, I have to say that we as men, bear the primary responsibility for it. 

Why?

Because, collectively, we allow it to continue.

We've almost all thoroughly internalized the cultural messages that our sexuality is less valuable and we have less to offer a relationship, so we put up with whatever crazy nonsense women pull in order to ""get"" or ""keep"" them. 

And the fact is that almost *anyone* becomes a psycho when no one will stand up to them. Women enter into relationships expecting to have it all their way because no one has ever hinted to them that things might be otherwise. 

To the point, in fact, where, if their man stands up to them, they are mostly angry not about not getting their way, but about what they perceive as the implication about their attractiveness and desirability.

By allowing women to control us with their sexuality, we have started to pin their ego and self worth on how well they control us. 

Hitting isn't the worst of it. Not by a long shot. The worst of it is the things we do to ourselves trying to charm or impress that pretty girl. The worst of it is having to dance or jump through hoops like some sort of performing animal in order to be loved. 

The alternative is to just stop. Stop suppressing ourselves in the hopes of pleasing others. Stop having relationships that aren't on our terms. Stop pursuing women, and let them find out what it feels like to have to do the asking. 

But we all have to do it together. One guy here and one there, standing up for themselves, we just going to end up alone.(Friends with benefits can be a lifesaver here, but...)

What we need is a sort of reverse Lysistrata, where we all refuse to pay, perform, and pursue anymore, until we are acknowledged as fully functional human beings, with needs, worldviews, and inner lives, rather than some sort of ambulatory furniture. ","1193886942"

"reddit.com","t5_6","I'm not going to follow this line of reasoning for too many more posts, only because I've made my point reasonable clear in this, and other posts on this topic. However, to again boil this down for you: neither you, nor anyone else, can arbitrarily target someone for the purposes of protest. In this instance, it's not the marine's rights that are being infringed, it's the rights of those who attended the funeral. 

The family, rightfully, has the expectation of a reasonable level of privacy. Even if the Phelps are protesting in a public location, they were invading the privacy of people who were not in the public eye, and had done nothing to warrant the protest. On the other hand, if the Phelps had only protested on their website (which they ALSO did, in conjunction to the on-site protest), then it may have been a different story. 

Someone in the public eye is a different situation, like Bush in your example. He sought his position and as such now has an expectation of a loss of privacy. However, the family had done nothing to merit protesting. The jury agreed with them that there is, again, a certain expectation of privacy which was not held. That expectation of privacy is to not be thrust into the public eye, again, arbitrarily.

Juries don't always make sensible decisions, apparently in this case they weren't allowed to consider anything else but the emotional impact caused to the family.

Do you really think that juries should be instructed to disregard civil rights and then be charged to make a fair decision?

&gt; I'm not supporting the suppression of protestors. They can protest if they want - just find somewhere suitable to do it. A funeral isn't it.

they weren't at the funeral. They were outside of the church and across the street. They blocked nobody and they followed all applicable laws to the letter. This is the reason they aren't in criminal court.

So when you say they can protest, you're saying that they should be excluded from public places for these protests correct? How is excluding them from public land fair?

Its like you're elevating the status of the family to be above the status of everyone else. They have been granted privileged access to public space. The next step is to grant this right to other people for other occasions. I'm sure we can exclude them from protesting during weddings as well right? 

You're transforming an absolute right into a conditional right.

&gt; More knee-jerk bullshit just as bad as the GOP.

Me? you're the one in support of ""free speech zones""! That is a GOP tactic perfected by Bush!

Nobody else is reading this than us right now, so you don't have to pretend. You feel that circumstances dictate when certain suspensions of freedom are justified.

&gt; But since that soldier died for your right to do so, show him and his family some fucking respect.

ahhh....so now its respect. This is what Bush wants protesters to show him as well. Respect.

It wasn't too long ago that the elite of europe were demanding respect from the commoner. I can see the concept is slowly become more justified here in the US now.

&gt; So, quit trying to pin it to the adminstration, the war, or terrorism.

the method of exercising a freedom isn't the point I've been trying to make. Its that an American citizens freedoms are inviolate according to the constitution.

&gt; Free speech versus the right to privacy

What does privacy have to do with public spaces and protests though?

The case on the surface looks like we just don't like the WSB people and they can go away from the rest of us and do what they want, but they can't inhabit the same space as us. This basically is the populated areas of the country.

Deeper down though, this is a case where one group of people is given greater right to the public space than someone else. If a nutty group of people can't express themselves, what chance does a semi-nutty group have in 5 years of doing the same?

We are slowly transforming absolute rights into conditional rights. Once we break the absoluteness of a right, the degrees we're able to push things around is subject to interpretation.

For example, look at what we accept in allowing the government in warrantless phone tapping. It used to be disallowed completely, now we just get upset if they abuse it too much.

So now we have broken the absoluteness of free speech. It'll be just a matter of degrees from now on for who we suppress and why. The funny thing is that James Watson was also suppressed so closely together with this. I would almost say that its being orchestrated. ","1193888199"

The federal nutrition recommendations shown have too much grain in them for a normal, healthy diet. The subsidies for grains are much more deleterious to the nations health than the meat subsidies. Grain subsidies cause high-fructose corn syrup to be cheap (and keeps us from getting delicious real-sugar Dr. Pepper). HFCS is a much greater cause of obesity than meat will ever be.

That's 940 calories. How much comes from dairy and meat products, so hated by the article's author? 180 for the patties, 50 from the processed cheese (maybe), and 90 from the sauce (very speculative; in all likelihood this is mostly calories from corn oil and corn syrup). Potentially 320 calories from subsidized meat and dairy (at an absolute maximum). The rest is all corn. Corn oil, corn syrup, corn everything. Now how are meat and dairy making us fat again?

Keep in mind that this is the small meal. Super-size it and the numbers get significantly worse.

(Edit:) Ingredients for the special sauce (draw your own conclusions): Soybean oil, pickles, distilled vinegar, water, egg yolks, high fructose corn syrup, sugar, onion powder, ketchup, mayonnaise, corn syrup, spice and spice extractives, salt, xanthan gum, mustard flour, propylene glycol alginate, sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate as preservatives, mustard bran, garlic powder, hydrolyzed (corn gluten, wheat, and soy) proteins, caramel color, extractives of paprika, turmeric, calcium disodium EDTA to protect flavor.","1193889800"

NEW WEBSITE REVOLUTIONISES ON-LINE MARKETING
OF HOLIDAY HOME RENTALS


Real estate IT specialist, Entire Holidays has just launched a unique web based program aimed at promoting independent holiday home rentals to the world wide market via its new website www.entireholidays.com.

entireholidays.com is a break-through concept in online marketing. Whilst a number of websites currently target holiday home accommodation, only entireholidays.com is focused on assisting real estate Agents and Property Managers who may be responsible for up to 300 properties at any one time. Other websites are more tailored to individual property owners, requiring the data for each property to be manually entered and uploaded. This is a cumbersome and costly process for any Property Manager with more than a minimal portfolio of holiday home lettings.

“entireholidays.com is a revolutionary idea that will change the marketing of holiday rentals in much the same way that realestate.com and domain.com have changed the marketing of residential and commercial property sales,” said Mr Kelan Casey, Managing Director of Entire Holidays. “Property Managers will be able to upload their property details to our website via their current software portal and this will be fed automatically into other leading holiday sites such as takeabreak.com. With one touch, their holiday home will be promoted to the world on many leading holiday accommodation sites.” 

The feed into the TakeABreak website has already been accepted with many others due to follow in the New Year. Other key travel companies are also in negotiation to accept Entire Holidays’ properties onto their site listings.

“Currently, most Property Managers have elected not to take advantage of online advertising for independent holiday homes and apartments,” said Mr Casey. “It is so time-consuming to upload data and images to all the relevant sites that most Property Managers have concluded that it is not worth the effort for the small amount of commission they receive in return.

“entireholidays.com however automates the entire process and allows the Property Manager to manage all their holiday lettings from one portal. If they currently use a portal such as ReNet.com or Rock End (Rest), they can simply upload their property data through this system for automatic upload to the Entire Holidays’ site which will feed into a multitude of other high profile national and international sites.”

TakeABreak CEO, Mr Craig Davis agreed that the benefits entireholidays.com will bring to Property Managers and Agents will be significant.

“By partnering with Entire Holidays, TakeABreak can now list holiday rental properties without the Agent having to do any extra set up. As Australia's leading holiday rental website, TakeABreak can cost-effectively bring in additional bookings” said Mr Davis.

The Australian holiday home rentals market is currently valued at $1,600,000,000 in gross annual rental income per annum. With over 310,000 holiday home properties available at any one time, it is a market with enormous potential. With statistics from BIS Shrapnel showing that 8.5% or more than 500,000 households now own a second home in a holiday area, the holiday rental home sector has become the fastest growing segment of tourist accommodation in most areas of Australia. 

However, despite a recent study by Quantum Research finding tourists preferred staying in holiday homes because they felt more a part of the community than when they stayed in a hotel or motel, occupancy rates for holiday homes only averaged 48.4% for the year ended 30th September 2006.

“There is enormous untapped potential in the home rentals market,” said Mr Casey. “By advertising their properties on our entireholidays.com site, Property Managers can now take advantage of this potential, increasing returns from their existing properties while freeing up their time to attract other holiday rental properties to their portfolio.”

entireholidays.com is the only website in Australia that is 100% dedicated to the marketing of holiday lettings. As it allows a Property Manager to manage all their lettings through one portal, incoming bookings can all be managed via a single inbuilt calendar system. It is the only system in Australia that will allow agents to do this.

Developed by real estate agents for real estate agents, the Entire Holidays’ system offers unparalleled ease of use. A 24 hour 7 days a week customer service line, initial training and set up and ongoing training and support are all provided to ensure agents start to reap the rewards of the system as soon as possible.

“In addition to increase revenue from holiday lettings and easing the process of property management, entireholidays.com also provides Property Managers with the opportunity to earn and redeem rewards for a multitude of products and services” said Mr Casey. “By simply participating in our program, Property Managers and Agents can earn anything from plasma screens to holidays to computers and entertainment equipment. The list is endless.”

Entire Holidays is currently offering agents a free trial of the system. To find out how to take advantage of this unique opportunity, log onto www.entireholidays.com or call Mr Kelan Casey direct on 02 4341 0700.

It is a way to cut the costs of distribution (that record labels often have to front to the artist) so that the profits can go directly to the artist instead of the majority going to everyone BUT the artist.

There is nothing wrong with making money from selling your music. Radiohead experimented with a new business model that appears to have succeeded. Furthermore, to Radiohead fans, they gave away an album for free. That is a gift.

I don't even know why I'm explaining all of this to someone who clearly is only complaining because they don't get Radiohead and thus must scoff at their creation in order to feel better. I bet you have never written a song, let alone recorded an album, or better yet done anything creative and put it on the chopping block.

Hey, I can't stand gangster rap or Fallout Boy or Britney Spears, but I don't waste time anonymously hating on them online when they are in the news.

If you don't like Radiohead, why do you care? I'll tell you why - you are like every other Radiohead hater out there.

That being said -  I think this lawsuit sets a bad precedent because any asshole with a law degree can sue you and make it really expensive for you to express your opinions because then you have to go out and pay some other asshole lawyer to defend you.

"politics","t5_2cneq","For this to be real, you have to accept at least some of these:

* Ron Paul supporters are too stupid to see this would backfire
* They are unprincipled
* Bush's own campaign staff, notorious for arranging for the election to be stolen, thought that this was unviable, that it would backfire
* And didn't catch on that nothing they do backfires
* Or were too principled to do similar

The only way to reconcile these things, is to understand that such tactics, were they employed by a candidate like Hillary or Giuliani, would be brushed off and not hurt them. Even if one leveled the accusation at the other.

But, since this does hurt a campaign like Paul's, which is noted for being about principle, and since it would be inevitable that it backfires... is that neither he nor anyone that supports him is guilty of this.

Not even a higher up, but some republican on some republican state committee found a spammer in eastern europe who'd do this for $5000, which is a cheap way to scuttle Paul's campaign. He needs every dollar, every single vote, and if this so much as costs him a few thousand dollars or a few hundred voters... it was money well spent.

For a supposedly feminist writer, Wheden seems to be leaning towards more and more objectification of his female leads.  This storyline COULD be really well done...  or it could just be prurient and exploitive.

Also, ""search for identity"" plotlines are so cliche in sci-fi these days, and so rarely done well.  Phrases like, ""the show revolves around the childlike Echo's burgeoning self-awareness,"" make it sound like it could be a total cheesefest.  (""Is this what normal humans call...  love?"")

 I only make comments when I really want to. I don't troll around making insipid one liners like [this](http://reddit.com/info/5zkk1/comments/c02citf).

 Unfortunately, I'm quite human, and sometimes those insipid one liners (or longer answers) become more than just that and get on my nerves...

No matter how stupid and backward the conversations being carried out are. Sometimes, when you hear some of the stupid justifications that get put out there, it's hard not to take things personally. Especially for matters which do concern you personally. When some asshat half way around the world makes broad sweeping judgement calls on entire populations across the world, and then this pov is vehemently defended by legions of people who just will not admit that their reasoning is plain wrong... it gets to you.

Apparently you've never bought insurance on the open market.  They ask questions - you have to answer truthfully or - later  - when you file a claim - they simply drop you, deny coverage, and accuse you of fraud.

The website you cite is an insurance industry coalition.  Funny how much they talk about people defrauding insurance companies - but nothing at all about companies defrauding individuals - which from my perspective appears to happen a lot more often.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Tag clouds aim to provide more than 1 dimension of information at a glance. An alphabetically sorted tag cloud lets you (1) easily locate any tag you are looking for (2) instantly see which ones are important. A tag cloud sorted by popularity makes it harder to find specific tags.

E.g. [delicious tags](http://del.icio.us/tag/). Quick, what are the 10-15 most popular tags? Now how popular are php and statistics?

You can add another dimension to the same tag cloud - color. Brighter tags could be newer, faded tags could be older. I added another dimension - point-in-time - to my [personal](http://chir.ag/tags/) blog tag cloud. So you can immediately see that while I talk a lot about love, computers, and india, the tags kayak, kitties, and tampa have affected my life more recently. Also, while economics and websites are still a big deal to me, they've always been as important. Calculus is becoming less and less important now that I've been out of college for a few years. Move the slider above the tag cloud to see the point-in-time tags.

Tag clouds can be useful and informative as long as you put some thought into it and realize the scope of their use. You can't just slap on a tag cloud on to any odd webpage and expect magic. Neither can you convert a tag cloud into a descending popularity list and expect to convey anything meaningful.","1193892387"

Let's tax capital gains at 50%, because only those nasty rich folks are getting any money from it!  Viva la Revolucion!

Let's see how the economy does then, when money flies away from equity and debt markets and start-ups can't get any capital.  Jesus kids... for just one second try to look at the economy from a utilitarian perspective rather than always having your class-warfare boxing gloves on.

Follow this logic for one nanosecond:
1.  Risk taking is good for the economy.  If  entrepreneurs can't get access to capital (and let's be clear, giving an entrepreneur venture capital is one of the top 10 most risky things you can do with your money), if companies can't get the money for risky projects, than the economy stalls.
2.  Taxing Capital Gains gives an incentive (at the margin, I you don't know the impact of the marginal, please pick up an economics textbook) for people to not invest in these risky activities.
3.  If you tax capital gains as income, there's more of an incentive for people to put their money in income producing risk-free assets than risky projects/companies.

Now to directly respond to your post: firstly, if you think the stock market isn't risky for rich people, you don't know jack about investing.  Secondly, your red herrings about people people having ""no money to lose"" and rich people ""losing more when they die"", 1. have literally nothing to do with the point I'm making, and 2. really make very little sense.

It's good when foreigners purchase our goods, but I'm not sure we want foreign control of our domestic assets.  In fact, we (the US and European governments) block the Chinese from purchasing large American companies outright, even though they would love to do so.

But all those dollars the Chinese hold have to go somewhere, and in this case, they went into our subprime-backed investments.

Today that number is about 1oz for every $40000 in circulation.  In 1980 gold hit $830/oz, inflation adjusted for today that is about $2400/oz.  They should consider other things, like that the size of the gold market is in the range of 100 billion, but the size of the general market is is the range of 10000 billion.  If even 1% of the general market starts taking proactive actions to shelter from a declining dollar, that will pretty much guarantee gold goes nuclear.

"science","t5_mouw","Thanks for pointing me to one of those articles born from ignorance I was talking about (probably found by googling).

That article mainly talks about [Daniel Botkin](http://www.naturestudy.org/whois/botkin.htm) and an [op-ed he wrote](http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110010763) for the WSJ. You can read two answers to it [here](http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2007/10/17/rupert_murdoch_tear_down_this.php) and [here](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/10/global-warming-delusions-at-the-wall-street-journal/).

The melting glaciers of the Kilimajaro are a red herring, it is no longer thought to be caused by global warming. But there are tons of other indicators (melting polar ice, glaciers elsewhere, temperature records, ..) which show that global warming is happening - but if he does not doubt that GW is happening as he later says, why mention the Kilimanjaro at all?

Also, Botkin is a biologist, not a climate scientist, so I do reserve my doubts about his expertise on climate models.

&gt; The idea of a runaway Global Warming cycle - carbon dioxide casuing warming, which in turns releases more carbon dioxide and more heating, etc, until the earth's atmosphere matches that of Venus - is a product of these models.

That is plain wrong. Much simpler models show that greenhouse gases cause global warming. The complex models show just more detail, and include more feed backs mechanisms. But that the greenhouse gases cause warming is simple physics.

The computer models have also been confirmed by observations.

And no, a runaway greenhouse effect as it happened on Venus is not to be expected, and is *not* predicted by any of those models.

But few degrees is bad enough to cause a lot of trouble.

Anyway, it also not just the models, it is also historic data that confirm the consensus.

You really should read the IPCC report.

Long-term investors wouldn't exit existing investments, as this would trigger a taxable realization.

Additionally, even with lower expected after-tax returns, US-based investments still have some advantages over international investments (especially of the emerging market sort), such as high-quality financial reporting, establish securities law, lower management fees on funds, greater diversity in both industry and company size, etc. Now, a move to 50% is extreme, but something like a move to 25-30% (comparable to normal income rates) would be much easier to swallow.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;The melting glaciers of the Kilimajaro are a red herring, it is no longer thought to be caused by global warming. But there are tons of other indicators (melting polar ice, glaciers elsewhere, temperature records, ..) which show that global warming is happening - but if he does not doubt that GW is happening as he later says, why mention the Kilimanjaro at all?

I must admit that I am disappointed by RealClimate's response. The redditors that have recommended the site to me in the past seem to hold it in high regard.

The problem with both responses is that they dodge around the issue raised by the melting of the glacier at Kilimanjaro.

&gt;Even if it turned out that for some bizarre reason the Kilimanjaro glacier, which is thousands of years old, picked just this moment to melt purely by coincidence...

Correction: It seems RealClimate scientists failed to understand the implications of glacial melt in sub-freezing temperature.

Let me explain. Glaciers that melt at sub-freezing temperatures do so due to solar radiation. The glacier at Kilimanjaro is melting because the sun is more active. Logically, if increased solar radiation is causing unusual glacial melting, then all other melting glaciers around the world are also melting at an increased rate due to increased solar radiation. Increased solar radiation would effect more than just Kilimanjaro.

Botkin's focal point is that increased solar radiation is at least partly responsible for increased deglaciation and melting of the polar ice caps. The two responses fail to address the science behind the argument.

The fact that Mars is warming up also lends credence to the argument.

Feel free to rebut that, or link to a site that rebuts that piece of logic.

&gt;which show that global warming is happening - but if he does not doubt that GW is happening as he later says, why mention the Kilimanjaro at all?

Global Warming is happening, at least for now. There is no science needed for that, just simple scientific measurements taken year after year. The debate is over what causes that heating. Natural cycle, or human activity? Sun, or carbon dioxide. Botkins is suggesting that the sun is at least partially responsible for the melting glaciers/ice caps.

&gt;And no, a runaway greenhouse effect as it happened on Venus is not to be expected, and is not predicted by any of those models.

You are likely right on this. However, that doesn't stop politicians and other high-profile activists from exaggerating the results of computer programming. 

Thats an issue seperate from computer modeling itself. And sadly, it taints the credibility of more reasoned and honest activists.","1193896820"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Of course code can be expressed in a platform-independent fashion. But it is a fundamental truth of computer science that many interesting questions cannot be asked of code in a Turing-complete language.

Sure, but the *question of interest* in this case is, ""Does the document conform to the schema/DTD?"" And this question is decidable, even for Turing-complete programs. That is why programs in Haskell 98 and ML can be type-checked statically: type-checking always terminates even though the programs might not.

Besides, I didn't say XML needed to be Turing-complete. There are many languages which perform computation which are not Turing-complete. If I take a language like Haskell and remove recursion, all Haskell programs will terminate, and yet I can still encode things like Ackermann's function. [Charity](http://pll.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/charity1/www/home.html) is a powerful, terminating programming language. CSS performs a sort of computation, and yet CSS rendering terminates. Regular expression substitution terminates. There are lots of HTML templating languages with restricted iteration, etc. Even XML's so-called ""textual substitutions"" are a form of computation.

What I am complaining about is the misperceptions that:

* by limiting the computation to simple textual substitution you have somehow sidestepped computation altogether. A more robust mechanism would have been to allow variables which range over XML data and element type variables which range over XML element types. In XML you can't even define a polymorphic pair or polymorphic list. It's completely ridiculous.

* you cannot validate a document which performs some computation.

&gt; You mentioned undecidability but waved your hands past it as if it is irrelevant. It is not: it is key. If you send me a schema to validate your data, I want to know that the validation process will terminate in a predictable amount of time.

Sure.

&gt; But you are proposing something even more insane: you are claiming that the data exchange language itself should be programmable.

Yeah, I'm crazy that way.

&gt; XML does not have macros. It has simple text substitutions.

And the difference is...? A text substitution facility *is* a macro facility. The difference between a variable and a macro is that macros don't respect the grammatical structure. (I mean ""variables"" in the sense of Haskell or Scheme, not C.)

&gt; Yes, the XML family of standards is layered so that different applications can choose the appropriate set to implement.

My point is not the layering. My point is that it is precisely because XML does not include any mechanism for computation that the other standards (like XSLT) became necessary. So your insistence that XML being programmable would make it useless is already refuted by the mere existence of other Recommendations seeking to address that problem.

&gt; Isn't Lisp layered? Does every Lisp variant ship with the exact same set of libraries?

Sorry, but I am not a Lisp apologist.

&gt; Oh really? Can you please point me to the RFC for this cross platform ""lambda calculus?"" How are integers encoded? What is its character set?

You see? This is the problem! No, there is no RFC for lambda-calculus. But there is tons of information about it in the mathematics and computer science literature. But because the XML creators are so ignorant and blinkered, they had no idea.

&gt; Funny, having been at the meetings, I could have sworn that the most influential people on the committee included...

OK, you've got me there. I guess I should have written, ""*Despite* knowing about mobile and portable code...""!

The problem, you see, is that two of the mobile/portable languages in question here, Javascript and DSSSL, are untyped, so the idea of static validation was far from their minds. As for Java, which *is* mobile code which can be statically type-checked... well, it's pretty close to C/C++, isn't it? And, just like them, you don't see the relationship between validation and type-checking either. You are just making my point for me.

&gt; Sorry, can you point me to the part of the XML specification that says that a tag ""lends semantics?""

It doesn't say it in the spec, but it is a pervasive misconception which XML advocates have, at best, done nothing to combat; at worst, they have promulgated it. Do you know there are web designers arguing about whether some XML vocabulary is ""semantic"" or not? It's unbelievable.

I am not the only one who is [exasperated](http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1093) by it. I could find several other links in that vein.

&gt; Can you even define what it would mean to ""lend semantics""?

Sure. Consider XHTML. It has elements like ol and p. The semantics of these elements are given (roughly) by how they are rendered. For example, p is rendered as a paragraph.

Now consider an XML document which is not XHTML, maybe conforming to some schema S, but which has a para element. para has no *a priori* semantics except what is called initial semantics, which I will skip. Now, how do I say that para is a ""paragraph""? There is no way to do it in XML except to assign some special meaning to tags of S, that is, by defining an ""XML application"". In other words, to define the semantics of para, I have to go *outside* of XML.

Now consider what I could do if XML had some means for computation, something like XSLT perhaps, but terminating. I could send the S-conforming document along with a mapping of S's para to XHTML's p. Now the meaning of para is the same as p, so I have defined its semantics unambiguously.

The key point is that I can't do it without some means of computation, which XML lacks.

&gt; James Clark, inventor of DSSSL doesn't ""know anything about programming languages."" You should do five minutes of research, friend.

Well, Paul, guess what? I know all about Mr. Clark and DSSSL and Jade and Scheme. Clark is a fantastic programmer, but not much of programming language designer, and that is part of the reason he has no PLT publications. It is also why DSSSL never had a rigorous description in the vein of the XML Schema Formal Description.

I have read that the reason Relax NG has a formal description now is primarily because Phil Wadler introduced James Clark to the idea. I think it's great that he has adopted some PLT ideas, but the fact that he was ignorant of them before then only drives my point home.

&gt; It isn't XML that is confused. It is you. DTDs are not a type system. DTDs are a grammar definition syntax. Like BNF. Not like Haskell types.

Well, I'm sorry to break it to you, but ask any type theorist and you will find out that DTDs are just a special kind of type system. A grammar is just a set of axioms for a noncommutative logic whose proofs are strings. This is a fact which is used implicitly in data bindings such as [DtdToHaskell](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/HaXml/Xml2Haskell.html), and in type-theoretic approaches to language description such as [ASF+SDF](http://www.cwi.nl/htbin/sen1/twiki/bin/view/Meta-Environment/ASF+SDF)
and its offshoots. The fact that you still labor under this misapprehension is just more proof that-- well, I'm sorry, but you just don't know what you're talking about.

It is also why XSLT requires a validation step after the transformation; if the XSLT designer has known their business, they could have defined XSLT in such a way that a transformation always produces a valid document given a valid input. In type programming, we call this, um, a ""function"".

&gt; Funny, if the XML companion standard were NOT expressed in XML, then that would be used as proof that XML is poor. But if they ARE then that is proof that the standardizers didn't know parsing.

Sorry, I was not clear enough. I am not talking about the fact that XML and other W3C Recommendations are written in XML. Of course you ought to eat your own dog food. I am talking about the fact that, for example, an XML Schema or an XSLT program is an XML document. It is so completely absurd and unworkable that Relax NG defines a non-XML syntax, and Phil Wadler et al.'s XML papers defined a non-XML syntax for schema in order to be able to treat it satisfactorily.","1193896912"

Venture capital is about ownership first, then investment. And ownership gives you control. Company goes bust? Sell assets (facilities, process, knowledge) and therefore reduce your damage.

Also, risk isn't only at the side of the capital. Risk is taken by entrepreneur and workforce, too. It's divested. Actual owner  has the most leverage there.

What governs the behavior of venture capitals is that they are in the business of investing in *risk*, not in the business of improving the economy. In such a position, first thing they do is to *reduce their own risk*, having a way out of trouble. And that, I think, errs on the side of *poorly* following through, in a domain that is often not of venturer's expertise.

Their risk taking (I say, risk *management*) is largely orthogonal to the health of the economy. What matters much, much more is what actual value can be created, and that is in the hands of people with knowledge and ideas, not money.","1193897258"

"programming","t5_2fwo","At this point I'm starting to think you are either trolling or have never been in the position of actually hiring someone.  Either way I suspect this discussion is very unproductive at this point and I doubt I'll respond again.

&gt; Of course, it's not like you have Real Ultimate Power that would let you dictate policy globally, so people would get to choose regardless of whether you ""let"" them or not.

This is the exact type of response I'm talking about.  This isn't even a real critique, instead it's simply a poorly thought out flame attempt.  I obviously allowed people to choose by presenting more than one way to test someone during an interview.  Did you actually read it?  Some of your later comments make me doubt that very much.  At best I suspect you skimmed it.

&gt; Or BS that they solved it, assisted by writing it in a
&gt; language the interviewer is not familiar with -- like Perl,
&gt;  or, say, Ruby. 
&gt; It's a LOT easier to talk a person into believing your
&gt; program works than to prove it on a computer.
&gt; Heck, I've talked myself into it many times before
&gt; finding out, ""The computer says No...""

Your assumption seems to be that either the hiring manager is non-technical or that they are a terrible programmer themself.  Or maybe they don't teach pseudocoding in school anymore.  Or maybe you never went to school and don't understand pseudocoding.  I have no idea which it is, however I can 100% guarantee you I can understand the logic of pretty close to any pseudocode, particularly if it is written by a good programmer.  Perhaps that's not your skillset, perhaps you don't have the ability to abstractly conceptualize the logic of a program, if that's the case, you most certainly are not a good programmer, or the kind I would hire.  I've hired dozens of people using this technique, and any *good* programmer can tell when someone is BSing them, especially on something they know well.  Good programmers produce very clear logic that is easy to follow, particularly in pseudocode.  If that's not your experience, you may need more practice.

&gt; In the sense that you got hired? An equivalent article could be written by a junkie whose ""interview"" consisted of getting stoned with the hiring manager -- ""it worked really well for me!""
&gt; That's tautological; it doesn't demonstrate that such a process will actually succeed when it comes to ""hiring good programmers"". Indeed, good programmers are often so heavily recruited that they never even GO through a normal hiring process. They wouldn't even bother with stuff like phoned-in brain teasers, considering them a good indication that the company is probably clueless, because that's not a very good way to find people.

First off I don't think you even know what the word tautological means.  Second you clearly didn't actually read the article.  I clearly discussed in the article that I have employed this technique numerous times in my own hiring process and it has produced excellent results for me.  I also commented in a different comment that I didn't end up taking that job for personal reasons.  However I have used the process extensively and hired dozens of programmers myself.  Perhaps if you didn't either skim or quit reading early, your retention might be better.  Your idea that good programmers never go through a hiring process is ridiculous.  Certainly many programmers get hired directly through word of mouth, however many companies require all hires to go through a screening process.  Any programmer that can actually produce workking code wouldn't have a problem with this screening.  It's those that can't code that have the biggest issues with it.

&gt;The point that you made, ""When hiring a programmer, you need to see how they program"" is spot-on and also completely obvious. The best way to do this is to see stuff they've already done that actually works. Not toy problems, not how they do in a completely different environment (whiteboard vs. computer, being put ""on the spot"" vs. enough time to get in ""the zone""), not how well they can convince you they're right.

More proof you haven't interviewed for many jobs or hired many people.  First of all it isn't obvious because almost no one does it.  If it was obvious everyone would do it, yet hardly any company does.  Second, seeing what someone says they did proves nothing.  Every programmer comes in claiming they ""built"" this or that system.  Yet any piece of software that is non-trivial requires a team of people.  The good programmers had a very significant hand in building it, the bad ones claim they did.  The problem is as a hiring manager you can't possibly know which type they are up front.  So the only way to know if someone can actually code, is to have them do it for you.

&gt; nd personally I've heard so many brain teasers that chances are good I already know the solution without having to figure anything out. That's probably why companies have shifted to unconventional questions without ""right"" or ""wrong"" answers to see what someone's reasoning process is, although without any proof that their critique of someone's reasoning process is in any way correct!

Seriously, actually read the article next time.  I specifically said brain teasers are a bad hiring technique.  Giving someone a programming problem on the other hand is not a brain teaser, and I guarantee you, if you came and interviewed with me, you'd be presented with a problem you'd never seen before.

Your final point about freshmeat is just as problematic as the point about having someone show you something they wrote that works.  In real life you have no idea how much help they had or how much of the software they built themselves.  Not to mention that the number of people geographically close to you that have software on freshmeat and are on the job market is vanishingly small.

Why don't you come back after having had to hire a team of 20 people in a short period of time to staff a project, and let us know how your brilliant ideas work out.  Having seen or tried most of what you suggest in real life, I can tell you first hand it won't work out well for you.

There are a few things you have to have to make the ideas I presented work.  Either the hiring manager has to be a good coder themselves or they have to have access to a good coder to help review candidates.  People have to have already built the problem you are presenting and be very familiar with how it works.  If you do those things, and run this process as I've presented it, your odds of hiring an inept programmer will be **greatly** diminished.

"reddit.com","t5_6","two of my friends and i witnessed a ufo in october of 2001 while we lived in the virgin islands. not just a strange light in the sky but a physical craft cruising over our heads no more than 50 meters off the ground. cigar shaped, about the length of a 727 with an almost translucent or reflective surface. 

At first we thought it was going to crash due to its trajectory. But it slowed to a stop in mid air after entering a small low lying cloud where it then vanished. 

it was the most incredible thing i ever saw and i've never looked at the sky the same since. its one thing to see something strange in the sky, but this was close enough we heard some sort of mechanical power source which vibrated the air around us and resonated in our bodies. it is depressing for me to think about in a sense because i know i will never find out its origin and who or what occupied it. i've also never regretted the absence of a digital camera more than during those brief moments.","1193898220"

"reddit.com","t5_6","How much is going to Iraq, or is being allocated to the USEmpire?  How much goes overseas to pay our interest on our debts?  How much goes to FEMA trailers that never get used, then sold at 10% of their original price?  How much of our money goes to pay for propaganda?  How much of our money goes to ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, except greedy, corrupt individuals?

That accounts for much, much more than 40% of our FEDERAL revenue!

You are an idiot to think that our federal government needs this much money to begin with.  RP clearly says that the federal government doesn't need this much money.  When Americans have more money, taxation on consumables becomes less burdening and you can easily absorb any lacking revenue by allowing the states to tax that.  This requires the state to maintain control over their own resources and requirements. 

All of our states are CASH STRAPPED because the federal government takes the largest majority of taxation on the income of the people.  

Before you ask such a silly question, why don't you ask yourself, why does the federal government need so much money to begin with?

I will reference the ""good old days before 1913"", because before 1913, we the people had real money, and our social economics were in very, very good order, and without *pre*1913, we would not have become the greatest, most powerful nation ever to grace this fine planet we call Earth.  But I guess to you, 1913 is ancient history equal to that of Biblical times.

RP should have referenced the good old days before 1783 when we whooped the shit out of the British empire for burdening the people with abusive taxes and without any representation.

40%?  Give us back our 40%, and we will fix it ourselves, and faster than these wolves in sheep's clothing we call our government!

Even so, with RP as our president, I would be glad to continue paying income tax  if we had something to show for all of our money they have spent.  As it is now, they can't show us anything except for blood, guts, broken bridges and broken promises.   ","1193898292"

"reddit.com","t5_6","I agree that the buildings weren't demolitioned. But these reasons are just bullshit.

&gt; On the other hand, conspiracy theorists form a dogmatic view FIRST or in an unqualified way, and then use all sorts of clunky and imprecise evidence to support it, as demonstrated previously.

I'm not like that. I assumed at first that it fell normally, and then had my doubts. There are anomalies. This much is certain. But I now attribute these to some oddball, unexpected failure mode (that probably still hasn't been explained adequately).

&gt; To suggest a cover up is to allege a huge amount of compliance from a huge amount of people, and equates to extreme paranoia.

No, it's not. There is social inertia to the extent that few need actively and intentionally to cover things up. Even now, how many americans believe Saddam was involved in 9-11? Right there is evidence of a (botched) conspiracy. It's not exactly as if Bush wasn't morally/ethically capable of pulling shit like this.

&gt; Therefore, they suggest, there must have been some other catalyst in the collapsing of the two towers. Now, there is leaping logic at play here, namely that the steel must melt for it to lose integrity. It is not obvious that steel need not melt for it to be weak, but any expert would immediately recognize this.

And yet other buildings burn and the steel doesn't lose integrity and collapse. The ""truthers"" have this part right... something funny is going on. Just that they can't imagine something other than CIA ninjas wiring it up for demolition.

And it blathers on a bit more, lumping in the ""demolition"" theories along with much more plausible theories... such as key people in the Bush administration (or their kingmakers) having foreknowledge. This isn't absurd, minimally competent FBI and CIA bureaucracies were mostly onto it right up until. To say that someone didn't put two and two together and decide to let it happen anyway... that's just dumb. This part of the conspiracy theory is not easy to debunk, I half believe it myself.

If you want to debunk the ""demolition theory"" though, that can be done in just one reason that requires no evidence or counter-evidence. What would be gained by bringing the buildings down, that wasn't already accomplished by hundreds being killed in the jets? And it has to be a pretty big something, to account for the added risk of premature discovery, the added risk of the attacks being unsuccessful or abandoned, the added risk that the impact wouldn't damage the detonation system and leave it to be discovered, the risk that there wouldn't be leaks (since demolition would require at least a dozen more low level conspirators... Cheney himself wouldn't be there wiring up the plastique).

But to discover that murderers were about to do this, and to let it happen so you could have a new Pearl Harbor you've been creaming your shorts for? That sounds decidedly Bush/Cheney-like. Wanting to add another murder to Manson's death count might be correct or incorrect, but that doesn't rise to the level of ""conspiracy theory"".","1193898721"

They already have the money, it's not like it's deposited.

No, it results in depreciation of the dollar. The lower dollar may translate into inflated prices for commodities, but that's a separate issue. 

&gt;If the price starts dropping fast enough, everyone tries to get rid of it at once, as the first person to get rid of reserves first gets the most out of them.

"science","t5_mouw","Statins were originally prescribed to treat high cholesterol, but they've recently been finding that statins may also reduce hypertension. 

My reason for wondering if the new definition of MI could trigger increases in statin scripts is because I've read two MD sites, one's a cardiologist, the other's a retired MD/astronaut, that seem to think the medical community prescribes statins a LOT. The cardiologist blogs about ways to decrease risk of cardiac disease with supplements and diet, and he monitors his patients' progress very closely to make sure the program is working (but he runs into problems with what goes against the AMA, because what he's finding out hasn't gone mainstream yet, and people find it hard to believe that starches and grains can be more dangerous than fats). The retired MD writes about his bad side effects from taking statins, which caused him to research it more, and his findings are worth noting, and maybe looking into the cardiologist's teachings. Here's their links if you're interested: http://heartscanblog.blogspot.com/

PS: if you, or someone you love are taking statins, pay attention to their coQ10/statin articles -- I really don't have personal experience with this, since luckily my lipid panel done a few weeks ago was good, but I'm at the age where that could change soon, so I watch this stuff in my feeds =)","1193899796"

This doesn't apply to everyone. If we ONLY think of the welfare of the downtrodden investment bankers when we make monetary policy, we're gonna fuck over many billions of people.

Second, did the family have therapists and pills? I don't know, maybe? Who gives a fuck. I didn't say that they did or they didn't, but you've stopped short of claiming that they didn't by asking that question. An example usually helps make a bigger point.

Furthermore, tag clouds tend to have an excessive amount of affiliations. On the web panel for Dreamhost, there are about fifty tags in the cloud.

Yeah many if not most police officers are good folks, but unfortunately trust is difficult to earn and easily lost. As soon as one bad cop abrogates an individual's rights without being brought to justice, the individual will never trust the police force to act justly again. 

What's screwed up is that the police require the people's trust in order to move forward in their investigations, but in areas densely inhabited by minorities the populace has learned through experience not to trust them or ""snitch"". So distrust leads to fewer investigations, leaving more crimes unsolved on the streets which spurs cops into more racial profiling which leads to more distrust and fewer leads and higher crime, and scrub rinse repeat.

I'm sure you have someone special in your life, someone you love or want to love. Well there are many ways to spark up some romance in your busy life but the personal touch of romantic greeting cards can really hit the emotional spot your aiming for.

When you're going to give your loved one romantic greeting cards you must practice the fine art of surprise. Cards like this are most effective when they catch your spouse off guard, then the true appeal of your card can work its magic.

Greeting cards are often pre-made, making it easy for the giver to pick a loving and creative card. However, if you have a talent for making greeting cards then I suggest going down the path of customized greeting cards for that special someone. 

Anyway if you like this article you can read the full one and see the video on my blog.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm not conflating, rather I'm oserving.  The gay political agenda is borne of the gay subculture and almost all of the activists are members of the gay subculture.

The gay agenda has had many unintended consequences and if reasonable gay people don't think carefully about some of their approaches they will do themselves more harm than good.  Pushing the abolition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman handed the last election to Bush.  It was a wedge issue that the Republicans deftly used in key battleground states and the polling confirms that it got more people to vote (to affirm marriage) who in turn favored bush over Kerry in aggregate.   Soon enough gay activism will seal the marriage debate once and for all with a Constitutional Amendment.  You may scoff at this, but what will happen is people will get sick of a few percent of the population insisting everyone pretend men and women aren't meaningfully different and pretending that wanting sodomy is the same thing as being black or white.  Once an Amendment passes you can give up on the issue once and for all which might actually benefit the gay movement by refocusing its aims--say elevating gay subculture.

Newsflash:  you don't need a marriage license to be monogamous and getting married is no guarantee of monogamy.  Stop blaming heterosexuals for the choices gay adults make.  ","1193906575"

"science","t5_mouw","In the US, one typically pursues what is known as a J.D. This is a professional degree that happens after the undergraduate degree. If I recall correctly, programs typically last three years.  Contrast this with an MBA, another professional degree, that typically takes two or, say, an MS in computer science taking two to three years.

Each of those degrees, being professional degrees, typically costs the student money and perhaps a lot of money.

On the other hand, a PhD is a graduate degree. In engineering, computing, and many of the sciences, the student will receive some sort of assistantship that covers tuition and pays a stipend.  In a field like CS students will often intern during summers and earn substantially higher income. In many programs, students satisfy the requirements of an MS along the way and earn higher internship salaries as a result.

Having said that, PhDs take a long time, perhaps six to eight years in most CS fields on average[*]. 

[*] Interesting side note: Biologists and the like take fewer years, but then have to spend more time postdocing. CS graduates often don't have to postdoc at all. My guess is that it works out to be the same overall time.","1193909488"

Right, I noticed the literal logical implication: *If you go into court with therapists and pills (A), then you might sway a jury (B)*. Of course, this does not literally imply *If not A, then not B*.

Nevertheless, your statement (""might just be able to sway a jury"") certainly seems to suggest  *If not A, then not B*, by claiming that A will just barely accomplish B, and apparently implying that anything short of A is unlikely to accomplish B.

Hence I am asking you whether in this case, B was in fact preceded by A.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I've always found the attitudes surrounding abortion peculiar.

My personal feeling on abortion is that it feels wrong.  There's something deeply unsettling about it to me.  Once when I was in the second grade I saw someone intentionally crushing birds eggs.  The thought of it kinda made me sick.  I knew it wasn't cruel or painful, but there was something deeply saddening about it.

Then again, I feel strongly that just because something seems wrong to me doesn't mean I should force others not to do it.

Pro-lifers bother me sometimes when they feel the absolute need to control those around them instead of simply making good decisions for themselves.  And pro-choicers bother me sometimes in their bold and proud attitude towards abortion, almost as if a girl who walks out of an abortion clinic deserves a medal and a parade.

My attitude has always been that abortion is a very bad thing which we should, as a society, try to reduce.  But controlling the lives of others is also a very bad thing which we should, as a society, try to reduce.","1193913429"

In other words, not attending the conference won't actually affect anything.

There are two issues here.  Is the economy being taxed too much or too little, and are the poor/middle class/rich dividing the obligation fairly?

Buffet is arguing that the split is not fair, which could mean you raise taxes on the rich or lower them on the poor/middle class.  He is obviously assuming the economy is taxed too little but doesn't have much to say on that topic.

Pay attention, please. I am doing my damnedest to say that this album -- Magic -- is not ""filled"" with Iraq war criticism as the title of this post alleges. 

Springsteen is against the war. We all know that. So am I, by the way, but that has nothing to do with what we're talking about.

Take a look at the title of this post. The title says that Springsteen's new album is filled criticism of the Iraq war. That's not true. 

The title implies that this is the reason he's not getting played on Clear Channel. That's not true, or at least there's no proof presented to back up that implication, certainly not in the article this post leads to. 

The title implies that the article this post points to supports his assertion. It doesn't. The article doesn't even mention the war in Iraq because IT'S NOT WHAT THE ARTICLE IS ABOUT. Neither is it about the Dixie Chicks.

Jesus, this is exhausting.

So why don't you tell me ... do you think Springsteen's new CD is a statement about Iraq? How did you come to this conclusion? Do you think it's marginally anti-war, aggressively anti-war? What's your favorite anti-war song on the CD? And your 2nd, 3rd and 4th?

"reddit.com","t5_6","feminism and the deification of women in american society began as a part of a campaign by Capital to get more Labor into the Labor force. THe faster the supply of labor grows, the lower wages are, and the higher profits are for Capital.

So feminism evolved into a sort of religion to pump up women's egos so that they would feel capable of competing with men in the workforce.

This started back 40 years ago or so. THe FBI in fact was the first funder of Gloria Steinem.

Most of this female-centered ""political religion"" originated from the nonprofit foundations (e.g., the ford and rockefeller foundations), which channeled plutocrat and megacorporation $$$ into political activism that would provide the genesis for feminism.
See Dr. Roelofs' book FOUNDATIONS AND PUBLIC POLICY: THE MASK OF PLURALISM. Or just read Daniel Brandt's online essay about multiculturalism and the elite.

""12. Do I have to accept every assignment that is offered?
Foreign Service personnel can express their preference for postings, but must be willing to serve worldwide according to the needs of the Service.

13. Does the system tolerate dissent?
As public servants, Foreign Service Officers must publicly defend U.S. government policy, despite personal reservations. There is an internal channel through which an employee may present dissenting views on specific foreign policy issues. If an officer cannot publicly defend official U.S. policy, he or she has the option to resign.""

&gt;As of Sept. 30 Gravel had raised $287,000, far below the news outlet’s $1 million threshold, one of three criteria for participating. NO other major candidate participating in either party’s debates has raised less than $2 million.

&gt;Even if a candidate has not raised $1 million, they could still participate if they have received 5 percent or more on recent polling in Iowa or New Hampshire, the sites of the first nominating contest, or if they have traveled to those states at least 14 times to campaign, Todd said of NBC’s rules.

&gt;Gravel did not meet any of those criteria, he said.

Actually, it operates the same as natural selection in the environment. You see that animals in the far North have thicker fur than animals in the south? Did ""THEY"" arrange for that to be the case? Is it a CONSPIRACY that northern animals have thicker fur than southern animals?

No, not at all. It is simply the outcome of ENVIRONMENTAL FORCES over time. THere are small forces and BIG forces that act on generations animals over time. The climate is a BIG force.


American politics is ALSO an environment. And there are small forces (you and me voting and answering polls), and there are BIG forces ($$$ from plutocrats and corporations; in the aggregate, you can call these forces CAPITAL). Over decades, the BIG forces have a BIG effect. So the political environment is SHAPED by CAPITAL, just as the animals' fur is SHAPED by climate.

Let me help you with an example:

Imagine that an IDEA is present. Such as the idea that people work and earn $$$. 

In this sense, how americans work and earn $$ is analogous, similar to, etc the fact that animals have fur to protect them. 


Just as their are forces that shape and affect the thickness of that fur, also, then there are FORCES that shape how americans work to earn $$.


There are forces that affect how we work to earn $$. Some forces are small, and some are big forces. 

One big force is Capital. Capital is the accumulation of lots $$ into highly concentrated areas, such as billionaires and corporations. In aggregate, individual americans have lots of $$$, but their $$$ are not acting in unison, held by a few people or entities. RIch people and large corporations are labeled Capital because they represent large aggregations/collections of $$ in one location and under control by a small number of people or entities.


Suppose one billionaire has a DESIRE about how this idea of people working to earn $$ should be. So, in order to make his desire come true, he uses some of his $$$ to help SHAPE the idea of how people work to earn $$$. 

For example, he gives some $$ to a nonprofit foundation and tells the foundation to spend that $$$ to help his idea come true (suppose he wants more women in the workforce, so that the labor supply is higher, and he can pay lower wages. Law of supply and demand, you see....).



So the nonprofit foundation tries to make that idea come true by writing books or newspaper article or making a video or funding political activists, etc, all of which is designed to help that billionaire's desire be fulfilled (get more women into workforce, which causes the supply of labor to grow faster than demand for labor, which causes wages to drop and profits to increase). 


Over the decades, other billionaires/millionaires have the same idea. Why? Because they are in the same position and have similar ideas (want lower wages and higher profits), not surprisingly. 


So over decades, all this $$ from Capital has an effect of the political culture of america. Just as the cold climate causes northern animals to have thicker fur, the strong forces of big $$ affect the american culture, SHAPE the american political culture. Over the last 50 years or so, Capital, in its ever-present desire for lower wages, has shaped the american political culture so as to mold that culture into a shape that will help Capital. Similarly, mankind, over millenia, shaped wild cattle and domesticated them through selective breeding, breeding those cattle that had mild temperaments, bigger udders, thicker rumps, and that were meatier.

So, therefore, over decades, through use of their $$$, Capital has SHAPED our political culture, has DOMESTICATED it, into a shape that is CONDUCIVE to higher profits for Capital.

Is it a conspiracy? No, just organic entities acting in their own best interests.

There are also other mechanisms in play that affect the outcome. For example, the snowball effect is a large factor.

THere, that wasn't so hard, was it.

If you want to an entire book, and want to learn more about this idea, read Dr Joan Roelofs' book FOUNDATIONS AND PUBLIC POLICY: THE MASK OF PLURALISM.

&gt; with a monster disguised as ECMAScript 4. 

How have Adobe and Mozilla hijacked things? There are other groups/people involved in producing the ES4 draft, including Opera. 

The draft was produced from a combined effort from what I can see and have read. The minutes of the meetings are even in the public on the [wiki](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=meetings:meetings). 

Read through the minutes and get an idea of the discussions and decide yourself whether anyone hijacked things. Any objections from others would be in there I suspect.

&gt; The open reference implementation is 
&gt; a nice idea, but it is hardly a proven 
&gt; approach for defining a language standard, &gt; especially with a C based implementation.

The reference implementation is not in C. It's in SML. As a footnote the author writes:

&gt; It can be very difficult to develop tools or independent implementations if the syntax and semantics are encrypted in C. 

I suspect this person hasn't looked at the reference implementation.

Let me clarify my point, since either you really like cops abusing their power or English is a second language for you: cops that do a shitty job should be punished and or stripped of their badge. Cops that are corrupt should be prosecuted. Cops who are assholes for no reason should be slapped on the wrist somehow, because it helps contribute to a negative image. When the primary function of your job requires you to interact with the public, it's a good idea for the public to like you, as they will be more likely to help.

&gt;Clear Channel radio stations instructed not to play new Springsteen album. It's filled with Iraq war criticism.

Is that misleading? Let's look at the article:

&gt;Clear Channel has sent an edict to its classic rock stations not to play tracks from ""Magic.""

According to the article, the first statement is true. But is it really filled with Iraq war criticism? [People who have listened to the album](http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/16587992/review/16682049/magic) seem to think so. But I don't need a rock music critic to explain music to me, I prefer to figure it out for myself and on Magic there is definitely some heavy social and political commentary going on as there is on all Springsteen albums.

I've always believed that art is open to interpretation and can mean many things to many different people, but if you want to discern the artists true intent a good clue would be the artists public statements. I think the Boss's public statements speak for themselves as per what his motivation was behind some of the songs on Magic.

It is perfectly possible to program in the final coalgebra model in a functional program but it's not the usual idiom (although I think it would be wise to explore it further). Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that in functional programming we're used to programming with folds, rather than unfolds. Folds are modeled using initial algebra, hence the parallel. 

While initial algebra model sum types, final coalgebras model product types, which I sometimes like to think of as functional objects. Instead of pattern matching on the data as in ""functional programming"" you project and element which corresponds in my mind to sending a message in the ""Tell, don't ask"" world.

"politics","t5_2cneq","You're projecting quite a bit: ""Stop blaming heterosexuals for the choices gay adults make.""  It appears to be the other way around:  you're blaming gays for a host of ills.

Regarding the marriage issue, I live in Massachusetts and, *surprise*, the world hasn't ended here because of gay marriage.  Fewer and fewer people care about the issue because it doesn't affect us much.  Gay marriage is only a wedge issue because people like you make it one.

As you say, marriage has little to do with monogamy, for both sexual orientations.  But, regardless of what you believe about religious implication of the label ""marriage"" (an institution which has changed vastly over the centuries), there are core legal rights that gay couples are entitled to, among them being tax-free inheritance and hospital visitation.  These rights (and the responsibilities that they entail) create the social context for stable relationships.  I personally don't care if you call it ""marriage"" or ""civil union"", but I do care about people being able to see their life-partner in the hospital or not lose their housing because of a tax issue.

As for this comment:  ""people will get sick of a few percent of the population insisting everyone pretend men and women aren't meaningfully different and pretending that wanting sodomy is the same thing as being black or white""  WTF?  Why do you care how other people structure their lives?  *It doesn't affect you*  And, given that homosexuality is in part biologically determined and in any case an unmodifiable trait for most gay people, heterosexism really is similar to racism.","1193923144"

Not the rest of the planet; just the US, its allies, and the countries it has bullied into silence. Most of the world thinks Iran is being treated unfairly.

&gt;Your arrogance is stunning.

So far, my track record on calling international events has been considerably better than the authorities you're asking me to trust, so I'm going to go ahead and continue trusting my own judgment over that of interested parties with pre-existing agendas and appallingly bad track records. 

The evidence tells me the US/EU3 refused to negotiate fairly with Iran, and then pressured the IAEA into referring Iran to the Security Council under false pretenses so it could have an easier time marginalizing Iran and softening the world for a planned military strike. You have produced absolutely nothing over this entire exchange to suggest otherwise, preferring to cling to a dogmatic, authoritarian analysis of the events. That's your prerogative, and I suppose it may help you with your legal clients, but it does not help us get to the heart of what's going on between Iran, the IAEA, the US/EU-3, and the rest of the world.

I'm interested in what actually happened, in what the evidence tells us about whether a given decision was fair or lawful, in what dynamics are actually driving these events as opposed to what interested parties want us to believe, and in what is the best way to move forward.

You're welcome to call that ""arrogance"" if it makes you feel better, but ask yourself: did you support the invasion of Iraq? Did you believe the US government's arguments? Did you trust its claims? Did you believe Iraq was hiding prohibited weapons, that it couldn't be trusted, that it wasn't cooperating with the weapons inspectors and the IAEA?","1193923626"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt;The port 1024 limit forces you to run all network daemons with
superuser privileges, which might open security holes. Without the port 1024 limit, most network daemons (except sshd), could be run without superuser privileges. Some daemons try to remedy this potential security hole by handling each connection with an unprivileged process/thread, but you still need the privileged listener process.


Actually, no. You need root to open a socket on a port below 1024 - this is to prevent denial-of-service on well-known-ports (any random user could pretend to be sshd, for example). But you can drop privileges *immediately* afterwards, and before actually listen()ing to the network.

Here is the work around:

Run your server on a non-privileged port, say 8080 for example.

Now use iptabels as root to forward to it.

**iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080**

This will forward ALL incomming connections to port 80, on to your server listening on port 8080.

I'm not sure if it slows things down at all, I doubt it does significantly if at all.

There should be some way to grant users privileges to listen on ports &lt; 1024, without giving them access to everything else as well.

The workaround works well though :)

By a similar argument,

* you shouldn't trust any files owned by root because any untrusted user could use an exploit to edit them.

Slichter says what happens now is independent promoters pay stations huge sums of money to be their sole programming advisor. Those promoters then charge record companies enormous amounts to get their songs added to a station's playlist. Slichter says as a result, the cost of getting radio airplay has become ridiculous.

""To get to launch a song on alternative radio, I was told it cost at least $200,000. To get 'Closing Time' on the radio they spent something like $700,000,"" he says.

I didn't make an 'analogy'.  You said it's like the IAEA is the police, it isn't.  Don't be so childish as to try and strawman my previous arguments - you're not a woman are you? !!!

&gt; Most of the world thinks Iran is being treated unfairly

This is untrue.  There was a vote in the UN, 23-3.  Sorry.

(oh and if you're going to claim that the US has some sort of bully power in the UN again, i'll just refer you to the Iraq debacle.  You can't have your cake and eat it too kid)

&gt;You have produced absolutely nothing over this entire exchange to suggest otherwise, preferring to cling to a dogmatic, authoritarian analysis of the events

What you still don't understand is that i'm not arguing *how we got here* i'm trying to get you to admit fact.  Iran is in violation of the NPT!

&gt;I'm interested in what actually happened

Really?  Do you actually believe Iran isn't making a bomb?  

I think you aren't stupid enough to not realise that.  I think you want Iran to be nuclear armed, and able to stand up to Israel.  Am i wrong?

&gt;did you support the invasion of Iraq? 

Yes.  I still do.


&gt;Did you believe the US government's arguments?

No, their claims have nothing to do with my support for bringing democracy to the middle east.

&gt;Did you trust its claims? 

It's people like me (and me at one point) who get the evidence for these 'claims'.  yes i believe some, yes i know some are bullshit.

&gt;Did you believe Iraq was hiding prohibited weapons, that it couldn't be trusted, that it wasn't cooperating with the weapons inspectors and the IAEA?

This is irrelevant, we sold them the weapons which we now can't find.  But that's not the reason i support the war.

None of your attempt here to change the subject from Iran to Iraq has anything to do with admitting that Iran is in violation of established international law.

When will you admit this?

"programming","t5_2fwo","I agree with some of what this article says, but I propose a different solution.  The ideal answer (I think) is to replace this resource permission system with a more robust and fine-grained system.

For example, I would love to be able to specify that only the ""apache"" user can listen on port 80 of IP x.x.x.x.  I don't require the Apache httpd server to have root permissions then, but rather just to run as the user it would have chown'd to anyways.  This prevents a malicious local user from somehow crashing the web server and listening to port 80 themselves, while still dealing with the setuid root sercurity problem.

A simple default configuration of ports 0-1024 on any IP being root-only would maintain compatibility where people are too lazy to configure the system correctly.  Personally, I would continue to have 0-1024 be root only, but opt-in ports like 80, 25, 110 to certain daemon accounts.","1193924663"

You're feeling is that we have a moral obligation to respect the dead and their associated family members. If people don't show the proper respect than they are suppressed.

Be careful though what you wish for, once we start obligating people to follow someone else's moral codes, we start to suppress more than just speech, but also behavior.

&gt; there are right ways and wrong ways to exercise your freedom of speech

Thats why we are in the shape we are in with this nation then. Almost every situation can come up with a rational explanation. This is why we call something a ""right"", because presumably there are no cases where they can be denied.

What you're now saying is that free speech is not a right, but rather a privilege. A privilege has a right way and a wrong way to do things and shouldn't be done everywhere. For example driving a car is a privilege and it can be revoked in the same manner that we're discussing.

I suppose you can think that we should not have ironclad rights in this country, but hopefully you realize what you're giving up by doing this. So next time your privilege is revoked for speaking out, you can't claim it to magically be a right again.

His actions led to his arrest, 8 days in jail, and he still had to pay court costs over the battery charge that he stole the cop's taser. His wife was still arrested, and he was too. And in the end, the cops didn't get punished or look all that bad - even the judge reserved some sympathy for them. The guy (mostly legally) defended his home and his wife, and that is extremely commendable, but his specific actions reminded me way too much of an over-eager cop.","1193924989"

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; *Vacant Housing Units.* A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at the time of the interview, unless its occupants are only temporarily absent. In addition, a vacant unit may be one which is entirely occupied by persons who have a usual residence elsewhere. New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place. Vacant units are excluded if they are exposed to the elements, that is, if the roof, walls, windows, or doors no longer protect the interior from the elements, or if there is positive evidence (such as a sign on the house or block) that the unit is to be demolished or is condemned. Also excluded are quarters being used entirely for nonresidential purposes, such as a store or an office, or quarters used for the storage of business supplies or inventory, machinery, or agricultural products. Vacant sleeping rooms in lodging houses, transient accommodations, barracks, and other quarters not defined as housing units are not included in the statistics in this report. (See section on ""Housing Unit."")

&gt; *Units Occupied by Persons With Usual Residence Elsewhere.* A housing unit which is occupied temporarily by persons who usually live elsewhere is interviewed as a vacant unit provided that a usual place of residence is held for the household which is not offered for rent or for sale. For example, a beach cottage occupied at the time of the interview by a family which has a usual place of residence in the city is included in the count of vacant units. Their house in the city would be reported ""occupied"" and would be included in the count of occupied units since the occupants are only temporarily absent. Units occupied by persons with usual residence elsewhere (URE) are further classified as seasonal vacant or year round vacant units. Other vacant. Included in this category are year-round units which were vacant for reasons other than those mentioned above: For example, held for occupancy of a caretaker, janitor; held for settlement of an estate, or held for personal reasons of the owner.

Nope, a religion. But English has a nice term that refers to disliking people who belong to a group, whether determined by genetics or religion: racism.

Huh? What in the world are you talking about? Attacking a people is racism (unless you have a better term), but I just said that it is acceptable to criticize a practice. I don't like how Muslim countries generally treat women, that is not an attack on Muslims.

No, most feminists don't make that claim as such.  There's a lot of debate about porn, that mostly falls into three camps:

1.  Porn is inherently harmful to women, both in the methods of its production and in the effects on cultural attitudes about women and sex.

2.  Porn is not inherently harmful, but a lot of what's getting produced is problematic, and the industry is in need of reform.

To Whom It May Concern:

 

It seems increasingly more obvious, as time has move along this election season, that you people in the media are wielding undue influence on who and what the American public sees as a choice for President.  Your exclusion of candidate Mike Gravel is just the latest in a series of moves your network, and others have used to push the attention of the people toward the candidates of choice for the owners of your company.  You people should be ashamed of yourselves.  Any integrity the media might have managed to hold onto after your disgraceful performance in helping the Bush administration run this country into an unfounded war in Iraq is now lost, with your obvious bias.  Journalism has died in this country and it is you people that have killed it.  If Mike Gravel is not allowed to participate in this debate, consider your network to have lost another customer.  I will no longer watch anything sponsored by your sad excuse for an impartial television network.

Their response:

NBC has offered Sen. Gravel many opportunities to get his message across, in both interviews and debates. However, with the election season approaching and more candidates vying for an opportunity to join the debates, NBC News felt it necessary to set minimum criteria for participation in the debate -- including measuring the amount of time the candidates spent campaigning, as well as poll-standing and financial resources. These are similar to guidelines used by non-partisan organizations that manage the presidential and vice-presidential debates, and leaders and activists from both parties believe these requirements are fair. Unfortunately, Sen. Gravel did not meet these minimum requirements.
 
NBC News has a long history of editorial strength and independence and made this decision based on the abovementioned criteria.

Second, if someone is intent on committing murder (and has taken steps toward what they plan to do and not just thought about it -- thought is not a crime), you can put them in jail for it, thus preventing the action.

Third, under torture, people will tell you anything.  They will say whatever you want to hear.  It has NEVER been a proven mechanism for getting information.

I know what you're thinking: what if a man has a bomb in New York and we capture him, know he planted it, but don't know where.  We can use many, many techniques that are within the law.

Some of these people detained are probably not very strong or even guilty of anything, making them total pussies like you and me.  If this happened to you and you were threatened with this daily you'd be very likely to just end it.

Now even if they are guilty (obviously no one will know 99% of the time) I don't think it should be condoned for the simple fact that America is becoming what it fears.  Terrorists are not a huge threat to this country and torturing the few caught is not the best way to prevent any future attacks.  Nor is taking away my liquids and screening my wife and I at the airport gate after already passing through security.

Fear is what drives this administration and it's sad.  Never should America torture anyone.  Just goes hand in hand with all of the civil liberties that have been revoked due to these 'terrorists' who succeeded in one attack on American soil, due mostly to America's poor response and protection.  Simply those planes could have been stopped after they were hijacked and even before that.  The odds of that happening again are so slim and even if it does it is not worth throwing out what this country was founded on.  They have capitalized on an attack to their own people to grab as much power as they could, why people aren't angrier over that than anything they have ever dealt with is beyond me.

There is no privacy in a public venue. The protesters were on public land, so this is not an issue of public vs private. This is purely an issue of censoring content.

For example, would these protesters have been censored for waving American flags and cheering? No, it would have been a welcomed intrusion into their ""privacy"". So this means that the content had everything to do with the case.

Even the quote you gave is foreboding. It says violation of expectations. I have a lot of expectations myself and if I can get a majority of people behind me, I can imagine a lot of minority groups that will be afraid to speak out.

If you somehow believe that your dollars are not going to give you a proper ROI, you deinvest in them. If everyone does this at the same time, then a ""bank run"" occurs. It is not that you will not get the dollar amount, it is that you will get less value out of it.

&gt;No, it results in depreciation of the dollar. The lower dollar may translate into inflated prices for commodities, but that's a separate issue.

Ok, it results in depreciation, but given that  we are in a global market, and not a low price leader, inflation is most certainly the outcome.

&gt; If the dollar continues to drop what you will see is instead of buying euros with dollars, dollars will start looking to buy out american companies.

Sure, and I think it is happening already. However, I also worry that US bonds / dollars are used as a gold standard by other countries, which was not the case with the yen.

There are even some instances when the right to free speech is more important that the right to privacy in your own home, and here's an example:  the KKK has the right to march down your street screaming any old hateful thing they want, even if you can hear it in your living room.

You'd better be really certain that you want to set the precedent that 'invasion of privacy' or 'emotional distress' can be used to curtail freedom of expression.

I think its tacky and disrespectful sure, but a right of freedom can't be suspended because someone else doesn't think its the right time nor place.

&gt; How is that not obligating people to follow their moral code?

The protesters made no legal demands upon others. Obviously if the protesters used the government to do something against the family, that would have been equally wrong. They didn't though.

The family is the only one wielding the power of the government to suppress someone else.

&gt; What I am saying is that turning up at a funeral and upsetting the family when neither they nor the soldier have done anything wrong is a really crappy thing to do.

I agree it is a crappy thing to do. However its worse to have a majority opinion wield government power to suppress minority opinion.

&gt; I'd be happy with your arguments if someone actually accepted that cheering at someone's funeral deserves to be punished.

Thats what happen, they were financially punished. Even the name ""punitive damages"" means to punish.

I don't think the soldier was gay. The WSB church members call everyone gay. All soldiers are gay and they say the same thing at every soldiers funeral. 9/11 was our heavenly punishment according to them for supporting gay people.

To whom it may concern,
I was shocked and appalled to learn that Mike Gravel would not be allowed to participate in the your October 30th democratic debate.  I have heard that the decision to exclude Mike Gravel was based on these three criteria:

a) Mike Gravel has not campaigned in New Hampshire and/or Iowa at least 14 times in the past year
b) Mike Gravel is  not polling at 5% 
c) Mike Gravel has not raised $1 million

 (a) is false and criteria (b) is not being applied uniformly to all candidates.  According to a recent CNN poll, mike Gravel is tied with Joe Biden, Dennis Kucinich and Chris Todd.  Unless all three of those candidates are excluded from the debate, it is unfair to exclude Mike Gravel on those grounds.  Criteria (c) is just depressing—do you feel comfortable conceding that the election to our country’s highest office is more about money than it is about principles and doing the right thing?  Please help us at least preserve the appearance—if only for one night--that our country is not run entirely by corporate America and that real people can actually make a difference.  Reversing your decision will greatly benefit our country. 

Rob Radtke
XXX-XXX-XXXX

Their response:

NBC has offered Sen. Gravel many opportunities to get his message across, in both interviews and debates. However, with the election season approaching and more candidates vying for an opportunity to join the debates, NBC News felt it necessary to set minimum criteria for participation in the debate -- including measuring the amount of time the candidates spent campaigning, as well as poll-standing and financial resources. These are similar to guidelines used by non-partisan organizations that manage the presidential and vice-presidential debates, and leaders and activists from both parties believe these requirements are fair. Unfortunately, Sen. Gravel did not meet these minimum requirements.
NBC News has a long history of editorial strength and independence and made this decision based on the abovementioned criteria.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Here is Mike Gravel's thoughts on this (along with contact info for people to whom you can complain):

A Letter from Mike Gravel also posted on the Huffington Post 

Tuesday, October 23, 2007

Rob

In the past year, I have attended 11 national Democratic debates of which two were sponsored by corporate media giant NBC. However, last week, NBC suddenly conjured up arbitrary polling and fundraising requirements specifically designed to exclude me. None of the previous debates I attended held such requirements.

When my staff called NBC directly to find out why I was now barred from attending, Chuck Todd, NBC news' political director, told us that there were three criteria we did not meet, namely that I had not campaigned in New Hampshire and/or Iowa at least 14 times in the past year, that I was not polling at 5% and that I hadn't raised $1 million.

It is clear that NBC just wants me out of the race. This was made evident by the fact that NBC did not even inform me of its arbitrary criteria before making the decision to stifle my campaign. NBC's Todd waited until 5 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 19, to inform my staff that I was not invited to the Oct. 30 debate at Drexel University in Philadelphia.  That's a fact!

Since I announced my candidacy for the Democratic Nomination for President of the United States on April 17, 2006, I have certainly traveled to New Hampshire and Iowa at least 14 times. And, according to a recent CNN poll, I am tied with Joe Biden, Dennis Kucinich and Chris Dodd.

NBC claims I haven't raised enough money to qualify. I'm proud of the fact that I don't collect millions from special interests (or fugitives like Norman Hsu). The reason why Senator Hillary Clinton seems to have a fundraising scandal every month is because money has corrupted our democracy. By stifling my voice on the basis of fundraising dollars, NBC is reinforcing the power of money over our national political discussion and our freedom.

But why has NBC suddenly come up with ""requirements"" designed to exclude me from the debate?

NBC's decision is proof that our corporate media do not want a genuine debate over our impending war with Iran. During the last debate I was the only one to aggressively confront Senator Clinton over her vote to label the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization. Had I not brought up the subject, seasoned NBC commentator Tim Russert, the moderator of the Sept. 26 debate, would not have even asked about it.

Most Americans still don't appreciate the gravity of that vote and they don't understand that our government is intentionally raising roadblocks to diplomacy. Corporate media have once again failed to investigate how Bush and a compliant congress have set us on the warpath. Instead the media simply parrots the demonization of Iranian President Ahmadinejad and the administration's unproven accusations against Iran. NBC and the other corporate media have jumped on the war bandwagon and they are determined to shut up anyone who tries to stop it.

The fact that NBC is owned by General Electric, one of the world's leading military contractors, is frightening and certainly smacks of censorship directed at the most outspoken critic of the influence that the military-industrial complex holds over this great nation. In the past decade, GE has benefited financially from the global war on terrorism and currently holds almost $2 billion in military contracts .

So I ask that anyone, who is as concerned as I am about the power of the mainstream media and the military-industrial complex, speak out in support of my campaign today.

Rob here are 3 powerful things you can do:

1. Sign the online petition to have me included in the debate!
http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/letgravelspeakoct30

2. Contact NBC and GE and tell them they are wrong for trying to stifle my campaign! Here are there emails you can copy/paste into your ""TO:"" field of your email.

chuck.todd@nbcuni.com, viewerservices@msnbc.com, directors@corporate.ge.com, ombudsperson@corporate.ge.com, jeff.zucker@nbcuni.com, lynn.calpeter@nbcuni.com, steve.capus@nbcuni.com

3.  Email the DNC at http://www.democrats.org/page/s/contact


Finally, since the powers that be now require that I raise $1 million in order to participate in the debates, please make a donation to my campaign.

I will not stop.  In fact, this fuels my fire even more. 

Unlike my fellow candidates, I am not focused on raising millions of dollars; I am focused on fixing representative government. Help us reach that arbitrary threshold for financing and I will continue to fight for democracy and peace for all of us, not just the wealthy.

Best,
Mike

PS.
On a personal note, I want to thank the many volunteers who made my recent swing through Florida such a huge success. I will be attending the Florida Democratic Party Convention and the United For Peace And Justice (UFPJ) Southeast Regional Rally &amp; March in Orlando on Oct. 27. For more information on these events, email David Nelson-VanDette , Florida State Director.

PPS.  PHILADELPHIA FREEDOM!
If you live anywhere near Philly, we are planning an event at University of Pennsylvania on Oct. 30, the night of the debate. If you live in the area and would like to attend, please contact my office via email at phillydebate@gravel2008.us.

After reading the story, she:

* Had a bunch of luggage in her car.
* Border guard suspects she's going to try to move to Canada.  (This is actually the case, which she admitted later)
* Key point -- she lies about it, insists she's only coming for a visit.
* They refuse her entry, so she drives away, and gives all her luggage to her boyfriend to bring through.
* Comes back, and doesn't tell anyone she was refused entry previously, and is waved through.
* When her boyfriend comes through, the border guards, who are not stupid, see all her luggage again.  They detain the boyfriend.
* When she comes back to pick up said luggage and meet her boyfriend, she's arrested for misrepresenting herself to border officials.

Obviously juries might be emotionally affected by them (especially racially derogatory ones) and could award penalties/punishments from them, but I can't find anywhere in the doctrine that says it's allowable to assault someone from them just uttering these kinds of words.","1193927734"

To be clear, you put a cloth either in the mouth or over the mouth (some versions use cellophane) and pour water over a person's head. The point is not to actually drown them (contrary to his claims) because then you might accidentally kill them and get no information. Water drips into the mouth, they may even inhale some, but ""pints and pints""? No way.

The fact he doesn't know the difference between waterboarding and Chinese water torture makes me skeptical enough of his claims.","1193927740"

"reddit.com","t5_6","What this really amounts to is a work level and load balancing issue. Essentially, if someone at your office takes a week off, their work is done by them in the evenings or before and after they leave. No big deal, no extra distribution of workload. If thye take a month off, someone probably has to pick up some of hte slack or the work has to remain undone. This is the point at which the ""cost"" issue comes in. The notion on the part of employers that they must bear some cost is to a certain extent false. The company doesn't necessarily bear the cost as much the co-workers do (to be fair, in revenue generating positions like sales, the company does bear the cost). What is interesting is that the company is fully willing to lay people off and then distribute workload based on a sense of either under-utilization of the remaining resources or a sense that they can squeeze more out of less. In that situation, the company has happily re-distributed workload onto the other employees, but they are realizing a gain (in the form of reduced compensation cost). Basically, the company can get rid of people and increase everyone else's workload and that is fine but they don't want to keep someone and increase the workload because the benefits accrue to an employee not the company. A lost benefit is typically viewed as an opportunity cost in this context. Therefore, the company rationalizes that they have incurred actual cost in providing paid maternity leave when they ahven't incurred true monetary cost.","1193927795"

"politics","t5_2cneq","This statistic is misleading for two reasons.

First, you're only talking about income tax. Other federal taxes, notably the payroll tax, are regressive.

Second, you are ignoring the enormous income inequality in this country. For example, the real figure is that the top 20% of taxpayers paid 65% of total federal taxes in 2001. This may still seem extreme, but they made 52% of all income in that year. Source: effective federal tax rates, 1979-2001, published by the CBO. http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=5324&amp;type=0#table1C

These figures are still misleading, for two reasons. First, they break things down by quintile - so the top 20% is all lumped together. The top .1% probably pays a much lower tax rate, due to capital gains rates etc. Second, these figures are from 2001, before all of Bush's (highly regressive) tax cuts had taken effect.

Edit: actually, figures for the top 1% are given in the table I linked - I didn't notice.  The top 1% paid 22% of taxes in 2001, not 39%. They *made* 14% of all pre-tax income in the same year.","1193927799"

Yes, I said that, and I stand by it.  The media in America is very Jewish, I have many other posts on this subject if you'd like to link to them too.

But you won't, because then you might run into a few of them where I substantiate the claim.

&gt; But if the intent really was to destroy Germany in a literal sense...

Yes, if there was a real intent to destroy Germany, to destroy the German people, then it's a completely different ballgame!

Or are you going to sit there and posit that it is wrong for Germans to kill Jews but quite alright if it is Jews who are killing Germans?

&gt; From the start you have been waving this ""Jews call people anti-Semite to shut them up"" flag...

This is a lie.  I take issue with Israel, first and foremost.  Not because of who they are, but what they do.

I take issue with some Jews, racist Jews, who rabidly support Israel, especially those American Jews who put the welfare of Israel above that of America.  It is exactly in the same way I take issue with all racists.

If there is a problem that all Jews share it is that those amongst them who are racist never get called on it, get a free-pass for their hatred, simply on account of being Jewish.  That is wrong on so many different levels I don't know where to begin.

&gt; Don't like being called an anti-Semite then either stop disliking Jews as a group...

Of course I don't dislike Jews as a group, but then you also misunderstand my objection to the term anti-Semite.  I stated it up front in this thread, and again in this post.    Idiots like you can call me what you will, sticks and stones and all that.  What is offensive about the term is the way in which it dehumanizes an entire race of people.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;I didn't make an 'analogy'.

From your post:

&gt;Does the IAEA stating something similar - without any possible way of knowing if Iran is or isn't making weapons (remember, they aren't allowed to inspect in iran, no matter how many times you claim they are) make any sense? Surely even you can see the illogical statement here.

&gt;Police: Mr suspect, do you have the murder weapon on you?

&gt;Suspect : I most certainly do not

&gt;Police : oh, well thats good enough for me! let him go!

So how exactly is that not an analogy with the police?

&gt;This is untrue. There was a vote in the UN, 23-3. Sorry.

*Security Council*. You've been conflating the UN and the Security Council this entire discussion. You also keep ignoring the fact that the US had to impose its latest set of sanctions unilaterally because it could not get Security Council support for its latest escalation.

&gt;i'm trying to get you to admit fact. Iran is in violation of the NPT!

No. The IAEA incorrectly found Iran in violation under pressure from the US/EU-3. Law enforcement agencies sometimes fail to enforce the law properly.

&gt;I think you want Iran to be nuclear armed, and able to stand up to Israel. Am i wrong?

Yes. I favour universal disarmament, which is incidentally an objective of the NPT that the nuclear 'have' countries routinely ignore.

&gt;Yes. I still do.

Indeed. Perhaps your support for the US campaign against Iran stems from an attempt to forestall cognitive dissonance over being snookered the last time around.

&gt;No, their claims have nothing to do with my support for bringing democracy to the middle east.

Ha ha ha ha! Please, keep them coming. You're killing me!

&gt;It's people like me (and me at one point) who get the evidence for these 'claims'. yes i believe some, yes i know some are bullshit.

""Some?"" Try ""all"".

* WMD in Iraq - wrong.
* Ties to al-Qaeda - wrong.
* Seeking nuclear weapons - wrong.
* UN inspections not working - wrong.
* Greeted as liberators - wrong.
* War will pay for itself - wrong.
* Appease al-Qaeda by moving bases out of Saudi Arabia - wrong.
* Bring democracy to middle east - wrong.
* Improve relations between Israel and Palestine - wrong.
* Weaken Iran - wrong.

What's left? Even the Kurds are getting fucked over - by US ally Turkey.

Your faith-based foreign policy works about as well as faith-based science, faith-based education, and faith-based social policy. You're so certain that Iran is building a nuclear weapon that mere facts - or their absence - can't possibility shake your certainty.

We've already seen where such dogmatism leads.

&gt;This is irrelevant, we sold them the weapons which we now can't find.

No. [We did find them](http://politics.reddit.com/info/2u0mo/comments/c2u6mw), which I pointed out a month ago in another discussion we had.

&gt;None of your attempt here to change the subject from Iran to Iraq has anything to do with admitting that Iran is in violation of established international law.

I wasn't changing the subject, I was pointing out that you're asking me to trust people who have proven that they are not trustworthy. So far, my method of figuring out what's going on has been much more reliable than the method you advocate; so I'll happily stick with what works, thank you.","1193928098"

"reddit.com","t5_6","They're public figures. I could argue that even though they weren't the ones who sought public office, they do have the means to remove themselves from the White House and not live there. Now, if Jenna Bush was at college and people were protesting outside her dorm room window, different story. 

As you said, I think we're going to have to agree to disagree. I am an ardent supporter of free speech, but I believe that when it comes to peaceful protest, there must be certain limits on how they are conducted. My belief, which appears to be supported by U.S. laws, is that you cannot choose simply anyone and create an arbitrary campaign around them. To allow such a thing is to disturb the rights of ordinary people to conduct their lives unhindered. 

Once someone enters the public eye of their own accord, either via political action, celebrity, they sacrifice that right to privacy. 

Think of it this way: what if the Phelps family was protesting the marine's family at, say, a grocery store they knew they would be at? And later at the mother's place of work? And later at their home? I'm not sure how you can argue that this type of ""freedom of assembly"" is lawful. What seems to be the fundamental disagreement here is that some people commenting here seem okay with infringement upon a person's private life at any cost to that person so long as free speech is not hindered. While others, like myself, believe that while free speech is broad, and should rarely and barely be hindered, it cannot give someone the right to impinge on another citizen's privacy or dignity without justifiable cause (i.e.- celebrity, political action, etc.).","1193928314"

The fact of the matter is, you can tailor criteria to exclude any candidate you wish.  The mere fact that you've found some combination of attributes unique to a candidate doesn't mean that that is the real reason you seek to exclude him.

But more importantly, look at when NBC announced these criteria: right before the debate.

From [The Pew Research Center study](http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=276):
&gt; A new study of the issue finds that cell-only Americans – an estimated 7%-9% of the general public – are significantly different in many ways from those reachable on a landline. [...] Yet despite these differences, the absence of this group from traditional telephone surveys has only a minimal impact on the results. Specifically, the study shows that including cell-only respondents with those interviewed from a standard landline sample, and weighting the resulting combined sample to the full U.S. public demographically, changes the overall results of the poll by no more than one percentage point on any of nine key political questions included in the study.

Longer answer:
Multiuser hosts still exist, no matter what you think. And yes, they are very common. If the port restriction was lifted a DoS attack against, say, a webserver (in the daemon sense) would turn into an impersonation vulnerability for a local attacker (kill real daemon, take its place, plofit). In short, if the restriction were to be lifted it would turn into one of the biggest class of security holes in unix systems.

Imagine a webhosting company that allows shell access. Hell, any hosting provider that allows php, cgi or similar, so let's just say *any* webhosting provider. Imagine they do an apache restart. Now all of a sudden, you have a race condition where any of their customer can take over every domain hosted there.

And wrt client-side authorization based on source port, yeah... the 80s called, they want their argument back.

"reddit.com","t5_6","This type of videos is unfair and misleading.  It's a tear jerker and they don't  show what the US's enemies are doing to the US soldiers.  The question is not torture is inhumane.  It is not.  The question is if the US wants to forgo the moral high ground by using such techniques as its enemies are surely using.

Personally, I feel that when you're at war, all options must be all the table, because at war you kill or will be killed.  In such a situation, the moral high ground is not a top-most priority.  This is not to say that torture is 100% effective, but there are times it maybe effective. Especially, when a situation is serious enough, all options must be open.  The fact that all options are open all by itself means something to a captured prisoner.  On the other hand, if he knows that his enemy is not allowed to do certain things, he will have a different attitude and strategy of dealing with them.

As Dershowitz put it rightly, it's about responsibility and accountability.  If the President gets its country into a war, he must be accountable.  If the President thinks that torture is necessary, he must be accountable for that technique when a situation calls for it.  He can't let his scapegoats take the hit, when the shit hits the fan.","1193929444"

The hollywood mentality suggests that you should shoot the bad guy in the hand so he can drop his weapon.  But those who own weapons understand that when you should a bad guy, you shoot to kill.

It is not about inhumanity.  Shooting someone is not humane.  The question is when should you shoot someone.  Responsible people who own firearms understand that you won't aim a gun at someone unless you shoot that person.  You won't shoot someone unless you decide to kill that person.  And you don't kill someone unless your life itself is in danger.

Complete misinterpretation of what I wrote.

I said that capital wants cheap labor. One way they get cheap labor is to get more women and minorities and nonwhite immigrants into the workforce, driving up supply and driving down wages.

To encourage women to enter the workforce, Capital developed feminism via the fakeLeft nonprofit-academia realm, all funded by grants from Capital.


Feminism is not a reaction to capitalism. Feminism was created by Capital, just as big fat domestic cattle were not a reaction to agriculturalized homo sapiens cultures, but instead these large domestic cattler were created by agriculturalized homo sapiens cultures.



If a painter needs to make some $$ in order to eat, and so therefore paints a painting, is the painting a reaction to the painter applying paint with brushes onto a canvas, or is the painting a creation of, a product of, the painter's desires and skills and energy? 

Feminism and multiculturalism and political correctness are all a *product* of, a creation of, the desire of Capital for higher profits from lower wages from increasing the supply of labor faster than the demand for labor increases.



&gt;If you look at any meaningful neo-marxist It saddens me that you've sublimated your anger with the capitalist system to anger against the feminist movement. You're only reinforcing bad aspects of the capitalist system by doing that.

Picketing a dead baby is pretty fucking low behavior, but again, I don't have to agree with what you say to agree that you should be able to say it.

These people are typically far away and on public land. In the case of WBC they are in areas specifically set aside for protesting. You should not be able to get in trouble for picketing in a designated picketing area. Even if you got your feelings hurt. They have just as much of a right to be there as you do to have a funeral in a publicly viewable area. It's incredibly shitty that they do this, but it doesn't mean we should start to impinge rights. Slippery slope!

The best reaction to WBC I have seen is from a biker gang that follows them around and erects something (perhaps a flag) that blocks any view of them from where the funeral party will be.

One guy in a small truck stopped dead in his tracks, reversed back to the road, and took off very quickly.

As i left, the cases were still there.  I had considered going in and telling the clerks, but the cases were plainly visible and nobody did anything about it in the five minutes i watched them.

If you carry a high potential, this can limit your ability to get credit e.g. a mortgage.  The mortgage lender may view it as a risk if you have the potential to go out one day and charge many tens of thousands in credit card debt.

I'm no expert in this, by any means, but this point was explained to me when I was shopping for a mortgage.

I don't know what effect, if any, canceling cards has on one's credit scores.

Added:  Of course, one can acquire more cards in the future.  But one's ability to do so may then be limited by the presence of the mortgage.  Also, there is concern for an immediate spike in your debt.  For example, immediately after acquiring the mortgage, you go out and charge $30,000 in furnishings and other items for the new home.  If that $30,000 had been on the books at the time of your mortgage application, the lender would not have approved you for as large a mortgage.","1193931112"

I'm speaking from experience when I reiterate that most churches largely stay out of politics and devote most of their outward efforts to helping the poor.  Churches and religious organizations that begin advocating for one political party certainly should be stripped of their non-profit status, but most  churches don't do that.

Vista is not as good as XP? Take this: Microsoft sold [85 million](http://www.windowsitpro.com/Articles/ArticleID/97467/97467.html?Ad=1) copies of Windows Vista, compared to just 45 million copies of Windows XP during the same time span in its initial release.

My guess is that the European subsidies are less biased towards meat production, but it's just that: a guess.

Whatever, I expect animal flesh to be the lion's share (pun somewhat intended) of the cost of making a meal, but it only is if you get something premium.  When I was a poor student in the UK, eating vegetarian from fresh veg was by far and away the cheapest option.

Something else is up though.

&gt;In every American supermarket, labels tell shoppers where their seafood came from. But there are no such labels for meat, produce or nuts.

That's not entirely true. All the produce at Costco and the produce I purchased wholesale for my restaurant was labled on the box.

&gt;I make a point of eating local when I see signs for food that indicate it was grown in my state.

The price usualy gives that away. Your only going to get it that way when it's in season, and that's usually a brief amount of time. It stands to reason that watermelons and stone fruits in winter come from way down south, and the price reflects it.

If you limit yourself to only locally produced food, you're not going to have a lot of variety in your diet.

"politics","t5_2cneq","First, much like the media, ""common working citizens"" are not a monolithic block: Examples include HR people with humanities degrees, data-entry-clerks who often don't have any degree, people who work in restaurants, people who work in construction, people who work in sales, people who work in factories, miners, farmers, receptionists, call-center operators, and that's just differentiating people by occupation (Note, I didn't list any occupations that require a graduate degree, and few that require a college degree... we're talking ""common working citizens"" here.)  Then, of course, the pool of ""common working citizens"" can also be split by location, religion, politics, race/culture, education, wealth, gender, and family size.

If we ignore all or most of these very real and important distinctions that splinter the otherwise insanely broad category of all ""common working citizens"", then we are forced to talk in such large generalities that nothing meaningful can be said.... That this extends to nothing meaningful that can be said about differentiating corporate agendas is hardly surprising.

Now, from the point of view of *an individual* ""common working citizen"", the different agendas of these six ""media giants"" are easy to differentiate:  If our individual is conservative, then he's likely to prefer FOX over CNN.  If our individual works in shipping, he' likely to prefer the BBC with it's focus in international news.  If our individual, is religious, he's probably going to go for a faith-based news service.  If our individual has a family, he may want a more family oriented news program... perhaps ABC, owned by Disney.  See?  Once we break up the uselessly monolithic category of ""common working citizens"" we get into specifics... those specifics easily differentiate the agendas of these corporations.

Because these companies are for-profit-entities, we know they don't have *secret* agendas... their first and only agenda is to make a profit.  To that end, they make a product and market it.  For example, Disney makes a variety of 'family friendly' entertainment products... they have *hundreds of millions of dollars* riding on these products... that means their agenda will always be compatible with maintaining a market for these products.  

Corporate agendas will always be visible as long as the products of those corporations are visible.  If those products are marketed to the public, then they in turn can't be invisible.  

This leaves us with visible corporate agendas, and individuals who can differentiate them.","1193932303"

they ignored it altogether. The instructions to the jury were just to assess if the family was emotionally traumatized and nothing else (as I read it).

&gt; I think it was the privacy issue, not 'emotional distress' that won the case, but I don't know for sure.

the incident occurred on public land, so how can privacy be claim in a public location?

&gt; But I disagree with you. I (and everyone else) have a right to attend a private event without being hounded by others, 

the event was at a private church, but the protest was at a public place. None of the protesting was done in a private location.

&gt; even if they happen to be in the public domain.

So your point is that public domain isn't always public domain? Sometimes it is private.

Not only is it private, but the private owners of this public land can now wield the power of the government to suppress other citizens from their newly acquired private land (formerly public land).

The case is pure and simple discrimination. There is no rationalizing discrimination and the associated suppression of others free speech. ","1193932390"
"reddit.com","t5_6","I have to agree to a point.  Relationships are often about trust and boundaries, both pointing them out and respecting one another's.  If you want to go to strip bars find someone who does not care or wants to go with you, sorry you haven't really experienced a good strip club until you have taken a woman or many women(you are treated as a person not a wallet, the girls hang out with your group between shows with no begging for cash or drinks and sometimes they want to go home with you now that you are a person).  

I think this rule can be followed further though, I only date bisexual girls or girls that prefer women but take a liking to me.  Reason--they not only dont care if I look or go to a strip club they want to go and they bring women home(of course we have rules and boundaries but those are clearly discussed and respected).  If you want a healthy relationship learn your partners boundaries and respect them as you wish them to respect your clearly stated boundaries.  If you are unable to state and inquire about another's boundaries then you are not ready for a relationship you are ready for a soap opera that is about to commence.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Right from the beginning, and all through the course, we stress that the programmer's task is not just to write down a program, but that his main task is to give a formal proof that the program he proposes meets the equally formal functional specification. While designing proofs and programs hand in hand, the student gets ample opportunity to perfect his manipulative agility with the predicate calculus. Finally, in order to drive home the message that this introductory programming course is primarily a course in formal mathematics, we see to it that the programming language in question has not been implemented on campus so that students are protected from the temptation to test their programs. And this concludes the sketch of my proposal for an introductory programming course for freshmen.

That is even less reasonable than it was back in '88.

&gt;Wrong, i have support for the UN sanctions against Iran. Nice try putting words in my mouth, but i got you.

Nice try. You've been very clear about your support for US foreign policy as it pertains to the middle east in general, and to Iran in particular. You have accepted the American claim that Iran is trying to build a bomb, despite the complete absence of evidence to this effect.

&gt;This part i liked about your reply, it was cute to see someone resort to changing the argument into 'iraq' from 'iran is in violation of the NPT'.

Sorry, but I already addressed this fatuous claim in my previous reply.

&gt;Now i'm religious? This is what your argument has been reduced too?

I called your case agaisnt Iran faith-based because it's clearly not evidence-based; I did not call it religious. You have more faith in your dogmatic certainty about Iran's intentions than you have in the evidence.

&gt;Fully half your reply is in regards to Iraq, but you won't even admit that fact either.

I replied point-by-point to your own statements.

&gt;We are discussing whether or not you will admit Iran is in violation of established international law, you did finally in this last response.

No. I maintain that the IAEA decision referring Iran to the Security Council is not lawful in terms of the NPT.

&gt;The real question you should ask yourself now, is why you are so pro Iran? Is it because you are pro Iran, or just anti 'west'.

Take Leviticus 18:22, for example, where it speaks to the men of Israel: ""You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination."" Also, Romans 1:27 describes homosexuality in this way: ""The men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error."" [Edit: These are quotations from the RVS, by the way.] Any church calling homosexuality ""natural"" or same-sex marriage a ""union blessed by [the God of the Bible]"" either doesn't read those parts of the Bible very often or chooses not to heed them.

This doesn't excuse the shameful acts of the WBC, however, as was my original point. I certainly am not defending them.

People want their viewpoint to be the law of the land and to hell with what anyone else thinks. If a few rights get trampled in the process, who cares, as long as it doesn't hurt me personally.

So the election process is a shame now, but why should people care? If they have their television and their fast food, let everyone else worry about themselves. Why should they care about protesters getting beaten up by police, after all it wasn't them getting beaten.

that aside, your attack on buffet doesn't even relate to his point.  he's saying that he has _higher_ income, but pays a _lower_ tax rate.  and he even says he's not taking full advantage of tax loopholes to do it!  this is what's known as a regressive tax, and it's beyond defense... which is why you change the subject.

the sad thing is that this is only the tip of the iceberg.  does anyone realize that one of the first things that bush did when he got into office is to phase out inheritance tax?  in 2011 it will drop to 0%.  does anyone want to speculate how much wealth will be transferred in that one year?  the rich win again, and you ""conservatives"" keep arguing on their behalf.  suckers.","1193933387"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;You have accepted the American claim that Iran is trying to build a bomb, 

Wrong.  I've deduced for myself that when a country hides their nuke program for 2 decades and it is uncovered *under mountains*, then kicks inspectors out... that something is going on.  You seem happy in lala land where no evil people exist.  I wish i was that ignorant.

&gt;You have more faith in your dogmatic certainty about Iran's intentions than you have in the evidence.

This is the only thing you've written i agree with.  My opinion is not based in fact.  However, remember that since the IAEA is not allowed to visit these sites, you have no evidence they are *not* building a bomb.  (i realise there is a double double there, but you get my point i'm sure)

&gt;No. I maintain that the IAEA decision referring Iran to the Security Council is not lawful in terms of the NPT.

This is a simple one, it's written in article 3 of the NPT that the IAEA gets to decide.  Thus it is lawful with regards to the NPT, since the NPT decides who gets to enforce 'accordance' and that is the IAEA.  That you can't see that is either a lie, or a gross failure on your part in comprehension.

&gt; I'm pro rule of law

Article 3.  Read it again.

Then why can't iran let the IAEA inspectors in?

thats clearly an act of vandalism and not a lawful use of public land, even assuming the tomatoes were thrown not at a private building, but a public one.

Their privacy was never violated. What are you suggesting that privacy be defined as, some form of worldwide ""off-limits"" status on certain subjects?

You're suggesting that a flag hung upside down to protest the war is violating all the passer-bys right to privacy. This essentially invalidates all forms of protest.

So I'm interested in hearing your viewpoint about the recent case where a family was harassed for hanging a flag upside down at their house. It offended several people as to not be showing proper respect to the flag and lead to complains and government intervention.

Considering that you just said that location is irrelevant in terms of offending others with your free speech, how do you feel about that case?

Wrong. The IAEA had full unrestricted access to Iran for over 20 months, and Iran only scaled back to safeguards access after the IAEA failed to guarantee its rights under the NPT. Since then, inspectors have still had access to the country, and in September, Iran and the IAEA signed a new work plan to resolve the last outstanding issues from the previous period of more intensive inspections.

&gt;This is a simple one, it's written in article 3 of the NPT that the IAEA gets to decide.

&gt;On the subject of people noticing and reporting suspicious actions, I have been espousing two views that some find contradictory. One, we are all safer if police, guards, security screeners, and the like ignore traditional profiling and instead pay attention to people acting hinky: not right. And two, if we encourage people to contact the authorities every time they see something suspicious, we're going to waste our time chasing false alarms: foreigners whose customs are different, people who are disliked by someone, and so on.

&gt;The key difference is expertise. People trained to be alert for something hinky will do much better than any profiler, but people who have no idea what to look for will do no better than random.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Couldn't the heightened sense of fear from citizens be of their own doing and not a bi-product of the government ""scaring"" everybody?

Some of it doubtless is.

However, government officials have a long history of using alarmist rhetoric to score political points and convince the voters to give them what they want, or, in some cases, just justify their own existence.

&gt; If you do ask people to report things you will certainly get the paranoid segment of the population looking for something to report around every corner.

Yes. This means you need to account for the possibility, and build mechanisms into the system that don't just escalate responses higher and higher out of natural ass-covering behavior. Having a TSA officer's first thought be, ""Well, it's my ass if that guy people are complaining about takes down the plane,"" is not healthy.

It's fractal, replicating itself on all levels of the War on Terror. If some dude gets busted trying to smuggle an explosive jelly donut onto a airplane, jelly donuts have to be banned no matter how fucking stupid the original plan was, because the cost of banning donuts to the person making the decision is virtually nil, and is easily outweighed by even the miniscule chance that someone would try the same dumbass trick again and miraculously get away with it. Add to that a desire to ""do something"" and you end up with a system that is fucked top to bottom.","1193934526"

Vista, for it's many flaws, does manage to bring better security, better stability (in my experience), and some non-trivial UI improvements to the table. It's a far cry from perfect, but I don't know how anyone can compare it to XP and conclude the latter is better.

Most of my complaints are complaints that carried over from XP, and most of it relates to misbehaving third party software (or rather, what third party software is allowed to do to the system - like insert itself into the startup without explicit permission, for example), and the inability to completely do away with IE and WMP.

I wouldn't run it on an older computer and I wouldn't say there's enough there to justify  upgrading from XP - but it runs fine on the computer I got that had it pre-installed, and I've never had any desire to go back.

Remember that the people who make more money are paying more tax (in some cases MUCH more), even though they're paying the same percentage.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;Where are the dumps happening? Do you know of any, or are you just guessing, like I think you are? 

There's no dumping yet, but countries are shifting their reserves - see:
http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/05/14/bloomberg/bxecon.php
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2007/NUM0912A.htm
http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/11/27/dollar_ed3__4.php
And more articles are out there - Like I said, nobody's dumping, but the fact that people are starting to reassess whether to keep dollar reserves and the fact that there's a viable alternative to the dollar as a reserve currency means we need to reconsider how we handle our currency. 

&gt;Where is the magical line where the entire world at once determines that the dollar is no longer worth anything and will dump their assets? 

I don't know, you don't know, nobody knows - but that line does exist. If the dollar keeps losing value, people will hold less. I'm not saying it's happening quickly enough right now to be concerning, but the dollar is losing value, and thus attractiveness as an investment.

&gt;Then, who will buy these dumped assets once they are shoved into the open market? It takes two to tango.

There will still be people who think it's worth enough to pay for, or who think the price is low enough they can still buy. The problem is, that raises the effective interest rate on those bonds or holdings, so when we borrow money next time, we've got to offer much higher rates of return to compensate for the risk premium.

&gt; Furthermore, if you dump one asset class to buy another, you will be shooting yourself in the foot twice - once by dumping your asset and depressing its value, and then twice by buying the appreciating asset, either straight up or through an intermediary, which just increases the spread.

You're absolutely right. You're also shooting yourself in the foot by holding onto a depreciating asset and ignoring the appreciating asset. In fact, I'd suggest that unless you really think the depreciating asset's underlying value is strong enough that in the long run you're going to compensate for both the current losses of the depreciating asset AND the missed growth of the appreciating asset, holding a depreciating asset in favor of an appreciating asset is a pretty poor investment strategy.

&gt;why would anyone who's holding Euros swap for dollars in a declining dollar market??

Either they're getting a rate that's better than the existing exchange rate (a realistic assumption - currency trading on failing currencies usually has an official rate and an unofficial rate) or because they believe we're going to get our act together at some point - a long-run strategy. Really, though, it's not hard to get someone to buy an asset - just give them a low enough price on it and they'll buy. 

Seriously, I'm not a doomsayer on the dollar. I think fundamentally this country still has a strong economy, but from Bretton Woods on, the dollar's been the only currency consistently worth a damn, which means it's been the only applicable reserve currency. That's not the case anymore - the Euro's gained a lot of value and a lot of clout, and it looks to be a fairly stable currency with a wide monetary base. Countries are already starting to use it as a reserve, and not just in the EU. That means we can't just rely on the level of demand for the dollar that we've always had - Now, we've got Competition, which is great for the buyers and sucks for us. Again, I'm not predicting doom, but we've got to shift our policies and stop acting like we're the only currency worth a damn out there. ","1193935090"

I remember when you had to look for ""pc"" or ""mac"" in fine print on the packaging.  It's in big letters ""Games for Windows"" on some packages now already.  All they have to do is put similarly-branded linux software in its own section (and while limited, it certainly exists) on the shelves for the new system.  Since most major linux commercial software has Windows ports, they can simply sell those as ""for anyone"" which would really push more development companies to make their software that way.

In the end, Walmart would use a tiny bit of their massive per-store excess space on stuff that's going to sell and probably maximize profit.","1193935266"

That's not a very good analogy, I'm afraid.  The difference is that the torturer isn't doing it because he might be tortured by the captive if he isn't fast enough.

Using torture and justifying it because we're ""in a war"" (hint: we never declared war.  This isn't a war at all.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The point is illustrated by the [Bill Cosby example](http://reddit.com/info/5z0ra/comments/).  Bill Cosby can criticize blacks for the non-genetic beliefs and values that they share, if he believes there is something wrong with those beliefs/values.  This is done for every group, but when one does so with regards to the Jewish beliefs and values, it is twisted into a criticism of their race (hence the term anti-semitism) and is therefore off-limits.  Bill Cosby didn't say being black is bad (racism), but that certain beliefs/values in the black community (ie. their belief systems) need to change.  He says, ""[Black Americans] putting their clothes on backward: Isn’t that a sign of something gone wrong?"" When people in the MSM criticize Islam, they are saying certain beliefs/values need to change -- not criticizing their race.

So you are wrong on racism: criticizing Islam is not considered racism, if anyone says so they are analogizing from the argument concerning Jews.  In the case of Judaism the two are conflated to provide endless justification for Jewish beliefs/values and anyone who criticizes those beliefs/values is accused of criticizing the race (hence, ""anti-semitism"").  This is manipulative.  Though it is regrettable the previous poster used such terms, his criticism, which in this context was clearly directed at the Jewish beliefs/values (AIPAC support for right-wing Israeli policies), there is an eagerness to interpret his criticism as a criticism of the Jewish race, because then his ideas can be discredited.  This is accomplished because there is no linguistic differentiation between the Jewish race and Jewish beliefs/values.  [In fact, some call a Jew who does not support Israel ""self-hating""; their racial identity is accused of being contradicted](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xBu3RpwIR0).

But it should be possible to criticize Jewish beliefs/values without being accused of criticizing the Jewish race, for example, that Judaism beliefs/values promote X, Y, and Z.  Anyone of any race can choose to adopt X, Y, and Z.

Furthermore, not only is criticizing Israel not anti-semitic, but associating certain Jewish beliefs/values with Jewish people is not racist, for example saying ""People who espouse Jewish beliefs/values need to stop supporting AIPAC,"" or conversely and more controversially, ""Israeli aggression is largely justified by Jewish beliefs/values, which need to change"".  In short, not all JUDAISM-BELIEVING PEOPLE support such policies but associating such policies with JUDAISM-BELIEVING PEOPLE ought not to be considered anti-semitic, because JUDAISM-BELIEVING PEOPLE predominantly support those policies and those policies are predominantly supported by JUDAISM-BELIEVING PEOPLE.  When people on reddit say ""Jew"" with reference to AIPAC, they are referring to the belief-system, because they mean ""Jew"" only with respect to policies supported by Jewish people.

The way the argument is set up now, to say that Judaism-believing people need to stop supporting certain ideas is twisted into racism because Judaism-believing people (beliefs/values) = Jew (beliefs/values) = Jew (race).  Critics of Israel don't want to eliminate the Jewish race but those beliefs/values, so don't exaggerate things and make it look like they do.  And please exaggerate again and quote some extremist because there are extremists who would like Arabs wiped off the map, too.","1193936060"

Fnord is the typographic representation of disinformation or irrelevant information intending to misdirect, with the implication of a conspiracy.

In these novels, the interjection ""fnord"" is given hypnotic power over the unenlightened. Under the Illuminati program, children, while still in grade school, are taught to be unable to consciously see the word ""fnord"". For the rest of their lives, every appearance of the word subconsciously generates a feeling of uneasiness and confusion, and prevents rational consideration of the subject.

In the Shea/Wilson construct, fnords are scattered liberally in the text of newspapers and magazines, causing fear and anxiety in those following current events. However, there are no fnords in the advertisements, encouraging a consumerist society. It is implied in the books that fnord is not the actual word used for this task, but merely a substitute, since most readers would be unable to see the actual word.","1193936095"

If it is not traveling at take off speed relative to the ground/air then WHAT is it traveling at take off speed relative too?

This has been going around the internet for a while now.  The article explicitly states the   AIRCRAFT is traveling at take off speed. It WILL take off.  Of course for the aircraft to be traveling at take off speed, this would also mean that the conveyor belt would have to be quite long, as long as the runway.

If we're talking about the WHEELS of the aircraft traveling at the same speed they travel when the aircraft takes off then of course it will not take off.  This is like jacking the aircraft off the ground and hooking up a drill to the wheels and spinning them.  You can spin them at 1000% the speed of take off, but if the aircraft is stationary it will not take off.

Regardless of what your feelings are about Iraq (I am completely against this military incursion) people are fucking stupid, and we seem to have a predominance of them in America (Bush elected twice?).

These people went to the funeral of a soldier and had signs that said ""god hates fags"" and who knows what else. I really don't know and I don't care, because their past activity is absolutely despicable.

While I sincerely feel that people have a right to free speech and can live how they want, you have to draw the fucking line somewhere, or WE WILL have people fucking chickens (I'm honestly worried about chickens) and yelling ""fuck you you fucking cunt"" in front of churches. Don't tell me it won't happen, it will.

It is a complex issue. It is sad that we have to get courts involved when people cannot hold their opinions to their selves, when they know that their actions infringe on someones right to privacy, and to be perfectly honest, human fucking decency.

The WBC is a hate group. End of story. And it looks like they are a cult too. Anarchy is not the American norm. We do have rules. Some follow those rules, some don't. The WBC, while they have every right to believe and say whatever the hell they want, do not have a right to dig into other's rights.

What they did, at the funeral, is not free speech. It is harassment. Even on public property, harassment is illegal. 

My opinion, and I could be wrong, because I am human, is ""FUCK THEM!"" If they showed up at the funeral of my son, who may have been in the military, someone (probably many) would be dead and I would gladly take the prison sentence. I am not talking out of my ass. I have a combat tour, spent 8 years in the military, and thoroughly believe in free speech. But there is a line where people start getting well beyond the realm of free speech and start getting to the realm of pushing people beyond their capacity. That, no where, is included in the Constitution. People can say what they want! But it may have consequences. All speech is not protected, and no where in the Constitution does it say ""you can be a fucking prick in the public forum, and God help us, you are free from lawsuits, even though you have passed all bounds of human decency and quite frankly, are a...prick.""

To require everyone to do so would effectively stop law enforcement. Additionally, to expect those who might have to assist to develop a legal basis for their actions and to hold them both criminally and civilly liable for the future rulings on the areas of that law which are being debated will effectively prevent any cooperation by individuals, groups, businesses and organizations.

1. The executive branch neither makes nor interperets laws. Those powers are delegated to the legislative and judicial branches respectively.

2. The real problem with immunity in this case, is that it may be granted before a public hearing of the facts. Whether telecoms eventually are held liable for their actions or not is another question. However, they should not be granted immunity for what they may or may have not done without public accounting of what those actions may or may not have been. Immunity is one thing, this kind of secrecy is another, and it leads us down the road back to the red scare and other times where our government has spyed on its citizens for political purposes.

So, rollingdivision, you are really telling Studs Terkel, a 90 year old victim of the red scare, and a lifelong fighter for privacy and citizen's rights, that these companies should get immunity?

I had to configure my IP address manually and disable the 'DHCP Client' service entirely before this behavior stopped. Only problem is, Vista thinks it's amusing to restart the process every few days. Microsoft did release a patch to ""resolve network issues"", and what did that patch do? It increased the interval from 15 seconds to 2 minutes. -_-;

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;If you're going to accuse me of being disingenuous, then you'll have to accept that label on yourself as well for attempting to misconstrue the results of this case. ...[T]he issue is not about ""silencing"" anyone. It's a civil case where the plaintiffs were arguing that the defendants violated their privacy and conspired to create emotional distress. The government is not ""silencing"" them, so there is no freedom of expression being infringed.

Well, I wasn't accusing you of lying, I was just suggesting that by presenting your case as if there were only two choices that you were creating the false impression that there were no other options.  I wasn't suggesting that you didn't believe that or that you were deliberately hiding the other options.  I was just saying there ARE other choices.

And while you may disagree with my view of this case, I'm not misconstruing or lying about it.  

In my opinion, some clever lawyers have created an end run around the first amendment and charged the WBC with a dubious civil charge that they were probably able to convince a jury to agree with - not because that actual crime had been committed, but because the jury found their speech so objectionable.

You may not agree with me on that, but I'm not lying about my view.  That is what I believe.

I personally hope, and believe that this will be overturned by a judge that will see through the emotion of this case and preserve the intention of the first amendment.

I find the WBC appalling.  I do not agree with anything they say or do.  But I find free speech to be such an important right that I am willing to tolerate a great deal of uncomfortable speech in order to protect everyone's freedom of expression.

&gt;One cannot argue that someone of another faith speaking their mind about their religion was an attempt to create emotional distress. A reasonable person could see that was not the intention. But in this case, the defendants ""conspired"" to infringe the privacy of the plaintiffs. They did this by protesting at the funeral of the soldier, and argued funerals are a public event.

From my understanding of the article, the protest was done on public property at a distance of 1,000 feet or something to that effect.  That seems public to me.

Please don't misunderstand me.  My wife is an Air Force veteran.  If she passed away and these idiots protested at her funeral, I would be incensed.  But in the end, I believe that free speech is so important that we have to tolerate it even when it is offensive.

And there IS a reasonable expectation of privacy that individuals have.  But if my understanding is correct and these people were nearly a QUARTER OF A MILE away - then that if clearly a reasonable distance away.

This is a SCARY ruling folks.  It hugely restricts free speech.  I pray it is overturned.

&gt;You should also be careful to remember that this is not ""some judge"" making an arbitrary decision. Indeed, this was a jury of 12 people. Of course, that doesn't mean the verdict was necessarily right, but it does mean that the Phelps family were at least heard by their peers.

Have you ever been on trial or seen a trial in its entirety?  If not, you would be very amazed to see how much power the judge has in a trial.  He chooses what evidence is allowed, he chooses how to instruct the jurors and he chooses which statements to allow the jury to consider.  A judge's attitude is very much a HUGE factor in what verdict is returned.  It is a common misunderstanding of most people to think, ""A jury of 12 people decides your fate.""  That just isn't so.  The judge controls so much of what the jury is exposed to that your fate is very much influenced by that judge, regardless of who is on the jury.

&gt; The case is NOT about what the Phelps family said. It's about the Phelps family taking prolonged, concerted action to disrupt this family's rights of privacy. Regardless of how YOU would have ruled, ordinary citizens DO have a right to a certain level of privacy. The jury found that the Phelps violated that privacy not because of what they said, but because of what they did.

I'm sorry but I disagree.  I think that the lawyers created a way for the jury to express their displeasure with what the Phelps said, while finding a loosely related charge that they could hang their displeasure on and find them guilty.

We've lost so much with this ruling, and I find it surprising that more people only see the hatred coming from the WBC and want to shut it down, but don't see what they are giving up to silence these people.

To stick with the student loans for a second: I'm not sure that the government subsidy really helps.

As a result, you're encouraged to pursue skills that are in demand while at school.

The government subsidy has the reverse effect: it makes it easier to pursue career paths that might not make you enough money to justify an unsubsidized loan.

They increase the incidence of breast and skin cancer quite dramatically.  These negative effects are increased when birth control is started during early to mid puberty.  There are also serious disruptions to the normal puberty process when birth control is being taken by girls.

Another concern is that there are medical procedures that can be deadly if the doctor is unaware that the girl is on birth control.  So, communication between the school and the student's doctor is paramount but is not being properly addressed.

Lastly, since he is involved in studying this, he is aware that the vast majority of these pills will be dispensed by nurses (at best) and more often by school bureaucrats.  The problem with this (aside from the obvious) is that the pharmacuetical companies have a history of turning these bureaucrats into simple drug pushers, which was extremely evident with regards to Ritalin, Adderall, etc. ","1193937955"

"politics","t5_2cneq","There are myriad problems with school choice that tend to be ignored, but first...

Statement: ""If Parents Pick Schools their Kids Attend, They Are Less Prone to Blame Teachers when Children Underperform, &amp; Far More to Prod Kids to Take Responsibility"" 

Notice that it does not say this is the truth - that is, that the children are responsible, not the teachers. Parents place the blame on themselves or their children when often, in reality, none of the school choices were any good. 

Problems with school choice:

1. Geography. Simply put, how do you ship every kid in every neighborhood to whatever school they want. Or do poor kids just get stuck with the neighborhood schools while rich kids can have their parents cart them off to the better ones?

2. Opposite Incentives. The market does not encourage teachers to try harder, it encourages teachers to tell their students ""if you don't like it here, then just go somewhere else"". The teachers know that X number of students need to be taught, and that if their school goes under because of students choosing others, another will pop up to meet the existing need.

3. Less Oversight. Parents vote in elections for school board members who do not represent the actual school their child attends. Many parents have kids in multiple school districts, making it impossible to divide votes. The ""compromise"" has been to run county-wide, at-large elections, which tend to grossly impede the ability of candidates who represent minority interests to get elected (even though their minority may make up the vast majority of a handful of schools in the area). 

4. Continuity. Just a nightmare for schools, teachers, counselors, etc. to shift around - trying to determine whether or not a student was a behavior problem at the previous school, what his/her grades were, etc. 

IMHO, I think the better solution includes...

1. Creation of more ""charter schools"" which are not geographically defined, but must provide county-wide transportation.

2. Students can choose between their geographically assigned school or charter schools.","1193938213"

The airplane won’t go that fast if you start pulling those high G maneuvers at those bank angles. … To expect this alleged airplane to run these maneuvers with a total amateur at the controls is simply ludicrous... 

It’s roughly a 100 ton airplane.  And an airplane that weighs 100 tons all assembled is still going to have 100 tons of disassembled trash and parts after it hits a building.  There was no wreckage from a 757 at the Pentagon. … The vehicle that hit the Pentagon was not Flight 77.  We think, as you may have heard before, it was a cruise missile.""","1193938397"

A few quick tips:
 -A humidifier with your CPAP helps *tremendously*. 
 -Flonase if your nasal passages swell from the air blown over them.
 -A t-shirt with tennis balls stuffed in a sock and pinned to the back will get you to sleep on your side more often -- it may help.  Try alternating using it and not using it, though. There is a fine balance between REM sleep and restful sleep that got screwed up by using the tennis ball/T-shirt trick too often.

But, on the opposite side of the coin... where do you draw the line from interrogation to interrogation with torture?  Can you keep him strapped to a chair and ask him questions for 24+ hours straight?  There is no pain, only discomfort?  When there is pain then it is torture (that's my definition).

"reddit.com","t5_6","Exactly.  They seek media attention with their unbiblical stances and you hear about them instead of those churches, who I maintain are the majority, that instead focus on social welfare issues.  Most churches with anti-homosexual/anti-Muslim agendas do not have big social welfare programs.  

As far as taking away their tax-free status, anti-homosexual agendas aren't enough.  When they advocate for certain bills, like Measure  36 in Oregon or when they advocate for certain parties (read Republican), then take away their tax exempt status.  Recognize, though, that this is a minority of churches.  Let me give you an example of what other churches do (and are deserving of continual tax-exempt status).  Imago Dei, in Portland, started two radical programs:
Love Portland http://www.loveportland.org/ and Advent Conspiracy http://www.adventconspiracy.org/

As far as megachurches, it is true that they tend to be extremely conservative and, I wager, many violate their non-profit status by political action, but there are others that are markedly better.  For example, Saddleback Church, in Orange County.  

Note: I am not trying to advertise for these churches.  I am just pointing out counter-examples to your claims.

&gt;Well, in a timely enough manner, CNN has an article out yesterday claiming that ""Oil Shale May Finally Have its Moment."" They claim that Shell is nearing the ability to use a secret new technology to produce oil from kerogen in an economical manner. The article suggests that Shell has been working on this technology for years, and that they may be profitable at $30/barrel oil. Critically, they don't mention when that $30/barrel profitability estimate was made. Princeton Professor and peak oil scholar Kenneth Deffeyes commented in ""Beyond Oil: A View from Hubbert's Peak"" that ""When oil was $3 per barrel, many people said that if oil ever reached $8 per barrel, Green River oil shale would have its revenge on Spindletop and shut down the oil industry."" Hmmm... sounds like there may be a sliding scale at work here. Why? Well, the crux of Shell's ""secret"" technology is to insert probes into the kerogen and heat it over a long period of time, and to surround those heater probes with freezer probes that trap the liquefied kerogen within an ice shield. Sounds energy intensive, doesn't it? If it was an energy-positive process at $8 a barrel when the energy used cost $3 a barrel, and it was energy positive at $30 a barrel when the energy used cost $15 a barrel, it doesn't sound too promising to me. Surely Shell has made improvements, but even IF they get the EROEI of the process all the way up to 1:1, or even 3:1, that is nowhere near the EROEI of our current, depleting sources of energy.

There's (at least in my opinion) a huge difference between watching some topless ladies prance around in the background and having said topless ladies rub their tits and crotch all over you.

&gt;In the late 1980s, Pakistani weapons dealer A.Q. Khan offered to sell nuclear weapons technology to Iran, and Iran declined.

LOL - that's what you think?  Remember now, he's a nuclear weapons expert, selling 'enrichment' equipment to Iran and you really believe everything is on the up and up?

You can't possibly be that Naive!  If it was all legit, why wouldn't Iran just buy enrichment equipment on the open market - they have an inalienable right to create nuke power after all?  The IAEA would have helped them with technical cooperation.  It's part of the reason the IAEA exists.

Methinks you need to research exactly what is going on in Iran a bit more.  You've been eating too much of the spoon fed variety media on this.

&gt;The IAEA reported that Iran had established a large uranium enrichment facility using gas centrifuges based on the ""stolen"" URENCO designs, which had been obtained ""from a foreign intermediary in 1987."" The intermediary was not named but many diplomats and analysts pointed to Pakistan and, specifically, to Khan, who was said to have visited Iran in 1986. The Iranians turned over the names of their suppliers and the international inspectors quickly identified the Iranian gas centrifuges as Pak-1's, the model developed by Khan in the early 1980s

"science","t5_mouw","If you are thinking about attending graduate school and like research I would like to alert you to a new scholarship opportunity for Rose juniors/advanced sophomores immediately and sophomores a year from now.

 

The scholarships are designed for students interested in attending graduate school at a new graduate research school opening in the fall of 2009 in Saudi Arabia called KAUST University.  *The students selected for the scholarships will be provided with a full tuition scholarship, monthly stipend, laptop allowance and book allowance for their remaining time at Rose Hulman (starting with the winter quarter of their junior year through graduation) and then of course all school and living expenses while obtaining the advanced degree.*  A brief summary of the program can be found on the attachment.

 

Kaust is planning on an initial class of 500 students.  Rose Hulman, Harvey Mudd and Cooper Union are the only three primarily undergraduate schools selected to nominate students.  Additional students attending the University will come from major research institutions such as Stanford, MIT, Georgia Tech and schools  around the world.  We can nominate 3 students and 2 alternates for the scholarships, with the 3 slots pretty much guaranteed.

 

To learn more about this unique graduate experience the IEE representative, the group overseeing the scholarship program for KAUST will be on campus for an information session and to answer questions on Thursday November 1st at 5:30 in M137.

My point is that we should treat prisoners (whether of war, of crimes, ""enemy combatants,"" etc) with the standards we expect our soldiers to be treated.  If we water-board, than it is ok to water board us.  If we put prisoners in stress positions, sleep deprivation, etc, then it is fair game.   America is SUPPOSED to take the moral high ground and lead through example.  Right now, we are setting a bad example.  If we as a society decide that the end justifies the means or that certain SUSPECTS are given less rights, and we as a society are willing to make that sacrifice to our own rights, to deal with these nutjob groups, then we should just be upfront and honest about it - ""Hey, world!

&gt;Bullshit, they are saying they want the IAEA to be allowed to perform it's role. 

No. The US has publicly and repeatedly stated that Iran should not be allowed to enrich uranium under any circumstances (short, presumably, of regime change).

&gt;you want a nuclear armed Iran to be able to oppose Israel.

You seem to be obsessed with Israel. This is the third or fourth time you've tried to insinuate it into the discussion by pretending I believe something I do not.

By the way, since you claim to be a lawyer, here's a quote from Michael Spies of the Lawyers’ Committee on Nuclear Policy on [whether Iran is in violation of the NPT](http://www.lcnp.org/disarmament/iran/undeclared.htm):

&gt;Critical to the Iran issue, the objective of the NPT mandated safeguards, as stated by its Safeguards Agreement, is limited to “the timely detection of diversion of … nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities” to unknown use or use in weapons. For each state implementing safeguards, the culmination of IAEA safeguard and verification procedures is an annual certification that no declared nuclear material has been diverted to military use. The conclusion that no diversion has occurred certifies that the state in question is in compliance with its undertaking, under its safeguards agreement and Article III of the NPT, to not divert material to non-peaceful purposes. In the case of Iran, the IAEA was able to conclude in its November 2004 report that that *all declared nuclear materials had been accounted for and therefore none had been diverted to military purposes*. The IAEA reached this same conclusion in September 2005. [emphasis added]

It's a nuanced analysis and worth reading in full, but I'll close with the author's closing argument:

&gt;A final point is that the issue of suspension, which the West has become fixated upon as the sole point of contention, is a red herring. The IAEA view is that a pilot scale enrichment facility in Iran poses no nuclear weapons proliferation concern. Moreover, Iran remains several years away at best from being in the position to begin constructing an industrial scale enrichment capability. Therefore, the urgent rush to impose penalties on Iran for failing to re-suspend activities misses the point, which is preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. Placing such a heavy emphasis on such a non-critical point needlessly escalates the situation and *diminishes the possibility for the resumption of dialogue and a negotiated outcome*. [emphasis added]

As far as variable arguments, this is a fairly common practice. The arguments property is used in place of using parameter names, which can add to file size in conjunction with other ""longhand"" syntax. The idea is that all of these working together helps to minimize the size of your JavaScript. It is commonly used in APIs and libraries.

The var args = arguments assignment was put into place in addition to the note that you cannot execute array methods on arguments. It is good practice to set it equal to a variable at the beginning of the script for this reason, but not totally necessary.","1193941152"

* Does bash support co-processes? ksh does them very well.

* Does bash support *discipline functions* (called when a shell variable changes)?

Okay, you know how psychology is a proto-science? It isn't very scientific right? And history is not at all a science since it's completely given up on making theories to *explain* history. Well, anthropology is lower still.

Anthropology is an ANTI-science. Anthropologists have absolutely positively decided that the truth doesn't exist and that lying is good. They've decided it's better to wuv savages than to see the truth about them.

So everything an anthropologist says is a lie pretty much, or at best some kind of deception or distortion of the truth. And if an anthropologist read the last sentence, they wouldn't disagree, they'd just protest the truth doesn't exist.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Thanks for admitting to like Radiohead. Your credibility just shot through the roof. I feel like I can trust you now, and believe that what you say is true.

Such as:

&gt;You're an arrogant elitist prick who thinks his music is deeper and more intellectual than someone elses.

Wait a second - that would only be true if I were disparaging the music that someone else likes. I never mentioned anyone else's music. It is actually happening in reverse, and yet _I_ am the elitist prick?

Wrong. The elitist prick here is the person who tries to ""teach"" naive, innocent little people like me that what we like is not worthy of being liked. _Me_ get off _my_ high horse? _You_ get real.

Only on the internet can you be labeled as arrogant for _defending_ someone's art, meanwhile it is deemed perfectly humble to attack. The irony makes my head hurt. And yes, much like the hater will ""downvote"" Radiohead in life, they will downvote my comment here, regardless of its truth value, because the lines have already been drawn and we are on opposing sides, and thus are forbidden to agree.

I don't give a shit what you or anyone likes, or even whether or not you like what I like. But when you insult my intelligence by trying to convince me that what I like is bad, I'm going to say something true that you don't like to hear, similar to my last comment. 

Why don't you try to logically deduce why someone who isn't a fan would waste their time doing what **anonymous_hater** is doing here. See, because, whether or not you like their music or their style or what they stand for, Radiohead have proven and established their credibility as artists many times over.

Thus, if I hear you blanket their work by saying the ""don't know how to make good music,"" I just simply stop taking you seriously, because truthfully, YOU are the elitist prick if you can't acknowledge why people would be a fan of someone else's art regardless of whether or not you can get into it yourself.

It must be something other than the ""bad music"" that would drive someone to waste their time trying to ""expose"" that to others. 

Additionally, that paragraph that sets off your political correctness alarms doesn't apply strictly to Radiohead haters - it applies to all haters. But I doubt you care to view it like that because it would make you wrong (not that you aren't already).

What else would drive **anonymous_hater** to do this other than the typical human behavior of railing against something they don't understand? Why do people attack things in the first place? 

I bet you won't try to answer that.

""Open your eyes, people! Radiohead is a sham! They are in it for the money! It's a conspiracy! Their music isn't even _good_ and you poor sheeple are actually PAYING for it!""  Who is the arrogant, elitist prick for real?

Yawn. I digress.

Oh, and speaking of arrogant.. I am so, so very sorry for ""pissing you off."" Actually no, I'm not, but I do pity you for getting angry about something so trivial. I hope you don't have high blood pressure.","1193941498"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; As far as variable arguments, this is a fairly common practice. 

Fairly common practice yes, for space reductions I don't think so.

&gt; The arguments property is used in place of using parameter names, which can add to file size in conjunction with other ""longhand"" syntax.

Irrelevant, I do hope nobody bothers with that crap when Gzip and JS minimizers will do a lot more than that with less effort and more readability.

Pretty much *all* of the uses of `arguments` I've see were either for varargs (because that's what it is) or for optional arguments for whom `null` is a valid value (because unbound arguments are also set to `null`, it's impossible to discriminate between an optional argument not being provided and one being set to `null` without using `arguments`)

&gt; It is good practice to set it equal to a variable at the beginning of the script for this reason

Granted, there are a lot of factors that make such a move easier for Apple - but it proves it can be done.

And honestly, I think Microsoft botched it by not going that route with Vista - they should have forgone backwards compatibility (perhaps offering a virtualized XP) and focused on rebuilding the platform from the ground up. It would have guaranteed that any software that installed on Vista would actually run on Vista, and given them a chance to cure many of the legacy problems associated with the registry, security, etc.","1193941605"

Now it's different, the republicans want to subsidise big business and take away civil liberties, and the democrats want to spend money on whatever they can and take away civil liberties.

When Saudi Arabia was founded, there were two groups- a wealthy family, the Saud family, and the average people who lived in the region.  They formed an army alliance and the Sauds were the 'generals'.  Once they took over the region, the Sauds became the ruling family.

The Sauds are not 'good' Muslims- they drink and sleep around, and the average Saudi notices their excess.  There is little public sentiment for them, but due to they massive welfare in their system they can keep rebellion at bay.  It is for this reason the Saudis will not reveal exaclty how much oil they have, as it is basically a countdown to their fall.

For more on this, read ""the Fall of the House of Saud"".

I have not done ad hom, I have just described your views. Have you read a history book on this? Or are you just winging it?

&gt;We had this in Iran. Iran hosts a conference on the Holocaust wherein all sides were free to make their case.

Sheer propaganda. It is not like this is some disputed political idea, this is established history supported by overwhelming evidence. The Iranian action is exactly analogous to a creationist organization holding an origin of life conference. Holding the conference does not mean that they are fair or that there is validity to the objection. 

&gt;If it is as you say it is, then let's get together and have a serious investigation where all sides are free to present their views, without coercion or intimidation.

You mean like the David Irving trial where he was convicted of lying? Or the hundreds of history conferences that have gone on, discussing WWII, none of the having evidence that the Holocaust did not happen. Nothing that suggests that the Nazis were just reacting to some Jewish ""boycott"". Nothing to suggest that anything substantially different than 6 million Jews were deliberately killed by the Nazis.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Well, this could turn into a *huge* discussion, but I want to focus here.  You didn't say anything about the parents not wanting their kids to do it.  You stated what you think their *motives are* for not wanting abortion or contraceptives in middle school, which were wrong and frankly an attempt to demonize those you disagree with.

Those that are pro-life and those that don't want middle schoolers to have contraceptives without parental consent are not doing it because of some authoritarian subconscious reflex.  Believing they do, as you seem to, means you have no intention of taking their arguments in good faith or taking them seriously.

Believe it or not, there are good reasons for not wanting those things.

Is it possible to believe an unborn child is a human and really care about their right to life?  Maybe those that are pro-life *actually believe that* and that that right to life trumps the overwhelming amount of abortions that are for the parents' convenience?

Is it possible to believe, accurately, that the handing out of contraceptives in school condones teenage sex?  Maybe some people believe that it *is* possible to focus on not encouraging such potentially destructive behavior instead of shrugging their shoulders and saying they'll do it anyways.

Obviously, there needs to be moderation in both accounts.  You have good points also, we do not want those teenagers that make mistakes also to suffer long-term life-changing dilemmas because of one mistake, and a mother who doesn't want the child means the child doesn't get the live and care it deserves.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm Sarah's editor at Wired. Here, for your convenience, is a simple five step guide to how this bogus YouTube video was born.

1) Sarah writes an accurate article about a flurry of spam promoting Ron Paul that was traced to apparently-compromised computers overseas, and had false information in the headers.

2) Ron Paul supporters say they would never use such underhanded tactics, and attack Sarah for reporting the story.

3) A Ron Paul supporter creates an account on a public forum under Sarah's name, and uses it to post a note implying that she'd been paid by Giuliani supporters to write the ""fake"" article. He/she then seeds the forged post to a bunch of message boards.

4) A (presumably) different Ron Paul supporter makes a YouTube video about the false posting, without a moment's thought about its accurate.

5) Ron Paul supporters everywhere propagate the false allegations about Sarah. They also don't bother to check it out, presumably because of the urgent need to get the word out that Ron Paul supporters don't use underhanded tactics.

Hope this helps!

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;but when one does so with regards to the Jewish beliefs and values, it is twisted into a criticism of their race (hence the term anti-semitism) and is therefore off-limits.

Where do you see someone criticizing Jewish beliefs or values? Lying about those beliefs, that is suggestive of something else. Criticizing them as they are, fine.

&gt;Though it is regrettable the previous poster used such terms, his criticism, which in this context was clearly directed at the Jewish beliefs/values (AIPAC support for right-wing Israeli policies),

Sorry, but support for AIPAC is not a Jewish belief or value, it is something that some Jews (and some non-Jews) do and some don't. Attacking Jews because of AIPAC is bigotry and the name of that particular bigotry is anti-Semitism. The other posted did use the words he did and that is what I responded to, not some other situation.

&gt;""Israeli aggression is largely justified by Jewish beliefs/values, which need to change"". 

I see several false claims there. I deny that Israel is, in fact, the aggressor. It has been fighting off a terrorist attack for decades. It is acting pretty good for a country in that situation. The U.S. took one attack and has done as bad or worse.

Hamas may be extremist, but they are the elected representatives of the Palestinian people, not some unknown nobody. Quoting them is quite relevant since they are at war with Israel. Quoting the PLO Charter is relevant since the PLO engaged in a terrorist war against Israel for decades.

I agree that I'm struggling to explain myself, here.  I wasn't attempting to argue that the XML version is less *expressive* (which is false, as you point out) and in that vein I shouldn't have used the word ""constrained.""

What I was trying to express is that in your  article, the nature of the well-formedness errors between the two expressions is different.  The only way to correct the XML version is to close the footnote before the enclosing para ends, whereas there is more than one valid correction to the s-expression.

You conclude from your example that XML allows for more accurate reporting of well-formedness errors, because the s-expression error isn't caught until the end of the expression is read.  But that's because there isn't an *error* in the s-expression until you reach the end.

What if an XML document has a thousand paras, and the first is mistakenly left unclosed?  Is it a ""well documented problem"" with XML that the parser wouldn't detect where you intended to close the para -- instead opting to point out the location of the error?

At any rate, thanks for writing the article in the first place.  It certainly has made me think about a lot of things.

I have used Java for 8 years, worked on the J2SE and J2EE implementations for IBM, hold all those fancy prancy Sun certifications (they were free for me, ok?) and I too have never heard of the modulo operator.

In fact, I assert with absolute confidence no such operator exists. I also accept that the Java Religious Establishment purports an enormous amount of myth and this is one specific case that I have seen numerous times.

First, there exists a transition period, where it exists and you and I may not notice.

Second, the east german government didn't really give a fuck if you liked to sit on your front porch and read novels. There are never enough resources, never enough control freaks to care about the mundane things you do.

You were allowed to make the occassional joke without worrying you'd be sent off to the gulag.

But as soon as you do anything high profile or outside of mundane, you're fucked. It was that way there, and it's pretty much that way now.

It makes people like me who are still on the fence about this election (disclosure: I heavily supported the Libertarian party in the '04 election and was burnt by it, now I'm apathetically middle ground) completely stay away from Ron Paul.  It seems that people who are pro-Paul are completely close minded about any other candidate and even more close minded about their own candidate's flaws.

I'm fairly certain that being so zealous about RP will leave a bitter taste in the mouths of a lot of supporters when this election turns into Giuliani VS Clinton.","1193946062"

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; So if they had protested and never mentioned the soldiers name specifically, that would have been OK with you? Sorta a politically correct version of protesting. ""We're not here for your specific son, but all dead soldiers are gay"". This is OK and would be permissible?

That's not what I said at all. Read my other posts on this topic, as well. The point I have made continually is the fact that they directed the protest at this family, and the protest WAS arbitrary. So, if they had roped off a street and had a march down that street in town, on the day of, talking about dead soldiers -- THAT is ok. That is not directed, arbitrarily, at people who have nothing to do with anything. 

&gt; In fact, the videos I have seen of the WBC protests usually don't specifically name the soldiers while at the protest. Even the article says that the name of the soldier was only listed at the website. In addition, they don't target a few dead soldiers, they target ALL soldiers living and dead.

Doesn't matter -- even if they're not directing it at one soldier in word, they are in action. The family of the soldier(s) are not related to the soldier's actions. It's not lawful to single out any given person without a particular reason to do so. I can't just pick a person on the street and start photographing them for a tabloid without getting their consent. I'm NOT saying that you have to have someone consent to protest them -- I'm only making the point that you cannot arbitrarily choose someone on the street and invade their privacy. (As opposed to, say, President Bush, who is not a ""private citizen,"" and has no expectation of privacy because he sought public office.)

As far as people on the website go: I would imagine that every person who feels wronged would need to bring their own suit. The whole point I've made in other posts is that if you don't feel wronged, or don't care enough, then you don't do anything! This man felt that his privacy was invaded, and this in conjunction with the intentional emotional distress and defamation of the soldier, was enough to bring him to civil court.

Yeah, that does make a lot more sense than passing individual laws for every conceivable type of frivolous lawsuit, doesn't it?  Restricting the rights of all citizens as a knee-jerk reaction to the flying Imams controversy makes absolutely no sense.

Besides, how many people have *ever* been sued for reporting suspicious behavior?  It wouldn't surprise me to learn that the flying Imams lawsuit was the only example.

&gt;You are inconsistent. You want judges to sort out the ""civil liberties"" of what in many cases is someone who is actually acting suspicious but not for government whistleblowers.

You're talking about two very different situations.  The civil courts aren't perfect, but frivolous lawsuits are routinely thrown out by judges.

On the other hand, the government whistleblowers are getting railroaded by a dysfunctional ""special administrative court"" system, which appears to be corrupt and more concerned with protecting the Bush administration than protecting those who would expose its malfeasance.  The need for reform is blatant and obvious, and any distracting hand-waving about the ""Democrats not supporting whistleblower rights"" and that absurd flying Imams law is utterly irrelevant to those issues.","1193946783"

So, I lived with my wife, at the time girlfriend, then fiancee, in three different cities under a variety of financial and social stressors (re: we were dirt poor most of the time, i.e. eat? or pay the rent? poor). We moved for college, career and financial reasons.

Not only that, we had a long engagement (three years) where we talked through *every*, *single* scenario, including our goals, our future plans career and family wise, and especially how to raise kids. We went through every red flag *before* we got married, and there were surprisingly more than I thought.

After all that, we've been together for about a decade, with a child. And a mortgage, car payments, all that. Above it all, I know I can rely on my wife, and she knows she can rely on me.

Ultimately, I don't think you can know a person for one, two, or even three years and from that guesstimate whether you can last the distance with marriage and kids. You can't simply take a person's word for it, and you can't get swept up in the initial romance and think you're perfect together.

I don't buy ignorance as an excuse. That's just as bad as leaving the spouse and kids in a lurch. As parents, you owe it to your kids to show them how to be proper parents and role models. Not talking, or sweeping problems under the rug is the antithesis of that.

Newsflash: Colbert is officially running, AND has a TV show.  (Granted, his is not running seriously)  Those are (current) facts.

Now addressing your other points:

Fred Thomson is no longer in law and order because **he's working on his campaign**.  Did you expect that he'd campaign in his spare time?  Being a TV character isn't an unfair advantage.  He just doesn't have **time** to do it.

Comedy Central does not want to be liable in any way, nor lose a big talent/moneymaker.  Their lawyers are fine-toothing this.

Although couched in comedy, the fine line Colbert (and Comedy Central) is walking is that his *job* is to cover the election.  He is not being given free airtime as a candidate to promote himself, he's just doing his job.  I'm sure this fine line wouldn't fly with a real candidate, but then, Colbert is not actually trying to win.

To answer your other question: The reason why is that Unix didn't become a philosophy until *after* the BSD and SVR people managed in a fit of trying to one-up each other, managed to completely fuck everything up. The only reason I think Unix ever had a *philosophy* was so that USC unixers could pretend to have something in common with VAX users and lispm hackers.

These days, Unix lost. Streams are dead, as are BSD-style signals and dumps. When you saw every sun4 install get gnu installed as the first (and most rapidly atime'd) you knew it had happened. Administrators became unafraid to run unknown programs with --help, and developers eventually started to say ""well it works on *linux*"".

Unix is dead, and improvements to Linux and GNU are out of pragmatism instead of merely to justify one vendors ""flavor"" of unix over another. GNU bash actually has a `/dev/tcp/`, and Linux actually has namespaces. Sunos^H^H^H^Holaris actually has a ""Linux compatability kit"" because fewer people care about Unix these days, than care about GNU/Linux.

As a result, the `iptables` solution that's flopping around all over the place really is completely acceptable. Combined with `-m owner` you can actually get your chmod/chown effects as well.

I run a bunch of multihomed linux boxes, and I block regular user access to outbound port 25 tcp and any udp access. As a result when a customer choses a weak password, I don't end up udp flooding anyone or spamming anyone else. The filesystem is otherwise almost completely standard to ease upgrades. Having everything be a file would make it harder to have a security policy different than Debian, whereas the versatility of iptables means I can still do the kind of hardening I want.

And we use authbind instead of iptables to allow user-binds to port 80. It works better than port negotiations and redirects, *and* doesn't require we have ginormous iptables.","1193947268"
"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; Apple managed to sell only 2 million copies

Before you claim FUD, you should consider your points. That vista number was also including new PCs sold by retailers that had Vista pre-installed. So that does NOT mean that 20 million people went out to their local shop just to buy Vista. Same thing applies to the '85 million copies' claim.

Even *if* we have trained people looking out for suspicious activity, there is a real risk of a significant chilling effect on non-harmful behaviour.  I was about to type legal behaviour, but on the contrary, we need to protect our positive rights, not just what is codified.

I know from personal experience that when you are questioned by the police for photography, for instance, and then subsequently have your name and personal information recorded, perhaps get checked up on later by detectives, etc., it is deeply chilling with regards to whether you think you can pursue your hobby.  And yet, from a certain perspective, I can see someone defending the cops actions: that they were just ""making sure"" that nothing illegal was going on, but boy does that have an effect on what people believe they can do and what they will do.  We have a right to do things that are not illegal, and we must protect them. 

It was the same thing in the first and second red scares; it wasn't that many people were successfully incarcerated or prosecuted or even blacklisted from their jobs (although many prominent people were), but the fear of ever even being challenged, whether that challenge ever amounted to anything or not, acted as a force to keep people in line.

I think we disagree here:

Complying with federal investigations is one thing. If the FBI or CIA later turns out to have wrongfully prosecuted, or investigated the wrong person, or mismanaged the case, of course companies that comply should not be held liable.

But that's not the question here. The question is about the method of investigation. Companies should not comply with federal investigations that require the use of illegal methods. That's the difference. To bring out a strawman again (but one that does, in fact, logically follow), corporations should not help the government to, say, torture detainees, no matter that the government really wants to get information out of them or has justified its use of torture.

There should be universal health care, homeless shelters/public housing, enforcement against job discrimination, and a functioning mental health care system (rather than lumping them in with true criminals in jails).

The fact that few democracies have gotten these completely right yet doesn't mean that they're all fascist states, it means we still have work to do.  The fact that the US is moving backwards on these is also very unfortunate, but it doesn't mean that people are intentionally moving us towards fascism.

The reason these problems persist is that people aren't fully aware of the magnitude of problems the underclass face on an everyday basis.  Once these problems are forced onto the national consciousness (eg. poor people being unable to evacuate before Katrina), the middle class becomes sympathetic.  If we get to the point where we fully comprehend their hardships, but *still* accept the status quo or even outright endorse it, then we're moving to the point where the underclass is irrevocably trapped and exploited.

V for Vendetta was a really stupid movie. 

Why?

The solution to a fascist government was apparently an anoynmous fascist revolution, juxtaposed against the main plot line of  heroine ""tortured"" into liberation by hero. Ironically the goal of the ""liberation torture"", was to inculcate the heroine with   the ""courage to come out as a lesbian"".

Some truly bizarre ass stuff.

As for the 2006 thing. The big hope was to get enough dems into office to slow down the executive, which has essentially happened. Those of us who actually were involved in campaigns, I double dipped for Joe Courtney and Ned Lamont in CT-02, understood that the democratic establishment was not going to save anything. The goal was to get as many progressives into office as possible, to attempt to have some influence on the out of control processes. You will note that the blogsphere got as many candidates into office as the DCCC in the House.

The progressive take over of the democratic party is going to be a long hard slog, much as the conservative revolution on the republican side took nearly 3 decades.

As for the Hillary = Bush thing. This is at best shallow thinking. You will notice that there is no substantial debate against Hillary at the moment. No one is even remotely attempting to challenge her on policy, it's all veiled character attacks, and investigations of the people around her.

Where as Bush II was heralded by the press, who actively covered up for him, and silenced opposition to his obvious flaws, that same press is working its way up into total attack mode against Hillary much as we saw in the 90's. 

You have to ask yourself why would they do this if Bush = Hillary. Obviously the people who pay for these things think Hillary is going to hurt them big time, otherwise they would just roll out the red carpet as they did for Bush II.

Oh yeah, when the government is totalitarian our guns will save us. Yay. Look we can be out on the streets with teh guns fighting for our freedumbs. Wait, there is a new post on my gun forum. Have to go!

I used to be pro-gun rights. Guns are primitive tools without much influence today. It is all about media control, lobbying, money and manipulation. Don't point to Iraq. The situation there is very different and those people have nothing. The government knows that to keep Americans from revolting, they have to be provided with candy and an unattainable American dream that they feel they can work towards.

Go look at gun forums. They are almost entirely dominated by right wing conservatives. The gun is a primitive power tool that appeals to authoritarians who think of power as the answer to issues and not compassion, dialog or empathy. Yeah, I am aware of the self defense argument. You do not need NFA and assault weapons for self defense. Yes, I am also aware of the NRA argument: ""If you let them take away our assault rifles, they will take away everything, your women will be raped and you will be at the mercy of colored inner city gangbangers who love rap."" The NRA panders to authoritarian anti-immigration whites. Dog the bounty hunter is the average gun owner's role model. Use force to solve problems.

Ron Paul is conservative first and foremost. Is he better than the rest of the neo-cons? Absolutely. But he is still against gays, abortion, taxes and all the usual progressive stuff. His only answer to every issue is ""DO NOT WANT."" If you are a progressive liberal, Paul is not the candidate for you.","1193948079"

A graphical clipboard that *shows* the past N pastes so I can easily drag and drop one into my program (or use a key command to insert) can be very helpful. (Of course you could do this in a curses-based interface as well, but perhaps not as nicely.)

Regardless, the time spent entering commands is only a small part of how long it takes you to complete an action. Figuring out which action you actually want to perform, then figuring out how to perform it, is almost always more costly.

Linux has the SElinux extensions which are now part of the 2.6 kernel series, though not enabled by default, when last I checked.

In FreeBSD land, there is a project named TrustedBSD.
TrustedBSD provides a set of extensions to FreeBSD to add support for {ACLs, Capabilities, Mandatory Access Control, Auditing} as well as supporting features to implement them. These features are being integrated into the base operating system distribution, with the intent that they be ""part of FreeBSD"".

Now read it and weep for OpenBSD: http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/fluke/html/inevit-abs.html


Restated, the OpenBSD and TrustedBSD projects have largely different thrusts: the OpenBSD project seeks to provide a correct and bug-free POSIX implementation (where correctness includes a focus on failing to suffer from security holes). It also includes cryptography-related features as a primary development goal, hence early development and integration of IPsec in the base system (and a continuing high level of maturity of their implementation), as well as their work on OpenSSH. 

TrustedBSD project seeks to introduce a variety of features, some described in the defunct POSIX.1e draft. These include MLS (with fixed-label BIBA), MAC, ACLs, FLASK and Type Enforcement.

Its possible (and perhaps probable) that OpenBSD will pick up some of the TrustedBSD work, but this just proves that you can't look to OpenBSD as ""the secure operating system"". Solaris has had similar work in-place for *years*.

Whats next is the integration of source control into the mechanisms for patching running systems, just the thing that IBM and Lisp Machine environments (*) had in the 80s and before.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; Your obsession with whether or not I would personally do something under duress has nothing to do with society at large or a country's interrogation policy.

In my mind, the reason people make this argument is to get you to say that you _should_ torture someone; that torture, in some cases, is justified.  The idea, then, is that if torture is justified under some circumstances, then torture should be legal under those circumstances.

I'll be bold and give my interpretation of both 1smartass's and khoury's comments: I believe that 1smartass feels torture is _justified_ in this situation, and therefore such cases should be provided for by the law.  On the other hand, khoury does not seem to believe that you _should_ torture someone, making a distinction between rational choices (torture is never justified) and _instinctual_ (irrational) _reactions_. So I hope I'm not far off in interpreting khoury's answer as: (1) s/he hopes s/he would not be allowed to torture, and (2) what we _want_ to do is not necessarily what we _should_ do.

Finally, for the record, if one of my loved ones were in danger, and I had someone who I _knew_ had information pertinent to safely recovering my loved one, I prefer to believe that my rational side would prevail and I would not employ physical torture.","1193948506"

You see when Robocop was written technology was already a big part of life -- computers were known and used somewhat frequently -- robots were already producing assembly line products, etc.; when Orwell wrote 1984, he touched on things that most people thought insane -- impossible even.  Telescreens, 24/7 survalience, etc. All these topics were thrown into the mix even before they were invented or deemed possible -- too me, that's a huge difference.  Robocop wasn't really that far-fetched -- not in the same way 1984 was.  Is my reasoning wrong -- or is there something I'm missing?

Yes it does. Ultimately I was going to get to that point but I can't get anyone to admit that they would torture someone themselves. I know that they would and I gave the circumstances. My next step was to see if their childs life depended on someone else torturing someone, would they be OK with that. But if I can't get anyone to be honest about them doing it themselves then there's no point in going any further with this.

"programming","t5_2fwo","In just about all the BSDs, the kernel, administrative and core userland tools are all built in one development tree.

This means that with each release of a BSD, you get the next version of kernel **and** userland.

In Linux, the kernel comes from one place, and userland tools from another.  They all come from different sources, and because of this, they aren't release at the same time, or from the same place.

For example, Linus and the Linux kernel contributors give you the kernel, but different utilities and tools might come from GNU, init from this guy, syslog from that guy...  It all works, true, but they are all developed independently and then put together to form the base system.  As such, different Linux distributions might have slightly varied base software, with the quality of security varying through each tool.

In BSD, again, the base and the kernel are all in the same source tree; they are developed and released as one solid set.

In terms of software management, each Linux distro installs both *system* **and** non-sys user software from its respective repository.

Most BSDs make a distinction between base system userland, *packages* and *ports*.

* Base system software is *part* of BSD.  You cannot install it from some repository or pull it in as a software package.  It will come **built-in** to the BSD system, and can only be installed or reinstalled from the raw installation data for that particular BSD.  Again, this is because the BSD base userland is considered as one with the kernel.  They are together developed and distributed as *one complete system*.

* Packages are software that has been built specifically for that release of BSD.  For some BSDs, like OpenBSD, packages are actually different than ports because the BSD development team has gone through the source of the software and made security or performance improvements, and tweaks that make it run ""better"" on the specific BSD.  Packages are usually precompiled, and are just tarballs to be extracted, ready to run.
  Your typical package would be for something like *sudo, dhclient, dhcpd, bash*.

* Ports are software that we all use in the UNIX world, simply ported over to BSD.  Most port systems simply grab the source and build.  Your typical port would be something like *fluxbox, GNOME* or *Firefox*.

There is essentially no real difference between the software installed by packages or ports; only suffice to say that pre-distributed *packages* offered in conjunction with a specific BSD release may have seen review by the BSD development team.  Ports allow you to build 3rd party software, and create packages from them if you plase.  Packages are usually binary tarballs, and ports are usually source to be patched and compiled.

The main thing BSD gives you, compared to Linux, is a much more *tighter* and *cohesive* system.

Usually the kernel is subject to much more exhaustive code review, and kernel subsystems are subject to higher standards.  Linux development moves fast, quite true, but the BSDs usually seek to *properly* engineer their software.

BSDs are usually much more _solid_ than Linux machines, and make for more reliable server systems.

The BSD way of development is evident in OpenBSD's **pf**, which beats the pants off of Linux's **iptables**.

Its also evident in FreeBSD's **GEOM** framework, which I think is superior to Linux's **md**.

And yet another example is FreeBSD's **Netgraph**, for which I don't think an equivalent exists in Linux.

FreeBSD was also the first to port Solaris' **ZFS**, and I do believe they are well on their way to implementing **DTrace**.

Gentoo's **Portage**, which was the first package management system to do things *completely differently* from other Linux distributions at the time, was primarily inspired by the BSD Ports system.

"reddit.com","t5_6","As the others who have responded mentioned, we (fiancee and I) were also told that closing accounts was a bad idea when we were looking for a house.  The debt:credit ratio, your credit history, etc were a lot more important.

Apparently treating my credit cards like cash (don't charge more than you can afford to pay each month) seemed to really help, as while I have a *lot* of credit, the numbers said we were such a good risk that just looking at the info we initially provided, along with a credit check, eliminated the need for the loads of paperwork, paystubs, body fluid samples, first-born off-spring, and our immortal souls that others I know had to provide to actually be approved for a mortgage any time in the last 7-10 years.  This situation is apparently...very rare.

In any case, every card I have keeps raising my limits, and aside from some rather essential household and car-related expenses since getting the house, I still follow the ""charge only what you have"" as much as I can.  So basically, a $0 (or even $1k or so) debt on $(rand() * 10000) credit looks a LOT better than $0-$1k debt on $(rand() * 100) credit.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Why the ""if you're not worried about performance""?  This is the fastest and best way to do it, given the context the original poster gave, which is as part of a memory allocation system.

It is very fast for small values of n, and its runtime for large values of n is proportional to log(n).  Since you are using it to allocate memory blocks and people don't usually allocate large blocks of memory without doing something with them, the chances are that something O(n) is about to happen, which will totally swamp the O(log(n)) power of two round up.

The only thing I'd change is that you probably don't allocate memory blocks right down to 1 byte in size, but probably have a minimum size such as, perhaps, 16 bytes, in order to maintain alignment.  In that case, start i at 16, not 1.  Then for small values of n it will have to iterate only a couple of times (or not at all) and will beat the pants off the ""more sophisticated"" techniques listed elsewhere in this thread and the original article.

As for converting it to a string or something ... oh, puhleeze.

For example, if I don't like the way Bush is doing something.. I can't decide I want to live under Kerry's ideas for government -- I am forced to live under what exists.  I have no ability to change that relationship.  However, if I am unhappy with the way my health insurance (for example) is treating me or costs, I am free to move to another health care provider.

This has more to do with resilience and reducing downtime than anything else. Java is quite likely the most secure web technology, security is a part of it's design hence the lack of pointers and the use of memory managers, so there is no need to hide it from the world. What we will often do is use an apache server to serve the static content, and of course most java webapps integrate with other back-end systems some of which will produce content themselves.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Okay, you're looking at a group of people here.  Let's say there's a large group of RP supporters who are, 18-25.  These are the same people who, for the last 7 years have been speaking their bastardized versions of 'leetspeak' on the net.  They yell 'omg' at everything.  

Even the news media, which has been the source of information until places like ./ reddit and digg came around and made it easier for us, hypes EVERYTHING.  How often is something in the news not a big deal?  Catastrophes, murders, scandals, etc.  This is what has been fed into the minds of people.  Why are you surprised when they scream at the top of their lungs about a presidential candidate, instead of being fragged?

Now take RP's platform.  He's about changing a lot of things.  The current situation we have now, is bad.  Some people may not think it's that bad, but I do.  This country is going to hell, and quickly.  (hell meaning to pieces, I don't believe in a hell)

When I first heard about RP, and what he was standing for, I went and read.  And read some more.  The more I read, the more interested I was, and the more screwed we seemed.  We have an illegal, genocidal war, without any end in sight.  We have the erosion of our basic freedoms.  There's the coming 'police state' that people talk about.  

These seem like big problems to me.  I'm a rather reserved person sometimes, and I have never been interested in politics.  I've never voted for anyone because they all seemed like scum to me.

When I started reading the news sites, a lot, I started seeing this pattern.  Our government is corrupt, most people will agree with that.  Our economy is doing bad, and getting worse.  And to top it all off, we're invading countries and killing over a million people.

Then I saw a RP article on Digg.  For the first time ever, I was faced with a man, a politican, but a decent, honest, trustworthy man.  I'd never seen that before, at least not at the federal level.  

I'm sure that the Bushes, and the Clintons, etc. all have their special interests - their big money buddies.  

RP doesn't take lobbiests over citizens.  He doesn't vote against his beliefs... EVER.  He has a proven track record that shows this.  I haven't been able to find any of his positions that I disagree with.  I may disagree with his beliefs but what he says makes sense.  He's against abortion, but believes that it's not his business at the federal level... ad infinitum.

All this, the state of the country, the constant threat of impending doom, a failing economy, untrustworthiness of our current administration, and the general ""I can't believe this guy is so honest"" feeling that he seems to inspire add up to a fanatical group of supporters.

And yes... I totally agree with the poster.  People babbling on inanely don't help anyone.  

To all my fellow RP supporters:

Try some dialog instead of empty comments.  Don't just say ""you're stupid if you don't like RP,"" say something with meaning, because then you just look like a tool, and people aren't going to listen to you, even if you really do have an important message.

An economic solution may play a small part, but it will remain small.  The American food industry (and not just the meat industry) is chiefly to blame, for pragmatically convincing Americans that it's in their interests to be incapable of preparing their own food from staples, so that the industry can sell them burgers and TV dinners (or otherwise prepared food items) at a substantial mark-up over their cost.  The more helpless you are, the more they can sell you.  And one present consequence, though there are other reasons for it as well, is that American vegetable dishes and food options are *utter crap*.  When vegetables are prepared, it's usually in as boring a manner as can possibly be conceived (""let's boil it to get rid of the flavour, then...well...serve it as a mild punishment!"") and the American culinary tradition is *even worse than the English one* from which it came, difficult as that is to imagine.  Whoever's to blame, the food culture is a disaster, and needs to be thrown out the window reinvented by those who are willing.  Less idiotic food economy will help those willing to try, but it won't likely help those already wholly sold on culinary idiocy.","1193950411"

1) Most of these people are career civil servants. They took a test, are not appointed, and have nothing to do with Bush. The Secretary of State and ambassadors are the appointed ones. The older FSOs have probably been toiling away there since Reagan or Carter. The Foreign Service Association has been against the war and the State Department(as in employees) in general hates it.

2) Yes, they could just quit and I imagine many of them might, but you honestly don't think this is worthy of complaint? You do your job competently for 20 years and then get told to go to a death trap or be fired? The Foreign Service is not the military, where you are expected to go in and fight. If a country gets as dangerous as Iraq is currently, the U.S. has typically closed the embassy or consulate. No one has been forced to serve in a particular country for 3 decades. I assume that if FSOs wanted to go die, they'd join the military instead. 

It is pretty much a death sentence. The PRTs(provincial reconstruction teams) I assume these drafted FSOs will go to are not funded properly, and the military thinks they will become conspicuous targets. The State Department has had to contract with the private security firms just to get people to protect the State Dept. workers, because there are no military available. They had to beg the defense department for just a few guards.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Why are people so freaking stupid? This isn't a riddle, it's a trick question! Think about how a place takes off as normal: It produces thrust with its engines to create speed so that the change in pressure above the wing, created by the shape of the wing, pulls the wings up and thus the rest of the plane with it. If a treadmill is canceling the forward motion of the plane by negating wheel-to-ground friction then the airflow cannot create the pressure changes required to lift the plane. The problem is that all you simpletons out there are thinking that a plane work just like a car and that if you get the speedometer up you will create lift. Please please PLEASE stop being so retarded people. This is stuff a 5th grader can figure out with only the very basic knowledge of how winged flight works.
Moreover, think about how an aircraft carrier catapult works. The steam-powered catapult literally drags the plane forward, connected by a hitch in the forward landing gear. This action helps the plane's engines by working WITH it to build forward momentum against the forces of friction and gravity. So pretty much you have quicker acceleration because two forces (engine and catapult) are working in conjunction and the result is quicker acceleration and thus shorter takeoff distance.
Now, if you STILL can't figure it out, take your little treadmill and turn it around so that it is moving WITH the wheels of the plane. It will help move the plane FORWARD thus making acceleration quicker because more force is being used to overcome the friction between the plane and the ground.

You can't ""pwn"" it in the same way that most of the e.g. apache exploits work, where a buffer overflow is used to execute malicious code on the server. Security is one of the reasons that Java is still used despite it's other limitations. Of course, that doesn't mean that devs don't introduce vulnerabilities in the application e.g. sql injection.

Apache itself is very well audited now and it's my web server of choice (always has been). But due to being written in C it is open to buffer overflows and there have been [many](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=apache%20buffer%20overflow) over the years.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Well, first of all, it's a matter of degree.  I would say fascist is a direction, not a location, like 'progressive.'  Trying to find the distinct line where a country has crossed the line between ""not fascist"" and ""fascist"" is kind of missing the point.

That said, I think ""working with"" can mean a lot of different things.  Democratically and ""fairly"" elected gov't officials hiring corporations to provide services is not fascist, though they ""work with"" each other.  ""Unfairly"" elected gov't officials who function as corporate employees, and are first loyal to the corporations and use the government to further the goals and profit margins of their corporate employers is fascist.  ""Fairly"" elected gov't officials who manage companies of some kind (like Amtrak or whatever), not fascist.

Fascism is not only a claim about how connected corporations and gov't are, but a claim as to the direction of power.

Cheney, it seems to me, operates like an employee of Halliburton, for whom he continues to work.  He is an example, in my opinion, of government being controlled by a corporation.  Hence: proto-fascist.

Fascists are rarely genuine free-marketeers; just like corporations are rarely genuine free-marketeers.  Corporations seek monopoly power and seek to restrict free markets (in their markets, anyway; obviously they like 'free' markets when they are the consumers.)  However, fascists are often ""pro-business.""  That's because ""pro-business,"" usually means ""pro-monopoly-power-for-a-small-set-of-
existing-businesses,"" and, in particular, pro-business is often anti-free-market.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I feel the exact same way. I don't need to agree 100% with everything the man says, that's simply not possible, we'd need 300 million different candidates. Ron Paul is for change, when change is needed. 

I don't agree with his abortion stance, I'm pro-choice on everything, but he makes a valid logical argument which I can understand and even better he wants those decisions made on more local levels. 

I'm all for trying out social programs that benefit society. A small community could definitely work out a system of socialized medicine - because in a small community leaders are held accountable for their actions. 

As much as I'd love to see health care for the people who need it, I'm rational enough to know it can't happen at the federal level. Our government can't do ANYTHING right, asking them to do more isn't the right move. 

Maybe our government makes sense if the population of the US was 100k people. But no single person should EVER have the power our presidents do over so many millions of diverse people. It's that simple. I don't care if it's Paul, or even if it's me. 

A vote for Ron Paul to me is a vote for change. It's a vote that says ""hey fuck you this system doesn't work and we all know it"". It's a vote that says ""we're not going to sit by idly and let you screw us anymore"". 

That's why Paul gets my vote. Even if I'm pro choice, even if I'm against immigration controls. 

Paul is our way of saying something in a system where the individuals voice no longer matters. Where free speech is a lot cause. Where our rights have been willingly given away. It's our way of saying maybe our ancestors bought into your shit but that doesn't mean we need to continue it. 

That is why Ron Paul brings so many people from so many backgrounds together. It's because freedom really DOES unite people. Because we will let you do whatever you want, as long as you let us do the same. Because we're not so convinced of our moral superiority that we think our ideas should be forced on you - we just want you to leave us alone.

&gt; Less idiotic food economy will help those willing to try, but it won't likely help those already wholly sold on culinary idiocy.

you may be right here as well, but i'm not certain about that.  consider: cigarette smoking is demonstrably sensitive to tax hikes.  studies demonstrate it drops when you tax it, despite being _provably addictive_.  oddly enough, Americans display less sensitivity to gasoline prices -- they drive about as much when they go up, although they grumble a lot more.  (sorry, i don't have a link to the studies i'm recalling.)

the question is, does the price elasticity of demand for plant-based foods better resemble that of cigarettes or that of gasoline?

i'm willing to bet that it's closer to cigarettes.  even though tobacco's a habit, you force yourself to reduce it if it gets too costly.  but for gasoline, since most of America lacks decent mass transit, there's no alternative: you use a car or you can't feasibly get to work.","1193952506"

I suspect that much corporate misbehavior today has a lot to do with the monetary system and the cozy relationship of large corporations with the Federal government.  To what extent it is an artifact of inflationary fiat money and out of control expenditures and regulation by a nearly unaccountable federal government versus something inherent in the nature of the corporation, remains to be seen.  I own a couple small businesses and do not see corporations themselves as evil or anything.  They are no more or less moral than the people who run them.

Fascism was the only original political ideology to emerge after the Enlightenment. Both Communism and Liberal Democracy shared the same baseline, the 17th-Century Enlightenment's notion of the equality of Man. Fascism was a direct assault on that notion, much more comrehensive than the dregs of Royalism that survived the French Revolution. It specifically rejected the notion of Equality, Rationalism and Democracy, in favor of Racialism, Mysticism and the Unitary Executive as personified by a strong leader.

What?!

The changes are not always massive, at least not on this scale.

ME was *decidedly* not that different from 98, which was not that different from 95.

On the NT line, 2003 is almost the same OS as XP, which was not *that* different from 2000, which was not *that* different from NT 4.

In fact, I'd argue that Vista is more different compared with XP than XP is compared with NT 4.

&gt; And thanks for assuming I have no idea what an OS does. Here's a thought, maybe people are downmodding you because you come off incredibly condescending.

Right, because you (apparently!) have *no idea*. I'm trying to get that across, and frankly I don't think there's a polite way of doing it with any impact.

The huge scale of what Microsoft did is abundantly clear if you spend just a *little* time researching it, and you have the background necessary to understand it.

Let me give you a bit of a metaphor.

You've got the 2003 model of a car, and you decide it's time to check out the new model, the 2007. So you come into the dealership, ooh, look, it's prettier on the outside.

So you take it for a test drive, and it seems to drive pretty much the same, maybe a little sluggish, and for some reason a lot quieter.

And so you go home, and your opinion of the car is ""well, it's basically the same, but a little prettier... what the hell have those car designers been up to for the last five years?!""

Except the car's fantastically different, under the hood. It's a hybrid now. It's got antilock brakes. It'll park itself. It gets 30 more miles to the gallon. It uses 802.11 to talk to other cars on the road and automatically reacts to lessen the severity of unavoidable crashes. It's the same base engine, but quieter, more fuel efficient, it charges batteries, and it's computer controlled. It has anti-theft sensors built in.

You come home, and you go on a car forum, and make a post, saying that ""GM could not have done much worse"", and that you have ""no idea what took so long"".

Any automotive engineer that saw your post would have the same conclusion I did: That you either don't know what happens under the hood of the car, or you just don't know what's different.","1193953117"

The problem with webmail is that IMAP is really built around long-lived connections. You *don't* want each HTTP page fetch translating into an IMAP connect/disconnect (something you can do more reasonably with POP).

i.e. it is IMAP connection setup/teardown which should be seen as expensive, not a continuous (but mostly idle) connection.

The standard way around this is an IMAP-IMAP proxy, which keeps a connection open to the backend IMAP server and allows the webmail client to reconnect cheaply.

Their purpose is to give the site's viewers an opportunity to voice their opinion and see how it matches up to the other participants. 

The distributed nature of the internet is relevant here.  It's a means for people to voluntarily form groups and spread information, and there's no centralized control.  This actually fits quite nicely with Libertarian philosophy.  It's impossible for a small group of people to skew the perceived opinion online except in a very limited way.  If this were possible, I assure you that every campaign out there would be doing this.  It's much, much easier to skew perceived opinion when information is spread through a small number of centralized news sources, and it's quite obvious that that takes place on a regular basis.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I have read most of the comments posted here. And, here is my opinion.
First, I think that EBS could be known by fews but not by all project leaders or managers. After 8 years of working experience, I find that EBS is the first ""rational"" methodology to improve scheduling precision and especially to evaluate team members estimation and scheduling competencies. What is worth the try with EBS, is its ""living"" behavior. It is not a fixed tool to determine scheduling accuracy. It grows through and with our team experience.
So first, we have the opportunity to prevent deadlines shortage and project slipping. Furthermore, we will improve each team member ability to correctly estimate the work he is doing. Those members will improve their estimation abilities faster than ""hobbyists"".

Now, I do agree with hx7241, killerstorm and Monkeyget. In project planning and task estimation phase, people do need tools that help them give accurate forecast of the work load to engage. EBS then will help getting more guarantees on deadlines and project deliveries.
Until now, I have used SFEE (SourceForge for Enterprise Edition), GForge (OpenSource like version of SFEE), online teamwork project (online.twproject.com) and even FogBugs. None of them helped me to evaluate task ""multidimensions"" as suggested hx7241.
I think that real value can be gained on evaluating :

* Objects' Complexity (objects we deal with in the current task)

* Task's complexity (sub-tasks, steps and typologie - modification or creation)

Furthermore, there is a difference between estimating the following steps for a task :

* Estimation workload itself

* Requirement analysis

* Solution design (detailed functionnal specifications)

* Solution analysis (detailed technical specification)

* Solution development (including unit testing)

* Integration tests (validating that developments fit togther with existing realzations)

* Build

* Project management time scope

What can be estimated accurately is development step. The other steps can be estimated as an amount of time (in percentage) accordingly to the development time. Hence, Analysis time can be 30% of development time (including specification redaction time) or even 200%, which common for new projects or features.

I have developped an Excel tool to do this for Lotus Notes/Domino Projects : My team's estimations were 95% accurate. I will try to send an article on this tool.","1193953498"

&gt; Which is completely different than your initial claim that, and i quote, *Java is quite likely the most secure web technology*.

How do both sentences differ? They are both correct IMHO. 

Java is also used because it's fast and scalable. A properly tuned VM will be closer to the speed of C than any other language (I could reference research to prove this). Once the VM has been up for a while (one downside), all of the key loops will be running as machine-code, optimized by the JIT compiler. You need a C guru to do similar optimization by hand in that world, it's a very desirable and saleable skill if you can do it. But I do agree completely with all of the other reasons you suggest it is used. It's used because it does the job well. Most of the criticism is from use as it as a desktop runtime, which it is usually ghastly.

WRT to the moderation, that's not my opinion on the matter, there are many posts that are just noise or are just abusive in tone. The ""report"" button flags the message for a human moderator to see and really shouldn't be used for people who are simply behaving as jerks. That's what the mod-down is for.

* Ruby is unstable.

When pressed on the issue he gave up trying to defend either one of his claims and decided to attack rails as being inflexible and made an outrageous claim/lie that there is no such thing as a ruby debugger.

Now you come along and claim other things about rails an/or activerecord and if I pressed you on them I bet you too would back off of them.

The problem with you guys is that you don't realize how flexible of a language ruby is and you are all too willing to just come out and lie. 

How anybody can look at the vast ecosystem of rails plugins out there and then claim that rails is inflexible is beyond me. 

What's more rails is very easy to extend (even activerecord). When twitter was having problem because they could not connect to multiple databases I think it took less then a day for somebody to modify activerecord to be able to read and write from multiple databases.

That's not an accurate characterization of the bill, though I admit the bill's authors are also to blame as certain titles do allude to preventing homegrown terrorism. However, the bill does not actually task any arm of the government with taking direct action against homegrown terrorism.

This bill does not give them permission to spy on anyone. If your argument is that they don't need permission to spy on people, then this bill doesn't matter! The only difference is that Congress is commissioning a report on homegrown terrorism. Whether or not they're spying is unaffected by this bill.

The powers of the commission are explicitly laid out in Sec. 899C(i). Specifically, they're empowered to hold hearings and receive evidence, to contract with private parties to discharge that function, and to solicit information and statistics from government agencies.

Ten to twenty years ago I never had to pull out a dictionary on a regular basis to define it for someone, but now I do.  

Some on the left throw the word around I explain the historical definition and they will back down and begin to talk about the same issue avoiding that word.  When I am talking to the right is when I run into trouble.  I pull out a dictionary then they often ""redefine"" it a bit.  What I mean by this is ""it would be where corporations actually write legislation"" is a common one but when I point out that has been common for the last few years and actually longer they again try to ""redefine"" and if pressed I will usually get a no comment to a screaming tirade in defense.    I think we are ""redefining"" fascism because we fit a bit to much of the definition much like the USSR tried to redefine dictatorship to allow Stalin to not be labeled to close to Hitler.  I think its stupid to move the goal posts when we either need to accept what we have become or begin work to change it.  Otherwise  we are just as bad as the Stalin apologists were in the 40-60's.","1193954782"

There is nothing wrong with not knowing about anything. I just wanted to watch the typical knee-jerking from the Java community when I challenged their belief system as opposed to the more epistemological, ""hey maybe there is something I don't know"".

It is the fact that I *do* know what the modulo operator is, that has them all up in arms. Once they have been proven wrong, I even predicted the response of a charge with pedant, etc. and perhaps even being told I need to appease the ninnies - both of which have occurred within minutes.

His point was not about a moneyed ruling class holding sway over a poor population - that is the way that things have been done for centuries. Instead he points out that fascism can only exist in a developed industrialised nation, as it requires the apparatus of state to be subverted by corporations to enslave the populace to their own ends. Which is, when you consider it, a frightening prospect in the modern age, when our corporations have had another seventy years experience since the first trial of fascism.

I don't for one second believe, by the way, that the US has become remotely genuinely fascist; the problem is that there are worrying trends in that direction. However having seen those trends, and being aware of the danger that they may ultimately pose if they are not checked at the earliest possible opportunity, they must be nipped in the bud now. 

That can only be through a return to the traditional American values. Values that do not include torture, or indefinite detention without trial, or attacks on other nations not on the basis of what they can do, but on the basis of what they might do years hence..","1193956608"

"reddit.com","t5_6","First of all, it hasn't been a year since Vista RTM shipped. The guy is obviously a MAC fanboy, just hating on MS. Here are my experiences:

[1] I think hardware and software driver support is just fine on Vista SP1. In fact it is great, better than XP for some new devices. I bought steelsound gaming headphones, on XP I had to insert the disk to install drivers, and on Vista just plugged in the headphone in the USB (headphone has an external soundcard) and Vista automatically installed the drivers. Nice and easy.

[2] I bought a Kensington wireless keyboard/mouse combo which is advertised as made for Mac. The instructions said that on Mac, insert this CD to install the drivers first. But you know what, on Vista, I just plugged in the receiver in the USB port and the keyboard/mouse just started working!

[3] I bought a no-namer harddrive, plugged it in, and it just worked!

[4] I bought a second LCD monitor, plugged it in, and you know what, Vista recognized it and multimon just started working.

[5] People complain about Vista being slow, which it was, but with the latest SP1 beta that I installed, speed is great!

[6] People complain about Vista being a memory hog, but there's two things there. One is that if you put in more memory, Vista's superfetch is going to try and UTILIZE the extra memory, so it just appears like it is using a lot of memory, while all its doing is utilizing the extra memory by prefetching. Besides, have you checked the price of memory these days, its dirt cheap, dirrrt cheap.

[7] And with all the extra hardware requirements that Vista is blamed to have, look at the price of this hardware. My office mate just got this great deal on a Dell computer, $515 for -

Core 2 duo 2.0 GHz
2 GB RAM
200 GB hard drive
Aero supporting graphics card
20"" widescreen flat panel
Vista Home Premium upgrade for $30 more.

Computers are getting cheaper and better and Vista SP1 works awesome!

"science","t5_mouw","Let me start by saying that if science is going to cure AIDS or cancer, you will not find it buried in some article on reddit, as if the cure is just there but scientists are too dumb to see it.

As intriguing as this idea sounds, it won't change the current HIV epidemic. One of the things that makes HIV such a nasty bugger is that it incorporates itself into our actual DNA. It can lay there in a latent period until one day it decides to start pumping out virus proteins and replicate itself. So you see, zapping these little viruses does nothing to deal with the issue that the HIV DNA is still in all of the host's t-cells. This is why even after being treated for many years, an HIV positive person such as Magic Johnson can seem perfectly healthy, but he will never be able to reverse his HIV positive status like someone in cancer remission for instance could be considered actually cancer free.

The article seems to say that this technology would be used to filter out our donated blood supply. This would be nice, but it won't stop the spread of HIV. Only one in one million blood transfusions leads to HIV infection nowadays. The vast majority of new infections are from sex or IV drug abusers sharing needles. How would this technology stop that?

So yes, this is a cool idea and could help avoid that 1 in a million transmission. But a treatment? I don't think so.","1193957342"

It's a huge commitment to switch editors, but you might want to consider doing it for a while. At first it will be frustrating because things that were so easy to do before now require you to look them up.

Ultimately you'll have to decide if the switch is worth it. I used vim for seven years and switched to Emacs in 2000, largely to answer the same question you ask. For me, it's been an emphatic ""yes!"" But I've said time and time again, vim and Emacs are both great editors and it really comes down to a preference in coding style. vim largely adheres to the Unix philosophy of ""one tool to do the job, lots of tools working together"" while Emacs has (deservedly) the reputation of having everything including the kitchen sink.

And even before you try another editor, do you really know vim inside out? I'm dismayed at how few programmers really excel at using vim when I watch them code! vim is WAY featureful, yet a lot of programmers don't know much beyond :wq. Try perusing the vim manual for a few weeks, learning more features... when you really master vim, you'll have a leg-up on most other developers (even Emacs users) who don't.

There is a spectrum that exists as far as who is judging what is hinky.

You are right. I misunderstood your original comment. My apologies.

&gt; Having mobs of supporters go to linked sites to do things like Digg up comments that support Ron Paul is pretty hypocritical, especially when you take into account any comment that even questions one of his views.

False. I take it you're referring to Ron Paul's support of personal liberty, and how his supporters seem to you to work against it. But remember -- liberty means freedom from the violation of rights. No rights are violated when an opponent of Ron Paul gets voted down - it's only an indications that readers do not value the comment. They can get a bit overzealous sometimes -- anyone can. And, really, I can't blame them much, especially since the loudest anti-Paul voice is that of the neocons.

&gt;Since when has Wired's credibility been questioned? Never. Not until surprise, surprise a negative Ron Paul story. 

What put the credibility of the Wired article in question was not its content, but the post on giulianiforums.com.

He would, however, act as an Executive thorn in the side of fake progressives like Feinstein and Reid.  

Which is one reason why, despite his obvious differences with Kucinich, he has repeatedly stated his respect for the man.  (And IIRC, vice versa)

* If high is nonzero, increment exponent
* Unbias exponent by subtracting 1023

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; I'll assume your first comment is sarcastic, to which I respond, I get no complaints.

Please note that this may be different from the statement, ""others have no complaints about me.""

I probably wouldn't say anything about your style of communication here, on Reddit, an informal setting largely populated by geeks (this thread being particularly geeky).

Furthermore, I accept that you're right, and that calling `%` the ""modulo operator"" is not correct.

My primary complaint, and one that I think reveals your communication style to be inefficient at best, condescending at worst, is that you did not disclose the reasoning behind your statements in your ""fictional interview.""  To simply say, ""there is no modulo operator in Java,"" with no further explanation means either:

1. You've never heard anyone refer to it in this manner before, which strikes me as unlikely since you seem to have an answer prepared, or;
2. You've heard other people making this mistake, and know it's a relatively common mistake, but you prefer to make people play games and tease the answer out of you, rather than simply being helpful and offering an explanation.

I know someone that speaks in this manner.  He is smart, he is pedantic, and he always thinks he is right.  This is probably bolstered by the fact that he often is right, at least by some definition of ""right.""  Nonetheless, his attitude is often infurtiating.

So to answer your original question: as the interviewer I would first attempt to figure out if you're a moron that doesn't know what I'm talking about, or the type of person that is happy to shoot their chances of a good job in the foot to make me figure out a mathematical puzzle.  If there were other candidates that seemed easier to get along with, that also had roughly equivalent capacity to perform the job in question, they would get the offer and not you.  They're simply going to be easier to get along with.

For the record, I (more or less) like, respect, and still communicate with the person I know that talks in a manner similar to that of your post.  Also, thanks for this discussion about the difference between modulo and the ""remainder operator,"" which I find interesting and informative.","1193959707"

I hate to even remember this, because it was so painfully awkward to witness at the time; but I've seen guys do that in real life, not out of a pre-arrangement or because anything was staged, but because it was an instinctive gesture to save face.  

They'd been humiliated, and had to look like they were standing up for themselves with every intention of beating the shit out of the person who'd humiliated them.  But they didn't actually have any intention of assaulting the person and enduring all the legal fallout (they just weren't furious enough to disregard consequences like that).  

However they still wanted to save face and LOOK like they were ready to kick the guy's ass, and for this to work, other people had to cooperate in this unspoken script, by restraining them.  And if those people weren't actually restraining all that hard, well, the ""enraged"" guy would have to act like he was being restrained in spite of it.

"reddit.com","t5_6","The myth test is just putting the plane on a conveyor belt. I didn't see any part about the engines being on.

In any case, although it is the engines that push air *through themselves* to accelerate the plane, the fact is all that kinetic energy is going to go through the wheels and into the conveyor belt.  Because the plane will not accelerate, wind currents will not form going over the entire wing(s), and thus no **lift** is ever generated.

Ever seen plane engines being tested?  At some point they have to turn them on to test how well they're working.  There's planes out there every day with their engines going full throttle, yet the jets or planes aren't taking off.  Whether it's because the plane is up on jacks or it's on a conveyor belt with landing gear engaged, it's the same situation.  If the plane itself does not accelerate, there is no air across the wingspan(s), and no lift is generated.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Your attitude is that this group doesn't deserve the protections afforded everyone else. 

And quite simply, I don't believe they do, in the context of the case. There is a BIG difference between showing up in front of a courthouse or posting on your blog your views on various affairs, and showing up at a soldier's funeral. It's way past hateful, it's way past the protection of free speech. Get. Over. It.

Everything is conditional. Thankfully, such conditions change depending on the closeness with which we hold certain rights. There are certain rights that take a LOT to be able to say, ""yes, we can impede on that for the public good."" And, yes, free speech is one of them. You have the right to offend, you have the right to curse and scream and do whatever the hell you want to on your time in your place. A public location is just that, public, and therefore fits the above criteria. But a private affair such as a funeral does not.

Now, I am liberal. I am pro-gay rights, pro-choice, anti-war. But I still say there is a fine line between what is acceptable free speech and what is acceptable and what is disruptive and in poor taste and possibly illegal, and this is one of those cases where the line has been crossed. If the young man had been still alive and harassed in this way, had they put one hand on him, it would have been a hate crime. Free speech stops when you impede on another's free speech. When you interrupt a person's mourning with bullshit like this... Well, you see what happens. ","1193961595"

No, not if I say so. In any contest where a more mainstream republican goes up against the democrats, if the republican has any chance at all of winning, it is by the slightest of margins. Will you not concede this is so?

If Paul runs as a third party candidate, he will win nothing like a significant number of votes. This I know you concede. However, even an otherwise insignificant number of votes might be the difference that a mainstream republican candidate needs, and if they think Paul would steal that insignificant number...

Will you not concede this as well? That while he couldn't win, he could easily spoil it for another republican?

&gt; That's not speculation. Who the fuck else would be sending it if it weren't Paulites?

Let's see, who would do a thing like that? Obviously Paulites are too stupid to see that it would inevitably backfire, and no one else has anything to gain.

&gt; I mean it's not like you guys have any problem spamming the fuck out of every web site on the internet

Talking about it everywhere that someone might listen is one thing. Hell, I'll even grant you that they're obnoxious. But that's not the same as ""dumb as rocks"" stupid.

&gt; going to email spam is not exactly a big stretch.

Yes, it's a really big stretch. People that are going out of their way to figure out how to persuade others about their principled candidate that might mean real change (from their own perspective) aren't going to contact eastern european spamkings to take out a contract to spam all the world with Paul messages. It's untargeted, counter-productive, illegal, unethical, and will inevitably backfire.

&gt; Ron Paul's own campaign staff says it's probably one of their misguided supporters.

Any other time you'd probably jump at the chance to call them naive. Here, we have evidence that they are, but you accept the speculation wholesale. They don't know who did, aren't necessarily thinking like the cheaters which would allow them to understand who probably did, and in any event couldn't tell the truth to the media without sounding like alarmist liars.

The one I would suggest for beginners is oanda.com.  While most require a minimum trade of 10,000 units oanda lets you trade as low as 1 unit.  Their margin maxes out at 50:1 but that is plenty to work with.  They also have a forex game that uses actual recent data so it runs exactly like the real market just behind a bit.  You can get familiar with the system for free and deposit a few bucks when you're ready.  Oanda, unlike most others, has a minimum deposit of a few bucks at most while others may require $500 to $1000.

Education costs to the taxpayer have quadrupled. And the students in the voucher-funded schools aren't doing any better on achievement tests than the students in the public schools. After a decade. 

In addition, the state has little control over the voucher schools. Some schools have precious little in the way of curriculum, books, or supervision, but for the most part, the state has only been able to close schools for misuse of funds. (One school accepted over 400,000 for students who never enrolled).

Parents aren't able to get much information about many of the schools before making a decision and some schools are very resistent to parent visits. Surveys have shown that although most parents using vouchers are satisfied with the progam, a large number of parents pick the school for reasons that have little to do with education.

Virology 101- A virus is made of two basic materials: 1) A protein shell to house the virus's genome and to aid in infectivity and 2) An inner genetic code, made from either DNA or RNA, either single or double stranded. Some viruses have other components such as reverse transcriptases and other enzymes inside their shell, but ALL viruses have a protein shell carrying inside a genomic component. 

Now if you would RTFM, you would notice that this technology will only destroy the outer shell of the virus. This will only help stop the virus from replicating further (that is if you get every single one), but would NEVER turn an HIV positive person into an HIV negative one.","1193962993"

Just like those who can cure cancer with DCA are making a killing.  You have to admit that pharmecutical companies run the billion dollar health care industry.

Paul spoils it for all the rest in ways they consider detrimental, and even if he could win it they'd not want him... what's the point in someone winning if they only claim to be on your team but really aren't?

So, a party leader makes a few calls, they find a bagman, some mid-level apparatchik in some state republican party committee. He pulls $5000 out of a slush fund that they use for dirty work, talks to a few contacts who do dirty things, and is put in touch with a Latvian spamking. They strike a deal, where the spamking guarantees that a few million will see this, and they wait a few weeks.

Then, once the spams are out and they've checked, you find some third-rate network security researcher. You get him to confirm that the spams exist and what content (pro-Paul messages) they have in them, and you let some worthless pseudo-journalist take it from there. They weave some speculation in with the only actual facts (that the spams exist), and offer no counter-speculation.

Spam works as a marketing tool, because the cost to reach 100 million is still cheap enough that even if you can only find 2 or 3 chumps, that's enough to profit. And you have no reputation to protect, you're anonymous.

It doesn't work as a campaign tool, because you're not anonymous, 2 or 3 chumps isn't enough to win, and people hate spam... they will find out, you can't win. Everyone knows this, the people on his staff, and his supporters.

Furthermore, if we're to assume it was his supporters, why are they the only group to do this? You can believe the rhetoric if you like, but with two large enough groups (Paul supporters vs. someone else's supporters) both are probably pretty equal all told. Why are no other candidates' supporters doing this ""for"" them? So, you have to imagine that there's this huge difference in the two groups... which is unlikely, but further plays into the propaganda.

Paul had nothing to gain by this, his supporters would have known that, but many other people did have something to gain and no one mentions this.

Giuliani could shrug off such an accusation, Hillary too... but to a man that claims to be honest and principled, this would be poison. ","1193963226"

The point is that proofs about concurrency, event-driven systems, file systems, and even the unbelievable nastiness that is TCP/IP and socket implementation have in fact been done and, particularly in the case of TCP/IP and socket implementation, yielded very useful results.

Your original comment suggested that there wasn't even a way to interpret any of these things in a consistent fashion, let alone prove anything about them (""One might as well try to prove 1+2=3 in a world where plus means times on even days of the month."")

A plane could theoretically be stationary on the ground, and if the wind is strong enough it would lift off momentarily. Of course, drag would make it move with the wind reducing relative airspeed and it falls down again immediately.","1193963433"

You assume that society will remain prosperous and primarily consumerist indefinitely.  Consumerism as society's central focus is mostly a development of the last 40 years.  It is not a permanent state of affairs.

Your assumption that the current style of corporatist government will remain solvent and continue growing is also baseless.  History is not linear.

There is every reason to expect severe economic disruptions and periods of mass unemployment in the years ahead, as have happened regularly in our history.  Your conjectures that the American people will forever be wealthy and pacified, and that the government will continue on its growth trajectory are baseless.

In summary, the main article and your posts are naive of how history really plays out and how long the status quo will last.  History has just as many crisis periods as linear trends.  Guns have been handy in lots of crisis periods.  The citizenry's willingness to use guns has flared up many times.  Read about the Whiskey Rebellion.","1193963565"

"politics","t5_2cneq","i quoted both. [wikipedia was quoting this summary.](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-1955&amp;tab=summary) as indicated by the footnote.

&gt;The powers of the commission are explicitly laid out in Sec. 899C(i). Specifically, they're empowered to hold hearings and receive evidence, to contract with private parties to discharge that function, and to solicit information and statistics from government agencies.

right. this means, they could legally talk to the telcos without needing any of the rigmarole that the police or fbi would need to go through. and then, there'd be no reason to get any warrants for anyone, because the government would already have the evidence from the commission's investigation.

&gt;If your argument is that they don't need permission to spy on people, then this bill doesn't matter! The only difference is that Congress is commissioning a report on homegrown terrorism. Whether or not they're spying is unaffected by this bill.

no, this bill does matter, because currently that's why the [fight over fisa](http://www.politicalchase.com/2007/10/15/gop-looking-for-fisa-fight?referer=sphere_related_content) is so vicious. i think this is just a very sneaky way around the whole thing.

"science","t5_mouw","Would you stop your conspiracy theory nonsense? As an actual person writing prescriptions in a hospital, I can tell you that we always choose the cheapest drug that does the job, especially when a patient is uninsured. We really don't give a crap what the pharmaceutical company is pushing this month as the latest and greatest. Whatever drug is out there that can help cure our patients, they are getting full access to.

Second, my comments were only meant to dispel the notion that this is an HIV cure since that is how the article and the OP presented it. Could this be used to treat other viruses? Yeah that would be cool, except that once the viral capsid is broken, the viral DNA is still around. Free viral DNA is highly infective in many viruses, such as Hepatitis C for example.

And you did attack my credential:
&gt;supporting an opinion on something you know nothing about.

Lastly, before you go bashing big pharm for being so super evil, consider this: if not for the capitalism driven market and these huge drug companies that profit off of our illnesses, countless lifesaving drugs would never have been discovered and brought to our patients. I think it's more than fair for a company that spends several billion dollars in developing a single drug that may not ever  make it to market to profit handsomely from the ones that do. Big pharm has its problems, but without them, we would have never had hundreds of miracle drugs that we now use daily.","1193963689"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; There are certain rights that take a LOT to be able to say, ""yes, we can impede on that for the public good.""

free speech just got taken down a notch. Combine that with James Watson getting suppressed as well and people will think twice before voicing a minority opinion. 

Stopping criticism of the majority opinion was the goal and it has been achieved. It would be one thing for society to shun the WBC, but its another to utilize the government to suppress them.

&gt; Free speech stops when you impede on another's free speech. When you interrupt a person's mourning with bullshit like this

they were outside the church and it was likely impossible to hear the protest at all from the church doors. It was the mere thought that the protest was occurring that was the only interruption and nothing physical. This makes it a thought crime.

&gt; I am liberal. I am pro-gay rights, pro-choice, anti-war. 

I doubt you care of my opinion, but you're not as liberal as you may think.

You've basically collected a bunch of opinions and want these opinions put into law. It's just as intolerant as a conservative position, you just have slightly different slogans.

Its like you stand behind the color blue and the conservatives stand behind the color red. Neither side wants to allow the color green or yellow. This is not true liberalism where individual liberty is important, you're just another conservative group with a different name.

I don't blame you, individual liberty has been on a declining course for awhile. The WBC is just another step in restricting freedom.","1193963697"

It's at that point I start to fall asleep and if I'm not woken up by something I'll go right under &amp; sleep right through to the alarm. The half-lucid dreamy bit when I'm only half in control of what I'm imagining is pretty cool, and I look forward to it.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; Here is the fact: For decades Social Security has been collecting MUCH MORE $$ than it has been paying out. This money is saved in a ""trust fund."" This trust fund is large enough to cover any ""shortfall"" that occurs when the baby boomers retire.

Yes. And then congress raided that trust fund, put IOUs in it like a gambling-addicted father might put in his kids' piggybank, and the trust fund is all gone. No more. No one penny left.

&gt; So what is fair? Cutting old people's benefits to cover they money that was taken by the Republicans to give to the rich? Taking more from working people's paychecks to ocver what the Republicans took? Or taxing the rich to cover the money that was given to the rich? Which is fair?

I don't know, but it's sort of moot. If that were the only problem, we could manage.

The real trouble is that there are more people retiring than there are people being born who will grow up and pay into social security. That's why the missing money is so important... we can't just wait a few decades, and save up some new ""extra"".

&gt; And, most of all, how is this Social Security's problem? How is it Social Security's problem that the conservatives owe Social Security all that money?

Because the ""trust fund"" even if it were there, only delays the inevitable. Eventually so many are collecting, that there's not enough being paid in to pay back out. Also, what the fuck is wrong with someone that thinks ""social security"" is some anthropomorphic entity that deserves not to be blamed?

So clearly privacy is a moving target and isn't really a defined law. If the government or influential group of citizens previously wanted to censor protesters sitting on public land, people would say that it was public and no violation of privacy had occurred.

Now the line has moved in a more broader sense of privacy. In theory an animal testing laboratory could sue PETA for targeting them now.

The verses before it condemn incest, etc. The verse following it commands the Israelites not to have sexual relations with animals. Any reasonable person would admit that God is here outlining to Moses sexual practices which He finds unacceptable. A male 'lying down with a male' describes the homosexual relationship. There really isn't anything debatable about that.

You're right to say that the Bible is a complicated book. I think that's why a lot of people form opinions on it without really looking into it deeply to discern whether or not the things they are told are true. Homosexuality is becoming more and more acceptable in modern-day churches, and so I suppose this leads people to believe that there is some real basis for saying that homosexuality is acceptable to the God of the Bible.

These companies are getting richer and bolder as they take avantage of us poor slobs who just want the freedom of our cell phone communication. The rest of the world has it, so why can't we? Living abroad I paid for my cell phone number and got my sim card and then bought minutes to add to my phone. I paid less then 1 1/2 cents per minute for local calls and only 4 cents per minute for calls to America. Text messages were a fraction of a penny and Quest charges me 5 cents per text messages here. As a person who uses the cell phone less than an hour a month, it was cheap and convenient in that affluent foriegn country--my monthly bill was less than $10 per month even with long distance calls to America each month. I had an upper range Nokia purchased for less than $100.
  Everyone I speak with (except the manager at Qwest) agrees the system here in America is corrupt and problematic but is there any movement to change things?  If so, what and where and how do we get some deregulation on the table and a true free market back in this country, at least for the cell phone industry? ","1193964993"

"reddit.com","t5_6","But the plane *will* accelerate. You seem to be confusing thrust and lift; they are two quite distinct quantities. 

Here's how a plane works:

1. The engines emit hot gas at however many newtons backwards, so the engines (and the plane attached to them) will experience a force of that number of newtons forwards. 

2. Acceleration is a function of force, so the plane will accelerate. 

3. Velocity is the integral of acceleration with time (not distance), so the plane will gather speed relative to the air.

4. 'Wind' (really stationary air, but it appears the same as wind from the aircraft's frame of reference) passes over the wings; this generates lift. Lift is an upwards force on the aircraft, acting in opposition to the force due to gravity; the magnitude of this force is a function of the forwards velocity of the wing through the air.

5. Eventually a velocity is attained such that F\_lift = -F\_gravity, and any further increase in forwards velocity will be accompanied by upwards acceleration.

Your confusion seems to stem from the assumption that the treadmill will somehow 'drag' the plane backwards with an equal force to that produced by its engines. Assuming the wheels are free to rotate, however, this isn't the case. In fact, the rotational motion of the wheels will simply 'mate' to the rotational motion of the treadmill; the wheels/treadmill system will simply act like a set of freely rotating gears. The motion of the ground, be it tarmac or a treadmill, is of absolutely no consequence to the operation of a plane.

Edit: As for your question about whether the engines are on: what do you imagine would be the ""mystery"" in discussing whether a plane with no engines will fly? *Of course* the engines are on, and operating at takeoff thrust.","1193965648"

Your not a pharmecutical researcher or executive so don't flap your wings claiming you know how they are run.  And don't label things like this conspiracy theory, that terms is just thrown around everywhere these days to discredit any notion that you might be getting lied to.  Do you really think that every peice of information large research companies and the government come across is disclosed to you? Pull your head out of the sand.  These companies have technologies and treatments decades ahead of what is out now.  Just because you want to walk around beleive your told the truth about everything doesn't mean you are justified in labelling everyone who disagrees a conspiracy theorist.  It's not like I'm claiming we never went to the moon or anything, that is stupid and it's the category your putting me in.

And no, a capitalist market is not the reason all these drugs exist.  In a state-run pharmecutical system there would be no need for the profit-generating aspect of the industry and it would be focused purely on finding preventions, treatments, but more importantly cures.

Give America another moderate and you have another Kerry.  Yes we hate Bush but do they hate his legacy enough to bother voting for more of the same, which is what a good deal of the nonvoting public will view her as not to mention the actual left that will leave her side in droves.  I am on the left and I will never vote for Hillary which is the only person on the left I can say that about.  I will vote Dem or RP but if Hillary gets the nod me and many others I suspect will vote third party.  Give the country just one left of center candidate one time and see what happens.

"reddit.com","t5_6","My head is spinning now. I am still confused as to how the plane will generate lift in order to get it to fly. It seems it would be highly dependant to the type of plane and the location of the engines or propellers. If it is a prop plane with the prop on the nose, I can see how the air pushed by the prop can generate lift as it passes over and under the wing. But, if it is a jet, specifically one with a single engine located high on the tail, it would seem that at takeoff speed on the conveyor belt, it would not be generating sufficient lift to actually get the plane off the ground. The airspeed would be generated above the plane and the wings, therefor generating little or no lift. Airspeed required to takeoff is dependent on that air going over and under the wing, and a tail mounted engine would generate that airspeed too high above the plane to actually provide that lift. Am I crazy thinking this? Somebody explain to me how a jet gets any lift (when placed in this scenario) when the engine is located above the fuselage on the tail.","1193967140"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Not really I have seen families of 4 use as much as these southern singles who are all about image and career and sucking the HOAs ass use about 200 gals/day! 

I have seen a friend in cary,nc who was like that's water bill and it said average daily consumption-452/Gals/day. He had a newborn baby and a wife and one dog. They showered every other day and the baby got a bath 2 times a week. The mom took 1.2 hour showers and the hubby took 20 min. showers and they would bathe thier dog every other day. Dishes were done 2 times a day and clothes 3 times a week. 

 My family of 8 uses 170/day when only one showers that day and when 3 of them shower (they have a schedule for showers to reduce consumption as well as to decrease their bill thye are not on a flat rate bill like most people they are actually metered in full.) when they have to they use at most 230 and this only happens once a month. they have it like this so only one person showers a day and they have scheduled dish and clothes days. 

I think all families need to schedule major water use days and offset it and even the usage out and limit shower times and get more efficient shower heads with better pressure and less usage, replace appliances with more efficient ones. if they would do this like my family does Atlanta would have alot less problems with water as well as any other area. 

They also need to install recycling systems in their homes to reuse sink and shower water for flushing toilets and other measures.

Showering every day is not necessary for most people. In fact it is detrimental to your health as it washes too much good bacteria away and the chlorine is eating away your skin and if you expose it to too much chlorine every day your skin will age faster and be prone to sunburns more and other problems.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I see where you're coming from. But for my part, I think the modern idea of progress is a sham. I've studied enough about traditional and indigenous cultures to recognize that a great many of them lived with not merely ideals, but functional standards of social decency and reverence for life that far outstrip what our founders had in mind. 

Technological innovation gave a convincing illusion of *progress* for awhile. But it appears that we are now on the brink of catastrophe because of it. As fas a getting along is concerned, our progress has been paltry, if there has indeed been any -- which I tend to doubt (we still have plenty of slavery, it's just been outsourced to what amount to foreign serfs). And when modern people are producing endless waste that is thrown into the air, the waters and the soil, *liberty* for its own sake loses all its lustre. I don't think we have higher standards at all, nor I do think we've really made progress. 

I mean, the natives of North America knew how to live well, and likely with much more happiness and meaning, without all the excessive, resource depleting and polluting junk that we've complicated our lives with.

Fascism is simply a form of government which considers individual interests and freedoms to be subordinate to the interests of the state (check wikipedia) - and a fascist state could arise out of ANY strongly statist belief system.

That could be a communist system, a socialist system or theocratic system. As long as individual rights are trampled upon, fascism can arise. The only form of government that is, by definition, opposite to fascism is libertarianism.

When a fascist, all-controlling state emerges, everyone associated with it will be powerful. This could be people, businesses and whatnot. Such an ignorant screed is modded up by so many people here.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I understand that but it does not apply in this scenario. Assuming in this scanario the plane is moving at 0 MPH relative to the ground but the engine on the tail is generating an airspeed of 150 MPH (sufficient to fly), due to the engines placement, very little of that airspeed would be seen on or around the wing. Planes are incapable of taking off without sufficient airspeed over the wing no matter how fast the engines are moving. If this airspeed is generated above the plane, the lift is relatively zero. While the engines provide thrust to move the plane forward, the forward movement must generate airspeed over the wing. In my scenario, there would be none, even if the planes airspeed at the engine is twice the speed needed for takeoff. There would be one hell of a wind tunnel above the plane in front of the tail engine but little of that would be converted to lift as it fails to pass under/over the wing.

The lack of the ability to easily discern someone's motivation shouldn't invalidate the role of that motivation, though.

&gt;Without waxing too philosophically, I would contend that who someone is is inextricable from what they do.

True, but the motivations for their actions have to be considered, as well.  Otherwise, the man who accidentally discharges a firearm while cleaning it and kills someone is no different from the man who purposefully murders another person.

&gt;I mean what if someone dated gay, had gay sex, never dated women, and still alleged heterosexuality, would that be accurate?

It's highly unlikely, since carrying on a long-term relationship is much less likely to be done for reasons other than attraction.  However, what if you found out that the man was blackmailed, and that someone would kill his brother if he didn't engage in those activities?  Would you still consider him gay, or would you consider him a straight man acting under duress?

My point is that motivation is paramount when sexual orientation is involved.  The act itself does not always imply homosexuality.  It strongly indicates it, but in light of adequate motivational forces other than homosexual attraction, it is reasonable to consider the person to be straight.","1193968765"

People who believe the plane will take off might as well believe that if I am running as fast as I can on a treadmill, when I jump I'll fly forward as if I wasn't on the tread mill.  But I won't.  I'll go up, but not forward.  The plane is on a conveyor belt in a treadmill fashion (it's not a conveyor belt carrying the plane forward at take-off speed -- which may work, with the caveat that they also add more speed to account for the air-resistence of the engines when they're not turned off and forcing air through themselves).

Yes, the plane will be turning potential energy into kinetic energy and using up fuel.  But like a person running on a treadmill can't make a long jump forward off of it without a sudden burst of additional energy, the plane cannot suddenly extradite itself from this system as if it weren't in it in the first place.  I think perhaps some here are expecting the engines can overtake a conveyor belt carrying it backwards at takeoff speed, but that would imply the engines can take the plane forward on normal ground at 2x takeoff speed.

Um, only if you're writing things in Forth or something. Under strict evaluation, if you have:

x is first evaluated, then h(x), then g(h(x) and finally f(g(h(x))). That's sort of the opposite order to how it's written.

Even if your conspiracy theory (and it is *exactly that*, you hypothesise on the dealings of a conspiracy) regarding these companies' agreements with each other not to release treatment X made any sense whatsoever in the capitalist marketplace, they'd have no way to stop treatment X being developed and put into use elsewhere. Why aren't polio clinics in Africa using Royal's technique? Why aren't Indian peasants lining up outside the Royal Clinic for a burst of anti-TB royal radiation? Why aren't those evil anti-IP Chinese building cheap DIY home-Royalling kits, with open-source tables of illnesses and their appropriate treatment showing up on the internet? As you say, it has been decades: if Royal's claims were true, why hasn't any of this come to pass? 

The first oil company who brings a reliable, efficient, effective non-oil power source to the table will make billions upon billions of dollars. They'll gut the competition, and be free to operate a near-monopoly until the patent runs out, which will be a damn sight longer than current oil reserves will hold out for. If Glaxo had a heart attack vaccine, they'd roll it out, their stock would spike a hundred percent, their directors would share high-fives and raises, and the conspiracy be damned. 

Corporations are not driven by long-term goals and secret backroom agreements. Corporations live quarter to quarter, enslaved to their stockholders and their constant demands of accelerating profits; indeed, this has been fingered as a factor in the rise of the finance industry and a lot of the other troubling facets of modern western economy. Corporations maximise on the short term, even if they know it will cause problems in the long term; for examples, look at every fossil-fueled industry sector.

But I don't think counting is a lot like rating.   Here's another example I concocted: no critic I've ever seen considers one star to be the worst possible.  Everyone (I know) goes from 0 to 4, 5, 10, or whatever.

We may not often rate with zero, but it's not uncommon to hear ""nothing"", ""no worth"", or ""no value"".

In fact, that raises the best point yet: If we ask anoncoward101 ""What number corresponds to no swarm at all?"", doesn't ""one out of ten"" seem like a terrible counterintuitive answer?  No [something] just lends itself naturally to zero.

edit: And consider this!  What's twice as good as 2/10?  Of course it should be 4/10, but in a 1-to-10 system the answer is 3/10.  Chew on that.

A good thought experiment to reveal this is to ask yourself what you would do if you had two candidates for a job, the demands of which required character traits that you normally associate with one gender, and the *only* thing you know about each candidate was the gender.  Most people would correctly give the job to the candidate of the 'proper' gender, and I suspect that those who would just flip a coin are being insincere.

This aggregate difference, though, which would produce a probability of affecting the characteristics of one member of a gender, is irrelevant in this case.  In fact, what we have here is the complete opposite of the thought experiment I posed.  For what other job is a candidate more thoroughly scrutinized than President of the United States?

You may believe, as I do, that the relative lack of female politicians is due more to psychological gender differences, such as the disparate desire for status and power, than it is to sexism.  However, I think that, when assessing an individual, these gender differences and stereotypes, though sometimes useful, become marginalized the more we know about that individual.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Fun thought experiment.  If the engines are off and the conveyor belt is on, do the wheels spin and the plane never moves?  This is the fundamental assumption you're making.  But I think this is wrong.  There is friction in the world, and the fact is a stationary plane, engines off, sitting on a conveyor belt, will simply be carried backwards.

If the belt is turned on slowly so that it doesn't spin the wheels and just carries the plane, then the experiment will go exactly as I have described.  If the belt goes full speed all at once and jerks the wheels into motion, before the experiment begins, then perhaps the plane has a chance of a slow take-off.

But how do you see the experiment starting?  Will the engines be on before the plane is lowered onto the conveyor belt?  Will the plane be started after being stationary on a belt that's off?  Or will the plane be started after being carried backwards on the belt already?

Part two: When the engines are on, does the intake of those engines alone account for the hydrofoil effect?  If so, then the plane may take off.  But again, I do not think they do.","1193970219"
"reddit.com","t5_6","You can look through my history here and see that when I'm not yammering about politics or promoting myself, I'm usually defending Windows Vista. I bought a laptop this past March that came with Vista pre-loaded and aside from some hiccups in the first month, the thing has been dynamite for me. Never hung up, never crashed, and shortly after I bought it I had zero compatibility issues.

I'm currently writing this in Ubuntu's text editor. I got Gutsy, installed it, and after a day to figure out how to get software running and add Wine, I've used it exclusively for the past week. Give me some more time to feel around, and I'm willing to bet I'll convert over 100%.

Why did I make the switch? Did Vista suddenly crap out on me? I previously said it never crashed and had no problems, so why would I change OS's considering I had no problems?

Friends have been telling me to try Linux for forever. I've tried many distros, but at the time, the available help was neither particularly helpful nor readily available. So I stuck with Windows. I'd have gotten a Mac, but didn't have $1200+ to spring on a low-low-low end notebook.

Things are different now, though. It's a hell of a lot easier to find step by step guides to do pretty much everything if you're a Linux newbie, and you can easily find a Live CD to give 'er a shot. Then, as long as you can get your internet connection running, it's no problem at all to get help to get everything else going.

People act as though Vista is such a terrible product that it killed Microsoft. Maybe some of the extreme techie folks think so, but most end users see little difference and just like Vista's bells and whistles. If releasing a buggy OS was enough to kill Microsoft, Windows ME would have annihilated the company 7 years ago.

So why did Windows survive as the leader back then? Because the only option was the ""hardly works with anything"" Apple OSX or Linux at a time when you wer pretty much on your own to figure it out.

There was no mass exodus from Windows to Apple or Linux in the ME days. Everyone I knew simply downgraded to 98SE, and keep in mind they HAD to do that because ME was so buggy it could render your computer completely worthless. Vista has problems, but it's light years beyond the near-unusable Millenium Edition.

What's changed is that the alternatives have become easier to use and easier to switch to. I still maintain that Vista is a far better OS than it gets credit for and I prefer using it over XP. However, I've been able to putz around with Linux for the first time in three years without either formatting my hard drive or sitting there looking at a desktop with the wrong aspect ratio playing with GIMP because it can't detect my network card and without an internet connection I can't get any help.

Vista isn't the death knell of Microsoft. Hell, I don't think MS is going to die at all. However, it's going to drop a fair bit not because Vista killed it, but because the alternatives stepped up their game and are easier for most people to use than they used to be. There's a lot more software for Macs, and Linux users can use Wine to get all of the software they're used to.

What we're seeing now is the emergence of competition over monopoly. I chose Ubuntu because it was the first one that worked, and frankly it's fun wiggling windows around and watching them wobble. It wasn't because Vista was so bad I got turned away, I keep it in dual-boot mode (though I need to change my partitions to give Ubuntu more room...), I just like Ubuntu better, and it wasn't until now that I was able to try it out.

That's the difference.","1193970226"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt;I interviewed someone that had been using Java for 3 years and he'd never heard of the modulo operator.

Not long ago, I was in a fourth-year CS class where part of an assignment was to write a simple emulator in C for a machine the prof had defined. Part of that, of course, is ""take this two-byte instruction, the first four bits are the operation, etc..."".

Nothing complicated.  A couple of &gt;&gt;'s and some &amp;'s. Last semester of the degree - we can handle it. :p

The day comes in to hand in the assignment, and a friend of mine in the class starts complaining about all the pain-in-the-ass bit manipulation.

Me: ""What's the big deal? Shift? And?""

Turns out my friend here had somehow managed to go through four years of computer science without learning about bitwise operations. wtf? Rather than shift right, for example, he'd just divide by 2. His code worked - it was just ugly and verbose.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Even by my more than liberal definition of spam, what the Paul supporters have done is not spam. Take this site for example... they're overzealous, and they submit articles and comments. The comments are particularly telling, I've yet to see examples of the ""cut and paste"" comments in support of Paul, though plenty of those against him (I'm looking at you dkj).

The stupid ""cute kittens/weird pictures/whatever"" article submissions aren't spam either, even if there are more of them than most of us would like.

&gt; Flooding internet polls

Any halfwit IT/web-design department has had these fixed since '98. Only one vote per IP. I don't believe that it's anyone's moral duty to make sure that the other side gets proportional votes in a poll. If there are more Paul voters than say, Giuliani, they shouldn't throttle themselves back so that they're more or less equal. Besides, how could they?

&gt; flooding reddit and digg

The last 3 days, there has been maybe one story about Paul on the frontpage per day. Maybe two. No more. That's hardly a flood.

&gt; flooding forums

Which forums? If you mean the comments section of blogs, that's what it's there for.

Again, I don't think that a person who wants to voice their political opinion in an area created just for that purpose should have to step back a moment and say ""Hey, wait a moment, there are more people agreeing with me than there are disagreeing, I should shut up"". If you believe that they should, I'd be interested in seeing you make a case.

&gt; For one or two Paulites to say, ""hey, I know how to run a botnet, and I need to get the message out about ron paul"" is not unlikely.

Without the followup of ""Because he's a great guy, honest and principled, and he should win because he's the best candidate"" ?

Or maybe a ""despite the fact that spam doesn't work"" ?

But more damaging to this theory is that it's not 1995 anymore. We're not talking some wannabe hacker who's rooted 30 machines... it takes much more effort than that. It takes resources. If any idiot was doing spam, we'd have beat the problem by now. I don't suppose it's fair to assume everyone understands... but if you were to start spamming from a consumer account, you'd be flagged before you could send out even a few hundred emails.

The large (and the relatively small) botnets
are ran by those who treat it as a (criminal) business. They're good at what they do, if such a thing could be said. They spam their own stuff, but just as often hire out their systems to others for a fee. I don't suppose that they'd warn some idiot supporter that it wouldn't help, but neither would they do so for anything less than a significant chunk of cash.

And there aren't so many retards that have a few grand to dump on something like this. It's not something they could do on the spur of the moment either... they'd have to be stupid enough to have plenty of time to do it and still go through with it. And, though the naysayers will love this, Ron Paul supporters would have to be far stupider than others (and yet still have lots of spare cash), because we're only seeing this with his, and not Giuliani's or Romney's supporters.

If you let your dislike of Paul cloud your judgement and/or you don't understand how spam works, I suppose you can believe it was his supporters. The rest of us know that someone did it to bitchslap his campaign.

&gt;The first oil company who brings a reliable, efficient, effective non-oil power source to the table will make billions upon billions of dollars

You do know what OPEC is right? They are basically a cartel and are constantly under pressure from various organizations to limit their cartel type behaviour such as unfairly determining price.  So yes, in this case there is a group of shadowy figures that dictate the industry.  I seriously doubt one of the members would happily screw the others and get away with it.  OPEC controls the oil market and the price per barrell, that is a fact.

Maybe in finance industries and similar types living quarter to quarter is the most efficent business model, it explains America's wonderful current economic situation.  But industries that rely on research and development need to look towards more long-term business models.  For a pharmecutical company releasing a cure for something like diabetes, which requires daily medication, would yes cause their profits to soar in the short-term.  But over mnay years they would lose millions of dollars in revenue they are no longer getting.  The men on the boards for these companies aren't stupid, they realise this. You say they are enslaved to their stock-holders and that is not untrue, but releasing small advances still rakes in profits and is more then sufficent to keep stockholders and themselves more then happy.  It is naive to think as you do.

You obviously believe everything is disclosed to you and there are no secrets kept from the public.  You said think rationally, how is a company choosing large long-term profits over one big score irrational?  Skeptics like you just label anyone who calls 'bullshit' a conspiracy theorist, a crazy nut that sits in their basement with a foil hat on.  Here's a good example, what about back before the war, when 'conspiracy theorists' were saying there was no WMD's in Iraq and it was an unjustified invasion.  Now do they appear stupid? No. While there are extreme nuts like Hollow Earth people etc. that make questioning things look bad, most people you call conspiracy theorists just look rationally at a situation and come to the conclusion that something isn't right or doesn't fit.

        ticks++;
    }
    void delay(int ms) {

Back then we asked ourselves what we'd be willing to put up with to have a non-communist Saudi Arabia, and this is the answer we (the Saudis &amp; the US) came up with.  

I think it's totally fair to be ""in bed with them"" yet still criticize and demand that they respect human rights and democracy.  We should choose this option over all others.  After all, we'd still be just as ""in bed with them"" if they respected human rights and democracy.  

Why does America have to do with less because we expect others to behave correctly?  You seem to think that America can do anything it wants, but the truth of the matter is that the Saudis themselves are responsible for their own behavior.  It's not America's job to bring American-style democracy everywhere.  In fact, it's a pretty dumb idea as we're seeing right now in Iraq.

The whole world cries and moans that America should come and save them from their repressive governments.  But as soon as we do that, everyone starts killing each other - usually over some long-suppressed ethnic or religious hatred.  Do you have any idea how bizarre this kind of reaction looks to Americans?  I mean... we just look at each other and wonder ""What the fuck is wrong with these people?!""

Even the Kurds!  The Kurds are the only happy story to come from Iraq, but look what's happening now - they're busy trying to get killed by the Turks!  Why?  **WHY?**  Why is it so hard for these people to enjoy peace and embrace their chance for prosperity?

This is the kind of thing that makes us nervous about Pakistan.  What the hell is going to happen when Musharraf loses power and they have free elections?  I've got a funny feeling that people are going to plunge Pakistan into either a long-festering civil-religious war, or... (and this will be completely horrible) a war with India (with the possibility of a nuclear exchange)!!

Crazy!

By the way, I don't know why you grouped secularism &amp; decadence with indifference to human rights.  There's nothing wrong with secularism.  In fact, the whole world could use a lot more secularism.  People doing evil things to each other over money is better than if they're doing it for ""God.""  Because at least you can get the evil to stop if you cut off the money, but with religious people, you just can't get them to stop for any reason whatsoever.  

And decadence?  What exactly is wrong with that?  American has one of the largest middle-classes in the world, but we still love our rich celebrities.  It's just good-natured fun.  Besides, the free-rider problem is a very real one.

http://www.ronpaul2008.com/articles/239/religious-liberty-thwarted-by-the-supreme-court/

From that article:

&gt;Moreover, there is ample evidence that most of our Founders were deeply religious men who never imagined a rigid separation between religious beliefs and governance. Indeed, our national documents, symbols, currency, and buildings are replete with religious symbolism. Our national motto, ""In God We Trust,"" is an obvious example. These symbols are entirely inconsistent with the religion-free government supposedly mandated by the First amendment.

My complaints:

1.  Most of the Founding Fathers were not ""deeply religious,"" but deists who generally questioned religion.  Jefferson, for example, took all the supernatural crap out of the Gospels to make a more rational text, and said that Revelation was no more coherent than the average person's dreams.

2.  The Founding Fathers were advocates of separation of church and state, particularly Madison and Jefferson.  (See Wikipedia's article on separation of church and state.)  Ron Paul is making the same unsupportable claims that the Religious Right tends to make.

3.  ""In God We Trust"" was not the motto the Founding Fathers chose, as Ron Paul implies.  It was put on coins for the first time in 1864, but not used on all U.S. coins until 1938.

&gt;The sad result of this misinterpretation of the Constitution is a legal and political landscape which is unnecessarily hostile to religion. Popular culture and media mirror this hostility in their inaccurate and unflattering portrayals of religious conservatives and fundamentalists. The message is always the same: conservatives want to force their religious beliefs upon society. The truth is that secular humanists have forced their beliefs upon a largely religious nation. In schools, in government, and in the courts, secular values dominate. Secularism, wrongly characterized as neutral toward religious faith, has become the default philosophy for our society. The Supreme Court, by refusing to consider the Elkhart case, has furthered the cause of those who wish to see religion eliminated from American life.

Americans are overwhelmingly pro-religion.  (Remember the poll that found that Americans trusted atheists the least?)  I don't see how secular humanism is being forced on anyone, unless Ron Paul is complaining about students not being able to pray in public schools.  Here's a hint, Ronnie:  Kids can pray in public schools, and there is no law saying that they can't.

And then there's this article:

http://www.ronpaul2008.com/articles/87/statement-of-faith/

&gt;I have never been one who is comfortable talking about my faith in the political arena. In fact, the pandering that typically occurs in the election season I find to be distasteful. But for those who have asked, I freely confess that Jesus Christ is my personal Savior, and that I seek His guidance in all that I do. I know, as you do, that our freedoms come not from man, but from God.

Did you catch that?  ""I know, as you do...""  He automatically assumes that anyone reading the article or considering supporting him believes in a higher power.  I have the feeling that most people here do not.

Ron Paul, despite his reasonable views on Iraq, the war on drugs, and gun control, is basically a theocratic nutcase who does not believe there should be separation between government and religion.","1193971882"

An airplane's engine, sometimes combined with a propeller, pushes or pulls it through the air. The wheels are there to hold the body (and/or propeller) up in the air until it gets going fast enough so that the air holds it up (simplified explanation).

Like the front wheel of a bicycle, the wheels of an airplane will rotate with little friction on the treadmill, so the treadmill will have little effect on the plane's ability to take off. If its speed is regulated to be as fast as the plane's speed through the air, but in the opposite direction, then the wheels will experience exactly twice the rotation that they would on a normal runway.

OK.  A plane can be going through the air and the pilot's like, ""hey check this out"" to his copilot and he take sthe plane down and ""lands"" on a conveyor belt.  Only all he does is go along and the wheels spin hilariously fast and make a whining noise as they're not built for that.  He can lift up again with no problem.

Or can he?  What I keep imagining is that when the pilot does this, it'll feel as rough as a normal landing, if not worse, because all though the wheels will spin and reduce friction fighting the plane's forward momentum, at first they will skid and the plane will experience a jerk.

So I guess epicrdr is right in that the kind of plane matters the most here.  Can it generate *that* much thrust?","1193972580"

A treadmill is incapable of holding a plane in place. The wheels of an airplane freewheel, they are not driven. So the treadmill can turn the wheels all it wants, but this will have very little effect on the forward motion of the plane because they have so little friction while freewheeling.

The concept is still the same. We need to restrict people at certain times to certain places. 

So if someone important comes to town, to protect everyone (protesters and dignitary) from getting hurt, the protesters are required to do their protesting in a specific area. Outside this area the protesters are subject to fines and/or arrest.

Of course when the dignitary has left the area, then everyone is allowed to protest outside this zone if they really wish to.

""Every country has the government it deserves"". 

Mind you, I'm not letting Bush/Cheney off the hook. Their combination of incompetence, malevolence and ideological blindness is truly staggering.

Still, I think the main cause for the state of America is us - the American people - and the culture of anti-intellectualism that we've embraced. The idea that we can blissfully live as a peaceful and prosperous  superpower while not spending a single brain cell on any deep issues is simply not tenable.

It does not even have to be actual force, but the threat of using force.

The force of rolling resistance is given by F = CFn, where C is around 0.01 for an airplane tire on a runway, and Fn is the normal force or the weight of the airplane.

So if a small plane masses about 500 kg, it will weigh about 5000 N and then its wheels will have about 50 N of rolling resistance. I'm having a hard time finding any figures for thrust of typical airplane engines, but I did find that the first jet engine generated 4000 N of thrust, quite a lot more than needed to overcome rolling resistance.

When it comes to configuring your build, Portage gives you more flexibility than traditional Ports systems due to the USE flags and structure of the ebuilds (they still use ebuilds, right? I haven't looked at Gentoo in ages. :3 )

In BSD Ports, each port and all of its dependencies by default will show you a config dialog where you choose which options you want or not.  You can do recusive configs or script the creation of the config options yourself, but it doesn't quite compare.

[Wipe Israel 'off the map' Iranian says](http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/26/news/iran.php)

&gt;TEHRAN: Iran's conservative new president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said Wednesdaythat Israel must be ""wiped off the map"" and that attacks by Palestinians would destroy it, the ISNA press agency reported.

&gt;Ahmadinejad was speaking to an audience of about 4,000 students at a program called ""The World Without Zionism,"" in preparation for an annual anti-Israel demonstration on the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan.

&gt;His tone was reminiscent of that of the early days of Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979. Iran and Israel have been bitter enemies since then, and anti-Israel slogans have been common at rallies.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Sure, but the question of interest in this case is, ""Does the document conform to the schema/DTD?"" And this question is decidable, even for Turing-complete programs.

No. That's one of an infinite set of questions that one wants to ask of an XML document. Equally interesting ones include: ""What is the first element in this document?"", ""What is the last element in this document?"", ""Does this document contain a &lt;title&gt; element?"", ""How many &lt;link&gt; elements does it contain?"", ""How many instances of the letter Q does it contain?""

I can answer any of those questions in constant space and O(N) time using XML as it is today (as long as I tell my parser to reject documents with entities, which is typical). XML's simple structure allows this, even on very small devices.

&gt; Besides, I didn't say XML needed to be Turing-complete. There are many languages which perform computation which are not Turing-complete.

Yes, I noticed that there is more that you didn't say than that you did. That makes it hard to have a meaningful discussion. You can disclaim any particular proposal as different than what you were thinking of, whereas XML has the unfortunate responsibility of actually existing and therefore being concrete. Why _don't_ you say what level of computation you are actually proposing?

In inferred Turing complete because you said that the lambda calculus and Javascript were two examples of what XML should have implemented.

&gt; &gt; Yes, the XML family of standards is layered so that different applications can choose the appropriate set to implement.

&gt; My point is not the layering. My point is that it is precisely because XML does not include any mechanism for computation that the other standards (like XSLT) became necessary.

Yes! By design! Because XML is not a programming language and we already have enough of those. Can we pull back from hypothetical land into the real world? XSLT is a Turing-complete language. For XML itself to obviate the need for a Turing-complete companion, XML would need to become Turing-complete. Is that your proposal? (I'm still waiting for a proposal and not just a rant)

There is nothing shameful about one standard giving rise to another. Every programming language chooses to leave things out and have them be expressed in a library instead. Every object model chooses a level of abstraction and pushes other abstractions into layers above or below. Since you haven't specified what you want to change about XML I can't tell whether it would add a tiny bit to XML's complexity or a massive amount.

&gt; So your insistence that XML being programmable would make it useless is already refuted by the mere existence of other Recommendations seeking to address that problem.

That statement is totally illogical. Making XML programmable would make it useless for SOME purposes. There are SOME uses of XML that specifically choose not to implement XSLT because they don't need its power and don't want its cost. Increasing the implementation cost of XML might very well make it useless for some purposes. It is demonstrably easy to add a computational layer on top and you have not yet supplied an argument of why that layer needs to be embedded into XML itself. XML's a la carte nature is part of what has made it so successful.

"programming","t5_2fwo","(continued)

&gt; &gt; Isn't Lisp layered? Does every Lisp variant ship with the exact same set of libraries?

&gt; Sorry, but I am not a Lisp apologist. 

Well we are discussing this in the context of a comparison to S-expressions. Given that you haven't actually made a positive proposal, I'm left grasping at straws.

&gt; &gt; Oh really? Can you please point me to the RFC for this cross platform ""lambda calculus?"" How are integers encoded? What is its character set?

&gt; You see? This is the problem! No, there is no RFC for lambda-calculus. But there is tons of information about it in the mathematics and computer science literature. But because the XML creators are so ignorant and blinkered, they had no idea.

I didn't say that I do not know about the lambda calculus. I do. And I know for a fact that many of the editors of the XML specification know about it because I've discussed it with them (at least in Scheme-form). What I professed ignorance about was not WHAT the lambda calculus is, but your assertion that it is ""portable and platform independent."" Those are not adjectives that make sense to apply to an mathematical abstraction. Anyhow, this conversation is a dead-end, because nobody ever said that computation was necessarily platform dependent. So you put up a straw man and knocked it over. It is *trivially obvious* that computation can be (and frequently is) platform independent.

&gt; A more robust mechanism would have been to allow variables which range over XML data and element type variables which range over XML element types. In XML you can't even define a polymorphic pair or polymorphic list.

XML is not a type system. XML is tags around data. I can imagine how it would be useful for *XML schema* to have a concept of a polymorphic list, but I can't imagine how it would be useful for *XML* to do so.

&gt; you cannot validate a document which performs some computation.

Validation is the least interesting of the computations that one does on XML documents. It is just the gateway that documents must pass through on the way to fulfilling their goals.

&gt; OK, you've got me there. I guess I should have written ...

Yes, in general, you should write with more accuracy and less bombast.

&gt; The problem, you see, is that two of the mobile/portable languages in question here, Javascript and DSSSL, are untyped, so the idea of static validation was far from their minds.

You are obsessed with validation. But it is precisely because every consumer of XML has a different set of queries in mind that it is hard to add ""computation"" without knowing whose queries will become more unpredictable in performance.

&gt; . Do you know there are web designers arguing about whether some XML vocabulary is ""semantic"" or not?

Given an appropriate definition for semantic, the debate makes sense. One can easily spend the rest of ones life arguing about such a thing (without any productive resolution), so I hesitate to start, but...a definition I like is that the semantics of a statement are the inferences licensed by the statement. Therefore the element &lt;important&gt; licenses the inferences that the contained text is important (whatever that means in the context) and might be presented to the user in bold. Whereas the element &lt;b&gt; licenses fewer inferences because all it says is that the element is bold, but not why. ""Semantic markup"" is therefore just markup designed to maximize the inferences that can be made based on the markup. Not inferences made by the computer. Inferences made by the programmer.

&gt; Consider XHTML. It has elements like ol and p. The semantics of these elements are given (roughly) by how they are rendered. For example, p is rendered as a paragraph.

You've started your example off the tracks and can only get further off the tracks as you proceed. Consider the element ""title"". There are thousands of ways to render that element. So the idea that its semantics are defined by how it is rendered is incorrect. Rather, the semantics exist in the fuzzy world of human beings and their brains. The word ""title"" is just a hint to humans to invoke the neurons in their brains that know what titles are.

Before we can proceed with mapping one element's semantics to another, we should establish the semantics of the base element, don't you think? So can you please produce the canonical specification for the semantics of ""title""?

Human beings will disagree on the mapping of any other element in the world to title. Some will say that the caption of a photo is the same as a title. Others will swear up and down that it is a different thing altogether. Some will say that the caption is a kind of paragraph. XSLT is one popular way that they can all express their local opinions without interfering with each other.

&gt; Now consider what I could do if XML had some means for computation, something like XSLT perhaps, but terminating. I could send the S-conforming document along with a mapping of S's para to XHTML's p.

If I am sending this mapping ""along with"" the document, then why does XML itself have to do the computation? Why can't it be an ancillary standard that implementors can choose to use or not. Actually, there are a variety of such standards and it is precisely because different people want different things from such a mapping them that the different standards exist. (examples include architectural forms, XML Schema inheritance, XSLT, DITA element inheritance, etc.)

&gt;  Now the meaning of para is the same as p, so I have defined its semantics unambiguously.

If ""para"" and ""p"" have exactly the same semantics, then there is no need to map them. Simply use ""p"". If you discover after the fact (after the message has been transmitted, for example) that ""para"" has the same semantics as ""p"" *in a particular computing context* then you need to communicate that fact outside of the XML somehow. So why not just do that in the general case? The XML doesn't have to change. The XML document doesn't have to privilege one interpretation of itself over others. The XML standard doesn't have to change.

&gt; The key point is that I can't do it without some means of computation, which XML lacks.

That is false for (at least!) two reasons.

First, if you want to just establish equivalence, you can do that with a statement that doesn't require any computation (as that term is typically used).

Second, if you DO want to do it by means of computation, then that computation can be transmitted along with or separate from the XML. The XML itself does not need computation.

The fact that this assertion is made a thousand times a day in any medium sized company belies your assertion that XML needs more computational capabilities to allow it.

In the programming language world, there is no consensus on the ""best"" type system. It would have been lunacy for XML to embed some specific type system and privilege it above all others. If you were to attempt such a thing, XML would never have come to fruition.

&gt; I know all about Mr. Clark and DSSSL and Jade and Scheme. 

Sorry, I was thrown off by a) your assertion that DSSSL can't change the order in which elements are rendered b) that the inventors of XML only knew C and C++ c) that the lambda calculus exists in the world of hardware and software platforms and d) that the inventors of XML didn't know anything about semantics (see Sperberg-McQueen's paper on semantics here[1]). i.e. you made so many provably wrong assertions and implications that I inferred that you didn't know what you were talking about. I guess that demonstrates how different ""agents"" can read the same ""document"" and draw different inferences based upon their context. Thank goodness we are free to do so...

Sorry, I'm out of time to waste here. You haven't succeeded in demonstrating that XML needs to embed (rather than reference or co-exist with) computation, but I feel free to try again.

On the other hand, if you want to do something productive instead of ranting on Reddit, you should take your ideas, define an actual alternative to XML, try it out in the real world and then promote it as a competitor to XML. XML isn't something handed down from the gods, but the end result of several decades of experimentation. Better stuff will come along. Several competitors to XML have gained ground over the last decade. So I'm glad that you're thinking about what could have been done better.

But all you are doing is hand waving about vaporware and insulting the people who actually did the hard work to make something useful. Nothing productive can come of that, I'm quite sure.

OPEC's influence has been on the wane. America's largest source of foreign oil, Canada, is not a member of OPEC. Mexico, our third largest source, is not a member of OPEC. Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil in the world and is not a member of OPEC.

OPEC still has significant influence, as they do represent a large bloc of oil exporters, but they no longer control the price of oil. They have far too much competition. In any case, even if every oil-producing country was a member of OPEC, cartels are by nature very fragile; if the price is fixed too high, the individual members begin to have an incentive to cheat.

The treadmill will only ever go backwards as fast as the plane is moving through the air. Rolling resistance of tires is pretty low, on the order of 50 N in a light aircraft, while the thrust provided by the engine(s) is in the thousands of Newtons. So there's more than enough thrust to overcome the rolling resistance of the wheels even if your double it with the treadmill.

Males are more likely than females to cross-dress for sexual arousal. Men are more likely to have sexual fetishes in general, because men have more eroto-sexual differentiation complexity. This means they are more likely to respond to visual images and tactile stimuli – such as wearing women’s clothing – as sexually arousing.

If the Central Bank introduces 14% new money over what is already in existence, then lets consider the effect on someone's initial 100,000 dollars which could buy 1 house. After that new money is introduced into the economy (via government lending or by the private banks), then that same 100,000 dollars can only buy 86% of the house. - The 14% of the wealth that has been taken away from those 100,000 dollars has appeared as new money in the Mint - a transfer of wealth from everyone holding US Dollars to the FEDERAL RESERVE (The US Central Bank) and the private banks that receive the newly issued fiat money, that lend it out as debt.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;What are the parallel factors with homosexuality? Is it attraction in daily life? Dating? An effeminate relationship with men in general?

It's the same thing that makes straight people straight.  You look at a beautiful woman, and maybe you'll wonder what she looks like naked.  Maybe you fantasize about holding her close.  You find your mind wandering back to her throughout the day, and you look forward to seeing her again.  You long to be with her.  Your heart skips a beat when you hear her voice.  You fall in love with her.  Or maybe you just lust after her.

Now, take all of that, and apply it to someone of the same sex, and that's what homosexuality is.  Homosexuality is having the exact same physiological and emotional response to someone of the same sex that the majority of the population has to the opposite sex.  It's a fundamental part of who you are, and not just the veneer of actions you perform sans the motivation behind them.

&gt;That is what I was getting at when I said there is nothing more absolutely homosexual than a homosexual act. 

I believe the opposite.  There's nothing more absolutely homosexual than a homosexual thought.  Actions can have many different motivations.  To use your example, giving head for crack doesn't make you gay.  However, fantasizing about giving a guy head, and getting aroused by the thought, *that* makes you gay.

&gt;There aren't outlying factors, this is a man asking for sex and desiring the sex-- and nothing else, how isn't that homosexual?

Perhaps he then closes his eyes and tries his damnedest to imagine that it's a woman doing the deed.  Getting a BJ from a man while fantasizing about a woman probably means you're straight.  Desperate, but straight.  Getting a BJ from a woman and fantasizing that it's a man makes you gay.","1193977481"

Anyone who is unfortunate enough to have *absolutely no other alternative* source of music to listen to than the radio (which I've not seen in a lonnnnnng time) is not likely to be dramatically impacted by lyrics to Springsteen's song.

On the other hand - a great amount of people unfortunately watch Fox News. Places where there may have only been a radio before - hospital waiting rooms, offices, etc., now usually feature a television.  More often than not it would seem to be on Fox.

There's a great many more people being influenced by Fox News than lyrics on the radio - it's trivial in comparison.

"reddit.com","t5_6","A live taping? Not a taped taping?","1193978473"
"reddit.com","t5_6","I gave up and googled around.  Here's my (quite possibly mistaken) understanding of the confusion and the solution.

By design, the engines will cause the plane to accelerate relative to the air, not to the ground like a car's engine does.  The *groundspeed* seems to be a rather minor factor in affecting the *airspeed* the plane can reach (the wheel friction is just not as significant as you might expect).

The plane will then be attempting to reach some airspeed, and the conveyor belt will be **attempting** to spin fast enough to keep the wheels from moving forward (relative to a stationary observer beside the treadmill); but the wheels are only limited by friction, whereas the treadmill is probably much more limited in how fast it can go.  

Since they're freewheeling, the wheels can rather *easily* spin twice as fast as they normally would; it's not going to greatly hamper the plane's accelerating *airspeed*. The plane will be puttering along happily at taxi speed while the wheels and treadmill both have to accelerate quite a bit; but the wheels don't have to put any effort into that acceleration, they just have to not fall off; and due to the limited contribution of friction (compared with the plane's thrust), the amount of thrust to hold the plane in place--or inch it forward--isn't going to be as much as you'd expect by watching the treadmill zooming past and wheels spinning madly.

It's conceivable that a treadmill capable of infinite speeds, would match ANY spinning of the wheels, so that the plane couldn't ever move forward, and the wheel bearings would finally burst into flames as the wheel approached light speed; but on a *real* treadmill, it's very likely that it will reach its limit long before the wheels reach the limit of how fast they can spin.  

And once the treadmill can no longer outpace the wheels, the airplane will have little difficulty gaining airspeed (with wheels spinning and smoking, but the airplane only approaching normal takeoff airspeed, without much more effort than it would have expended to reach that airspeed on a regular runway.. just a bit more wear and tear to the poor wheels).


**Edit:** it might be useful to picture a toy airplane which is sitting on teflon skis, on a teflon treadmill.  The friction between airplane and ground is absolutely minimal.  You've got a hand behind the airplane to hold it in place and keep it from moving backward, while the treadmill zooms underneath at furious speed, trying to move the plane backward against the stopping force of your hand.  

Think about how little force it would take to hold the teflon airplane stationary with your hand while the treadmill skims along under it.  And then how little extra force it would take to start inching it forward.  And if you actually got behind it and pushed, of course it would go forward.

It would still require energy on your part, but little compared to say pushing a weighted cardboard box along a regular floor.

I think that exaggerated visualization might help convey how the wheels can keep spinning at high speed, while the airplane uses a bit of force to move forward while largely disregarding the ground.","1193978479"

No, the real local level would be between a woman and her doctor. He's not in favor of that. And if you think he wants the state to make the decision, think again. 

He's proposed legislation in Congress that would define life as beginning at conception. Once that happens, if states continue to allow abortion, the feds will have an obligation to step in, just as they would for legalized honor killings and just as they do for medical marijuana. Even popular birth control methods like IUDs that prevent implantation would likely be prosecuted by the feds under civil rights laws, since a fertilized ovum = human being.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I've used vim for 6 years, maybe more.  I switched to emacs about a month ago and never looked back.

What prompted it was I was coding professionally and my productivity started to matter a lot more than when I was a student in college.  Computer science classes tended to give relatively short program assignments but were algorithm heavy.  I usually spent more time debugging and thinking than typing.

Another key thing is that school projects normally only involve a few files.  At the most one directory.  Code bases at software companies span millions of lines of code, tons of files, and directory hierarchies that start to make your shell prompt touch the edge of your screen.  Being able to get around many disparate files and switch around quickly is vital.  I eventually decided this wasn't possible (or I couldn't figure it out, more likely) to do in vim.  Thus my emacs-curious persuasion.  I also wanted debugger integration (with gdb and pdb).  When I went looking for plugins for vim I always came back disappointed.

As an editor, is emacs more powerful than vim?  I actually don't know.  I can't say I was able to master vim.  The problem is it's hard to find what you want to do.  The help is a pain to browse and you have to know exactly what you're looking for.

Emacs on the other hand has great help.  If you don't know the shortcut you start typing the function name which is usually easier to remember.  Then it'll tell you what key that function is bound to so you can use it next time.  It's much easier to poke and prod emacs and that is the way most people learn.

So how good of an editor vim is is really pointless.  With emacs being much more interactive you're able to learn the power that's there.  If you can't learn the features of an editor then you can't really call them features.

I started learning emacs about a month or so ago.  Switching hurt for at least a week.  I still use vim as a crutch sometimes when I want to browse directories and quickly look at files.  (I find I get into buffer hell in emacs when I start browsing through many directories and files).  If I spend more than a few seconds in a file in vim I start doing crazy things like hitting Ctrl-n and expecting the right thing to happen.  I then give up my broken crutches and open the file in emacs.

vim, I wish I could quit you. ^x^c","1193979542"

* Have a vsplit window where the contents of the page below are stored on the right, and the mousewheel tracks/updates the scrollbar as though they were all one page twice as long as normal. (It'd be extremely useful as most *nix code doesn't extend more than 80 chars, so there's lots of wasted screen real-estate in full-screen).
* Indent-based background shading which changes color as the indents become deeper. I haven't actually looked into the possibility of doing this with just a syntax file yet.

Every few months I'm motivated to spend another 5 hours reading the documention to find ways to implement them, but I've yet to encounter a way to actually do the above. Everyone in #vim either refers you to :vsplit/:scrollbind/etc (which aren't entirely helpful for anything after the initial split) for the split window, or your window manager for a full-screen mode. Despite reassurances that it *must* be possible, nobody I've spoken to has offered more advice than is offered in the documentation.

I mean, if Clinton says it wasn't an inside job, fucking hell, that settles it right there, and all truthers MUST be insane.

Believe what you want.  I personally don't think that 9/11 ""truthers"" are doing any harm to anyone, even the victims families, since a LARGE majority of them don't believe the official theories either.

The truth is, whatever happened on 9/11 has and will continue to cause this world to spiral down into absolute chaos and tyranny the likes that hasn't been seen in hundreds of years since the Great British Empire.  And every day we move closer to a world full of war, hatred, racism, greed and corruption and many ""truthers"" just want to spiral in the opposite direction, regardless of the real truth.

I don't even think BUSH himself, or anyone in his administration actually knows what really happened on 9/11.  Conspiracy?  I doubt it, Bush is really to stupid to be in on it.  But the official story is moldy swiss cheese, and truthers need to stop making up shit because they stink just as bad.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Everyone, please read this article. I cannot overemphasize this. For example, if meditation was taught in the educational system, violence and ignorance everywhere would ebb significantly within a generation. Do we want to remain egoistic all our life? We can help Man transcend himself: by doing it ourselves through the practice of meditation. 

From the article:
&gt;""You stop being always projected outside. You start looking in and seeing how your mind works, and you change your mind, thought by thought,"" explains Matthieu Ricard, a Buddhist monk, scientist and French interpreter for the Dalai Lama. ""The French intellectuals don't like this. They say, 'Let's be spontaneous; passions are the beauty of life.' They think that making an effort is not nice—a silly old discipline—and that's why we're such a mess. But many modern people understand the notion of getting fit with physical training."" So the idea of developing mental skills with meditation is gaining ground.

Training your body makes sense, all it takes is a bit of *discipline*. 

The majority's mind is fat and lazy. Meditation helps develop a better balance between mind and body. It trains the mind. We also need this kind of exercise to be healthy.

&gt;One Tibetan lama told Wallace that before training, his mind was like a stag with great antlers trying to make its way through a thick forest; the animal got snagged on branches time after time. But after many years of practice, his mind was more like a monkey in a jungle, swinging freely from vine to vine.

Dance monkey, dance.

Evolution of any animal takes place over generations and generations. But in one individual human, evolution of the mind can be dramatic in the span of only a few decades. Make the most of would you have left, fellow redditors.

edit: Damn, this article is fascinating. On the neuroscience of meditation:
&gt;Meditation becomes a kind of ""dashboard for your emotions,"" Wallace says. It enables you to check the gauges and objectively decide if you're about to overheat, so you're not caught by surprise when steam begins to rise from the engine. The ""engine,"" in this case, is what is often called the limbic system—or the emotional brain—which is connected to the prefrontal cortex. Through its actions on the prefrontal cortex, meditation can dampen affective arousal from a limbic system kicked into alarm mode by fear or anger.

Dance

&gt;""Mindfulness is a form of intrapersonal attunement,"" says UCLA's Seigel, which makes it the perfect tool for interpersonal attunement—in other words, compassion. ""The ability to see your own mind,"" Seigel notes, ""allows you to see others' minds.""
 

&gt;We are fundamentally interdependent with other people and our environment, says Ricard in his new book, Happiness. Each moment between birth and death, the body undergoes innumerable transformations, with the mind the theater of countless emotional and conceptual experiences. ""Experience"" is simply the content of mental flow. Yet we assign permanence, uniqueness and autonomy to the self. Such self-importance and ego-grasping form the root of suffering.
Meditators find that when they stop taking their own emotional upheavals so seriously, the self drops away. They process the world more directly. Absorption, a state similar to what is known as ""flow,"" increases. ""People are hungry for this kind of authentic experience,"" observes Kabat-Zinn.

 

""Awareness gives you your life back. You can then decide what to do with it.""

Also I'd like to add: What is your definition of ""liberating the markets""? Nobody (relatively) in this country is advocating the neglect of private property laws or state owned ""markets"". Those people are called socialists. It's quite wrong, and somewhat of a knee-jerk reaction, to assume that liberals are socialists.

I consider myself to be liberal and a firm believer in capitalism, but certainly not unrestrained capitalism. I know the importance of private property, and I also know and respect the kind of outcomes that the market can produce. But I *DO NOT* have blind faith in the free market. That's the problem with libertarianism, in my humble opinion and that's coming from someone who used to consider themselves a libertarian.","1193980893"

What does the government do to avoid running low on water?  The only thing I remember from Texas is silly measures such as only allowing lawn-watering on every other day.  Meanwhile, at every other time the price is artificially low, which doesn't just cause overconsumption that affects that community, but which also every other community in the watershed.  There are real, far-reaching, wasteful effects to artificially low water prices.

To be clear though, I'm of a mind to have a competitive market, which might require that the community cooperatively own its infrastructure (water pipes) who then allow different groups which owns rights to water allotments and who run water extraction and delivery to the town, to compete for service to that locality.

&gt; Also, this unpredictability would hurt people who are living paycheck to paycheck.

A Trillion dollar pipeline has been planned there for about 20 years.  Oil industries are still just getting started in human history...

"reddit.com","t5_6","Maybe I'm the lone voice of dissent here, but assuming it wasn't all planned (and I'd have to guess it was), I thought Angel came away looking like a tool.

Callahan doesn't really claim to be a psychic, his claim is that he's a medium.  He goes through a silly, melodramatic ritual with spooky music and he gets information from his dead author.  His paranormal gifts come and go according to the whims of said dead author, and it's not something he can turn on and off like a lightbulb.

So fine, that's his act.  If Angel has a problem with the stunt as performed, it's his job as judge to call him out.  How'd the guy guess the info about the car?  Did he cheat, if so how?

It just comes across like the Callahan pulls off his trick, impresses (I guess) the audience, and Angel turns into a petulant child, trying to change the rules of the game because someone else is getting all the attention.

Instead of doing his job as judge and critiquing the stunt or revealing how it was a fake, Angel relies on ambushing the guy to do a tangentially related trick.  It makes it look like he didn't have any real idea how to debunk it, but wanted to be a dickhead all the same.

What on earth is with you people comparing this to James Randi's work?  Randi is scientific, rigorous and *fair.*  He gives people enough rope to hang themselves.  This is silly dramatics, and Angel looks no more convincing than the ""paranormalist"" he is trying to debunk.

Even Carson, who most definitely ambushed Yuri Geller, at least criticized Geller on his own terms, according to the so-called magic he had just performed.

(Of course I still think all the drama was probably fake.)

"reddit.com","t5_6","This isn't a secret.  It's how our system works.  It keeps money in constant circulation and keeps inflation up so that you keep working.

One thing you fail to realize is that ""100,000 dollars"" that you hold (and that is being diminished by new capital issue) is *fiat money to begin with*.  The value of that 100k was determined when the Fed first issued it into the market.  To say that they are ""stealing"" it from you is grossly misrepresenting what is going on.  They are merely readjusting the value of their own currency in which you placed your faith to begin with!

In other words, the ""value"" of 100k yesterday is no less or more valid than the value of 100k today.

The system is equitable - if you believe that we should revert to a gold standard, *you could have put your money in gold*, and you would have been rewarded handsomely.  Your first mistake was *not putting your money where your mouth is*, and your second mistake was blaming the Fed for your own misjudgment.  These days you can even invest your money in a gold tracking ETF that is traded like any other common stock!

You, as a private citizen, can own stock in various entities that participate in this system, such as banks or other financial institutions like hedge funds and private equity funds.  This is how the ruling ""elites"" keep their wealth - in the market.  It isn't sitting in a bank in switzerland.

In fact: Fascism has fuck all to do with ""corporations"", and it never did. Fascism has to do with totalitarian nationalism. None of the ""classic"" fascist states enjoyed the support of corporations - usually they plundered them or took them over. They weren't big on ""traditional elites"" either. The concept of Nazi Germany was that it would be an anti-aristocratic worker's paradise - the main (almost only)  difference between Nazi fascism (national socialism) and Soviet Communism (international socialism) was the patriotic/nationalist nature of the Nazis (Germany for the Germans), as opposed to the avowed ""internationalist"" nature of Communism. This had became an issue during World War I, when Communists from opposing countries found themselves fighting their comrades.

I know, the money issued by the Federal Reserve has always been fiat money and is introduced into the economy as debt.  This is correct.  Why are you saying I'm failing to realize?  I haven't said anything contrary to this, - I am aware of the functioning of the system.

I didn't mention any ""stealing"", the closest thing I mentioned was a ""transfer of wealth from those holding US Dollars to the people who first receive the new bills as credit - the private banks"", which of course is the design of the Federal Reserve system, to maintain and accumulate more wealth for a relatively few wealthy families.

Who is saying Gold Standard?  I'm certainly not saying gold standard.  A gold standard would just limit the current system (which would just be less terrible for the middle and lower classes).  There are many alternative systems, ... Ludwig von Mises Institute ... Austrian Economics ... and others.

What I don't like about the current system, in simplified terms for this short space, is that newly introduced money is issued to banks as credit which then lend it out as debt.  That debt must be repaid from the economy plus interest causing continual competition and an expected rate of bankruptcy.  Either way, there is a transfer of wealth to the bank, and the rich get wealthier faster than any 'trickle down' effect can take place.

So it does not *always* act opposite of gravity (and almost never acts totally opposite... considering the force is perpendicular to the chord line)

I would also like to add that the treadmill (in the real world -- ie can't travel at any speed necessary to counteract forward motion of the airplane) **would** decrease the total velocity that can be attained from the engines.

""Converting""?  A conversion to fiat currency implies that it was non-fiat to begin with, and if that were the case, what would you be needing to convert for?  You're talking in circles.

&gt; Last time I checked amazon.com or Frys didn't have way for me to transfer fractional shares of an ETF as a method of payment.

If you have no faith in a fiat currency, then what are you doing buying goods from amazon and Fry's, two retailers that operate within the fiat system?  You can't have your cake and eat it too - you either believe in it, or you don't.

What you're saying is that you like all the nifty stuff that central banking allows you to afford - but you don't like it when they issue new currency, because you can no longer afford as much of all the nifty stuff.  In other words, you **enjoy all the upsides, but don't enjoy the downsides**.  Well, no shit sherlock.

There are plenty of places in the world where you can still barter for goods in gold.  I suggest you go to those places and revel in your currency's stability  while laughing down on us poor saps who have to shop in retail stores with our imaginary money.

But, then again - you don't have the balls to put your money where your mouth is, do you?  You find the whole idea of living in a modern fiat economy just too damn convenient to actually do anything about your fears and actually convert your holdings to commodities and move to a place where they still barter.","1193986952"

I did that too, but not in the fun way like imagining my co-workers as a team of international assassins. When I first started teaching, the only channel I had access to was CNN International, and then the horrible [Beslan school attack][1] happened in Russia, so I would watch as the tragedy played out over the course of three days. The way that went down was when they had their school opening assembly, a group of terrorists stormed in, took over the school, and held it hostage for a couple days, and then nearly everyone died in a final shoot out with army. (Wiki: ""Three hundred and thirty-four (334) civilians were killed, including 186 children and hundreds more were wounded."") After the tragedy, one of Putin's responses was to stop allowing people to directly elect regional governors. Instead, he appoints them himself. No, that doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

Anyhow, after that I tended to think about the Breslan school massacre and get depressed by man's inhumanity to man during assemblies.

&gt;Judaism or Christianity aren't any different. All 3 religions are messianic and await a savior

"politics","t5_2cneq","Justice O'Connor, dissenting (transcript), began her opinion by citing United States v. Lopez, which she followed with a reference to Justice Louis Brandeis's dissenting opinion in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann:

“ Federalism promotes innovation by allowing for the possibility that “a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.
 ” 

O'Connor concluded:

“ Relying on Congress’ abstract assertions, the Court has endorsed making it a federal crime to grow small amounts of marijuana in one’s own home for one’s own medicinal use. This overreaching stifles an express choice by some States, concerned for the lives and liberties of their people, to regulate medical marijuana differently. If I were a California citizen, I would not have voted for the medical marijuana ballot initiative; if I were a California legislator I would not have supported the Compassionate Use Act. But whatever the wisdom of California’s experiment with medical marijuana, the federalism principles that have driven our Commerce Clause cases require that room for experiment be protected in this case.
 ” 

Justice Thomas also wrote a separate dissent (transcript), stating in part:

“ Respondent's local cultivation and consumption of marijuana is not ""Commerce ... among the several States.""

Certainly no evidence from the founding suggests that ""commerce"" included the mere possession of a good or some personal activity that did not involve trade or exchange for value. In the early days of the Republic, it would have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local cultivation, possession, and consumption of marijuana.
 ” 

Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the original author of the commerce clause cases United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison, joined O'Connor's dissent.

So, I believe they've been reporting it artificially low (this isn't really a conspiracy).  There is such a negative view on inflation and the fact that the reporting methods were changed back in the mid 80s, its caused the official inflation numbers to be incorrect or ""optimistic"".  Now, when inflation isn't correctly reported employers don't increase the wages and salaries of workers.  So basically for the past 20 years wages have basically been pretty flat with poor growth.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Ron Paul generally argues in favor of the Austrian School of Libertarianism http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School which in part essentially says as follows...

Inflation is a form of theft. Inflation takes money from those who save or depend on savings (such as retirees).

If paper money were backed by gold, the government would be prohibited from printing more money. Instead of inflation, we'd generally have deflation because generally over time businesses become more efficient which leads to lower prices. This in turn would encourage savings.

Why? Because deflation means prices tend to go down over time. In other words, if you live in an economy generally experiencing deflation (falling prices) then you can reasonably assume that $1 ""tomorrow"" (in the future) will be worth more than a $1 today people. If you have that belief then you would have a strong incentive to save. Why buy stuff today? By waiting a little longer you'll get a lower price.

Inflation, on the other hand, encourages spending. You tend to think, ""I'll buy that stuff right now."" Why? Because you believe that the stuff you want will be more expensive tomorrow (in the future).

Confused? Here's how inflation works. Say the entire economy consists of 10 people living on some small island. Just 10 people. That's all. Now let's say each person has $10. The economy now has $100 in circulation. Everything for sale: coconuts, fish, thatched huts, etc is paid for by people with that $100. In other words, essentially if you wanted to buy everything for sale on the island you could do so with $100.

Now let's suppose one of the 10 guys goes off and prints $100. Now he's rich! Why? He's got $110 whereas everyone else has $10. But it's more insidious than that. Because the economy now has $200 in circulation to buy whatever stuff is for sale in the economy, each person who had $10 now essentially only has $5. Why? Because essentially if you wanted to buy everything for sale on the island you would need $200, not $100 as before.

By the way, do you realize who that ""guy"" is who went off and printed $100? That's the government. Really? Yes. If you or are were to go off and print money that we'd be committing the crime of counterfeiting. But the government has a legal right to, essentially, print as much money as it wants. Therefore, the government, through it's ability to counterfeit, can steal money anytime it wants simply by, in essence, cranking up the printing presses.

The Austrian School of Libertarianism argues very persuasively that fiat currency http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_currency is essentially ""legalized crime"" because the government becomes a ""legal counterfeiter.""

How do you solve the problem? Allow each piece of paper to be exchanged for, say, 1 ounce of gold. No more money can legally be printed than there is gold to cover claims by those holding this paper ""backed"" by gold. Frankly, given the value of gold relative to it's weight, it would be feasible for people to carry around gold coins. If gold were worth $700 per ounce then if you wanted to carry $140 you'd only need to carry around 1/5th of an ounce of gold which would be roughly the size and shape of a current US quarter. If you needed to carry around $1,400 you'd only need to carry about the equivalent of 10 quarters. If you needed to carry $14,000 you'd need to carry about the equivalent of 2 and 1/2 rolls of quarters, hardly a huge load considering few people need to carry $14,000 with them.

Sound like a weird idea? Historically it's actually normal. In historical terms fiat currency is weird. Does that sound far-fetched or incredible to you? Does gold seem like stuff just for jewelry? Ever hear a quarter referred to as ""two bits""? Wonder where that phrase comes from?  How about the pirate movies in which the lovable pirates talk about ""pieces of eight""? What exactly were they talking about? (By the way, in 500 years I wonder if the Nazis SS be seen in the culture of the time as lovable. Pirates were certainly not lovable; they were generally brutal and savage.). Here are some facts to show how reasonable using gold (or silver) as a form of money actually has been, not just around the world but even in the United States of America.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_dollar

The Coinage Act of 1792 created the United States Mint, but the first U.S. dollars were not as popular as the Spanish dollars, which were heavier and were made of finer silver.

The coins had a nominal value of eight reales (""royals""). The coins were often physically cut into eight ""bits"", or sometimes four quarters, to make smaller change. This is the origin of the colloquial name pieces of eight for the coin, and of ""quarter"" and ""two bits"" for twenty-five cents in the United States.


Prior to the American Revolution there was, due to British mercantilist policies, a chronic shortage of British currency in its colonies. Trade was often conducted using Spanish dollars. Spanish coinage was legal tender in the United States until an Act of Congress discontinued the practice in 1857. The pricing of equities on U.S. stock exchanges in 1/8 dollar denominations persisted until the New York Stock Exchange converted to pricing in sixteenths of a dollar on June 24, 1997, to be followed shortly after by decimal pricing.


Long tied to the lore of piracy, ""pieces of eight"" were manufactured in the Americas and transported in bulk back to Spain (to pay for wars and various other things), making them a very tempting target for seagoing pirates. Some pirates were among the richest people in the world. The Manila Galleon transported Mexican silver to Manila in Spanish Philippines, where it would be exchanged for Philippine and Chinese goods, since silver was the only foreign commodity China would take. In oriental trade, Spanish dollars were often stamped with Chinese characters known as ""chop marks"" which indicate that particular coin had been assayed by a well-known merchant and determined genuine.


[...]

Millions of Spanish dollars were minted over the course of several centuries. They were among the most widely circulating coins of the colonial period in the Americas, and were still in use in North America and in South-East Asia in the 19th century. They had a value of one dollar when circulating in the United States.

Make no mistake, the problems faced by the American people are not caused by unscrupulous mortgage brokers or the rising price of oil. These are symptoms of an economic disease caused by a spendthrift Congress enabled by loose monetary policy. Too many pundits praise the weak dollar as benefiting exporters, but they fail to see the harm done to thrifty, hard-working Americans. Rather than continuing to pursue a policy of easy credit and increasing debt, we need to return to a sound monetary system.”

Yeahhhhh...that, and its also got some deeper historic context. After WWII all the empires were finished. The Ottoman was finished after WWI.

It never mattered so much if they [the west] controlled the oil (though that would be ideal), its more important that the nations of the Middle East stay divided and dysfunctional. OPEC is the price that the west paid for this arrangement; ie, if they were going to keep the Middle East highly dependent upon its role as an oil exporter, they had to let someone in the Middle East get exceedingly rich off of it, so that these exceedingly rich Middle Eastern men could send the money we pay for the oil back to buy Mansions in Malibu, Harvard educations for their kids, and weapons to oppress their own people and wage war against their own neighbours.

As for Shakespeare vs. Lessing, you're confusing seminality with greatness.  Obviously no-one can repeat Shakespeare's position in history.  However, if that's your definition of a writer's greatness, then your original point is meaningless, since obviously no woman would have been able to gain Shakespearean levels of fame at that time in history - unless, of course, she wrote under a pseudonym.  Hmm... perhaps Shakespeare was a woman.  Makes sense!

BTW, if you don't think that much if not most of Shakespeare's prose was flowery, you weren't paying attention.  Yes, I've read all of his significant plays, multiple times.  And enjoyed them.  For what they are.  

[Edit: my favorites are probably The Tempest and Merchant of Venice.  And I'm not seriously saying Shakespeare wasn't a great writer, a genius.  But it seems common to be  blinded by his historical context.  Same goes for Beethoven, since you mention it.]

&gt; Understandably, many Americans fear that with no drug laws, we would have hundreds of thousands of addicts, crack babies, children trying drugs, and other evils. But that's what we have now.

Because large problems never get larger!

&gt; they would no longer have to mug innocent people to support their habits.

Because legalizing drugs will make them non-addictive!

&gt; If all drugs were legal, addicts could seek help by going to doctors - no longer afraid of being prosecuted for their medical problems.

I'm sure that some people don't seek help for legal reasons. I suspect many, many more don't because they don't have the money to spend on fancy detox when the next hit is only $10 away.

&gt; If all drugs were legal, criminal drug dealers would no longer prey upon our children - any more than distilleries and breweries try to infiltrate schools to hook kids on alcohol.

No more than cigarette companies advertise to children!

&gt; When I grew up in Los Angeles in the 1940s, the worst schools were safer than L.A.'s best schools are today.

And you always did your homework and respected your elders. Anecdotes from old cranky men about how things used to be better are not convincing, ever.

&gt; If all drugs were legal, our government would no longer be dispensing propaganda that makes children want to try the forbidden fruit.

That's not true. Alcohol is legal, and the gov't still gives children propaganda about that. Furthermore, parents still would tell kids not to use drugs. Furthermore, people try drugs not just because they're forbidden, but also because they are lots and lots of fun.

&gt; Why do I think America would be like this if all drugs were legal? Because that's the way it was before the drug laws were passed.

We can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. Part of this phenomenon is popularity. Drugs are popular. People aren't going to forget about them if we change the law.

I'm bored with libertarians saying that markets work and then insisting that drug consumers don't respond to market forces like threats of jail or high prices.

**Paxtons definition of fascism:**

*""... a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation
 with community decline, humiliation or victimhood and by compensatory
 cults of unity, energy and purity, in which a mass-based party of
 committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective
 collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties
 and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal
 restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.""*

According to Paxton, fascist ideologieas are just means to get  into power. The ideological part is abandoned in practice as soon as the leaders have the power. At least for me rice of Christian right -&gt; Bush government is just like from Paxton's book. They were working for corporations after they gained power.

So people that buy stock in AAPL (stock is investing by giving them money to make more profit) don't forsee that AAPL might go up?  Futures usually are pretty well in line with real supply/demand issues.  Can this be maniupulated with supply controls, cartels and wars and finally fear? Yes.

&gt;~*To kill by submerging and suffocating in water or another liquid.*

* Client/File and Print Sharing;for Microsoft Networks installed by default.
* IP6 install by default
* Many new dialogs are no longer Copy friendly.
* Task Scheduler converted into a new start-up hidey hole, spybot, UNSTOPPABLE service. Pre-filled with unnecessary trash tasks.
* Software Licensing service.
* THE EVERYONE GROUP STILL EXISTS AND IT'S GRANTED FULL RIGHTS.  Yes that required CAPS, since I keep seeing flappings about security in the same context as Microsoft.
* More Services that are running/used that shouldn't be, Distributed Link Tracking Client, Group Policy (unstoppable) for example and DCOM, remind me again why I should need DCOM for local processes.
* General Service fragmentation. To many to go into, as well as being poorly documented.

&gt; .. releasing a cure for diabetes would cause [the companies'] profits to soar. Over many years they would lose millions. The men on the boards for these companies aren't stupid...

No, but they are human. Humans are greedy, and don't live very long, and don't care what mess they leave in the hands of their successors. Why should I, as this hypothetical board member, pass up on a hundred million dollar raise? Withholding a cure for diabetes would benefit the corporation and the industry as a whole on a long-term basis (say, thirty years long-term). During that thirty years, there might be two or three complete cycles of board staff, and there will certainly be new revenue streams uncovered in the form of new diseases and new treatments for same. During that thirty years, one hundred and twenty economic quarters will have elapsed. During that thirty years, the board members who made their fateful decision to get insanely rich at a stroke will all have retired, and some of them will probably have died. The company doesn't make the decisions, the humans do. And that's why corporate behaviour is and always will be (and must be, in fact) to maximise short-term gain even at the price of long-term loss. Drug companies offer cures and vaccines for many debilitating and chronic illnesses. The only reason they don't offer cures for the ailments du jour is that the twenty-first century's killers (cancer, diabetes, etc) are more complicated than the polio and nonresistant TB of yesteryear.

Your next paragraph doesn't have much worth addressing, except perhaps the bizarre inference that you're right because the protesters of the Iraq invasion were right. Instead, I'll ask you: why haven't you properly responded to my pointing out that there *are* institutes other than pharmaceutical companies which have the capability to develop new treatments? The oral polio virus was developed in Africa, for example. There's thousands of Universities around the world which would *kill* for the cachet of curing cancer. To suggest that only ""Western scientists"" are capable of innovation isn't just astonishingly narrow-minded, it's also somewhat racist.

which is actually *not* a prime, since it has factors (19 97 277).

The proof still stands, though, because *relative to the posited highest prime number*, it does give you a new prime, still yielding a contradiction. The distinction is important because one might be tempted to use the recipe for finding new prime numbers, which won't work.

(I'm viewing Communism as an economic term, not a legal system, of course...)
 
I'm just a little confused though: You are telling me that a State that I've been taught is Communistic is in reality a fascist state that thrives off of a capitalist (although corrupted) market? I guess I don't understand how China runs things, but you seem to lump 3 terms together that seem incompatable with each other.

(edit: Unless you are saying that instead of the State and Market being so intertwained like Communism, a Fascist government and a corrupted capitalist market are two different systems that work together. Ok, I get it, but the confusion came from where do you draw the line. At what point does a Fascist governemnt and corrupted capitalist market become one and the same?

&gt; sequence of keys to do something, while only
&gt; having to think about it at a higher level.

Yeah, my hands have a huge number of key sequences for emacs memorized and I use them without actively thinking about them.  For a lot of them I couldn't even tell you what the sequence is without either thinking about it for half a minute or just performing it and watching where my fingers go.

For example the ""C-x b *sc[tab][RET]"" sequence mentioned above is one I do use all the time, and when I saw it in the post my thought was ""is there really a [tab] in there?"".  So I hopped over to an open emacs window and did the switch-to-scratch-buffer sequence that my hands ""just know"" and hey sure enough I'm hitting [tab] as part of it.

This sort of thing once caused me a lot of trouble with a corporate trouble ticket application, which in its text input windows had assigned the same key sequence that emacs uses for ""delete character"" to ""irrevocably clear the entire form"".  I usually ended up having to type the ticket text into some other editor and cut+paste it into the application, because at some point I'd have a typo and muscle-memory would invoke delete-char before I could think to stop it.","1193996659"

Assuming we're working with unsigned whole numbers and we are actually rounding *up*, not down or to the nearest.

    {
      unsigned  p2 = 1;

(Obligatory Paul DiLascia quote: ""If this code works, it was written by Gotebe. If not, I don't know who wrote it."")

Obligatory Captain-obvious ( or, for binary-impaired ;-) ): I exploit the fact that any power of 0 is 1000... in binary. So, shift until you reach 0, then take next power of 2 (*p2&lt;&lt;1*).

Ternary conditional in the return accounts for a case when i *is* a power of 2 (*p2 == i*), and for i==0 (*!i* part, need to return 1 then).

Compiled code bemusements: if nothing is said, VS 2003's compiler for IA32 (cl.exe, 13.10.3077.0) inlines this in 28 bytes (vanilla ""Maximize for speed"" optimisation). If I force inlining out, function gets bigger (36 bytes, plus the call itself).

Now compare it with Emacs, where you have a small core, on which everything is built using the extension language (ELisp) - this way the base extension language has to be made powerful enough to implement all the editor functionality, and almost everything Emacs developers add to the editor, gets immediately available to people using/extending/programming it.","1193999222"

When an intelligence gathering group discusses the need for classification of programs for 200 years, this usually referst to techniques for encrypting or decrypting. Considering the current estimates for cracking AES or DES messages and the lower requirements for PGP, this would fit that time period as the globe would NOT want to know that any and all transactions or coded messages can be read with mpunity.

Several things from this article strike against calling the emerging American political landscape fascist.

First let me say its not fair to say that ""Fascism evolves"". Its almost like you're saying the newly evolved fascism is anything I say it is and forget what ever occurred before. Since we have plenty of definitions available for different forms of government, lets use these existing definitions and not try to evolve any of the old ones.

Paxton's definition is nice, so lets use that as a basis. He's saying that there is a rough under-class that grabs power and the established upper-class is forced to work with them. The methods they use are the usual forms of patriotism and fear-mongering. A lot of movements can use the tactics the fascists did to obtain power, so I believe the distinction lies in the under-class forcing compliance from the elite.

Using just the idea that a fascist state is an under-class that is working with the elite allows us to distinguish it from other forms of government. Communism would be the under-class kicking the elite completely out of the picture. Using this definition alone though, we make fascism just a branch of nationalism I think.

So back to the slashdot comment. The commenter is talking about corporations controlling or at least as equal partners with the government. Nowhere in this idea has he developed a concept of an under-class assuming power. Whether fascist or nationalist, the under-class needs to be controlling some part of the government.

His description though is about how the rich have controlled the poor. The rich control corporations and then influence the government by campaign funding. The definition therefore fits best for a plutocracy, since nowhere in US politics is a poor person (under-class) represented.","1194001275"

Or she's in there doing drugs or getting drunk.  Whatever, she's hiding in the bathroom having fun while hubby deals with the dog and baby.  She's -not- showering.

edit:  For our friends across the pond.  We have a totally different way of heating water.  We keep a lot of water in a tank and keep the whole tank hot all the time.  I understand you do it differently... you heat the water on demand, no hot-water tanks/reservoirs.  The two methods have their good and bad points.  Over here, the tanks are of varying sizes.  You might get 15 minutes of all-hot, no-cold water in an apartment, and 30 or 40 in a house.  It SEEMS like more because the water is usually VERY hot to accommodate  dishwashers and such, so you need to add cold water which ""extends"" the hot water and you use less hot for your shower.  I think dishwashers need 135 degrees F/38C, minimum, and higher is preferred unless you have children/etc that might get scalded.

However, there is no way you're going to get an 80-minute shower every two days, on top of all the other demands.  Not to mention which, the minerals, chlorine, flouride, and other stuff would play hell on your body.

1. Being deeply religious and being Deist are 
not mutually exclusive.

2. While the founders did advocate a separation of church in state, it was not what that term means today, i.e. the banning of the word ""God"" from the public sector.

3. If you re-read closely, you'll see that he didn't say that the Founders wrote it.  He was giving a broader example of the religious heritage in this country.

4. He does assume that Americans believe in something that grants rights which is higher than man.  This is the first idea of the Declaration of Independence, and it's what makes your rights intrinsic as opposed to a gift from the government.  And gifts from the government can be taken away as easily as given.

To call Paul a theocrat shows you don't actually understand what he's saying.  He's a civil as well as an economic libertarian, as evidenced by his support for gay marriage.  He simply doesn't believe we should spend our time trying to root out all religion from the public sector.","1194003151"

"programming","t5_2fwo","**living documentation: here's how you build this crazy thing.**


When you press F5 (in this VisualStudio case), the IDE build your code from workspace/project/solution file.


* The project file contains in formation about all the file in a project.

* The solution file contains information about project dependency and where each project location is.

* They contain all the necessary information about source code and dependency. And you also check in your project file; I don't know anyone that does not check in their project file. If you open your VS project and solution file in text editor you will see those information in XML format.


The problem when project you check out doesn't build is when sometimes the dependent project is record with absolute path in the solution file. This problem can also happens even when you use Makefile -- your directory structure doesn't match what you wrote in Makefile. You can manually edit project file to relative path and check it in and it will stay in relative path.


**The F5 key is not a build process.**

MS Visual Studio comes with command line to build using solution/project file. So you can automate your build process if you want, with out having to write another build script.



If your environment is Visual Studio, you don't have to write another build script. Your build script is always up to date with what you see when you work in your project, you can automate by command line application and you also have the ability to run/debug by just pressing F5. Isn't that as good as Makefile?


If someone in your project want to use their favorite text editor to write code then go ahead. He can always build from command line using this project file. 


The only problem is when he want to add file to project, then he also has to add it to the XML project file. But if he is competent programmer enough to want to use Emacs for everything, then I suppose writing a simple emacs script to automatically add entry to project file will not be his problem ;-)","1194004630"

[Erectile Dysfunction Treatment](http://www.zibr.com) here


Impotence affects all men at one point or other in their lives. It's scary to think about it, but it's also something we all have to deal with sooner or later, so it?s best to be informed and know what you expect and how you can treat it.

Erectile dysfunction (ED), sometimes called ""impotence"", is the inability to achieve or maintain an erection for sexual intercourse. Impotence can involve three aspects of erection development: the time to develop an erection, the strength of the erection, or the amount of stimulation needed to achieve an erection.

Erectile dysfunction may be a result of a variety of factors, ranging from chronic diseases, medications, to psychological factors. Erectile dysfunction can be caused by psychological or physical factors. Psychological factors are the cause approximately 10% of the time. This is commonly due to anxiety, stress, depression, excess fatigue or dissatisfaction with the relationship with the partner.

Physical causes can include any disorder that prevents the nervous system or vascular system from responding appropriately to arousal. That includes injuries to spinal cord, or damage to the nerves in the genital area from diabetes, multiple sclerosis or surgery. Vascular problems can be caused by medications, diabetes, high blood pressure, and atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Hormonal problems, kidney disease, liver disease, excessive alcohol ingestion, and infections can also cause ED.

Erectile dysfunction can affect all age groups. It has been estimated that 18 to 30 million American men suffer from erectile dysfunction. This number has increased significantly as awareness of the disorder has heightened.

When it comes to homemade erectile dysfunction cures, the best thing you can try are erectile dysfunction exercises. Penis exercises offer a lot more benefits than one might expect. For one thing you will get a better understanding of what works and what not for you. The more you exercise, the more you can pinpoint the problems you encounter in achieving an erection or in maintaining it.

Most penis exercises require you a certain degree of erection, so simply by trying to perform them you will need to get used to being in control of your erections for a given period of time. This alone can do wonders for men who are naturally shy and unsure about their power to please their partners. In my opinion, the best product about erectile dysfunction is a membership to a professional exercises program.

It?s just as good for your overall health and confidence like going regularly to the gym and more men should seriously consider adding penis exercises to their workout routines on a regular basis. It is not really something we talk about lightly, this is not top conversational subject even for the most manly man, but let?s remember that a couple of decades ago we weren?t readily mentioning impotence either, not even to our family physicians.

Not talking about penis exercises and about what they can do for you don?t help anybody. The more we bring out in the open the subject of erectile dysfunction exercises and homemade erectile dysfunction cures, the more we can push the medical community into acknowledging the subject and coming up with safer ways of improving our sexual lives.

However, I still think gun control is an all too common roadstop on the way from democracy to dictatorship and that resisting the passage of gun control laws is a useful touchstone in keeping a democracy healthy.

A culture in which firearms are commonly kept by citizens in defense of their homes against common criminals is one in which people realize that the police can't always be there to protect them, and that they bear some responsibility for their own safety, and that perfect safety is not possible in this world.

However, when a culture abhors the private ownership of firearms and thinks that the average citizen should depend entirely on the police to protect them at all times, it is engaging in a perilous fantasy.  

There will never be enough police to protect you at all times.  At best the police are a deterrent that help us manage risk.  They are there to help but are not a guarantee of anything.

We conviently forget that we take our lives, and the lives of our neighbors and fellow citizens in our hands every day that we get behind the wheel of a car.  We lose 60,000 people a year in the U.S. on the highways and nobody bats an eyelash, yet the 911 attacks have absolutely terrified us. 

What is the response of the mindset that the citizen has no legitimate role in the use of force to stop crime (that the government can and should guarantee his safety) when the citizen witnesses a large scale attack like 911?

The reaction is to give up freedom for protection.  To give law enforcement whatever powers it wants in the false hope that it can use those powers to keep us safe.

I submit that had the average citizen kept firearms in their house and thought of it as his role to protect his family against criminals as a last defense, they would not have been so quick to respond to 911 by rolling over for the implementation of a police state.","1194006211"

To me, that is a crime. 

I am not trying to argue. I am presenting an Israeli perspective that is extremely unpopular on reddit and with people who rely on christian ethics without the religious FUD attached in general. 

The occupation will end. It must end. The thing is, however, that the arabs don't want the occupation to end. They want Israel do end, and there's a big difference. Syria and Iran would love nothing more than provoking Israel into military action in which as many ""palestinians"" as possible would die; that would give them all the reasoning they need to attack us. Actions of the PLO, Hamas and Fatah, along with other ""brigades"" and ""liberation forces"", do absolutely nothing to end the occupation. Instead, they're doing everything they can to play the victim card, prolong the armed conflict, prevent mutual understanding and diplomatic negotiation and ensure that Israeli public opinion supports occupation and persistent abuse of the ""palestinian"" people. And guess what? They're good at this.

For others that are interested in reincarnation, take a look for the book 'Many Lives, Many Masters' by Dr. Brian Weiss.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;'proof' suggests you just found a new prime number

No, in 4, proof is *correct* in concluding that P is a prime.

Why? Because, in 2 and 3 the guy clearly says that he's already using all *known* primes, which is *true* if the premise, that their number is finite, is true.

So, from 2 and 3, 4 *correctly* concludes Q is a prime. And then, 5 kicks in with the absurd.

It rather looks you are deliberately making the same mistake as your students? Or are you having problems with proofs by contradiction, like this one? I know I do ;-).","1194007788"

"science","t5_mouw","For anyone wanting really rigourous proofs, you might be interested at looking into computer assisted theorem proving. The idea is you have a small number of axioms (e.g. around 10) which you define everything from, including numbers, addition, lists, sets etc. The computer checks your working and verifies that you've worked from your definition to the axioms to give you very high confidence your proof is correct. The computer can also help you solve whole proofs (in limited domains) or help you by building some parts and letting you do the rest. It's not for the faint hearted though and the learning curve is vertical, but some will find it very interesting in how similar computer program and computer theorem proving is. You can also verify programs do what you think they do (e.g. prove quicksort program sorts a list, terminates etc.). You'd be surprised the amount of work and leaps in logic you need just to prove seemingly obvious facts.

Here is what some proofs about prime numbers look like. You need to run the script in the prover for it to make sense though. Each line in the proof prints out a modified a goal until you've proven the theorem, like you do on paper:

Did your brother attempt to fight his DUI or did he just accept his fate and pay his fine?  

Speaking of misleading statements...

&gt;I can't speak for 2002, but in 2005 I lost two friends to a 3-time drunk driving murderer

So are you saying this person killed someone else 3 times before he/she killed your two friends?  Because that's what it sounds like you're trying to say and somehow I highly doubt this is true.  

&gt;and in 2006 I lost another to a repeat drunk driving murderer.

So yet another person who had killed someone else while driving drunk prior to killing your friend?

You either have the worst luck in the world when it comes to friends, or you are lying.  Ask the vast majority of people and they have never known anyone who's been killed by a drunk driver.  Fact of the matter is that very, very few people actually do get killed by drunk drivers.  Not saying it never happens.  I fully agree that it does.  But not enough to warrant criminalizing people who have a drink or two with dinner and drive home perfectly safely.

"science","t5_mouw","I think a proof should not have to tell you not to misinterpret it. Perhaps informally, if you're explaining to someone, that may be necessary, but in a real proof this could be cumbersome. If we take as given that the reader is familiar with proof by contradiction and considers the wrongness of the provand to be a basic assumption to use in any proof then I think bahumbug1's summary of it is perfectly understandable. And, of course, if you want to extract constructions and lemmas and things from a proof by contradiction, you have to make sure they still work outside the proof, which they might not, because the proof starts by assuming something false to be true. As some people pointed out, here the construction used in the proof does not work outside the proof. I don't think that needs to be pointed out in the proof; the reasoning was pretty clear that the reason p(1)p(2)...p(n)+1 had to be prime was that it was not divisible by any prime, because p(1), ..., p(n) were all the primes.","1194008315"

""I regret that I have to be the one to tell you this, but your project is not based on solid software engineering practices.""

Why?  All of my dependent projects and modules, including the Installsheild project that creates the setup is a part of the entire solution.  I choose a build configuration that builds all of the projects and creates the setup.  Each project contains a txt file that documents the code and the code is well commented.  The source is backed up daily and all distributions built from one specific machine.

I simply have no need to build projects from the command line.  Sure, go ahead if a developer wants but I've never had the need to build anything outside the IDE from custom controls to setups.  But to imply you're doing it wrong because you use the IDE to build multi-module projects is freaking infuriating.  Because ""Mike"" is an idiot and gives a developer projects that won't build doesn't mean using the IDE makes you incompetent.

Of course, we also have greater-than-year-long waiting lists.

I have two private medical insurance policies to ensure I have access to non-urgent operations, and can afford prescription medicines. 

That being said, I'm glad we have good urgent care.

But the non-urgent is not in a great state. The present government increased the management of healthcare much more than the people on the ground who do the real work - so my doctor and nurse friends tell me as they share their frustrations.

In other news, I hear Canada has similar problems.

http://onthefencefilms.com/video/deadmeat/

""A 52-year-old woman in Calgary recalls being in severe need of joint-replacement surgery after the cartilage in her knee wore out. She was put on a wait list and wound up waiting 16 months for the surgery. Her pain was so excruciating, she says, that she was prescribed large doses of Oxycontin, and soon became addicted. After finally getting her operation, she was put on another wait list — this time for drug rehab.

A man tells about his mother waiting two years for life-saving cancer surgery — and then twice having her surgical appointments canceled. She was still waiting when she died.

A man in critical need of neck surgery plays a voicemail message from a doctor he'd contacted: ""As of today,"" she says, ""it's a two-year wait-list to see me for an initial consultation."" Later, when the man and his wife both needed hip-replacement surgery and grew exasperated after spending two years on a waiting list, they finally mortgaged their home and flew to Belgium to have the operations done there, with no more waiting.

Rick Baker, the owner of a Toronto company called Timely Medical Alternatives, specializes in transporting Canadians who don't want to wait for medical care to Buffalo, New York, two hours away, where they won't have to. Baker's business is apparently thriving. 


...In 2005, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled in favor of a man who had filed suit in Quebec over being kept on an interminable waiting list for treatment. In striking down the government health care monopoly in that province, Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin said, ""Access to a waiting list is not access to health care."" Now a similar suit has been filed in Ontario.""



The point is that Americans are taught by popular culture to think their health system is worse than it is, and worse than everyone else's in the world.

Take a car, for instance. After the first 150K miles, you shouldn't just do the regular maintenance - you probably should switch to synthetic, change the oil more frequently, and have the car more frequently serviced and check for leaks and such. The reality is that unless you work at keeping that car showroom new, it'll break down. 

Same with any relationship: you don't live in a bubble where it's November 2, 2007 every day for the rest of your life. If you treat a relationship that way, then changes are 'unpredictable' - because if expectations and a view of reality doesn't change, how can you predict the future?

With such incredible population density spread over so much suburban area it's very difficult to get the all the roads plowed in time.  People here have no idea how to drive in bad weather (rain or snow) so there's constantly accidents on every major road.  We also tend to get a lot of snow/sleet mix making the roads and sidewalks icy.  Rather than having some kid slip on the ice and sue the school they just cancel class.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;I see where you're coming from, and I wouldn't say I disagree, but I think your definition is problematic because you allow actions to just function as a veneer, when psychology is entirely built on behaviorism, as it must be. 

I would counter that psychology is based on behaviorism only because behavior is all that we can directly observe (once we're good enough at interpreting brain imaging, I'd be surprised *not* to see it supplant traditional psychological tests).  However, much of psychology is designed to elicit behavior that is indicative of internal mental processes.  As an example, take the Rorschach test.  Its purpose is to delve deeper than the patient's everyday behavior, and to generate behavior that directly represents the patient's internal state.

&gt;I'm not convinced that men having sex with men for the sake of sex can be so easily labeled as non homosexual by the mere addition of a chick fantasy playing in their head.

Fair enough.  It all comes down to how you define ""homosexual"", really.  From my point of view, such a man could be straight or bisexual, but not homosexual, because a gay man would be unable to become aroused by fantasizing about a woman.

&gt;I mean do you think that getting head from dudes has nothing to do with the dudes in Larry Craig's situation?

In his case, I'd say there's a distinct possibility that he's at least bisexual.  Even in the study from the article, I find it *very* likely that some of the ""straight"" men were bisexual or homosexual.  Non-standard sexuality tends to be looked down upon by society even today, and the study was done in the '60s, so I wouldn't be surprised if many men would attempt to hide their sexuality, possibly even from themselves.

&gt;isn't it a little ostentatious to define gay how you have? 

I don't really think so.  In my opinion, my definition of homosexuality makes the most sense.

&gt;Maybe many men who identify is gay, and only gay, but are still attracted to women, would find the idea that their ideation somehow defines them to be disturbing?

If they identify as gay, but are attracted to women, then they're bisexual to some degree, and not strictly gay.  What one identifies as can often be because that's what one *wants* to be, and not what one *is*.

Of course, this is still a simplistic view point, as there's no easy way to define what ""what one is"" actually means.  Is it psychological?  Physiological?  Something else entirely?

I still contend that attraction is the most important part to determining sexuality.  The fact that we can't directly observe this makes it easier to pigeonhole people based solely on their actions, but that's more for convenience's sake.  As telling as it is, behavior alone is still insufficient to fully describe a person.","1194010087"

Response: True, but once again, how does school choice solve this? Seems to me it just lets white flight happen internally as well as externally.

Quote: ""Further teachers are not encouraged to try harder RIGHT NOW.""
Response: Teachers in public schools respond to the same market forces of potentially being fired as those in private schools. The only problem now is that the demand for teachers far outweighs the supply. If there were 2 teachers for every position, we wouldn't have this problem. 

Quote: ""People can vote for school board members to oversee schools their children don't attend RIGHT NOW. This has been the case decades.""

Response: Parents have a geographical representation now. With at-large-only elections, candidates focus on the largest majority, rather than district majorities. Case-in-point: Durham NC, where I live. Our city is majority white, but large subsections of the city have a vast majority black population. With At-Large elections, these enclaves would get little to no representation.

Quote: ""As for continuity: picking up a phone and calling a child's previous teacher is not really as hard as you make it sound""

Response: Teachers can't just hand out all of your previous school records to anyone who calls on the phone. Data either in fax or sealed letter form would be transmitted and rekeyed into whatever system the other school is using. Counselors certainly can't just ""pick up where the previous school's counselor let off"", considering there are relationships to rebuild.

I guess I don't understand what you are trying to get at j0hnsd. Your argument is that these are all problems now. My argument is that School Choice will cause these problems. It appears that you are arguing that school choice is no worse than what we have now, but not that it is better.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;Being deeply religious and being Deist are not mutually exclusive.

They were in Jefferson's case.  Deists can be deeply religious, but it's not typical.

&gt;While the founders did advocate a separation of church in state, it was not what that term means today, i.e. the banning of the word ""God"" from the public sector.

You have to be kidding me.  The word ""God"" is not ""banned from the public sector.""  Listen to George W. Bush's speeches, or that CNN interview with Mike Huckabee from last month.  People invoke God or Jesus all the fucking time, and no one is preventing them from doing it.

&gt;If you re-read closely, you'll see that he didn't say that the Founders wrote it. He was giving a broader example of the religious heritage in this country.

You're correct.  He didn't actually say that they wrote it, but he heavily implied it.  Look again:

&gt;Moreover, there is ample evidence that most of our Founders were deeply religious men who never imagined a rigid separation between religious beliefs and governance. 

That's his statement.

&gt;Indeed, our national documents, symbols, currency, and buildings are replete with religious symbolism. 

There is his supporting argument.

&gt;Our national motto, ""In God We Trust,"" is an obvious example.

There is his example.  If you look at those three sentences as a progressing argument, then it's clear to see what he's implying.

&gt;He does assume that Americans believe in something that grants rights which is higher than man. This is the first idea of the Declaration of Independence, and it's what makes your rights intrinsic as opposed to a gift from the government. And gifts from the government can be taken away as easily as given.

So you're okay with Ron Paul assuming that every American believes in some kind of God?  Doesn't that show disrespect for non-religious people?  And actually, the Declaration of Independence cites ""the laws of nature"" before it begins to mention God.

&gt;To call Paul a theocrat shows you don't actually understand what he's saying.

I can clearly understand what he's saying.  I think that most people on Reddit fell in love with his economic views and foreign policy first and now refuse to look again.

&gt;He's a civil as well as an economic libertarian, as evidenced by his support for gay marriage.

Bullshit.  He is totally anti-abortion, which is not a position that most civil libertarians hold.  He also believes (see above) that religion should mix freely with government policy.  He doesn't support gay marriage in any sense; he just believes that the state governments should have the chance to outlaw it, and they shouldn't recognize marriages carried out in other states.

&gt;He simply doesn't believe we should spend our time trying to root out all religion from the public sector.

See above.  He's a believer in the War on Christmas.  He believes that prayer is not allowed in public school.  He believes that anyone reading his web site believes in a higher power.  He is totally anti-abortion, largely because of his religion, and refuses to believe that it serves any purpose.  No way in hell will I vote for this guy.","1194011326"

Then everyone up top gets all peaceful, and it turns out it was just a tiny localized radioactive event, right where this shelter was.  Everyone thinks the family is the last tragic story of the old times and they perished, but the family is still fine underground, they just think the surface is all contaminated.  So they run out of supplies, and send a son out... only to find out that there's an impenetrable concrete cap all around them to contain the radiation.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; You know that like 90% of Good Code is about limiting how your project is designed and built, right?

Sure, but are you sure the limits the IDE imposes are the right ones? My point is that when you do all your work through an IDE your project is, in design and in practice, locked into that environment and the ""worldview"" it fosters. You say: 

&gt; removes practical limits like a requirement for consistent capitalization

I mean is that really a good thing? I'd argue that your project should have well defined standards of capitalisation, and an autocomplete feature is no substitute for those standards, those kinds of issues are pervasive when doing IDE only development. 

I'd imagine a big factor here is that the code I'm developing is multi-platform (over 10 different architectures and operating systems) and customers need to be able to build the code. These two conditions mean the code base has to be buildable with a multitude of IDEs and build systems, and I can tell you this greatly increases the quality of the project layout and design.

I'm not sure where you get the idea that it is a justification for war for anyone, considering the real problem is that he is seeking Nuclear Weapons, and those Iranians I know that snuck out of the country briefly made it very clear his intentions.

So, in that same speech, what is the correct translation of what was translated as ""anyone who recognizes Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic nation's fury.""

And considering how he follows in the footsteps of the murderous Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who also spewed forth such bile about Jews and Israel, what are we to think?

And what are we to think about the support for Palestinian suicide bombers slaughtering innocents in Israel.  At the very least they should target the Israeli soldiers if they truly were ""freedom fighters,"" which they certainly are not.

And what of the support for terrorists in Iraq and the propping up of the Syrian regime and the dubious ties to the instability and assassinations in Lebanon?

Oh, and the flogging and murders of ""immoral"" behavior in their own country and suppression of free speech and those that dissent?

And what about his speech: [Iran President: Israel Will Be Annihilated](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,191819,00.html)
&gt;President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called Israel a ""permanent threat"" to the Middle East that will ""soon"" be liberated. He also appeared to again question whether the Holocaust really happened.

&gt;""Like it or not, the Zionist regime is heading toward annihilation,"" Ahmadinejad said at the opening of a conference in support of the Palestinians. ""The Zionist regime is a rotten, dried tree that will be eliminated by one storm.""

Or this one: [Iran’s Ahmadinejad says “evil” Israel will be “annihilated”](http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=7166)

&gt;“If the West does not support Israel, this regime will be toppled”, Ahmadinejad told a student gathering in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.

&gt;“As it has lost its raison d’être, Israel will be annihilated”, he said.

What about his support for Venezualan President Chavez, or his hand in the dealings of North Korea to Syria, etc?

Or Iranians saying we should [take the threats seriously](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/868852.html).

Should I keep going?

The point is that there is so much evidence that Iran, coupled with the extremist Islamicists it harbors, would slaughter Jews in accordance with Islamic law if it could.  The people of Iran may not be extremist, but just like in our own country, they say they chose the lesser of two evils.

Of course not. The amount of copper available is determined solely by the size of copper mines. Having the government buy copper won't increase the supply, it will only redistribute the existing supply. 

The same thing applies to health care. The government can take the already existing supply of health care (measured in terms of hours of health care services provided) and redistribute it. That's all. Single payer health care wont create more health care hours. Doctors already work far more than full time, the government wont get more hours from them.

You can't dismiss either editor without going through this process first.

Even as a classic vi user years ago, I used Windows-specific editors for a long time, because the amount of effort to deep dive into vim kept me away.  I finally worked through it, and am  glad I did.  I might be happier with Emacs, but that would be going back to the start of another six month curve.

I can have no comment on a question which makes no sense to me. For the ""president"" of an organization, you lack tact, subtlety, courtesy, humility, grace, honesty, and it appears in the end, common human courtesy.

You seem to have missed the entire thrust of my disingenuous mis characterization of your organization's goals: that the statements of your organization are themselves disingenuous and mis characterize the positions which they mean to attack.","1194013382"

but this ""conservative"" support of big business just has me baffled.  i mean what adam smith laid out was a system kept honest via competition.  that's it.  he hated monopoly as much as he hated government intervention because it corrupts competition.  and this continued confusion of big business as a proxy for market competition is what has allowed this fascist shadow to appear.  and all i see from conservatives is gloating that they think their side is being vindicated.

First if the doctor's office sits on claims it gives the processing company less time.  If the doctor's fill out the claim wrong or use some unusual codes, it screws stuff up.  Also, you can't possibly have a human review every claim in that time.  So an automated system processes things.  By default claims are denied if the system's algorithms don't validate correctly.  Kind of a failsafe from accepting everything.  Here is the thing, there is no timer on disputes.  So IF you have a claim denied ALWAYS throw it back at them.

However, I see David as a community steward, and take issue with his refusal to allow the Rails logo on any books other than his own. My reason is simple: rails.png is part of Rails, and is in every new project. Rails is licensed under MIT and that would imply that putting the Rails logo on a book about Rails is a clear fair use.

"science","t5_mouw","Another of my favorite proofs (one for the Book) uses Euler's product formula for the Riemann zeta function. It is much less elementary than Euclid's proof but nevertheless gratifying; [this page](http://carnalreason.org/infinitude-of-primes/) has an exposition.

There's also a nice proof that is very close in spirit to Euclid's proof but gives explicit bounds on the nth prime number as a function of n; indeed, it can be seen as a constructive version of Euclid's _reductio ad absurdum_ that yields the bounds as a byproduct. It goes as follows:

Let p(1), p(2), ..., p(n) be a finite sequence of distinct primes. Define P(n) = p(1) p(2) ... p(n), the product of these, and N(n) = P(n) + 1, and let p(n+1) be the smallest factor of N(n). Then p(n+1) is different from each of the p(i) for i &lt;= n by the same argument as in Euclid's proof, and it's a prime number because the smallest factor of any number is necessarily prime. Thus p(1), p(2), ..., p(n), p(n+1) is a yet longer finite sequence of distinct primes, and you can make an infinite such sequence by iterating this construction.

The above is just a subtle rephrasing of the usual argument but it easily yields the promised bounds. I'll prove that p(n) &lt;= 2^(2^n) for any sequence that starts with a seed of p(1) = 2 and is constructed per the above:

The basis case should be clear. For n = 1, p(n) = 2 &lt;= 4 = 2^(2^n), as expected.

For the inductive step, suppose the bound holds for i = 1, ..., n. Then

    p(n+1) &lt;= N(n)
            = 1 + p(1) p(2) ... p(n)
           &lt;= 2 p(1) p(2) ... p(n)
           &lt;= 2 2^(2^1) 2^(2^2) ... 2^(2^n)
            = 2^(1 + 2^1 + ... + 2^n)
            = 2^(2^(n+1) - 1)
           &lt;= 2^(2^(n+1))

As far as I know, this is the simplest and most elementary proof that gives any explicit bounds on p(n). Of course, the bound is ridiculously loose compared to that of, say, the prime number theorem.","1194014176"

I agree that this could be read in multiple ways. Let me break it down:

""I can't speak for 2002, but in 2005 I lost two friends to a '3-time drunk driving' 'murderer'.""

The '3-time drunk driving' is a modifier for 'murderer', like 'violent' or 'fucking'. Same for 'repeat drunk driving' 'murderer'. If you say somebody is a ""fucking murderer"" you don't necessarily mean that they were a rapist, too. But I agree that the language wasn't as clear as it could be and for that I apologize. But:

&gt; you are lying.

The driver was busted for drunk driving 2 prior times, and did it a 3rd time, resulting in the deaths of two of my wife's family's neighbors on July 31, 2005, as two children were burned to death in their van as their parents suffered burns trying to save them:

http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=News&amp;id=3311218&amp;ft=print

&gt; Pollock has two previous DUI convictions.

And a fellow law student of my wife's was seriously injured and her husband killed in the 2006 incident I mentioned which occurred on December 22, 2006:

http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070210/A_NEWS/702100317

&gt; Prosecutors filed a murder charge because of Eisner's conviction on a drunken-driving charge in June, in which he signed a statement acknowledging he could be charged with murder in the event he drove drunk again and someone died as a result.

I don't even know why I am discussing my personal life with a complete stranger on reddit, other than to defend against charges that I am lying about the deaths of people whom I know to have died horrifically.

&gt; I fully agree that it does.

Just not when somebody brings it up, eh? No, no, we can't have that, we must call them liars!

I agree there are problems with the DUI laws; that the lowering of the BAC limits have not resulted in fewer deaths or demonstrably fewer seriously impaired persons driving; that people who are not seriously impaired are caught in the crossfire between enforcement and those who actually do put people's lives in grave risk. I would be much more sympathetic to your cause if you spent as much energy on going after the drunk drivers instead of trying at all turns to minimalize their actions.

I agree with this.  Without Law, you'd be left with a myriad of power centers, all vying (almost certainly with violence) to establish their own authority.

Democracy gives itself a monopoly on violence, which is a good thing if you consider what other would-be authorities would want to use violence to take power.

We have laws that control this, and they grant authority to maintain order.

The key is *DEMOCRATIC* control of the authority and law.  Not, say, corporate or some kind of feudal warlord factionism.

Alcoholism is a well-defined term, and it does not mean someone who had 4 drinks one night and decided to drive. Having 4 drinks in an hour and hitting the road is seriously impaired driving, yet it is not alcoholism, it is simply drunk drunk driving. Saying we put alcoholics in prison implies that we go to people's houses and round up alcoholics who are slowly drinking themselves to death in their homes, when in fact, we don't care if they are alcoholics, only if they have enough alcohol before driving to reach a certain BAC which is considered ""impaired"".

Answer: If we jumped into our pants simultaneously placing both legs in at
one time, we would land heavily on the ground. As a majority of us are
getting dressed at the same time of the morning, the cumulative effect would
cause an earth tremor. Due to the use of time zones, the tremor established
In Eastern Time would arrive in the central zone at precisely the moment all
those people were jumping into their pants. The tremor would increase in
size exponentially, and proceed west to combine with the mountain zone folks
as they get dressed. As this cycle encircles the globe, it would feed upon
the next day's tremor and eventually cause the earth's crust to break apart
and float into space. This is why we put our pants on one leg at a time. ","1194014871"

There is very little choice with respect to health insurance.

Many people are barred from reasonable insurance plans because of ""pre-existing conditions"".  And the ""services"" that you get from many plans are, practically speaking, few to nonexistent.  

That said, I would be in favor of an opt-out option on state-sponsored healthcare, as long as the option was not structured to kill the whole system.

YOU CANNOT LEGISLATE MORALITY

passing laws that aim to prevent one from doing naughty things just makes a percentage of the population criminals... arbitrarily.

drinking is immoral, sex, speaking honestly with children, reading controversial texts, yelling in public, creating a nuisance (even as a protest).  Any of these things could be chosen as the next target of 'moral legislation' aiming to improve society.

Society never changes... the same freaks and conformists are ALWAYS present, its just a matter of accepting that which you disagree with or not.  Laws such as this will never ever ever stop anyone from doing what they feel is 'right' (by their own estimate).

"politics","t5_2cneq","The crux of it lies in Iraq's borders, as they were decided by Winston Churchill. 

All the European Empires used one very distinct and effective means of ensuring the ongoing division and dysfunctional-nature of the territories they cut out:

They would take two tribes or groups that historically hated each other, draw borders around them, and then put one of the tribes (usually the minority one) in charge by backing them with money, arms, etc. Its the fundamental historical cause behind the Tutsi Hutu conflict in Rwanda, the Kikuyu and Luhya tribes of Kenya, The Sunnis and Shi'ites, and numerous others...that I'm not really well versed enough to innumerate. But I do know it was their MO. They never wanted to sustain a military presence in their colonies - that's too expensive - their philosophy was always to take a primitive people and mould them into 'friends' - much more profitable.

Those instructions tweak the windows drivers to work in Ubuntu, but in Gutsy the Restricted Drivers tool says it is flashing the firmware.  Either way, while I agree with your point that it is sketchy to let a checkbox flash firmware, you can also hose your system pretty easily trying to follow instructions off of a forum too.

oh, and you can read the Hirsch Report if you want.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsch_report

Its a government report almost no one has ever heard about.

If peak oil is the 'scam' why is the TV saying its increased demand in China?  Hasnt China been industrializing for 20 years?  Oil went up 50% in the US JUST THIS YEAR.  Did china build 1000 factories last month?  For what?  

You cant say peak oil is a scam when only a very small minority of people have ever heard of it.  Or are you saying they let it leak out quietly to make it look more reliable than a big media blitz, to convince the suspicious Redditer's?  Come on man.

If the TV media said 'hey, oil production is going to decline 7-10% per year from now on (i've read that number...) there would be panic, people would stop buying junk made in China, and our fragile economy would take a shit.  Thats why it isn't public knowledge.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The video has it's points.  If you don't want to watch it, I can't change that.  The problem as I see it is that our government is borrowing the money we have in circulation thereby making our whole nation in debt to the group of banks that make up the Federal Reserve.  It says so right at the top of your Dollar Bill.  It says it is a Federal Reserve  'Note' at the top.  I have an older $1.00 bill that does not say this.  It says it is a ""Silver Certificate"" at the top.  It was printed against the USA's or the Peoples own supply of Silver and therefore had value which was one dollar of silver (fixed at the price of silver at the time it was printed).  If they had left this system in place, think how many current dollars the $1.00 of Silver (roughly a one ounce silver dollar at the time the note was printed) would be worth now.  It is interesting to contemplate how much less that current dollar 'note' you have in your pocket is worth now.  Watch the video I posted above  and think about it.  The Fiat system drives the economy true but at the same time, it drives the people to ruin and enslavement to debt.  Sooner or later it will break.  It has to.  Our prosperity and the nation our forefathers conquered with their blood, sweat, and tears has been stolen from us while we weren't looking.

One thing we can do to better resolve the signals that politicians send us is to view their IR spectra when we change just one ligand in their coordination sphere, particularly if we compare coordination of back-donation and non-back-donation accepting ligands, these  can reveal whole vibrational modes that strongly indicate orbital energies.","1194017032"

Lazy languages make an investment into determining what work needs to be done, and what doesn't.  Real world performance issues are often -- even most of the time -- about identifying what work needs to be done.  (For example, if this weren't true, it would immediately follow that P=NP.)  Programmers can sometimes lean back on a lazy language's well-optimized runtime to do large parts of that work for them, where programers in eager languages would have to build and manipulate their own data structures to track what work to do next.  That improves performance for a lazy language.

In microbenchmarks, it's often standard fare to try to force the compiler to do all possible work, mainly because there generally is no work that really needs to be done, and the accounting process to determine what work should be done next is considered ""algorithm"" stuff that's at a higher level than any language or runtime performance issues.  Lazy languages destroy that assumption, and hence make microbenchmarking of that sort less meaningful.","1194017959"

"politics","t5_2cneq","These definitions don't seem to be at all well supported by history.  The major difference which can be generalised is that Fascism is chiefly concerned with a state's *governance*, while Communism is chiefly concerned with a state's *economy*.  What generalised differences there are arise from this fact.  Governance may or may not be threatened by external political powers, and so whether external threats, real or imagined, become a focal point in fascist propaganda is entirely circumstantial.  Communism, on the other hand, is chiefly concerned with economic forces, and these are less easily confined by a country's borders.    External forces are almost inherently a threat, therefore, in communism's case.  It's for this reason that so many communists have theorised the *need* for a communist world revolution in order for *any* communism to succeed.  

Dictatorships of either kind will face dissent, and so it would be bizarre to find either system absent internal enemies of some kind.  Similarly, both have had undiplomatic tendencies, and so they tend to accumulate foreign enemies.  There will always be a mix of internal and external threats in either case.
But the ideology (and hence propaganda) itself is more threatened by and therefore more focused on internal challenges to the governing order in a system of governance such as fascism, and to external challenges to the economic order, in a system of economic management such as communism.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Quite ironic that you should recommend I read Charles C. Mann's book, 1491. Truth be told, I'm familiar with his work, and read his essay of the same name before the book was even published. You may review [that essay](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200203/mann) yourself if you like.  

It's ironic because you are essentially recommending a source which refutes your own arguments. Mann's work sets out to show that the Americas were a far more urban, more populated, and more technologically advanced region than generally assumed. Yet you say:

&gt;""as it so happens this was a sparsely populate landmass when various groups were arriving. Maybe you think that a few hundred thousand savage and violent illiterates should forever have been allowed to call the whole place their own, but that's not how it works.""

Here is a fine execrpt from Charles Mann's writing on the subject that you might like to consider:  

&gt;""Estimates of the population of North America in 1491 disagree by an order of magnitude—from 18 million, Dobyns's revised figure, to 1.8 million, calculated by Douglas H. Ubelaker, an anthropologist at the Smithsonian. To some ""high counters,"" as David Henige calls them, the low counters' refusal to relinquish the vision of an empty continent is irrational or worse. ""Non-Indian 'experts' always want to minimize the size of aboriginal populations,"" says Lenore Stiffarm, a Native American-education specialist at the University of Saskatchewan. The smaller the numbers of Indians, she believes, the easier it is to regard the continent as having been up for grabs. ""It's perfectly acceptable to move into unoccupied land,"" Stiffarm says. ""And land with only a few 'savages' is the next best thing.""

So I wonder if you ever really read 1491. From my perspective, what I'm saying is the opposite of *p.c. revisionism*. The politically correct line concerning this issue is to avoid talking about it at all, or whenever it does come up to point out how grateful the Native Americans should be for their income from casinos (a wretched consolation when you have any real sense of what was lost). As for revisionism, that old tale of a sparsely populated land up for grabs IS the revisionist history. You do realize that most of history is written by the conquerors don't you? 

""Noble savage illusions"" ... That's a load of shit if you ask me. When people don't want to admit that they've destroyed something beautiful, they rationalize that it was never beautiful to begin with -- a perfect example of ""P.C. revisionism"" in action.

In the first 3 days of the Intifada, the Israeli army fired one million bullets which completely disgusted the Israeli generals.  Furthermore, the ratio of deaths during that period was 20 Palestinians to 1 Israeli.  Motherfucking racists such as yourselves did not give a fuck.  Then the Palestinians decided that they too would fight back and broke their cease-fire.  This brought the ratio of deaths *during the entire Intifada* to 3 Palestinians to 1 Israeli.

"reddit.com","t5_6","So get a different insurance company.  It's not rocket science.    Besides, if you are buying your own insurance, you shouldn't get an hmo policy anyway.  

Get a policy that only covers catastrophic sickness with around a 10-15k deductible. Make sure they pay nearly 100% once the very high deductible is met.   Your premium will be around 1/10th or less of what you would pay for normal health insurance.   Then take the money you save (in this case something like $700 a month.  It is important to have some insurance in case you get cancer and have a million dollar medical bill, and also because just using your insurance card, even when you are paying, gets you some ridiculous pre-negotiated discount on medical care and prescriptions) and put all of it in a health savings account.  Make sure the health savings account is with someone like ING that pays good interest rates.  Every year, you will be putting away around 12 * 700 = 8400.  Normally your medical bills for even a large family, paying out of pocket, are much much less than 8400.  

In two years you have your deductible saved in cash.  If someone get's cancer, you are covered for that year (the next year you will have to come up with (10k - 8400) more than you would usually pay for insurance, but its fucking cancer, not likely to happen until you are older and on medicare.  (Besides, you have long term disability insurance right?   If you can't go to work due to cancer, but you are fully insured against not being able to work, the cost savings of not having a job will more than make up the gap (gas, car wear and tear) )

So the system only fucks you if you want old-style hmo or ppo coverage.  If you put even half as much effort into planning ahead as the dickhead in this kos article puts into complaining after the fact, the system is not nearly as bad.  What the kos folks want is for everyone to get a free ride regardless of whether they plan for themselves or not.  The european model does seem to be working well, so maybe they have a point in the end.  But you don't have to enter into a suicide pact with Blue Cross either.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The Nazi government at that time was not unlike now.  There was a strong state presence in the economy and all economic policies were guided by the State.  Just like it is in here.

Name a single American invention that exists due to the free market.  Boeing exists as a profitable industry because it gets a huge State subsidy: both in taxes and through the Pentagon for ""defense"".  Until the 1960s (I think, maybe later), the computer industry was entirely State funded.  Once it became a profitable industry it went over to private hands.  Likewise with the Internet which everyone already knows.

The pharmaceutical industry also gets large government subsidies.  Most innovation is made in universities and almost all grants are from the State.

If you want to pretend honesty, you must ask the question why, even after the Cold War, funding for the Pentagon has only increased.  Even today's [Science][] has a news article about how ""Pentagon's research boss is seeking an 11% increase in the Defense Department's science and technology budget for the next fiscal year"".

And if you think you can answer that away with ""War on Terror"", you must explain how it is different from Hitler's techniques.  Hitler whipped up immense hatred of communists, socialists, handicapped, Jews, gypsies and the whole gang of others.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I want to propose a Constitutional Amendment.

During wartime, the offices of the President and Vice President of the United States shall be located at the largest military hospital in the US. It shall become the duty of the President and Vice President to personally lead the efforts to transport and bury the bodies of soldiers who are killed in action and to treat and rehabilitate the soldiers who are wounded in action.  The Vice President shall perform NO other duties while a war is in progress, and for a period of one year after conclusion of the war.  He shall be assisted by the Secretary of Defense.  No US military hospitals may be built outside of the United States which alleviate the responsibility of the President and Vice President to perform these responsibilities.
---
Edit: On a separate note, I want to mention that certain US Presidents were Officers during wars and later, upon becoming President, were ALL successful in keeping the US out of war, to wit: Washington, Jackson, Harrison, Taylor, Pierce, A. Johnson, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur, B. Harrison, and Eisenhower. Teddy Roosevelt and JFK were not generals but were officers and kept this tradition.

The US Presidents who get us INTO war, it seems, are those who have NO military history and who have no appreciation for the hell that it brings.","1194019995"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Well that depends on the competence of the bureaucrat and how well the soldier is at keeping his papers in order.

There's another problem. When you have a war you have a lot of guys trying to get their way into this medical system that hasn't been expanded in the last 40 or so years. 

This creates a lack of doctors, nursing staff, hospital beds, bureaucrats, lawyers, et al. That's a perfect storm of pain in the ass to cut through to get medical treatment.

No planning whatsoever was given to taking care of our wounded soldiers beyond field treatment to get them back on the field. ","1194019997"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Ok...once again, every single one of those comments comes from people talking about what they perceive other people's positions are.  Not one is someone saying ""this is my position as a libertarian"".  

Libertarians do talk about smaller government, less embargoes, less military, less corporate handouts.  And yes they do advocate not making things illegal unless it actually harms someone (""if I'm not hurting you, leave me the hell alone"").  Those are all positions I have heard directly from them. 

However your accusals of isolationism, lack of social commitment and interaction do not come from libertarians.  They come from you, and from people who *infer* that that is a libertarian position.  You have no backing for those conclusions, and they are flat out wrong bro. give it up.","1194020187"

So kill off the military first - biggest waste of money the government has, and then maybe there's some common ground.  

But you do need to realize that you're gonna pay for living around other people.  You either pay for their education or prison, health care, or indigent burial with loss of access to emergency services, birth control, or welfare (or, I guess you can skip to indigent burial) but it is still gonna cost you.

Let's assume for a minuet that we make nicotine illegal.  Let's see what happens:

price of a cigarette rises to $10 (a typical price for one does of any street drug).  a pack is now $1600.  A pack-a-day smoker needs to spend $4800/month to support his habit.  Maybe he loses his house and turns to crime.  Maybe he cannot afford treatment anymore.  There are no nicotine patches on the market b/c nicotine is illegal.  Drug runners fear arrest and no longer deal in tobacco as its too bulky and easy to detect.  Tar is extracted from tobacco leaves in Mexico and is smuggled into the us.  In order to smoke the sticky resin you need a glass resin pipe, aka a crack pipe to consume it.  Smokers hide their habbits and develop slang names for nicotine so they can speak in code.  Thugs make fortunes smuggling bricks of sticky black tar and become rappers singing about Bakko and bitches and limos.  All harm reduction disappears.  There are not more Surgeon General's warnings.  No more reasonable ""stop smoking"" adds on TV.  Now you just have people breaking eggs and saying this is what Bakko does to your brain.

Far fetched? 

No way.  Nicotine is the most addictive drug known to man.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; But the current bizarre theocratic regime hasn't been in power for 100 years has it?

All right.  So how about we first take care of a bizarre regime that *has* been in power for 7 years and caused an unbelievable amount of grief and sorrow and death around the world?

Then we'll talk about a bizarre regime that might be theocratic and insane but is yet to launch an attack on anyone else.

&gt; They are different in that Christianity and Judaism have both undergone reformations and a degree of amelioration from literal fundamentalism to the point where fundamentalists are acknowledged as the odd, out-on-a-limb exceptions.

And you have done extensive research on how the Islamic world has undergone changes, have you?  Stop this pretense.

&gt; As far as I understand, as a Muslim, you must believe in the Koran as the inerrant literal word of God. Only the whackos think that's true of the Torah or the Bible.

The same is true of Christianity.  Most people you meet do not take it that way.  That is irrelevant.

&gt; The three Abrahamic religions are different in that respect.

Jesus was a pacifist.  I would say the West has regressed morally from what Jesus was.

&gt; That's rather masturbatory of you

Honestly, I would rather masturbate than waste time discussing this.  Yet I am.  Shows how masochistic I am.

&gt; rather than invent your own comment and argue with yourself

LOL.  Is that what you think?  I quoted what I had written because you had ignored what I had written.","1194020250"
