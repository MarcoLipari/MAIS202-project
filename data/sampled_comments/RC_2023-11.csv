But don't blame, let those emotions happen, understand that even if your so called flaws are the reason for the problem (doesen't sound like it) you still have the right to feel wronged, feel sad or hurt.
I hope the stuff with your parents gets better but if they keep letting you down i would suggest seeking help.with other relatives, school adults, friends and such. Sometimes you need that kind of support and getting it is more important than appeasing your mother.",1698796800.0

"autism","t5_2qhs6","You should talk to your child, and ask them what's happening, but be understanding.

This doesn't seem minor at all, and when you start ignoring such problems, bigger ones are sure to follow.

Going to school is surely important, but it isn't essential, maybe you should wait a couple of years until they are more prepared to start going.

But I'd consider homeschooling if that's an option for you.

Me, my mom, and my three siblings are all autistic. We all have school-related trauma, and except for one of my brothers, we all chose to homeschool,,
 as the eldest, I spent over 15 years in ""normal school"", and taught my siblings myself. It doesn't need to be a permanent thing, just homeschool them until they are ready. If you find it better that way, then keep it that way.

You need to be able to accept that this may not be a possibility for your child, they might be able to meet these expectations, but they might not, and as a parent, it's important to be supportive, and stand by them no matter the outcome.

There are many ways you can introduce your son to social activities and interactions with other kids without being inside a toxic environment. I would personally recommend joining the scouts, investing in hobbies (especially those related to special interests), introducing him to your friend's kids, and meeting autistic peers.

Nonetheless, you should go to school, and speak up, as they could be straight up taking it from him, bullying is unfortunately extremely common, even for those who aren't minorities, and especially for those that are.

Also, you should not expect your child to sort out the problem on their own, they won't be able to, might make things worse while trying, or may just accept it as their fate or as a part of life.

The tendency is for it to get worse, so no matter the solution you find more appropriate, you should act now.

I'm just a random person on the internet, I am biased as all humans, and I'm not a licensed psychiatrist, lawyer or doctor. My ""autistic teacher with 10+ years of experience sense"" is ticking and it could mean absolutely nothing, personal past experience is not a significant useful reference for serious matters, all relevant matters should be discussed with the involved. My personal tale is by no means direct advice or instruction relatable to your situation. Everything I and everyone else says should be taken with a grain of salt.

Have a nice day, at the time of reading and at all future days as well. May your existence be a happy one, best wishes for your partner and child.",1698796800.0

"Genshin_Impact_Leaks","t5_3l2acu","OT: I've been looking into knife fighting recently, both modern and older techniques, for the general interest of martial arts as well as game design, and I've found the Navaja to be particularly balanced, ergonomic, and with good blade design. Almost, annoyingly good, for how old of a knife it is.

>!I can't take it anymore. I'm sick of the Navaja. I try bowie knives. My Navaja has better ergonomics. I try modern fighting knives. My Navaja has better balance. I try Japanese tanto. My Navaja has better blade angle. I want to do snap cuts. The Navaja is best at them. I want to try Styers, Fairbairn styles - they both are great with the Navaja. It grabs me by the throat. I train with it. I cut boxes with it. I hone its edge. It isn't satisfied. I buy a Portuguese reproduction. ""This isn't built for combat"" it tells me. ""Give me modern materials."" It takes up so much space in on my shelves I can't have any other knives around. ""You just need to make me in a better steel. I can cut better with magnacut."" I can't afford magnacut, I don't have enough money. It grabs my credit card. It declines. ""Guess this is the end."" The latch flaps as the knife opens with its distinct 'Carraca'.

1. divide the Palestinian front

"texts","t5_2sbrh","Low key is usually best initially. I think my comment got downvoted too much about being cringe. Nothing is 100% in dating. It’s really in the eye of the beholder. Take a woman for instance who has been stalked by someone. They may feel cringe if someone comes off as being too attached early. We have all seen the psychos who get too into a girl too early on in this subreddit. Is your comment anything like that, no, but I bet a psycho somewhere said “I like you a lot” initially or “I’m really into you” or “I’m looking forward to more dates with you” or something along those lines. They can be scary after a first date. Women have learned a lot over generations and generations, that if a guy comes off too clingy early, it can be scary/dangerous. Keep it fun and light conversation in texts and ask for another date. I also don’t like to get into too much texting with someone early as well. You think you are developing rapport, but honestly, texting rapport doesn’t equal actual rapport. you aren’t. I generally use texting, etc as a way to schedule dates, etc. I might check in and say “I hope you had a good day at work!” Or something super light like that to let them know I thought of them. I however, won’t ask “How was your day at work?”. Why? Because that is asking for a response and I don’t ever want to pressure for a response unless I am trying to schedule a date.

Another thing you could do instead of saying what you did is to bring up something that was fun “OMG that thrasher dude with the knife TOTALLY scared me!!” Or “I had a lot of fun last night! I never have been to a haunted house as good as that one”. If she isn’t into you, you will get a delayed response, etc. Or if she replies, go with that line of conversation but then say “So what are you doing Friday night? Want to grab a drink?” Trust me, ignore the people who think that my comment was out of line. The people who downvoted me are being nice to you because you got hurt (and you handled it VERY well), and you generally seem like a great guy. 

Also, she may have said the same shit even if you said something more light hearted. We don’t know so don’t beat yourself up about it at all. I am really just suggesting for the future. 

Also, I went on a date in 2021 with this girl that I thought we clicked, and I was kinda into her, but I texted her the next day or something and she took a few days to respond. I just figured she wasn’t that into me. No big deal, I did like you, and handled it like a gentleman, and I didn’t text her anymore. Guess who texted me about 7 months later. Guess who is my gf of two years now…. So the way you handled yourself will be remembered and if she has single friends, she would suggest you to others because you of how you handled yourself. I’ve had someone I dated briefly suggest me to at least two of her friends that turned into some good times.",1698796801.0

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","So, it's not simple to explain because these things change pretty often. The mainstay in the US arsenal is the AIM-9, which was first introduced in 1956 and is still in use, after dozens of variations. Modern ones are nothing like the originals, apart from being heat-seeking air-air missiles (apart from Ukraine's recent adaptation of them into shoulder mount - yikes.)

But in basic terms, you have a forward looking infrared sensor that looks for a heat target, does some calculations on its speed and trajectory and calculates an intercept. But it's not as dumb as that - in all cases the missile needs to be given a target and it sticks to that target - it won't look for some arbitrary heat source. Newer ones kind of fingerprint the target so it knows what the heat signature should look like, and may identify the kind of aircraft and act accordingly. 

Very old AIM-9s could be defeated by flares - small burning magnesium that was hotter than the engine, but that was overcome by looking at the size of the heat source and sticking with the consistent source - so the flares would need to be the same angular size and heat as the engine. This is why the sun isn't a countermeasure. If it's a twin engine plane, the flares would need to present two heat sources with the right separation. Even newer AIM-9s can do head-on intercepts - the plane that launches it gives the missile the target and the missile picks up the radiated heat signature around the plane. They are quite sensitive and really difficult to defeat - modern AIM-9s almost never miss. The ones for use in the F-35 can get their target after being launched, so they can use the F-35 feature of signing the target through the pilots helmet rather than pointing the plane at the target, so if there is a plane on an intercept from the side, they can launch the missile, look at the intercepting plane, and signal the missile to target that plane and it'll turn and do that. 

Basically, the missiles upgraded from really quite stupid forward looking IR sensors, to modern optics that can do detailed pattern/image matching.

Another aspect that is usually overlooked is the speed of the sensor/action loop, which has increased a lot with cheap advanced computing. If the old system could operate at 1hz (one sensor reading to one instruction to change the rocket trajectory) and the plane being targeted could put out 20 flares, there's basically no way the chasing rocket could process 20 signals fast enough to stick to the right target. But a modern system operating at 120hz or faster (120 readings per second) would have no problem with that, isolating the correct signature and then sticking on it. This is a big part of why quadcopters weren't a thing and then suddenly everywhere - there's a minimum threshold for completing the sensor/actuator cycle that allows it to fly, and without enough computational power in a small enough package, you can't fly, and above that you can. Double it, and you can fly through trees at full speed (smartphones made that all possible).  

But the simple answer is that a modern heat seeking missile is going to hit you, flares or no. That's not very dramatic for our movie protagonist, though. Who knows how modern Russia's missiles are - they have a handful of very modern ones and then apparently mountains of decades old ones. One thing the US is pretty good at is downcycling old munitions, which is why our Ukraine packages basically cost the US nothing. The equipment we're sending Ukraine is stuff we consider to be useless and would replace anyway. It's suitable for the equipment Ukraine has, but would waste the capability of what the US has.",1698796802.0

Having kids learn from a structured curriculum designed to teach them to do things properly is important. Many parents do not have the knowledge or ability to properly teach their children how to exersise safely and healthily, but teachers can be trained to do so.

Also, some aspects of PE relies on having multiple people doing the activities together. You can't learn proper sportsmanship and teamwork on your own. You can't learn to spot someone at the gym if you have nobody to spot.

> Then kids can exercise without the judgment of their friends or the teacher

Judgement is not something that should come into it. It's clear you have some trauma from being judged for exercising as a kid, but it doesn't have to be that way.

MSP has a light rail that goes directly to the airport, and Mall of America so if you live around there you have easy access to a massive shopping, dinning, and entertainment area + the airport for minimal fees. Same train goes all the way to downtown as well.   


Dunno much about DTW's transit other than it's cheap to get around.  


ORD has some cheaper areas but you need to be real careful where you go at night especially. Very high crime rates in some areas.  


BOI is a smaller base in a smaller-ish city which has been growing rapidly for a few years. Was my first base when I was with them and it's a totally different experience for a large metroplex/city. Housing there has been rising but still somewhat affordable, very car dependent though   


COS/FAT/TUS/PSP are all tiny and you won't get in as a new hire  


SAN is very senior and expensive.  


LAX/SFO both expensive

Just wanted to fact check that (hobby of mine, nothing against you), the A-4's payload isn't 24 500 pounds, that's the max takeoff weight. The payload on the pylons should be more like 8 500 pounds.

Originally I wanted to check whether this was partially a subsonic vs. supersonic design thing, if you design just for subsonic you can usually make the wings have a lot higher lift to drag ratio (supersonic likes thin wings).

Fun fact: The Scooter's gross weight is about 16k pounds. With full tanks and the large centerline fuel bag, the F-4E can carry that much weight in just fuel. =)

(7 550 liters main tank, 2300 liters central bag, total 9 850 liters, times about 0.75 for the fuel density vs. water, divided by 0.4536 to convert to pounds = \~16 300 pounds.)",1698796804.0

"AskPhysics","t5_2sumo","Well, Kinetic energy tells you how the momentum actually transfers. In an elastic collision, kinetic energy is conserved, which you can use to derive the momenta of the two bodies after collision. If kinetic energy isn't conserved, that means some of the energy is converted into a different form and the momenta of each body will respond differently, but the total momentum remains the same. Momentum is always conserved, but kinetic energy not always. 

This is assuming a closed system, with no interaction with the environment, such as friction. It also assumed that all the momentum remains in the two bodies, and no other particles (even massless photons) are released.",1698796805.0

Also, per Fangraphs, it’s 3.2 WAR. So depending on which defensively metric you go by (BRef vs Fangraphs), he was anywhere from a slight bargain to a massive one. 

Suarez was not the problem. The problem was spending 18th most in the 12th biggest media market. The difference between 18th and 12th in 2023 was $53m. 

It’s okay though - I lived through the wasting of the primes of Griffey, Randy, Edgar, Ichiro, and Felix. Living through the wasting of the primes of Julio, Raleigh, Kirby, and Gilbert won’t be the thing that tips me over. 

(Note: I hope I’m wrong and Stanton allows Dipoto to go after either Ohtani this offseason or Soto next offseason, fill in the roster on short term deals like JD Martinez and Sonny Gray, and then Murakami and Sasaki in the following two offseasons [when they’re posted] once Marco, Suarez, and White are all off the books.)",1698796805.0

It’s important to discuss what you mean by first, and make sure you trust him.

You’re certainly at a much lower chance if neither of you have been sexually active before. Technically things like moluscum, hepatitis, and HIV can technically spread without sex, but that’s considerably unlikely. 

Raw is never completely safe, but then again no sex is, and this is one of the safest possible situations to have unprotected sex in.

"SeattleWA","t5_2vbli","I’m genuinely trying to understand how that is what she literally said. If that’s what she literally said, she would have said “The October 7th attacks were justice”. She’s asking “Why does our timeline for justice start on October 7th?”

Sure, both sentences have the word “Justice” in them but they are not semantically equivalent, so could we not pretend like they are?

This kind of feels like a case of hearing the implication that is most convenient to whoever is listening. You can assume that she meant “October 7th was an event that was justice” or you could assume she meant “When we evaluate what we consider as just, why do we not look at things that happened before October 7th?”.

I personally think the latter is more consistent with what she’s said: she mentions “timeline of events” I.e plural and not singularly October 7th - presumably including the following bombardments and hence making an argument about how we should evaluate Israel’s response. She also mentions the UN secretary general who made a similar point which gives me a little more confidence that was the point she was making . 

Hold whatever view you want on this issue but there’s a big difference between saying “Hamas’ attack is justice” and saying “It is important to discuss the context that led up to Hamas’ attack when we consider what is just” and while I think her point was the latter, more importantly, it doesn’t really sound like one can conclude with confidence that the former is what she meant (unless you can tell me why it is more likely to be the point that she’s making than the latter or how her statement is semantically equivalent to what is in the headline?) 

So yeah these kinds of sensationalist headlines (from either side) don’t do anyone any favors",1698796807.0

"shoresy","t5_4kyqe3","Yeah, for sure! I hear you about the way my rural comment may have come across, and I didn’t mean it in a sweeping always/never sort of way, and I am just speaking from personal experience growing up in rural Michigan with tons of relatives and friends who may say things like f*g and tr*nny, but would punch a TERF for me with no hesitation. We can’t expect our real life, concrete allies to know every term or what’s “correct,” especially in today’s day and age when identity is so amorphous and complex. Imperfect but concrete allyship will always matter more than policing how people speak like some sort of puritanical zealots, in my opinion.

That said, yeah, some of the comments on here have been ugly and mean spirited and not at all in the spirit of the show. And I feel for OP because they got driven off the thread before more reasonable and compassionate people started commenting, but it is really tough to have any sort of discussion about the intent of the scene or the writing when somebody is having a gut reaction to an (incredibly valid) trigger. I’ve been so disappointed in the shoresy post going around on r/trans because it’s full of people jumping to conclusions and painting the cast and crew in a light that’s not only false but also blatantly ignorant of the real world advocacy a lot of them engage in on their own time. So now there’s just a fuckton of people who are under the impression that Jared Keeso, Jacob Tierney, & everybody else who’s a part of the show is a bigot and transphobe, which could not be further from the truth if you look at their behavior outside of this (fictional!!!) scene.

Anyways, as much as I too crave nuanced discussion, the hotter heads won the day and I’m left rather disheartened at how much has been said in bad faith, you know? But ah well, not everybody is going to like or understand every piece of media, and I should probably make my peace with our society’s collective lack of media literacy lmao.",1698796807.0

also part of my approach is to just write a whole ton then cut away the stuff that's not awesome. 

another thing that weirdly helps me is to not ask 'how should i write this part' but 'how would a supremely GREAT writer write this part?' and it opens my mind to other ideas i might not have thought of. even though i am the one thinking of them.",1698796808.0

Em is a better rapper than he was at his so called prime, it's just that style and music in general does not sell.

To say it isn't as good as his best is ridiculous and I'd love to hear why. His older albums were able to grab the youth due to content/ridiculousness

But his new stuff holds the generations due to deep meaning, intense skill, layers.

I just dunno what your point is. Em is more relevant than those three as indicated by fans, sales, content, skill, what you think he's lacking?",1698796808.0

The basics:

- use *black* ink on single sheet of *white* paper 

- clearly print your exact account name, the name of this subreddit, and today's full date (include the year and a non-numeric/written month, like 'October 31 2023' or 'Oct 31 23'). 

- take 3+ pictures of you holding the sign, bending the paper slightly in your fingers, with visible nudity in multiple pictures 

- upload them to a single album on reddit.com (using the reddit mobile app) or vidble.com (if you only have access to a web browser (reddit hosting requires their mobile app)). NOTE: as of May 15th 2023 imgur.com will no longer allow nudity - if you have previous posts there you are welcome to delete and reupload them to reddit. 

- make a 'link' post on this subreddit that links directly to the album with 'verification' or 'verify' (and correct gender tags) in the title 

- wait until a mod responds on your verification post before posting here further (it may take a few hours, please be patient)

"truezelda","t5_2tfzp","So let's reimagine this just a little bit. Let's say Breath of the Wild kept virtually the entire same design, but in the intro shrines instead of Slate powers you get the strength to push and lift, the grip to climb, the paraglider and the stamina to swim.

In turn the slate powers are allocated to being mid-dungeon upgrades obtained within the Divine Beasts, necessary to activate two of the terminals (plus whatever minor redesigns necessary to accommodate this) -- i.e. Cryonis within Vah Ruta (necessary to beat Waterblight  Ganon), bombs within Vah Rudania, Magnesis within Vah Nabooris, stasis within Vah Medoh.

Further, the power of all four beasts is necessary to blast open the cocoon where Zelda has struggled to keep Ganon sealed.

With only *that much change,* how much better did I just make the game? I didn't even touch durability and *barely* touched the dungeon designs. Didn't touch any shrine designs except the first four, so if you don't have the intended tool to complete the shrine, *suck it* and hope your creativity is enough to cheese it, or just come back later.",1698796809.0

https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/a42868467/ai-flies-fighter-jet-first-time/

We've had auto land since like the 70s or something, so it's just the sky part we need to do now. 

Flying is actually super simple *when things go right*. Idk if you've ever tried it but you can do a test flight and in your very first flight with 0 training they'll let you take control of the plane. Now, it takes forever to be a good pilot who can handle when stuff goes wrong. That's the hard part aha. But, probably not very hard for ai.

The hard part about cars is accounting for all the different cities and how weird everything can be. Lines on the road eroded, traffic signs all in different positions or discolored or spray painted slightly, etc etc etc. That's why Tesla and GM and everyone keeps failing over and I er. Dynamic control is hard. BUT, for single city hard coded systems we've had working ai taxis for almost a decade now, fully working self driving single city taxis. 

Planes don't have that stuff about the locality. The sky is the sky, it's wide open and the same everywhere. And airports are all very standardized, it's a straight line! 

Now I don't think passenger ai planes will come any time soon, but ai planes are already being tested and I'd bet within 10 years will be fully working and up for sale for other stuff. Like maybe ups or whatever type shipments",1698796809.0

Also, fwiw: the joke in The Office isn't about this; it's trying to say that biking is a turn off. It was a different time. Also, if you live in a major city women tend to be attracted to bikers because of the culture associated with them and because it means you're at least a little fit.

[The overall impact of doubling recent immigrant inflows is positive on New Zealand-born workers, but small; raising employment rates by between 1.4% to 1.8% and wage rates by 0.2% to 1.9% depending on the model assumptions.](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/2852-impact-immigration-labour-market-outcomes-pdf)

[The strongest wage and employment impact of a change in the number of recent migrants falls on recent migrants themselves. Our CES 
estimates imply that doubling the size of recent migrant inflows lowers the wages of recent  migrants by 4% to 14% and lowers their employment rates by 10% to 13%… The impact on New Zealand-born workers of a doubling of recent migration inflows is positive but small –
raising employment rates by between 1.4-1.8% and wage rates by 0.2-1.9% depending on the model assumptions. The only evidence we find of negative impacts of recent migrants on wages for New Zealand-born workers is when we increase the relative skill-composition of the 
recent migrant inflows; this has a small negative impact on the wages of high-skilled New Zealand-born workers which is offset by a small positive impact on the wages of medium skilled New Zealand-born workers.”](https://www.productivity.govt.nz/assets/Documents/Impacts-of-immigration-on-the-labour-market-and-productivity.pdf) and [the original article](https://www.motu.nz/our-research/population-and-labour/migration/the-impact-of-immigration-on-the-labour-market-outcomes-of-new-zealanders/)",1698796810.0

I got these as a box about 2 years ago having heard initial good things and even after a few months of hyper care back then they were pretty raw and that dry earth soil taste was overpowering. I've let them sit and they've come ok eventually, but I bought them based on the hype at the time which seemed to be overwhelmingly positive but I never really saw it or tasted it.

Positive things are they are really well constructed and burn superbly. The maduro wrapper is tasty too and that certainly gets better with time.

Those are 6x60s and they go for a lot more now than I paid for them but I still don't get the acclaim given to them even now. Maybe it's just me.

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","It is mostly dependent on what devices truly need ethernet and for what purpose. For example, future Gaming Consoles and PCs will better saturate the full 2.5 gig interface, while a Phillips Hue Hub barely needs 10Mb. For ethernet devices, a different ethernet hub plugged into multiple ports will do better, especially with your solution of a cheaper router with all 2.5G ports, to be able to split 5Gig effectively across multiple ethernet devices. 

However, most devices like phones, wireless assistants (Google, Amazon, etc.), and streaming sticks will do better over wifi, especially with WiFi 6E where devices that will use it will get closer to surpassing the 1G ethernet ports and don't need to worry about latency or disconnect issues as much. 

Tl;dr: Ethernet would be better over a Hub than from a router if connected to multiple ports of Modem, while most other devices will saturate and use WiFi 6/6E  so having better range before issues is a better future proof for wireless devices and Hub for ethernet.",1698796810.0

The Irishman then handed his drink back to the attendant and said, ""Me, too, I didn't know we had a choice.""",1698796811.0

"Habs","t5_2r10m","I think the habs have enough other pieces to acquire future assets that if Monahan is healthy come new year and amiable to a 3-5 year deal at a reasonable aav I think they should sign him.

I have seen too many teams spend too many years trading off potentially key pieces because they are pending ufas, Monahan fills any role asked of him and is clearly relied on and viewed as a key veteran.

With Caufield and Suzuki both signed long term and in their prime there’s no reason why the habs shouldn’t be building.

If the key was future assets don’t trade for Newhook, who may not amount to more than a 3rd liner. 

Monahan had terrible luck with injuries, but last years injury was more of a fluke than anything, and he already lost a bunch of his jump and speed from pre injury so there’s no reason to think he’ll drop off significantly in the next 3-5 years.

Center depth is the most important asset in the league, I really hope they push hard to sign him at a reasonable aav deal.",1698796811.0

Some small dogs like heelers should never be in a big city, while some big dogs just sleep all day and do fine. But it also depends on personality. You might do well to adopt a big dog that's known to be lazy. Regardless, in my dog training opinion, **almost all city dogs should live near a dog run or park.** Only a handful of dogs are bred to be in small spaces without a park (think lap/royalty dogs).

"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","In game it's mostly referred to as a ""blessing"". More precisely Character Story 5 (req. Friendship Lv 6)

\[...\] On the night of Diona's seventh birthday, as the moonlight reflected off the spring and upon her face, she heard the soft voice of the spring fairy.  
""I will bless you, daughter of hunters, for your days ahead, and as a farewell. May your cup always run over with the sweet wine of celebration. May it always be refreshing as springs of ever-melting snow."" \[...\]

Every since she received her blessing she is unable to make anything that tastes bad. She has tried hundreds of combinations using the most disgusting ingredients, but once she turns them into a ""cocktail"" they become a *sweet and most refreshing beverage*.

Her hangout involves mixing some particularly disgusting drinks and serving them to people.

In the recent event ""Waterborne Poetry"" we were introduced to ""Callirhoe"" who turned out to be the oceanid who lived in Springvale and also to be the spring fairy who blessed Diona all the way back then. There was some emotional cutscene resolving some leftover issues for Callirhoe before her departure.

Technically speaking this makes Diona blessed. Practically speaking it's a curse she cant overcome.",1698796812.0

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","I covered that in the post.

Imagine you have a car that can go 60 miles per hour. 

If you manage to shrink everything about the car to 1/2, (and ignoring things like air resistance and many other things) Then consider how fast it would go.

How does a car go? It spins its wheels. If the wheels are smaller, the only way for the car to go 60 mph is by spinning the wheels faster. 

Do you think that the spartan who could run lets say 30 mph when he is 8.5 feet tall can still run 30 mph when he is 38 mm tall?

While its different mechanical forces, the same principle is at play. If you had the bolt flying as fast as it was flying when it was 68 times bigger, then you are INCREASING its RELATIVE speed (68x). 

It is certainly a concept you could explore, but you would need to stipulate that you are changing that rule. We are already ignoring lots of other factors so its not a big deal to ignore 1 more, but it would need to be specified.",1698796813.0

There are different valid answers to this theological question. 

Add to that that even Augustine wasn’t sure  
If this is valid theology. The word limbo means “in the margin” because when he first came up with the idea that the unbaptized children go to a paradise other than heaven Augustine put a note in the margin of the text for his editors to check if it was valid theology.

We found that while the foreskin was more sensitive to fine touch, it was not more sensitive to the other stimuli we used, and those stimuli are likely more important in sexual pleasure.”

It was very obvious to me that these folks were much more inexperienced and less emotionally mature compared to people around my age. It’s not a bad thing at all, it’s just very noticeable. That’s why I immediately just think that, if someone is with a much younger person - a person of whose brain may still be developing (stops at around age 25), of whom they don’t have much in common with, things to talk about or experiences they can emotionally bond over, the only thing left is for the sexual gratification, and/or to “show off” to their peers.

I’m not quite a Christian anymore, but I am a part of a Quaker meeting that does accept lgbt people wholeheartedly because we do not see why God should care. The outward appearance of a relationship does not determine its quality, and to claim some types are inherently sinful seems to embrace the letter of the law instead of the spirit of compassion we are supposed to have.

"BreakUp","t5_2r8tk","That heart sinking feeling in your chest is the worst kind of pain I have ever experienced but yes it does go away. Mine did ease a little after a friend of mine told me about an analogy from her therapist.

She said grief is like a box with a ball in it and a pain button on one side. In the early stages, the ball is very big. You cannot move the box without it frequently hitting the pain button. It rattles around on its own in there and hits the button over and over again, sometimes so much that it feels like you can’t stop it – you can’t control it – it just keeps hurting.

But as time goes on, the ball gets smaller. It doesn’t disappear completely and when it hits the pain button, it’s just as intense, but generally, it is easier to get through each day. 

For me personally, the first couple of weeks was intense pain and I lost my appetite but as time went on, I get that feeling a lot less. It still hurts thinking I have lost my person with whom I had envisioned my entire future but gradually I am healing and I hope you do too. You will miss all the memories you made with your person but just remember that if they wanted it to work, you wouldn’t be in this position. They knew how much it would hurt you to not be with them anymore but they still couldn’t give you what you wanted. We all deserve someone who will make you believe in love again and you’ll look back at this as a life experience. Just hang in there, it does get better with time. Keep yourself busy and spend as much time with your friends and family as you can. Write stuff down if it helps, cry it out then focus on moving ahead in life. You’ve got this!",1698796817.0

And I’m trying to be a negative Nelly: I just work with education. Countries like Australia, NZ, Ireland, England, are starting to tight their international system. They are thinking about the country, and about the system itself. Canada is only thinking of students, and their fool’s gold. A big change these countries are doing, for instance, is verifying attendance. Canada does not know which students are actually going to school, once they are in the country. I’ve seen students taking, one, two years hiatus from their studies with no damage to their permits whatsoever. In fact, they even renew their visas with no issues. Also, they do have a more strict documents verification: Canada cannot even verify if the letters schools are issuing are real. So yes, Indian students will keep coming, because the Canadian system is flaw, and ease to corrupt.",1698796818.0

"apexuniversity","t5_w42u9","Don’t be afraid of Discord, I’ve met the majority of my friends list on there. It was def hard for me as I’m not an extrovert but like you, solo ranked was not an option anymore. So hopefully I can help. - this may be a bit long so I apologize if that’s not what you need, then just ignore it the rest of my comment. But I’ll try to cover your concerns with my experience 

~~~ 

It is true that you might run into toxic players, but it’s no different than SoloQ - just leave after the match and remove them from your friends list. If it’s particularly awful then block them. 

Also true that you won’t vibe with every person, which is well known. If you aren’t feeling it - they probably aren’t either. So just be honest and say that you don’t find playstyles compatible or something like that. If you don’t feel comfortable saying that on coms then either do the same as you’d do for a toxic person (maybe msg them in discord after and say that they’re nice/gg but don’t think there’s compatibility or playstyles after removing them). With this though, I usually went with a 3-4 game rule - nobody is perfect and ppl make mistakes. So if they aren’t obnoxious or just clash personnalities, give it an honest try. B/c it does suck when you find someone but accidentally have a bad game or make a dumb play and get dipped on immediately (which may happen to you). However after a couple games, you can differentiate from those that just made a mistake vs those that don’t know better yet (everyone’s on their own journey of improvement). 

If they’re kind but not skilled enough (*in your opinion* - everyone has a threshold where it’s just too much of a gap in skill for ranked) then just say that one of you’re IRL friends logged in and you’re going to play with them - leave and then remove them from your list if you want. *with this, don’t post in discord again, unless you’re comfortable with it being blatantly obvious you were lying* Instead just DM those posting. 

In terms of actually posting, idk if you’ve been on there yet. But you can usually tell a bit about someone based on what they write or how they write it so use that to infer on who to trial.

It can take time to sift through people sometimes, but you’ll find people who mesh well. With a little bit of patience+persistence. Best of Luck out there!",1698796819.0

Unfortunately, I have experience dealing with people in psychosis, and a wrong step can lead to putting herself or yourself in danger.  


Please do not try to use logic like 'why aren't you dead yet' to talk her out of delusions: speaking like this only pushes them further into it and makes them think you are ""in on it."" This can be dangerous for you (although I will point out that most people in psychosis are non-violent, those who do become violent believe their lives are at risk and therefore must take extreme action to save themselves).  


Equally, don't confirm the delusions either. Instead, focus on emotion if she insists on talking about it and you can't distract her (always try. distracting first). For example, when  she talks about delusions of assassins, you could say 'you must be really scared, is there anything I can do to help you feel safe?'

How long can you live without water? Israel created an embargo on all the things necessary for people to have WATER.

That would be true if Israel wasn’t *restricting* the effort. If they don’t want to help, they should not restrict. If they choose to restrict as an Occupying Force, then they have to help, or allow others in the International Community to provide aid. They can’t *prevent* help and not be responsible for providing it. I can say it over and over again a million different ways until you finally understand it. 

I didn’t write these laws. If you want to change International Humanitarian Law, just remember, these are the rules that will apply if someone creates a military occupation of where you live. You might want to think twice about this.

Israel's current genocidal rampages against Palestinians in the Gaza strip is the latest brutal horror of the capitalist system- a system that is built on dispossession, exploitation and imperialist competition. It also reveals a world that is starkly divided- as evidenced by the standoff between masses of ordinary people that are protesting for Gaza across the world, and the international ruling class, who are complicit in reinforcing this oppression, from Biden to Albanese.

The fight for socialism is a fight for a world run by ordinary people, and built around democracy and solidarity- the polar opposite of capitalism. This is the kind of system we need to win a free Palestine, and to end racism and war everywhere.

Come along to this discussion to hear a radical perspective on struggle for a free Palestine and get involved in the socialist left.

"Methadone","t5_2sz9e","Hey so I know obviously the hood idea would to be get off methadone but my life has been changed ever since I was 13. I had a really bad broken leg, it was upside down and facing downwards and shit. Anyways it got infected with the worse infection possible, had to get skins grafts, lots metal in my leg and 13 surgery’s at the age of 13. My doctor took em off opiates after 2 and half years, after going from Oxy, to hydros, to tramadaol because he was a orthopedic surgeon dr not a pain management doc that could prescribe opiates forever, he would lose his license prescribing them anymore. I had extra bottles at ho e and my parents , mom being a RN nurse thinking I didn’t need to go pain management and get opiates thought I would ok. And I wasn’t. My gf felt bad so she started getting opiates for me from my one of her aunts, then my uncle dying form cancer had the strong oxycodone syrup, she would grab me some of that, and then after that she got me stuff from him, he was dying so he gave him So much extra that I never took anything he actually needed. After that I got in touch with of my aunts that my family dishoned. I started getting dilaudid from her for the past 5 years. I’m 20. Got a huge tolerance, and they are honestly not as good as Oxy. They are good once and while but not all the time. I’ve gotten methadone in the last 2 month and stopped talking to my aunt. I used to do heroin for the past year from the darkweb. I still use on top of methadone. In the 2 weeks tho I haven’t really used except for an Oxy 15 only 2 times in the last 2 weeks",1698796820.0

"DataHoarder","t5_2x7he",">I'll admit, I have no idea how to use GitHub and am intimidated by it.

You can download without using github, first, download ""Go"" (https://go.dev/dl/), then you can open Powershell, and run this command  
go install github.com/Lofter1/anyflip-downloader@latest  
So, it is practically installed, and all you have to do is open powershell or cmd, and use the command to download any PDF  
anyflip-downloader <url to book>  


\---- Only do this part if you receive an error trying to download the pdfs

Some may give an error ""Could not find page count"" when you download the pdf, this link can teach you how to fix it (https://github.com/Lofter1/anyflip-downloader/issues/19)  
But, in summary, go to the folder where you installed ""GO"", then, to where anyflip-downloader is (probably the folder will be C:\\Users\\YourUser\\go\\pkg\\mod\\github.com\\!lofter1\\anyflip -downloader@v0.1.6), there you will find the file (configjs.go), change it with the text editor of your choice, changing the line that has the command  
r := regexp.MustCompile(""\\""?(bookConfig\\\\.)?totalPageCount\\""?\[=:\]\\""?\\\\d+\\""?"")  
I'm  
r := regexp.MustCompile(""\\""?(bookConfig\\\\.)?pageCount\\""?\[=:\]\\""?\\\\d+\\""?"")  
So, open PowerShell in the folder, and use the following commands  
Go Build  
It is  
Go Install  
So I believe it will fix the Could not find page count problem

During WW2 there 4 to 5.318 military were killed and 1.5 to 3 mil died to military (either by nazis or casualties of war) thats a 2 to 1 ratio roughly

During Vietnam- 444k to 666k VC hiding within jungles and civilians and 405k to 627k civilian causlities - 1:1 ratio 

From 03 to 11 in the iraq war there is an estimate of 34k to 71k military combatant to 150k to 1.03 mil that's 1:5 to 1:14 - We got a lot of shit for Iraq and continue for Afghanistan 

So its not about bombing but how effective you are without carelessly killing the surrounding population. Otherwise, you might as save yourself time and effort and drop a nuke and kill everything and everyone.

"motherinlawsfromhell","t5_3cmxa","Treat her like a toddler, basically. 

She doesn't need to know anything other than the time and date to show up. Assign her a ""caregiver"" on the wedding day who's duty it is to babysit her and prevent her from making a scene (a bridesmaid or a trusted, ballsy relative is perfect for this role. Ensure they have a dress or large shawl on hand that will fit MIL if she shows up in something inappropriate.) 

If she tries to debate you on your choices, don't engage. Ie: 

MIL: ""You cannot have a cheese tower instead of a wedding cake, that's so tacky!"" 

OP: *blank stare, turn head and talk to someone else* ""So, Meryl, have you decided what shoes you're wearing yet?"" 

If she tries to get other people on her side, let them know you're not having it. 

AUNTY: ""MIL said you're not having an open bar. That's just not how we do weddings here!"" 

OP: ""MIL is not the one getrong married. If you feel that strongly about it, I'm happy for you to cover the costs? No? Okay, I guess we'll do it our way then."" 

Learn about (effective) boundaries and consequences. Boundaries dictate *your* behaviour, not MIL's. For example, one boundary you might have is that you will not listen to MIL's ""suggestions"". And a consequence you'd have to enforce that boundary is to hang up on her or walk out of the room when she brings it up. 

Being alpha is about being in charge in a cool, calm and collected way. No getting defensive, arguing or justifying your actions because that makes you look weak and like you've done something wrong. You state something (""we're having a childfree wedding"") and that's it. No debate. No one gets a vote except you and your husband.",1698796821.0

Persecuted Willow fans will seek colony rights to a distant arm of the Milky Way where they can finally pursue their niche fandom in peace, (think Pilgrims).

Face it, ""Sherlock Holmes"" refuses to end and go away, and it's been 135 years. Star Wars hasn't even been around a half century.

> You can still fire your Eldritch Blast from your Familiar, so they still get the benefits. With Blade, you can also take Eldritch Smite (Elder Arcanum, 11th level) to apply your EB effects with your attacks.

I think a minor niggle with this is that it kicks in comparatively late. The Tomelock gets their cool patron-flavoured EBs within a few levels, shooting twin beguiling psychic beams by level 6 while the Bladelock just hits things twice.

Obviously, the warlock is still a caster class and shooting EBs regularly is part of the gameplay idea... but the weapon attacks feel so much less flavourful now.

The mentioned bonus action beam will probably help with that but I think it's worth thinking about other ways to pull in some patron flavour - maybe just allowing the bladelock to switch damage types of their pact weapon?

Aside from that, There are wives out there who want to control who their husband pays attention to and who their friends are. I must say in the older generation the wives make everyone miserable until they get their way.

"EDH","t5_2scee","Buy-in: He's a 2-mana little guy, it's really hard to go wrong with him

Requirement: A permanent card goes to your graveyard from anywhere during each of your turns.  This is really easy, but does want some build-around

Payoff: 3 damage to each opponent on each of your turns that they can sac/discard to prevent.  This is pretty mild (as most punisher effects are) but the constant trickle of group slug can add up when he starts really fast.

What you want: You need to have a permanent card go into your graveyard from somewhere on each of your turns.  You could discard it, or lose it from the field, or even mill yourself.  You only need one, though, it's a binary state.  Will you get more than one?  Oh, probably, since you want to guarantee one, but you don't need AS MANY AS POSSIBLE like a standard sacfest affair.

To me, that means you want a potential combined arms strategy.  Personally, I don't think RB is the place for the self-mill strategy.  You CAN buy into it with the likes of [[Mesmeric Orb]] but you don't have the best tools or payoffs.

One thing I notice is that both Zoyowa and most of the tech that comes to mind for himn is very low-slung.  I think you could build an entire deck that only has a couple cards more expensive than 3, and largely lives in 1 or 2.

So, here's some tech that came to mind

[[Oppression]]: Lets you discard provided you cast.  Casting is easy, you'll do it most turns.  Free descend that screws your opponents.

[[Smokestack]]: The most mana-espensive card that came to mind.  Leave on 1.  Descend.  Everybody else suffers.

Fetch Lands: Zoyowa wants all his good fetches.  All 7 of 'em and probably [[Prismatic Vista]] too.  Since he costs 2 and you want him out fast he can't afford many tapped lands, but ideally you could trigger him t2 if you fetch rather than doing a normal land drop.  T2 Descend into commander is a good play and starts the damage rolling

[[Braids, Arisen Nightmare]] -- If you want to keep descending, you need gas.  Braids is gas.  If you go super low to the ground you can sac lands without much trouble.  People will likely just give you cards.  If they don't, that means they sac stuff, which hurts their development and keeps them from challenging you as effectively, and means more Zoyowa damage later.

[[Seal of Fire]]/[[Seal of Doom]]: You know what sucks when you're trying to descend?  Spells, like all the removal you should normally be packing.  You know what doesn't suck?  Enchantments that blow themselves up to do interaction, getting you your descend flag while doing the thing.  Ditto [[Omen of the Forge]]/[[Omen of the Dead]]

[[Doomed Dissenter]]: Eat the guy to descend, get a zombie back to still have board (IIRC you can't descend with tokens so the zombie is mot that awesome but its still more value for your mana, and you can throw it to braids or stax if you're already descending some other way)

[[Attrition]]: Descend, and also kill something worth way more than your cheap little fodder creatures.

[[Reassembling Skeleton]]/[[Persistent Specimen]]/[[Clattering Augur]]: Descend.  Return.  Descend Again.  Augur is expensive but gets you stuff in the process.

[[Sulfuric Vortex]]: More inevitability is better.


Overall, I think Zoyowa is best angled to be this fast-establishing oppressive commander who turns on the inevitability and then stretches the clock to get there.  Flood the field with dirty little guys that like to die and ways to off them that also hurt everyone else, mix in some extra group slug, and you're there.  The big thing is that he's two mana, and can thus start doing his thing before everyone else is ready.  I might come back with a quick draft of a deck.",1698796823.0

"classicalmusic","t5_2qhyq","Very thoughtful comment. Brahms is thought to be so stuffy, stifled, dry, etc. But many of the things he does would be considered quite free or even reckless abandon in a different cultural context, which ironically includes repertoire most of these people also listen to! What does it matter to us how Brahms stacks up in 1880, if we're also listening to music written in 1780?! IMO this gets to the worst state by the time people like Reger or Godowski or even Hindemith or Shostakovich are considered to be so conservative as to be irrelevant! They could be bad or fail, but how could things literally never done before be too conservative? Expectations were put on an exponential curve and people became dismissive based on a superficial evaluation.   


To completely deny the existence or effect of time, legacy, and the musical contexts things came out of would be insincere. It does affect how we judge artists and rightfully so. But on the other hand, many of us also enjoy music in such a sheer sense that it is capable of taking things even in ""dead languages"" and enjoying them the same. The fact that such dialogues can exist, people can pick up embers from a world long gone and forge things completely anew, I think it's a good thing.   


I believe a lot of 20th century enthusiasts became affected by style over substance when they spoke of not being able to write tonal music or what have you, and being too saturated with music of old styles, fail to appreciate what can be possible. In those social circles, for those careers, it might not have been possible. That's a separate matter from what the art achieves on its own. Reason being, to me this stuff is just syntax. So for that reason, I believe there is space to make music which entirely rejects preconceptions about syntax or meaning. There is space to make music which uses new grammar with old words, or old grammar with new words, in various combinations which can't be expressed with such a simplification. Clearly these wise composers like Ligeti and whatnot understood someone like Mozart isn't just ""boring old V I"" and that the whole is more than the sum of its parts due to rhetorical constructions, references, syntax, a rich dialogue of expectations, etc. For that reason, I think it's a free for all.   


To become an artist who is truly a voice of a generation, you have to express things which shine to the culture, there is no way of getting around it. But you can be an artist outside a time and I'll still appreciate it. You don't have to accept the premise that what is relevant to a generation and a moment is what you were put on Earth to do. I don't blame people for doing what it takes to earn a living or to carve out a space for themselves either.",1698796824.0

Sobrang uneasy ng mga friends ko sa thought na makikipagdate ako sa stranger, so sabi nila sasama sila pero manonood na lang from afar. Kaya lang, simula pa lang, nablow up nan yung cover namin. Pinauna ko sila maglakad para di halata na magkakasama kami. Pero nakalimutan kong sobrang bilis ko nga pala maglakad. 😭 nasa likod nila ako directly nung nakasalubong namin yung date ko (na nilampasan ko muna kasi di ko sure kung siya yon). Nagchat siya, sabay sabi ""is that you? I think i saw you with your friends"". 🤦🏽‍♀️

Tapos nung nagcocoffee na kami (we were sitting on tiny chairs facing the street), kitang kita nung guy na nasa katapat na street lang yung mga friends ko and every single time na titingin kami sa kanila, sobrang obvious na umaacting silang di nila kami tinitingnan. 🤦🏽‍♀️

Ang masama pa, akala ko nakahanap na sila ng tataguan na safe pero biglang binulong nung guy sakin na nasa likod daw namin yung friends ko and true enough, nandun nga sila. Bakit ba kasi ang liit ng coffee shop na yon!!! 

Sabi na lang tuloy nung guy na medyo awkward daw for him kasi first time niya yon na-experience. Tapos sabi niya pa, okay naman daw for him to meet my friends para daw hindi puro likod niya nakikita ng friends ko 😭 HAY NAKAKAHIYA!!!

Same deal with LLMs, IMO. Understanding them from first principles would be really, really hard. Few people in the world know them deeply. But you don't need that to be productive. But you do need to use them for various tasks, bang 'em around, and find those limitations yourself.",1698796824.0

"climatechange","t5_2rawx","I find the idea of overpopulation to be overly simplified and a false conclusion.

The concept is that we have a fix amount of resources and therefore a fixed amount to give to each person.  This is completely wrong.  Some resources are technically fixed yes, like anything we mine from the Earth, but those are still available in such vast quantities that it's not really an issue.  By the time we even come close to using them up we'll be mining asteroids and such making them limitless.  This doesn't even account for recycling. 

Most people point to crops, only so much food to go around, but that's just wrong.  We are innovative being, we've multiplied how much food we can create from the same inputs many times over civilization, there's no reason to think we'll stop.  The main reason there are starving people in the world is logistics and politics.  If I ship food to some small village in Africa it'll get intercepted by officials, if not confiscated it'd be taxed at the least.  If it does get by the war lords and gangs and actually get to the village it will be spoiled anyways.  

The solution to all of our problems is innovation and technology, and we need more people to be innovate and invent.  

There are several other things I could say on it, but I think that's the simplest point to make.",1698796825.0

"billiards","t5_2r9yh","May need to carefully pull it up some more to be able to apply some contact cement to both the hand and the underside of the wrap. Need to keep them separated until they flash over then push back down. Use your thumbnails to really push the seam down and together. Get a nylon or very firm rubber  roller or similar to run down the whole seem. If using contact cement and some gets on the finished side don't worry too much you can rub it off after. 

If you use super glue on this and it gets on the finished side it may be a bit more difficult to remove. They make super glue debonder buts it's a solvent of sorts and may screw up the leather. 

I think contact cement is the safest option here. Or send it back for repair.",1698796825.0

Copy oldhome to home preserving ownership/perms (can't think of exact CMD at this sec)

• Rebecca (1940, Hitchcock) has one terrible line reading by a maid.

• Ghost World should’ve had more racial diversity for a movie that deals so much with race.

• Vertigo infamously has an early scene that makes no sense.

• Back to the Future has plot holes, like how did they know the exact *second* (not just minute) the lightning would strike?

•After Hours starts to get a bit repetitious with the main character meeting one wacky woman after another, and again it could’ve had more racial diversity for a movie set in the middle of NYC.

• My Dinner with Andre could’ve been set in a more hip and interesting place instead of a sedate, white-tablecloth restaurant.

"ObsessedNetwork","t5_2vpav5","It’s not about monetizing talent. I fault no creator for that and I support some of my favorites. But you can monetize your talents and still care about your fans. And faking that you care about your fans to capitalize on their willingness to pay for content can go a couple of ways.

It’s no different than a musician, or an actor, or any other form of art. That would be like saying Taylor Swift doesn’t appreciate her fans because she charges for concert tickets.

The difference here is that they attempted to cultivate an appreciation of fans under false pretenses. I was at Obsessed Fest. It was a TINY sliver of their fan base. The attendance showed that.

Honestly the Reddit presence is a tiny sliver of their fan base as of the last verifiable Patreon information.

They know we know. We’re now expendable. If they speak to what has happened, then they have more people to answer to that would have never been aware. And that’s a HUGE financial risk.

Better to bury heads in the sand and continue earning from those oblivious, and replace those that leave. If you consider that everyone on Reddit is “against” them at this point (and they aren’t, but we’re just playing the extreme hypotheticals here) that’s 25% of their fan base at MOST. Certainly that will hit a pocketbook, but not as much as potentially alienating yourself to 100% of your fan base.

And so, the dollar is more important than the fan. Income over integrity. It doesn’t HAVE to be one over the other, but in this instance it is calculatedly so.",1698796826.0

"sustainability","t5_2qjtc","Most important-yet-neglected? Probably [alternative refrigerants](https://drawdown.org/solutions/alternative-refrigerants). Not only are they barely talked about, they're also both one of the single easiest and single most impactful solutions we know of. The basic idea is that current refrigerants, often hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs, related to the CFCs that were phased out because of the whole in the ozone) are *insanely* potent greenhouse gases, and these compounds are used in ACs, heat pumps, refrigerators, etc. We have existing alternatives that are wildly less destructive to the climate.

As for agricultural or soil-related solutions, two that I think are underrated and not talked nearly enough about are silvopasture (linked in my first comment) and [biochar](https://drawdown.org/solutions/biochar-production).

The reason for silvopasture is twofold:

1. It's the highest-impact agricultural solution according to their analysis (even higher than regular managed grazing as proselytized by Allan Savory):

> Silvopasture is the highest ranked of all of Project Drawdown's agricultural solutions in terms of mitigation impact, though it has received little attention. It should be a priority for scaling up wherever grasslands are humid enough to permit tree growth.

2. It's a remarkable and highly versatile method of agriculture.
  1. From a carbon perspective, it allows you to sequester carbon into both soil and tree biomass simultaneously.
  2. From an ecological perspective, it's biodiverse by design and it enables mutually beneficial relationships amongst the trees, pastures, and animals. For instance, many grasses actually [do best in partial shade](https://youtu.be/vYVSH2RpHcQ?si=Ew_xKK-EmJN-jvWd), and livestock generally do better (and produce higher yields) with the shelter provided by the trees. In turn, animals like poultry can help break the pest and disease cycles of trees by eating diseased seeds/fruits, and they can also break pest cycles of grazing animals by eating the parasites out of their dung. A properly managed silvopasture can be very ecologically sustainable.
  3. From an agricultural perspective, you can employ it on hilly terrain and poor or even rocky soils, and you can produce layered outputs that are more resilient to extreme weather or disruptions due to disease.

As for biochar, well, the Drawdown page on it doesn't explain its true potential (they mostly analyze it on carbon sequestration potential alone), but it does say something that it is the sole solution they list under the ""engineered sinks"" category (direct air capture, for instance, didn't make the cut).

In short, ancient peoples in the Amazon accidentally produced a type of extraordinarily fertile, productive soil by composting with a certain form of charcoal. Essentially, you burn woody materials in a very low-oxygen environment (so it doesn't combust into CO2). The result is basically solidified carbon, and you can mix this in with your compost. Due to its chemical properties, it fosters an incredibly rich bacterial ecosystem in your compost that makes for really fertile soil. In addition, when you finally mix this biochar-enriched compost into your soil, it's fantastic at absorbing and holding onto soil nutrients.

The presence of biochar has produced the famous ""[terra preta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta)"" or ""black soil"" of the Amazon, which are man-made soils that are wildly more fertile than most Amazonian soils. The reason being that most soils in tropical rainforests receive so much rain that the nutrients are washed out. As a result, soils in most tropical rainforests worldwide are actually really poor with very little fertility. But the addition of the biochar (and the bacterial ecosystem it enables) prevents those nutrients from washing out, thus resulting in highly fertile soils.

Further, the reason it's considered an engineered carbon sink is because biochar isn't a very bio-available form of carbon, so it can remain stable in the soil for centuries or longer (hence why the terra preta made my indigenous Amazonians centuries ago still remains).

However, I will add that biochar is no silver bullet either. As I understand, it's primarily useful as a soil amendment in tropical climates and its benefits are more limited in temperate climates. Further, it does require a lot of woody feedstocks, the availability of which is the main limiting factor in Drawdown's analysis of its projected impact. But it's definitely still a very interesting (and not talked about enough, imo) solution that could help sequester carbon *and* improve soil quality (especially in the tropics).

It’s a good idea to go to pure black world tendency, kill the colorless demon at the start of 2-1, then run all the way to scirvir in 2-2 and kill him for the talisman. This way you get both pure black events done in one go

If you do this DO NOT warp away or reset the world at an arch stone after killing the colorless demon. However, you can touch the arch stone in 2-2 to make sure your respawn there if scirvir kills you. Just don’t reset the world when you touch it",1698796826.0

GLORIOUS Marine pic. Presuming these are a few of her crewmates, this is just a gloriously fun group session.To comment first on that outfit, it’s really incredible. I don’t know if that is her standard, the seethrough, skintight body suit, but being completely clear and barely hiding any details of her soaking wet holes underneath would already be a huge with, and then we get her sizeable breasts out in perfect cut outs for tits, designed into the outfit, fucking lovely. I like how squishy and bulbous they look, no perfect hentai spheres here but real weighted breasts. Her crewmates jerking themselves off into/onto her body is always a nice boon in my book, hell, i wish there were more waiting in the wings behind her. The one guy focusing on her armpit is a nice touch, while not my thing using more parts of her body for simultaneous pleasure is always good, and it adds a bit of flair like her mates all have their own kinks. She clearly seems to be enjoying herself as the wetness and steam is visible easily, and her pose is one of display, not one of being held and forced into it. 

The 2nd one actually really drives home the concept that she is offering her body up for sexual relief, but not completly. Like, she isnt going to fuck any of them, but she is letting their eyes and hands get their fill, and they can rub their cocks all over her until they bust. Probably not how most would see it, but I ADORE the concept she is willingly acting as fap meat for her crew over a complete cum dump. Allows her to maintain some aspect of power and being in charge while still very much being in the submissive role as far as being sexual outlet. Her eyes closed and focused as she feels her anus being stretched and can hear their deep pants and breaths behind her, soaking up the view, feeling her heat with their hands and smelling the captain’s aroma in heat is lovely. The stretch on the anus doesn’t go into gape territory, so love that, and still retains its tightness, pucker, and the deep red coloration. Plus that butt has a lot of squish to it. This is one of those pics that I feel like if you like Marnine and butts you could blow a load ON the pic, the anus and POV on that is just that quality. 

Enjoyable pic however simple it may be, unique enough to really warrant some enjoyable faps.",1698796827.0

Recology and WM employees in Seattle are contract employees through either teamsters 117 and 174. Union employees are excluded from typical employer benefits such as employer stock options, healthcare, vacation, 401k, wages, tuition reimbursement etc and instead have the benefits from their respective collective bargaining agreement that provides them with their step progressions in wages, raises, vacation time, healthcare, pension, overtime rules etc. 
The Seattle employees are exempt and unable to purchase into ownership of recology as they are contracted labor. I know plenty of drivers who have worked for both at some point and my neighbor a driver who has been with recology in Seattle for almost a decade does not have the option to buy into the companies stock, with WM anyone could but without incentives.",1698796827.0

I kept the label as stahp because this goes for when either person is the solo earner or solo parent at home.

People need to stop trying to put monetary value on what they do on either part and start to understand that it is just both people putting in the effort required to make it work.

"NIPT","t5_2ap2ow","Hey there, thank you for visiting the sub.

During this difficult time you may be looking information about what the NIPT results you received mean. There are 2 main sticky posts about what NIPT is, how it works, what it can miss and how false positives happen, sono findings, and your chances of a true positive after NIPT.  PLEASE READ THESE LINKS - this will explain everything.
POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE CALCULATOR FOR NIPT RESULTS https://www.perinatalquality.org/Vendors/NSGC/NIPT/

**I highly suggest you first read through everything in main post located here to start:**
https://www.reddit.com/r/NIPT/comments/ecjj5v/welcome_to_rnipt_the_sub_for_abnormal_nipt/

**After this head over to this post about the actual individual results**:
https://www.reddit.com/r/NIPT/comments/itmyjw/my_nipt_results_show_this_abnormality_what_does/
IF YOU HAVE A POSITIVE FOR TRISOMY 13, TRISOMY 18, TRIPLOIDY and NORMAL SONOS for NT scan and further normal sonos, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY about CVS vs AMNIO. CVS can have wrong results as a result of commonality of confined placental mosaicism in all layers of placenta and an amnio is best for this. (THIS IS NOT THE NO RESULT LOW FF RESULT that NATERA CALLS HIGH RISK FOR THOSE THINGS... that is not what that even means). This is specifically for an actual high risk for ONE of those on the NIPT.



Please also place a flair on your username which can be done by going to the right side of the sub -- community options -- and update username flair. This updates the flair on your username IN THIS SUB ONLY. This is so when you speak to others, they immediately understand your situation AND you can see their situation summary. There are some options filled in, but you can also write in your own result.


I will tag your post with POST FLAIR on your actual post. These are in different colors and allows users to actually click on the post flair and pull up every post that has a similar situation such as -no results-trisomy 13-NT scan question-etc. Clicking on the green -no result post flair- will bring up everyone who has also tagged their submission as no results/low fetal fractions and you can read up their stories/outcomes and responses (or any other topic that is common for NIPT results.
I understand you feel awful. This is a thread about what to do while you pass time in limbo: https://www.reddit.com/r/NIPT/comments/solboc/what_to_do_while_you_are_in_limbo_post_for_main/



Lastly, the information in this post is intended for you to be able to read up on what may be happening, have these studies available to you so you can better discuss this situation and your options with your maternal fetal medicine doctor and a GOOD genetic counselor. You always have a right to speak to a genetic counselor after an abnormal NIPT result and this should be provided for you by your OB. If you have been incorrectly told that the accuracy of your result is 99% without a proper Predictive Value calculation please report this somewhere as this actually leads to wrongful terminations of pregnancies in that office. That OB needs further education about NIPT positives and how to present such information as well as knowledge of the Positive Predictive Value of NIPT based on age. You could make a big difference by making sure this never happens again in the OB's office for future patients such as yourself.


As always, take any information given here and online for what it is - information - and always discuss further treatment plans with your physicians, however with caution. Not all physicians are actually up to date with NIPT testing, what results mean or how to present such SCREENING results to a patient. You will see this come up in posts across this sub.


My intention is that you have as much information about what may be going on and can make informed decisions with your treatment team moving forward.


THIS IS A SCREENING AND NOT A DIAGNOSTIC TEST


Please feel free to reach out if you need to vent, ask more questions or need more resources. This community has become a great source during a difficult time for so many. I appreciate those who chime in as we all remember how difficult to be in this situation. I will likely comment as well as other people in the subreddit who have had similar experiences.

"Whatifalthist","t5_3n8fd3","You are quick to dismiss, but its true enough from what I've learned from both history and discussions with religious leaders over my life. The ideology of forcefully spreading the religion through crusades, is functionally the same ideology of ""White Man's Burden"" of the 1800s and early 1900s. 

In fact it's origins go back to the expansion of the roman empire, where all western societies stem from. 

This is in contrast to say something like Judaism who's more isolationist ideology that stems from worshiping at the lost temple of old Jerusalem. Judaism was intended to be focused at a single location, and doesn't have as much focus on expansion.  

Christian ideology was essentially a adaption/continuation of Judaism, and the Roman Ideology of the time of its rise. And adopting those ideologies is why they grew much more numerous.",1698796828.0

Our 17 year old son is confused. He has considered trades (doesn't have much experience, but is enjoying his applied physics class which is a shop class). He is looking into mechanical or civil engineering and going for the Army ROTC or Navy ROTC scholarship in which he would commission as an officer. (This has been a great route for past members of our family including his oldest brother, uncle, and cousins.  I honestly think he has a very good chance of getting it, but I would hate to see him waste time and money going for it and not liking it. Plus, what's going on in this world is really scaring me for my son in regards to going in the service. Don't get me wrong, we are patriots, but I already have one in that's an officer...scary times.). He has considered construction management, HVAC, welding, and becoming an electrician. If he was to go the trade route, can you pls recommend a route to start with? What is the most promising in terms of pay, benefits, and some day becoming a family man. While young, it  probably won't be a big deal traveling, but some day, it will. He is also an Eagle Scout and good student thatis taking some college level courses as a senior. Any reccomendations would be appreciated. 
Thank you in advance.

To ensure that your post gets to the right place, read the following instructions:

1. **If your post is career-related:** Re-post your questions in the latest [*Weekly Career Discussion* sticky thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/search?q=flair%3A%22weekly+discussion%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) This applies to you if you:
  * need career advice, feedback on your résumé, or other career-related guidance
  * are asking about salary, job demand, switching industries, etc.
  * are a student asking about engineering majors and/or universities

  If you're an engineer and have other specific career-related questions, you can post directly to r/AskEngineers — but please read the [AskEngineers rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules) before posting.

1. **If you need to interview an engineer for a school assignment:** Use the list of engineers located in the sidebar. r/AskEngineers maintains another list, located in their sidebar under Resources.

1. **If your question is asking about ""how something works"":** Post your questions to r/AskEngineers. Try to include info & context related to your questions so the users there can do their best to help you. General requests for help will not get answered.

\- Joe/Bill came last but only because they waited hours for a bus

\- Dennis/Andrew came last but were a day behind already before taking the Fast Forward

\- Uchenna/Joyce got very lost trying to find the Fast Forward which is why they only arrived just before 2nd place.

&#x200B;

Becca/Floyd’s Fast Forward was the worst because it didn’t appear that they got lost or did anything wrong. The regular tasks were pretty short and the skydive task just took way too long but through no fault of Becca/Floyd.   


Monica/Sheree’s wasn’t great either because teams were separated in groups that were 2 hours apart. Using the Fast Forward means you likely beat the teams in your group but will not make up 4 hours and come 1st.

We also had David/Jeff’s Fast Forward where they only arrived about 15 minutes before 2nd place Kelly/Jon but didn’t appear to do anything wrong besides struggle at the Fast Forward challenge for a little bit.

"intuitiveeating","t5_2w4xa","Have you considered doing a meal delivery plan? I’ve done Blue Apron, which sends directions and ingredients for gourmet meals. It takes a little effort, but the food is top notch. I know there are lots of services that do pre-made meals (Hello Fresh?). Not to mention frozen meals. Delivery just gets expensive and probably unhealthy. Where I live, delivery often takes so long, I could make something faster than it can get to my house. 

If you’re looking for something delicious and easy, Chicken Piccata is shockingly easy and tastes as good homemade as it can from a restaurant. Pasta with a homemade Alfredo sauce is also surprisingly simple and approachable (really simple - butter, heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper). Stir fry is super easy and tastes great with the right sauce (you can even get pre-made sauce to make things simpler).",1698796834.0

According to law, if the deceased left no will, then her properties must be divided among her heirs equally.

Now, if your aunt insists that your grandmother left everything to her verbally, a verbal will is not allowed in the Philippines and is often looked down upon. Any verbal evidence, one that cannot prove that there is a will present, cannot be presented in court and cannot be used to disinherit legal heirs such as your mother.

If Lions lose a free agent who lands a big dollar deal in free agency, they get a compensatory pick. Someone like Chase Young easily could have netted a 3rd round pick back if he left for the big contract he'll likely get. So if he's a rental, he likely costs next to nothing.

If Holmes didn't like Young or the other options for other reasons, that's fine.

"rust","t5_2s7lj","> Although, it seems that all concurrency in Inko is provided via the ""actor-model"" (I believe) and so sharing references across threads might not be a possibility? 

Correct, it borrows from Pony and requires you to guarantee a value has no outside references to it before you can send it to another process. A few types (e.g. `String`) that are immutable also use atomic reference counting and can always be sent, as these are essentially treated as value types.

> Even if references can't be shared across threads, the aspect of mutable references being unique is a strong point of rust in my opinion. Because it makes it very easy to reason about your code as if you have an immutable reference, you know the value will not change somewhere else deep down in the codebase leading to logic errors (I'm talking about in single threaded contexts).

The Manhattan courthouse is a truly great place to get married and we had a wonderful experience. We had a small reception afterwards with close friends and some US-based family. We opted for a reception in India which was a first for his family, but ended up perfect for everyone.

Cost breakdown:
3k rings, jewelry, and wedding attire (we bought Indian wedding attire in Jaipur as part of a special trip with his family)
$25 NYC courthouse wedding ceremony 
2k US reception- was able to get an amazing deal on a few hours in a distressed gallery space and catered it ourselves 
~5k India airfare, hotel, event space, food/drink for ~100 ppl

A few things:
1. We are super happy with our decision and 8 years on, we don’t regret a thing.
2. We didn’t take a honeymoon but we do travel every year for our anniversary. We figure we’ve gotten a few years of vacations out of what most US couples spend on the big day.
3. We knew we didn’t want to spend big on a wedding and it took a lot of negotiation with both our families to get them onboard.",1698796835.0

What makes you think that it was just an EA? Is it because she said so?

She cheated on her first husband,cheated on you,then you forgave her,now she's cheated again. I'm so confused as to why you've refused to leave..

How can she be remorseful, but tell you to get over her indiscretion?

You seemed to have spent this entire relationship rug sweeping.

Are you afriad of starting over?

It's better to start over at 99 than to be with someone you can never trust,at the end of the day you'll never really be happy.

Are you afraid of not having a partner??

>is a cheating ho-bag so it's fine that OOP was a rude piece of shit to her.

I still don't think he was that rude to her (regardless of whether this post is real or fake). She kept shitting on her ex relentlessly for way too long even after being hinted at to stop. It takes a massive lack of self awareness to not realise it. 

She kept pestering him to join in on the shitting and even after he declined she kept at it.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","I agree, although I’d add on a couple things to your list of things to try. It is basic biology, and although unspoken issues are often the cause, therapy can’t fix that. The biology thing sometimes has to be addressed directly. That means working on things that spark attraction in the most primal areas of our brain, and that’s not doing dishes or talking. Those things only work if the lack of them is a turn off. But they aren’t turn one.

I’m not giving anything concrete, so let me give an example based on some research: 

- Just about any of Esther Parell’s advice, which is the need for both to engage in independent things outside of the relationship that start to create a little more mystery and interest and joy in each persons life independently. She has a Ted talk in several books. He talks a lot about how getting too comfortable and in some respects to close can really kill desire.

- Novel and arousing activities, which increase relationship quality (outdoor activities, active sports, card games, travel; examples: attending musical concerts, plays, lectures; skiing, hiking, dancing).  This is the opposite of pleasant but not arousing/effective: visiting friends, movie, church, eating out (which is the quintessential date night, and that’s why it doesn’t work). 

- knowing your partners primal turn-ons and focusing on them. In our case, I didn’t know how much certain parts of the body turned my partner on. I was surprised! Or other things, like how a certain kind of clothing or how it’s worn affects your partner more than others. Many men are really turned on by long hair, for example, but don’t mention it to their wives (and it’s hard, because you don’t want to tell her what to do, but she deserves the choice of knowing it’s a huge turn on and making her own choice). Or women who don’t tell their spouses they love beards or stubble or suits or whatever. The guys don’t have to do it, but it’s helpful to know. 

- most important: learning to flirt again. You really can’t go anywhere without this. People literally need to learn to bring back playfulness, and honestly, most people need to learn it by reading and watching dating experts. I’m not talking about creepy dating experts or negging; I’m talking about sending your spouse saucy texts instead of just asking for milk, telling your spouse how she’s naughty instead of just saying she’s a great mom - the kind of teasing that feels like you’re in on it together. Things she says that challenge you and get your blood boiling. When people start to focus so much on mortgages and everything else, and especially when they start to think it’s silly to be silly, that’s a death nail in any relationship. You can play the mortgage and chase your spouse around the living room from time to time. That playfulness is what life is about; life is there to be enjoyed. And when you lose it, he lose vibrancy in a relationship.

So many people are going to read what I just wrote and think it’s silly or dismiss it. Unfortunately, it is the most important thing you can do.",1698796837.0

"Kaiserreich","t5_2wgr5","MacArthur is already overthrowing the constitutional system by marching on Washington, idk if firing him changes anything if he has a unit loyal enough to commit treason. It might even become a “the President fired me for refusing to kowtow to him, march with me to save America.”

But should we just handwave the coup, idk if Reed has a vested interest in slowing down. A lot of his actions, especially executive orders, are targeting at pressing issues and perceived flaws in America; iirc he’s EOing rent controls, not making declarations about leftist theory. Not to mention the anti-establishment candidates (Reed and Long) are both about changing the system and derive the most support from the failures of the establishment. If you got elected on America being broken, being zealous is a virtue. 

As for implement an agenda, I think it’s highly likely that Congress is gridlocked with no party being close to a majority, especially in the senate. In that regard, Reed will likely be very limited in his legislative agenda (which is why he uses Executive Orders so much to begin with) and likely will be a sort of lame-duck president constantly butting heads with the Supreme Court and Congress. But as president, he also has a lot of power over appointments and executive policy, which will have plenty of ratifications. 

Honestly, I think both Reed and Long are fated to clash against the American political system. The separation of powers handicaps an anti-establishment president unless they control Congress, and even then they’ll butt heads with the Supreme Court. Without the 2ACW or some political crisis, either man will find his power checked, with most of their supporters disappointed and bitter by the end of their terms.",1698796837.0

I'm not sure why you've just mentioned more things that are messed up in society, having more problems doesn't negate the original problem, it just means there are more problems.

And legal is not the same as moral. Is it legal to lie to someone to get them to sleep with you? Pretty sure no one's gonna arrest you for pretending to be a celebrity to get laid, but don't try to act like there's nothing wrong with that just because the laws in your area permit it.",1698796837.0

mirá sus entrevistas y lo escucha lo que dice

>equipara al Estado con un pedófilo

La entrevista con novaresio donde habla del estado como pedofilo y los nenes bañados en vaselina: https://twitter.com/Martin_Rey_Ok/status/1659347202316152834 ese es el recorte, en la entrevista tira un par mas. desopilante.

>desprecia la pluralidad de voces

Se refiere a integrantes de otros partidos como escorias humanas (zurdos van a correr, colectivistas hijos de puta, radicales como el peor tipo de ser humano, insultos de todo tipo a todo el arco politico), creo que no necesito buscar fuentes de esto porque su caracteristica principal, insultar a otros políticos.

>se ve a leguas que tiene un par desequilibrios emocionales

El cambio anímico que tiene de una entrevista a otra (e incluso en la misma entrevista), compará Trebuq vs el otro dia con Majul. Ta todo bien con ser medio autista o excéntrico pero prefiero que ejerza otro cargo público antes de darle control del país a un tipo que se pone como se pone Milei en público.

>cree que el único mecanismo para ordenar los recursos de un país como Argentina es el mercado

Sobre esta podés ver el debate con Grabois que hizo en el programa de Fontevecchia donde sugiere que el estado no debería encargarse de hacer escuelas sino que deberia hacerse a través de inversión privada, y si no hay privados interesados en construir una escuela en un pueblo kb pero no deberiamos financiar con impuestos obra pública de este tipo porque es inmoral y asdsadsa. Idea de la cual se desprende que en un pueblo de dos mil habitantes [en el medio de la nada](https://www.google.com/maps/@-41.0683822,-68.3851378,15.83z?entry=ttu) donde hacer una escuela no es rentable no va a tener una.

>su vice quiere reabrir un debate ya saldado para empujar una agenda oscura

Y sobre esto no sé que citarte pero también es abiertamente reconocido por Vicky que para ella los represores son presos políticos, desconociendo los fallos de la justicia y reinvindicando la dictadura que ya llegado a llamarlo ""el proceso"" (haciendo referencia a ""Proceso de Organizacio Nacional"", titulo que le puso Videla a su irrupción en el sistema democratico y republicano)",1698796838.0

All you’re doing is countering and continuously adding another level to the mind game to where they have to make the right decision. You’re doing all that with 1-2 buttons.

When I’ve asked her to stop doing it, about me and them, she doesn’t. So she doesn’t get to know personal things about me anymore. She gets the generic version of my life.

I guess my point is that you are entitled to your preferences and boundaries, and if your dating partner is not fulfilling them to your satisfaction, then it’s up to you to enforce the boundary to respect yourself. But also, other peoples behavior can’t always be about you. We don’t know whether she might have a boundary with her mom for whatever reason.",1698796838.0

"CatAdvice","t5_2sn56","When you say location swap, do you mean something like this?

Example:
- Violet in the office; JJ in the kitchen
- Violet in the kitchen for a few minutes or however long she is comfortable being there; JJ in the office as per timeframes mentioned for Violet
- Violet back in the office; JJ back in the kitchen
- Repeat a few times until both cats seem increasingly comfortable before moving on to next step (eating behind closed doors, eating while door cracked open, being able to see each other through mesh barrier, etc.)

You've done a lot of good work trying to introduce your cats but it seems like you focus a lot on letting your cats see each other as soon as possible (you give no timeframes so I can only speculate based on how often you mention visual contact between the cats). Also use JJ as the leader in this process. Poor Violet, yes, but poor JJ more, because she got there first, it's her home first, her territory, and she's stressed out that you brought a ""threat"". If JJ is comfortable, increase the exposure to Violet by increments. If JJ reacts poorly or not warming up as quickly as anticipated, slow down the introduction or restart the previous step. It takes a long time. Look up Jackson Galaxy.",1698796839.0

Palestine gets millions if not billions of dollars a year I promise you if even half of that money towards making gazan civillians safer the casualty rate would be more even.

"Journalism","t5_2qhym","TL;DR: Removing the upfront costs for disseminating information results in many more people doing so in their own way, without realizing that they are still beholden to whomever owns the means of dissemination.

All of these people ""surging past legacy media"" on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok are also subject to rules imposed by the companies that own them, have no control over their archive, and are having the data of both themselves and their viewers constantly harvested by those platforms for their own use. They are essentially renting press space and paying with views and personal data.

This article also glosses over the fact that a lot of the misinformation being spread is done so by people who *think* they are doing good journalism but are either misinformed, ignorant, naive or all three — much more common among younger people who simply don't have enough experience in the subjects they are covering — and have no one to serve as a check for that. Johnny Harris is a great example.

He's had a YouTube channel since 2011 but became popular with his ""Borders"" series on Vox, which was subject to its many layers of quality control and fact-checking. He switched back to his YouTube channel after Vox canceled the series in 2020 amid the pandemic. Some of his YouTube videos since then, subject only to whatever standards he decides to impose on himself, have been rightly criticized for oversimplifying concepts and falling victim to any number of traps that would be fettered out by an actual quality-control process.

And then we have examples like this:

> This role is increasingly being filled by content creators, many of whom reject the neutrality of traditional journalism in favor of reporting that takes a stand. Elise Joshi, 21, is a member of Gen-Z for Change, a political collective of young activists with large social media followings. In August, Joshi interrupted White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre at an event on voter engagement to ask questions about the administration’s decisions to greenlight oil-drilling projects. After Joshi posted a video of the interaction to TikTok, where she has more than 150,000 followers, people applauded her for asking questions they felt the rest of the news media had ignored.

Journalism is not activism, but this example isn't even activism. It's just confronting an official with uncomfortable questions. I bet people liked seeing it, but how did it inform them in any way?",1698796841.0

"PhotoshopRequest","t5_2u2ui","Hello u/Weird-Ingenuity9331, thanks for posting on /r/PhotoshopRequest! Please note:

- Unless you have stated that you wish to be contacted privately for privacy reasons, etc, please be wary of anyone who contacts you about your request outside of your post. We are unable to assist with any problems that may arise from dealing with users who contact you outside of this post.

- Please remember that fast usually does not mean best. Unless you're in a hurry and the request is urgent, it's best to wait at least an hour before choosing a submission. It can be very demoralizing for our editors to spend time working on an edit only to find that OP has chosen the very first submission, which is often not the best quality.

- Remember to zoom-in and look carefully at the submissions before choosing a winner. Recent advancements in AI have enabled some very impressive edits to be made very quickly, however it often results in unnatural distortions of things like faces and hands and background objects that more careful editors can and will correct manually, but at the cost of a bit more time. Again, it's best to be patient.

- Since this is a paid request (you've set the ""paid"" flair and/or you've offered payment) all submissions will be watermarked. Once you've chosen a submission and sent payment, the editor will send you the final, un-watermarked file.

- Once your request is solved, remember to change your post's flair to ""Solved"" by commenting ""SOLVED"" and thank those who helped you.

Both Deacon and Cassie's examples of remembering a change in ""the past"" almost immediately instead of a delayed affect to a alternative present...that could possibly be it. Maybe it's more immediate if it's a past memory than a alternate present memory. That sounds pretty consistent to me when I think about it. Almost every time it's a shift in memory from something in the past, it's almost immediate.  

I also think it has a lot to do with **time** being omniscient and being a living entity. Cassie needs to remember events at certain points for certain events to be set in motion, if she didn't, it could spiral out of control and possibly break reality.",1698796841.0

"CatholicPhilosophy","t5_39uy8",">So I think viewing the world in Aristotelian terms (forms) is our natural existence. When we dive deeper and remove the idea of God, we end up with phenomenology - our human attempt to view reality ""as it is"" (ie, without form imposed by a mind). With phenomenology, we see that everything is a process., and that includes our egoic conception of self. Without God, reality melts into nothingness, and even our self (ego) dissipates under scrutiny. We cease to exist as individual beings.

I think this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the nuances of phenomenology. Early phenomenology drastically emphasized epistemological realism. The phenomenological reduction was used to bracket off biases and assumptions in order to gain an objective insight into the real essence of things, which is why early phenomenology was seen as going back to the “things themselves”, not as a means of reinforcing nominalism: ie “We see that distinctions only exist in our minds”. This current of phenomenology is thus most prominent among Catholic phenomenologist such as Edith Stein, Dietrich Von Hildebrand, or John Paul II. Even as Husserl tended towards “transcendental idealism” in his later works, he would still probably reject the notion that distinctions between essences are merely nominalistic.

In terms of the notion of individuality, Edith Stein provides a very comprehensive account through the lens of both Thomism and phenomenology. Her notion of individuality lies heavily upon the phenomenological emphasis of intersubjectivity and empathy along with scholastic ontology. A good starting place would be [“Thine Own Self: Individuality in Edith Stein's Later Writings”](https://www.amazon.com/Thine-Own-Self-Individuality-Writings/dp/0813216826). I also would recommend that you look more into the notion of imago dei in the early church fathers!",1698796843.0

Yes St George ICU did have its issues a few years back, but that was partly due to a culture of bullying, rather than incompetence. Since then they have regained their accreditation with CICM. No doubt there was some communication issues, and the bullying culture may well have contributed to the incident, but trashing the actual ICU isn't helping.  


For those that were saying how can 4 doctors not be airway trained, they were all ICU doctors, and so of course they were airway trained. And for all the ICU doctors in this forum I'm sure the management of desat in someone intubated (trache or otherwise) has been well drilled into your training (since reg 1). The cause of this must have been multifactorial, and not just ""the trache fell out and no one did anything etc cos they were all incompetent etc......'

We should only wait for the official report to come out before casting blame.",1698796844.0
"ConservativeKiwi","t5_zxhx5","Interesting write up, somewhat simplistic. The elections were free and fair, the part you could expand on was Hamas's promises leading up to the election which were to reduce corruption and to improve internal security, and why that was such an issue following the Israeli withdrawal months earlier. 

Theres also the conflict after the elections between Hamas and Fatah, the fallout of which has led to Hamas ruling Gaza and Fatah ruling the West Bank. 

One part you don't seem to account for is that half of Gaza is aged under 18, so half of the people there weren't even alive when Hamas took power. How much should they be blamed for what Hamas has done? 

And cause I'm Pam, one correction, of the 1400 deaths, about 300 were active duty soldiers. So vast majority is inaccurate.",1698796844.0

"WalgreensStores","t5_33erf","I have a list, but there's a tie between 2.

The first one is a woman who flat out went to punch me because an item wasn't coming up as being on sale. (By the way it wasn't on sale.) The only reason she didn't was because my manager stepped in front of her and she stopped. (He didn't get punched just in case anyone's wondering.) He didn't even realize the woman was going to punch me. He just saw her screaming and me backing away from the counter.

The second one is honestly too long. To make it short though a customer is now banned from Walgreens because she didn't like an answer I gave her regarding a personal question she asked about me. I am disabled and have medical episodes that can be triggered that are very dangerous and she intentionally tried to trigger one because she was unhappy with me. I've worked at my store for over 4 years and she is 1 of only 2 customers we have ever successfully gotten bans approved for.",1698796844.0

If wearing a piece of the original dress is important to your daughter, consider removing some lace, applique, or beading on the original dress and applying that to a simple veil.

The Crescent tends to go to crap just after the 2nd stop heading north and then never makes up much time until between Gastonia and Charlotte where the schedule is crazy out of whack for the 30 minutes needed.  From Greensboro to CVS the train tends to lose about 15 minutes.   
   


I did look and about 5% of the time since the start of the year the connection was not made. If the train is more than 2.5 hours late into Greensboro then we will jump in a car and drive up US-29 and pick up the train at CVS.  If the Crescent is running late then maybe the Cardinal will be as well. I will be tracking both trains the morning of and if we have to start in a car we can.

"AITAH","t5_446kys","I stated that he should pay 50/50 for the rental of a separate vehicle when they ""go places,"" even if he can't drive.  Or, he can pay for an uber / rideshare, 50/50.  That's fair, right?  It is obvious is that he is dependent at those times on his partner's vehicle.  The true cost is more than just gas / petrol.

My point is that gas / petrol money isn't enough, and yes, 50/50 is also perhaps too much, but he is clearly not paying his fair share.  My larger point is that he is an anchor in the relationship.  

Where I come from partners are true partners.  I'll repost what I typed in another post: My wife and I are partners. I don't mind paying for the car that she drives because I want her to be in a safe vehicle. If she wants or needs something that benefits her, and it's in the budget, I'm more than happy to chip in or pay in full.

The OP only wants to pay his share.  To me, that is a problem in the relationship, and it seems his partner is fed up with that attitude.  I could be reading more into his comments since I am not all knowing, but the very fact that he thinks paying for fuel is adequate tells me a lot.  

I probably old-fashioned, but I wouldn't put up with that mindset in a relationship.  I'll let you have the last word if you do have any final thoughts.  Good evening.",1698796844.0

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Yes, it is bad for you, especially if you're watching porn while doing it, and single. Not for your physical health, but for your mental health. It will desensitize you to the wonders of having regular sex with regular people. And you risk ending up like one of those guys that can't finish with a woman, and has to finish manually himself by his own hand because that's what his body is used to. It's also giving you a big dopamine hit every time, and that's why you turn to it when you're bored, you're feigning some dopamine. Over time, your dopamine baseline will raise, and you'll find yourself watching more and more taboo stuff, masturbating more and more, chasing that dopamine to reach that level again. And it can also kill your drive and motivation to go out and find a real life-partner / sex-partner.  


My advice would be to quit the porn. Maybe just once in a blue moon, but don't make it a regular thing. Don't masturbate more than 3x per week. Use the rest of that energy you usually use to play with yourself, to find a partner to have sex with. Too much of anything becomes bad. Just keep it in moderation, and when you really do need a release.",1698796844.0

Some medications side effects are muscle weakness other times it could be your immune system recovering from an illness both times after getting covid It took 3 months for my muscles to get back to normal. I lost all my gains at the gym but also being sedentary for awhile can make your muscles weaker. I haven’t been to the gym for a few months, I think it's contributing to my newer muscle weakness + knee pain.

Wishstones isn't really a problem, since it didn't take away from our legendary pity (even if it sucks that it took away our epic esper pity, but this isn't a ""big problem"" but rather a small one)

Getting a divinate for a regular legendary you don't own isn't that bad, because you can somewhat easily get them, with wishstones, whenever they're put on banner/get a rerun

But shimmer legendary are arguably WAY more difficult to get, so sometimes getting 2~3 shimmer legendary divinates for shimmer legendary you don't have and will probably never have, isn't a good thing, especially for f2p players

Imo a good way to fix this would either be to remove the possibility to get legendary divinates for characters you don't own (but this would be asking too much coming from the devs), and another really good fix would be to like... get a way to get higher rates for said character ?

Like for example, if you get a Xuan Pin divinate, then you'll have more chances to get her/have a guarantee to get her after a set amount of pulls (ofc it would be more than 100 pulls), or something like that",1698796845.0

By Chloe, The Little Beet, Dig Inn are the big chains with plenty of vegetable and vegan options. I’d go for green vegetables, sweet potato, salad and a protein. Protein keeps you fuller for longer.

Westville has some healthy options if you choose wisely. I like the bowls and salad, but I avoid the sandwiches as they feel like burgers/fast food to me.

12 Chairs or a similar Middle Eastern restaurants are a good option. I would choose a pitta, salad, any tomato based dish or falafel.

When you eat in a restaurant, an appetiser and a side dish can sometimes be a better option if you are stuck.

If you are concerned about the optics of not drinking, ordering a wine spritzer to make your drink last can reduce the calories and effect of your drink while giving the appearance of joining in.

“Sukeban Entertainment has a unique combination of women from TV Production, Social Media Advertising and Business Operations from the brand side. Our entrance into the agency world just seemed like the natural progression. We united to create a multidimensional approach to all our brand partnerships. We know that the potential is there to partner with any brand and grow their market. We believe that social media is not a monologue, it’s more like a telephone than a television. Followers trust the influencers more like a friend making a recommendation. The best marketing doesn’t feel like marketing at all.  Give, us a try we think you will be pleasantly surprised. And we are a women owned business.”

 Note: Sukeban (スケバン/助番) is a Japanese term meaning 'delinquent girl', and the female equivalent to the male banchō in Japanese culture. The usage of the word sukeban refers to either the leader of a girl gang or the entire gang itself. Sukeban were formed as a direct result of male gangs' refusal to accept female members, consequently the term has come to refer to the massive movement that brought feminism to public attention at a time when men of the ya‌ku‌za were thriving.",1698796846.0

The head of a dick is more pliable than people realize and can handle a good squeeze. The squeeze when erect is part of the good feeling of wearing a glans ring. Also the heavier the ring, the more gravity is working against the ring staying on when flaccid. Being a tighter fit helps with that.

I seriously recommend buying a sizing ring set some of the companies sell, or hitting up the hardware store for cheap trial sizes before you sink a lot of money into rings that you won’t be able to wear or enjoy the feeling of wearing. The first one I purchased ended up being to big for all day wear and never leaves the drawer. I have heard stories of guys having their ring(s) fall off at the worst time possible in crowds of people or in a private setting or an office meeting where it was obvious what happened and where it came from. You don’t want to be that guy 😂

The cock rings you wear around your dick and balls are a different story. To small and they hurt, to big and they fall off.

Prior to this it was a case of simply filling out a form and submitting it through student services for approval, from 2018 onwards it was decided to access learning support then medical records must be submitted with contact details for the relevant GP practice to verify the provided evidence, unsurprisingly the amount of learning support claims dropped significantly and suddenly there was no issue receiving laptops, scanning pens or mini-library access cards again",1698796847.0

"Wrasslin","t5_2wzap","If Vince McMahon, the owner of the company had a top 10 list of wwe wrestlers of all time. Hulk Hogan, John Cena and Roman Reigns would be on that list. He owns the wwe, hes seen wrestling over decades. Do you think Vince McMahon cares about Minoru Suzukis work rate? So if the owner of WWE wouldn’t rate work rate higher than drawing ability, than why should we all. He literally is the wwe. 

He’s proven what successful wrestling looks like and people have proven they’re more invested than these big stars than the guys that can run the ropes. How can you completely disregard 3 of the most successful wrestlers in the world, who have millions of people going back and watching their matches and their big moments and rivalries, but disregard that all because they don’t have enough 5 star matches from Dave Meltzer. 

Wrestling is more than work rate matches. Work rate is one half of the wrestler, charisma is the other half. The Rock can’t wrestle like Minoru Suzuki, but guess which one made wrestling popular?",1698796847.0

"WarthunderSim","t5_2dvmh9","#Knots

For me, it is a simple matter of relevancy.  As a certified pilot and a professional Air Traffic Controller, everything I do in terms of speed for aviation is in Knots.  As such, putting the game in Knots helps to reinforce the standard in which I'm held to in real life, whereas... learning KPH/MPH would be useless.  

For anyone who is on the fence about Knots, I'd encourage you to make the switch.  If you ever decide to pursue IRL aviation ventures, having your mind already wrapped around Knots will serve you better in your training.  

I also play Naval and Ground, and still use Knots there... for Naval, that is pretty obvious... but for ground it is a bit obscure, but I'm too lazy to switch it everytime I switch modes.  However, I have found that I rarely look at my ground vehicle speeds when making judgments about maneuvers.  Because the speeds are all pretty low anyway in tanks, it is more of a gut feeling just watching the ground go past me to determine how my tank will handle a sudden turn, unlike aircraft where entry speed into maneuvers is critically important.",1698796847.0

"TrueChefKnives","t5_95bg32","I’ve been a professional chef for only 2 years and am a first semester culinary student, so I don’t have as much knowledge as everyone here. But I want to be clear: Paper cutting isn’t an accurate test of cutting performance. 

If anything, it’s best used to see if your sharpening skills are consistent across the entire edge of your knife. It’s also a good test of how high the edge polish is. Knives sharpened at a higher grit typically cut smoother than in a lower grit. But that doesn’t always translates perfectly to food. 

Cutting horizontally (or against the grain) is supposed to be hard because it’s frickin against the grain. Cutting with the grain disrupts less cell walls. Also the geometry of the knife might not be good. The edge might be sharpened well but the rest of your knife still needs to pass through the ingredient. Also, thinness might come into play but not always. Finally, how polished the sides of your knife may come into play. If it’s very textured, it might not pass easily. If it’s smoothened at a too high of a grit you might find that food sticks to your knife more (bad food release). I find that sanding your knife’s sides from 2000-4000 grit is a sweet spot. But if you have a knife that’s known for its mirror polish, kasumi finish, or matte finish then I’d stay away from thinning/sanding the sides.",1698796847.0

What he did is comparable to firing a gun he didn't load at the guy. Whether the gun was empty, only had a blank, or was loaded with the right ammo to kill him was entirely up to luck.

"pornfree","t5_2rglh","One major benefit to no porn is that you don’t actively support a horrible industry that mistreats and abuses women. There are other benefits like being free from an addiction and having more free time too. Think about the amount of time porn steals from you. You could, fill that time with other things like reading or drawing or something. Porn fucks up your perception of sex, so going without it can get rid of those perceptions over time. I think going no fap would be a great idea too because in the beginning, you’d probably be masturbating to a lot of scenarios that you saw in porn, so it could just become a trigger or a temptation, if you will. I think it’s worth it and I urge you to do it. Don’t beat yourself up if you relapse, it happens. Addictions are hard to beat. But imo, the best reason to quit is so that you no longer support such a terrible industry. Women are people too, and I think a lot of times, it’s easy to forget that the women in porn are people that are there not by choice, but because they had no choice. They are mistreated and abused. Perhaps that can serve as motivation to not look at porn. And again, if you do relapse, it’s okay. Don’t beat yourself up for it. It happens. What counts is the effort.

I just think that’s an insane amount of money for him to turn down to keep playing centre at the roosters.

Not in a group setting,  solo in my garage.   I was  sore for 3 days from  just squatting the bar with no weights for the first time... I was kind of embarrassed. Fast forward and so far I have not gotten hurt lifting, it's been empowering, I'm lifting heavier, it's minimally impact my runs the next day and I look forward to my strength days.  Knock on wood I haven't been seriously sidelined this training cycle either.

I think it may impact your running a bit at first though that should go away as your body adapts. I just scheduled easy short runs the day after early on. And I try not to lift too close to a quality workout.",1698796849.0

My doctor took em off opiates after 2 and half years, after going from Oxy, to hydros, to tramadaol because he was a orthopedic surgeon dr not a pain management doc that could prescribe opiates forever, he would lose his license prescribing them anymore. I had extra bottles at ho e and my parents , mom being a RN nurse thinking I didn’t need to go pain management and get opiates thought I would ok. And I wasn’t. My gf felt bad so she started getting opiates for me from my one of her aunts, then my uncle dying form cancer had the strong oxycodone syrup, she would grab me some of that, and then after that she got me stuff from him, he was dying so he gave him So much extra that I never took anything he actually needed. After that I got in touch with of my aunts that my family dishoned. I started getting dilaudid from her for the past 5 years. I’m 20. Got a huge tolerance, and they are honestly not as good as Oxy. They are good once and while but not all the time. I’ve gotten methadone in the last 2 month and stopped talking to my aunt. I used to do heroin for the past year from the darkweb.

Because…

>Never said otherwise

If you understand my point enough to claim I am validating the exact one I say I am *not*, then you are literally contradicting yourself in two sentences here. Because this is the most succinct summation of my point possible, which you say you never said otherwise, whilst then saying I’m making a different argument then what I have been.

This is but three layers removed from vegetation.

>You literally still think I'm disagreeing that theres a definition for these terms or something........you really aren't hearing me man.

I don’t think you want to have a debate I just think you want to talk; I genuinely do not know what’s wrong with you. 

But this is once again, a good example of your inabilities. You say, I’m not hearing you, or that your argument isn’t the case and that it’s different. 

What is your point, then? 

You’ve had ten incessantly vague comments to elaborate on what you believe in and you are yet to do any. I don’t know what purpose you have for bringing any of this irrelevant information up, barring that you possibly feel the dictionary definition and usage is invalid. Which is what I’ve been led to believe your saying and you later confirm in this comment

>Larping your fantasies are you?

I’m not the one claiming you wouldn’t do something if you were in my presence, *keyboard warrior*(i don’t even know what the hell that meant)

>Yeah I'm sure you'd be willing to show these messages to your future kid, wife, parents... Etc

I would, and tell her and them that this grown ass man, spent more time bitching to me about how I’m bullying him on the Internet(once again, explain how I’m bullying you, or define it, but we all know how you feel about definitions lmao) than fixing his incoherent point.

>Look do whatever you want man, If you're going to pretend you would talk in this childish manner to my face then I'll treat you like the child you wish to be.

This tantrum would make sense if I ever called you anything out the way past a sarcastic, frustrated comment.

Can you exactly point to where something past that occurred? I’m not denying I was frustrated, I just don’t know how you could take it so personally. Can you establish this? Or are you going to say I’m *gaslighting* you again?

>That's a muddy analogy if I'm being honest, could you quote me where I make an argument akin to this?

In your insistent issue with the word Tankie because of its contemporary usage and/or disagreement surrounding its definition.

Feel like this was pretty clear. 

>It would be more accurate to compare it to something like ""libtard"" or ""Anarkiddie"".  Two words that also differ based on political perspective.

An analogy is an analogy for a reason, you don’t make them one to one with the topic. If you can only understand that under the guise of political perspectives, then it defeats the purpose of the analogy. It’s an accurate one as it deals with disagreement and discourse over not the etymology of a word, but its contemporary definition/usage. 

Which etymology could have a part in, but I don’t think it’d be relevant in every situation as to how people use words

>I just watched a Ben Shapiro review of Openhimer and multiple piers Morgan clips. Does that mean I am aligned with Ben Shapiro and Piers Morgan?

This is actually a good example of a bad analogy for the right reasons(as it deals with function) and you misreading my arguments.

I was speaking about the subreddit and how their behaviors reflect the content creator, I don’t watch enough Deprogram to know if they made some crazy statements about violence. But I know their subreddit does; but your reaction tells me the podcast probably did(unsurprising)

This analogy was bad though because the content of the contemptible person speaking is relevant. I wouldn’t turn my nose at Ben Shapiro making an Oppenheimer review because that’s innocuous and can technically have nothing to do with his political beliefs, but I would certainly be suspicious at taking information he disseminates about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, after he has referred to Arabs as *dirty* and *barbaric* previously. 

Why would anyone with critical thinking skills, trust a Tankie on their oftentimes unreferenced takes as to what a Tankie is and the origins of the word.

The Bible and Quran are also not good examples; you can trust these sources to offer neutral, moral lessons because these books originated as a selection of fables. Yet I would not trust either, or be very careful referencing their unscientific claims about the cosmology of our world; this is actually so disingenuous holy shit.

>Maybe, but the episode I referenced is still really well thought out at deconstructing the modern use of tankie in online discourse.

Okay so let’s silently observe how you carry this totally non conflicting point to your previous statements(about me not understanding or addressing you properly).

>We went over this. I countered with the deprogram episode and explained why the word is by design reductive and philosophically loaded languange.

Aha, we had to slog through a lot of manure, but we reached it. I would love to see how this comment fares juxtaposed to your claims that I’ve misunderstood you.

You clearly have a problem with the etymology and contemporary usage of the word, so long as you feel like it is by design unhelpful or reductive. You spent all this time rambling, and said exactly what I said you’ve been saying; you just have a problem with the word and how it’s used.

But that is like… your *subjective* opinion, that this word is unhelpful, and no amount of history  behind it can change that as etymology is often irrelevant as to how people use words currently.

Even if it was the case that Tankie was made solely to detract from innocuous Anti-Capitalists(it wasn’t, so I don’t know how it’s inherently reductive); it’s current usage is not impacted by this as it explicitly defines the type of Anti-Capitalist it is talking about.

I also think you are overestimating the amount of people who misuse Tankie for this argument; this is not like Nazi or Fascist, this is not in the popular lexicon. You could randomly pick ten moderately politically involved people, and I bet that six to seven wouldn’t even know what a Tankie is or have ever used the word. 

It is very niche, much like this conversation. And by him using that word and speaking about subreddits, another niche conception; I doubt he’s misconstruing the term.

But even if he was, what the fuck does that have to do with what I’m saying. I know what a Tankie is and I responded in turn; he provided no definitive information because it wasn’t relevant to the statement. 

>Radical is also a reductive word because from everyone’s perspective someone is radical.

That doesn’t make the word reductive, it just makes it subjective. You are arguing for a world where definitions do not exist; I don’t think you know what the word reductive means either or it’s prescriptions when used.",1698796850.0

"HunterXHunter","t5_2spu5","Togashi is Togashi, he usually things through with his decisions, and analyzing the story it gets clearer. Kurapika for example is 4/4 which is literally death day, but with Killua is about the tale of two lovers who were separated. Origine is given the job of weaving by her father, and she is sad because she is lonely/Killua being made an assassin by his father and being lonely; her father fulfilled her wish to go and meet someone expecting her to come back, like Killua she doesn’t;  birds save the day, like Canary, etc. The point is that the similarities are pretty big to be denied, again, it doesn’t have to be romantic in nature, but it’s there. 

Lover’s suicide is a phrase Killua used when he thought he was going to die with Gon in CA, it’s usually used between lovers. 

With Killua’s hands. Killua participated in the Greed Island and in everything because he knew how important it was to Gon, he didn’t particularly wanted to win, he just wanted to win for Gon. In that scene he did it for Gon, Gon was the one who wanted to win at any cost. No, it isn’t romantic, but it shows the depth of his affections. 

It’s not creating theories, it’s just interpreting things in every way, the text is there.",1698796851.0

The only types of guys that have approached me were ones looking for serious relationships. And I've never dated a guy who didn’t want or assume that we were committed to each other or would be someday. So I've always been the gatekeeper of relationships in my life (note that earlier you conflated the gatekeeper with the asker and that's most often not the case.)

I literally did, dipshit. You're following a fucking propagandist script. How do you think I had answers read to go for your obnoxious gish gallop? I've seen your talking points a million times before.

For all you say you can condemn two things at once, you don't seem to understand it's possible to recognize that just because one thing is bad, it doesn't justify bad actions from someone else.

Ukraine is not the US's problem. And Russia simply isn't powerful enough to do the things you think they want to do. 

>Article V has nothing to do with the Ukraine War. Ukraine is not a NATO member, and Article V could not be invoked if, for instance, US soldiers were sent to Ukraine and got attacked. 

Like hell it couldn't. That would be Russia attacking US soldiers. Why do you think there's such a huge song and dance about not directly getting involved?

>You think that. Again, you sound like one of these autofellating ""all war is bad"" types that forget that the Taliban was actively harboring Bin Laden and aiding Al Queda and refused to turn him over and cease their support of Al Queda. The invasion was justified, unlike Iraq. 

The Taliban offered to help search for Bin Laden, and Bush attacked anyway because he wanted a war, not a cooperative police action. Once again you prove you fall for war propaganda at every possible opportunity.

War *is* always bad. At the absolute best, it's a necessary evil.

I guess he meant to say Hasan calls people out for saying the hospital wasnt bombed by the IDF which would make them IDF supporters/defenders since all the most up to date understanding and evidence we have clearly shows the IDF lied about their evidence of it being Hamas so we still have no idea who it was.

In the mid-2000s I worked at a company that had the entire sprint planning day for sprint planning, the devs would get into conference rooms and actually discuss different ways of accomplishing each story, coming up with a plan and sharing knowledge in the process, evaluating risks, aligning on what things they value in the code base. At the end of the day they were well prepared to genuinely « commit » to the work - not this rubber stamp fake and meaningless commitment we see most of the time.

That was an important part of agile that has been mostly lost in the quest for efficiency and frankly greed. And I would gladly take any opportunity to bring that back into our process.",1698796852.0

Sounds like a loaded scenario however.  

Maybe when you are more independent, seek in getting a mediator and sit down with your dad and talk about life and putting in boundaries in good terms.  Not to be rude towards your stepmother but it sounds like she catalyzes hysterics to push things her way.  Sounds like a mediator wouldn't help for her.  She may be better receptible being more respectful if she gets it from your Father respecting you. (Though I do not know those personalities, and minds given the circumstance)

A mediator is safer than just going at it yourself.  Going at it yourself you'd be backed in a corner, you may be resented more until you live to their ideals, or your reality will be played over by whoever believes is more right.",1698796852.0

"RealTesla","t5_3mgxy","I order an MX, page says delivery Oct-Nov before and after order. I placed the order because to transfer my supercharching must take delivery before dec 31st and to get fed tax deduction of $7500 + $5k (colorado). so before Dec 31st is critical and based on what the page shows, it shouldn't be a problem. 3 days later, they move the delivery estimate between Dec 31st and February 2024. Can you say bait and switch? Who can defend this nonsense. The least they could do is let me switch the ""fee"" to a different car but nope, have to place another $250 fee, or get an inventory car but they won't allow supercharging transfer if a car has a discount. I even asked if I could pay full price, again they say no.
I'm an early adopter and have countless people buy Teslas because I gave people rides in my 2014 MSP and talked it up to sell a lot of cars for the and they treat me worse than garbage.
This debacle is their fault, it's deceptive, how can anyone defend this robbery. So  I lose $250 or cross my fingers and hope they move delivery up totally at the mercy of their incompetence and pass up other makes that are a much better value these days?

This is the official Darktide Discord, it also has a ""communities"" tab with lots of smaller communities in different languages. Or you could try and google (or use another search engine) to find other Discord communities, maybe in your native language. That's how I found mine.

The game has crossplay, so you can team up with everyone who owns the game.

By the way, if you are searching for new teammates, it is best to state your timezone and times you normally play at.",1698796853.0

"coloranalysis","t5_35s40","I think you’re neutral, leaning warm, which might be why it’s harder for us to gauge your type in the comments lol. 

Because of that, I think you can pull off a lot of cooler colours than a typical warm season can. My favourite colours on you though are the ones with warm undertones though. 

For example, the ultramarine (top left) in 1. Plus the teal, leaning green top on the right of 1. The cooler blues at the bottom aren’t terrible, per se, but they do bring out a lot of red in your face. But in the warm ones (on the top), your complexion looks more even. 

The top right green in 2 is the only warm green in the collage and also the best one IMO. The rust top in 5 (top left) also looks great on you!

I also think you need lightness. I like the top left in 3. I think bottom right in 4 would look even better on you if it wasn’t so dark.

You get washed out with too much grey, so I’d put you in the spring family. However, I do think you need to accommodate for lightness more than saturation because you can still pull off colours with a little bit of grey, like the greens in 7.

So I’d put you as light spring. But that doesn’t mean you can’t wear dark colours! I like the charcoal on 8. It’s lighter and softer than a pure black, which compliments your features more. 

Hope this helps :)",1698796854.0
"MLBTheShow","t5_2tjde",">We don’t know what set 6 will look like. I doubt it’s just the forever program. The forever program rarely ever added cards but it’s safe to assume there will be set 6 cards.

>I commented because you’re saying things that aren’t relevant and it’s good to point that out. This year is different than any other year so we can’t just assume things will be the same.

For the system drive, the TPM works well, and that is a different story, because Windows has anti-hammer protection (type the wrong username/PW more than 20 times, the machine will reboot to a BitLocker recovery prompt).  However, an external drive only has protection via automounting, a password, a USB drive, or a recovery code.

Having a hardware encrypted drive ensures anti-hammer protection on the external drive.  The internal drive already has this.

As an alternative, the user could be given keyfiles to be stored on their local C: drive, and the drive shipped using TrueCrypt with a keyfile used as part of the encryption.  This would provide adequate protection, as there is no password able to be directly guessed or brute forced.",1698796854.0

Atonal general means there is no tonal center. Funk often has near static harmony and would usually be modal. Claypool always has a tonal center, whether he’s using functional harmony or not. I’d be less surprised if there was atonal fusion but I haven’t heard any. 

That’s a very interesting marimba piece. I do get a certain sense of tonality from it but I may be tricking myself into that. It would require a little more thoughtful analysis from me to really argue one way or the other.",1698796855.0

"povertyfinance","t5_hcycg","Most of this was practiced throughout the 1950s and 1960s. It was considered completely normal. We are not talking the Great Depression here. (Exceptions were people did not forage much, or use food pantries, or negotiate fixed prices.) 

Pretty much everything else listed  was considered sensible and why would you not watch your money and stretch it as far as possible?  People gardened, sewed, repaired stuff, did not eat out, paid in cash, used up leftovers, did not go into debt except for a mortgage (this was pre credit cards). Vacations were visiting relatives or camping for the most part. 

This is all good advice and I learned from my elders and betters to live this way and still do except I fly to visit relatives who are not near by. I just made a big chicken soup. Some of it I put in the freezer, I'll eat it two or three times this week, I'll make chicken salad. 

It cost a little more than one fast food meal (now that fast food has gotten expensive). *There is no comparison to the nutrition in the soup and a Big Mac meal.* This is the most important point. It's actually not ""cheap"" to eat crap food. The soup has kale and parsley (which I grew in containers), carrots, celery, tomatoes, escarole, and some noodles. It was so good!

"SocialDemocracy","t5_2sjw0","One aspect of this I don't always see discussed is the employment side. The decline of natural resource extraction can be devastating to communities that have traditionally relied on them for jobs. When the mills, mines, and oil fields close, it's the workers and their families that suffer the most. This is partly where I think some of the backlash against climate change control measures comes from in places like Alberta and West Virginia. It's easier to say ""we need to cut fossil fuels production"" when you're not the one losing your job over it (the inverse is also true... easier to say that when you're the one whose house is flooding). 

This is why things like education funding for workers so they can retrain is so important.

"StreetFighter","t5_2qnu5","Accurate is absolutely the wrong word for it. More than anything, especially more than actual results, the public perception of what's good or bad is mostly dictated by pros in an echo chamber. It loops around, too. Top players almost universally agree that a specific flashpoint proves a character is top tier, they say that to their fans, and everyone latches on to it. That's not to say they're always wrong, but there's almost always an equally good or better character going overlooked and - crucially - under explored once the hive mind decides a character is the meta. It's a big part of why, for example, no one switched to Poison or Laura despite Idom dominating with them for years. 

Specifically for SF6, balance is already in a great spot. JP and Ken are top tier but so are like 4 other characters and even the bottom tier isn't like super far behind that. Plus, the game is flat-out too new. Top JP and Ken players aren't winning against the field even half the time at major events, so the results are showing those two aren't nearly as OP as social media says. 

But, to answer your question, accuracy isn't a thing. There will always be a character the community says is too good, in every game. Ideally, balance changes will just make characters with obvious limitations less limited. Gief will be able to combo to lariat more often. But the worst thing the devs could do is read the pros complaining on Twitter and make the game into the changes they're asking for.",1698796856.0

Yeah maybe. If you are presuming bad intentions on my part, in which case I should probably assume bad intentions on yours.

Maybe.

>But there's usually tell tale signs to these situations that of people pay attention to, clue them in to what may have happened and what kind of person you are.

Okay, you don't like me as an individual, that's some interesting information. Now please tell me what point in the user agreement or code of conduct I violated.

>Bringing something up that happened two years ago,

When it happened is not relevant, you can pretend it was yesterday or ten years ago, it changes nothing.

>and firing off at anybody replying to it (cuz God forbid others have had different experiences with Anet support), shows what kind of person you are.

*""God forbid others have had different experiences with Anet support""* this is not what people are saying *at all,* they do not have *""different experiences with anet support""*, they are saying that they think it is fine and fair when companies bad people from paid services without giving any reason. Note that NCsoft's user agreement says. ""We have no obligation to accept appeals. We also have no obligation to explain any decision regarding a violation of this User Agreement.""

Before I commented I scrolled through the replies. If someone takes your post at face value they will think way different of you looking through your responses. And honestly that's what some of these types of posts are

"facepalm","t5_2r5rp","First of all, Slavic is not a racial group it's an ethnic group distinguished by language group. You are utterly unqualified to speak on the subject you feel so strongly about. 

Secondly, Go To School. I literally learned about bacon's rebellion and the racialization of slavery freshman year of high school. 

Thirdly use your damn phone. I googled the racialization of slavery and this paragraph was in the very first link: ""With the hardening of slavery came the emergence of race. Previously, people's appearance and origins had not mattered as much before socially, particularly among the working class. The physical distinctiveness of African slaves - now absent similar European indentured servants - however, not only marked their newly created subordinate position within Virginian society, it became the justification and reason for that position. Virginia's example, in turn, became a model that other British colonies with slaves, when they were created, followed with a mutually reinforcing dynamic. ""Race"" explained why Africans were slaves, while slavery's degradation supplied the evidence for their inferiority. When Thomas Jefferson observed almost a century later that Africans were slaves, the apparent naturalness of their position had erased the actual social history that had produced it.""",1698796860.0

>H mart sells produce... they sell enough things that the store exists, so someone on a bus could buy it. Is there some certain items that you think make other stores a better target? Laundry soap? Batteries? Places can and do put that kind of stuff behind lock and key. 

No one buys food on the bus.

The most comical part of it all is people bragging about the purchase they made on Amazon to disable AFM, but they can’t tell you what benefit they gained other than they saw someone on Reddit say that AFM hurts your engine. Personally I met a guy years ago that had a 4.3 set up to only run on four cylinders just for the extra fuel mileage. That thing ran just fine and never had any issues. Just like anything else, you can find someone who will tell you who will tell you something is good or bad, but there aren’t many people saying it’s bad that can actually tell you why it’s bad.",1698796861.0

I don't know exactly how to properly word this. But you deserve help and compassion. If I could I would reach through the screen right now and give you a big hug. 

 I don't know exactly how it works where you are, but see if you can reach out to a trusted person who can help you. You could try your family doctor, a school counsellor, a mentor. Anyone. If you don't trust them with your whole story just yet, start with the basic: I'm not feeling good. My thoughts are scaring me. I feel disconnected from the people around me. Mental health care gets a bad rep sometimes, but talking about what's going on in your life even if it's just describing what you're experincing to someone in very broad terms can help you process and figure out together what to do from there.

I know our life stories are probably vastly different and I'm just someone on ther internet, but idk, what you describe feels so familiar to me. I just wanted to let you know you are worth fighting for, and hopefully this gives you some energy to keep fighting.",1698796861.0
"Tools","t5_2r8ec","Just did this last year and here's my list. I need to add to it based on the great comments I'm this thread.

Things that aren't in most tool kits, or may be worth buying a specific brand:
*Flashlight
*Duct tape, like small roll of Gorilla brand
*Blue painter's tape, not just for painting but for temporary use without damaging walls
*Zip ties
*Superglue, pack of small tubes is better since they dry out
*Knipex cobra pliers
*Milwaukee 7 in 1 pliers/wire strippers, or whatever your favorite brand is
*Utility knife like Milwaukee fastback
*Vise grips
*6 in putty knife
*Stanley fatmax 16ft measuring tape

Things that are cheaper to buy together in a kit. Lowes has good kits at a reasonable price:
*Socket and wrench sets
*Screwdrivers
*Bit driver with variety of bits
*Allen wrenches
*Needle nose pliers
*Diagonal cutter
*Adjustable wrench
*Claw hammer
*Level

Other:
*Micro flush cutters, any brand that are like Hakko CHP-170
*Cheap multimeter
*Safety glasses
*Husky precision driver kit
*18 or 20V drill, with an extension and driver bit set
*Small set of drill bits
*One chisel, to fix things like a door strike plate that needs to be moved, etc.
*Stud finder",1698796861.0

2. all species are transitional. Period. We can't possibly have an example of every species or tiny little change to ever live, as fossilization is extremely rare. Evolution is (mostly) a continuous process. Sometimes it happens fast, sometimes slow, but it always happens, and we can only see snapshots of it. The fossils we do have paint a convincing picture, and especially with regards to human evolution we have a lot of ""transitional"" species that have more basal characteristics combined with more modern ones. 
3. DNA tests are valid when seeing how closely humans are related, why can this not work to compare us to other species? ICR does not understand genetics.
4. ah yes, the good old entropy argument. Entropy is famously hard to understand, which is probably why ICR uses it here. It's not exactly a measure of order or disorder. It's more of a measurement of how much energy in a closed system is unavailable to do work, and it does increase with time. Earth is not a closed system, we get energy from the sun, thus entropy is irrelevant.",1698796861.0

"worldofpvp","t5_2wbvb","I think that problem has risen since they wanted to make pve gear as good as pvp gear.

Because of that decision we now have a simple honor conquest system without any other restrictions than ressources.

What prevented this problem to occur earlier in eh game's life was that pve gear was useless and to get conquest you needed a certain rating. Which mean that under that rating, nobody had access to that type of gear.

I think it would be much more faire to require a certain ranking after being able to have piece x or y. That way at every rating the playing field is somewhat fair and you don't have to sacrifice character progression for that.

But for it to work it would require to make pve gear unviable in pvp, which I'm for but I don't think blizzard will ever do it.

"podman","t5_u1am9","Pods serve a very specific purpose that requires tight coupling of multiple containers. It's a very important concept with Kubernetes - where every runtime is a pod which consists of one or more containers. Was majority of pods are a single container, and your view of how containers work apply in that case.

Pods allow things like init-containers, side-cars and other features where a piece of code ""watches out"" for other code. Like initializing a database or handling caching. A side-car allows you to separate features like authentication and caching into a separate container, and it can be applied to any container regardless of what programming language they are based on. In other words, it's very important in some cases, that multiple containers have access to one another - like direct memory access. In the vast majority of cases, you don't need that and one pod = one container.

OPs use-case is not common - actually I've never seen a real implementation of a clustered database this way. It's a fun project to learn podman with though, but putting everything in one basket defeats the purpose of clustering to begin with. Since it all shares everything, all containers in a pod must run on the same node. If you lose that node, everything stops - so it's not how we want to do distributed processing to have failovers etc.  But it's easy to setup for testing/learning the concepts.

In kubernetes we use ""StatefulSets"" which creates a set of pods, one per DB instance. It will know not to schedule them on the same nodes by default. What you want to do is have a public front-end like the 80/443 ports that have private (internal) access to the DB cluster which isn't exposed to the outside world.  So 3 pods + 1 pod for user interaction. This way you can scale the StatefulSet if you need more redundancy or processing time, while keeping the user-interface separate and you can scale it without impacting the database.  Pods can do a ton of things beyond just running a single container, so starting where OP does is a way to learn.  But it's not for real-world use.",1698796863.0

I believe they will start securing new more traditional contracts in the very short term. The first two phases of the facility should throw off between 1.5 B and to be profit per year by 2029.  At a conservative 10 multiple. That's a 15 to 20B business. (50-70x)

Additionally, they have the final two phases of the facility which will be financed from cash flow from the first two phases so will not need the same amount of equity partners as Phase 1&2.

They also bought another site which is likely to be another facility albeit well down the road. I firmly believe they will eventually have a 100b business (300x)

Obviously that's 10 plus years away and very optimistic

For downside protection, the company is valued at under 400m... They have already put 1.5 B into the facilities construction and have signed a sale/leaseback for $1B.

So, assuming the target is a language that has basic math operators (+, -, *, /), they should be able to accept the appropriate tokens; perhaps integers or floats for operands but not mixed together.  Build on this idea as needed: add variables and assignment, for example.

I’m thinking you set multiple milestones targeted to take no more than 2 weeks each (which I think allows for 3 milestones, probably).  They should then have a working output binary at minimum by the deadline of Dec 18. You could allow one or optional extensions of type checking and dataflow analysis if appropriate.",1698796863.0

"JapanTravelTips","t5_37afl","I would recommend just booking a hotel for Osaka if you're planning to spend more than a day there. We recently went to Kyoto & Osaka and there was an extra hotel tax charge for Kyoto upon arrival (it wasn't much though). 

The Shinkansen is not cheap and will only stop at Shin-Osaka, which is still pretty far from the central Osaka station. Even with the much more expensive ticket price, you won't actually be saving a lot of time.

For the cheaper express train, it's going to take about 40 minutes one way. Add that to the time it takes to commute to the station, queuing up to buy/pick up train tickets (the queue was long since there are a lot of tourists), you're looking at around 2-3 hours return trip. Also if you haven't been to Kyoto or Osaka stations before, chances are you will probably get lost in the station at some point as it can be a bit confusing. Not worth it in my opinion.",1698796864.0

Before you ask how do I know gun control works? Well my source is every other country in the world that doesn't let children be routinely slaughtered in their schools. 

>So for something to be effective it has to work 100% of the time?

It generally has to work at least most of the time. Like for example gun control in say the UK. 1 or 2 gun incidents slip through once in a blue moon. So I'd say its pretty effective there. 

I don't expect to convince you or any gun nut tbh, I don't think most of the world expects it anymore either. Not after sandy hook. Something like that, so deeply, truly, unfathomably horrific as that and to just do... nothing. Its pretty clear after that that no amount of dead children is too many. No amount of dead children is worth more than your guns. I think the rest of the world just wants you to at least be honest about it.",1698796864.0

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","ADHD Inattentive. It was sorta fine until around age 12, then it was impossible to do homework, wake up in time, go to bed in time etc.. Was always daydreaming in school, not really paying attention. Never active in class. Easy target for bullying. Still managed to get 3-5/6 in everything tough, somehow. 

Guess I was just too quiet to be noticed, and isolated myself because of the bullying. So no one thought I had adhd, and just assumed I was a loner with anxiety issues (weird that wasn't enough to get help). Didn't get diagnosed until recently, really wonder what my life would look Iike if i got diagnosed and treated for it 25 years ago..",1698796865.0
"IWantToBeHerHentai2","t5_4ebedy","You submitted a post tagged as Solo. Please ensure your post adheres to Rule 11.

> Solo content must explicitly state (or heavily imply) why you want to be the girl in the image. The image must display a fantasy or desire element that you wish to experience.

If your post title does not explicitly state why you want to be her, reply to this comment **explaining why you think the implication alone is sufficient.** Failure to do so will result in the post being removed. A reply does not guarantee your post will be approved.

Solo masturbation images are not allowed unless it includes a unique element that you wish to experience. This should be indicated in your title. Additionally, roleplay quote titles are not allowed on solo posts unless you believe the quote itself sufficiently conveys why you want to be her.

Posts that display an obviously desired fetish such as exhibition, bondage, etc are not subjected to this rule.

He's ridiculously strong, durable, his fire casual fire attacks are on the same level as Endeavors near-suicide attack and he's invulnerable to the fire where as Endeavor suffers and can actually die just from using his own fire powers too much.

As a team, I could see Prime All Might fighting even peak Escanor reasonably well in terms of physical strength and giving him a wingman to help with ranged attacks and to tag out with, gives the duo a serious chance of lasting an hour till Escanor starts to power down. 

But it'd be exciting. 

As for 1on1 Escanor obliterates Endeavor pretty much for the entire day time. Super early morning or at night and I'm fairly sure Endeavor wins though.",1698796865.0

Seriously, check your water meter it should not be spinning with all water in the house shut off. Also, I must manually add water to my pool with the garden, no auto-refill feature. If you have auto-refill, it could be defective allowing a slight amount of water into your pool, yet, you won’t notice it due to normal evaporation. 

As said before, the front water main line was broken before I even bought the house. The Home Inspector I paid for should’ve caught this. So, as a rookie new homeowner with a pool, I’m getting $140.00+ water bills a month and think “oh, that must be normal cuz of the pool”. Wrong. Meanwhile, the family of 4 next door without a pool is paying $40.00. 

My-then water bill states I’m using 120,000g of water a month by myself. Huh? That’s means refilling my pool 11x a month? No, I’m not.
I even received a letter from the Water Co saying my property is using way more water than previous history. Front water lines are a plastic pipe buried 4ft underground from the meter in the sidewalk to the front yard shutoff valve. They can break over time or get damaged by tree roots. Yet, the yard shows no signs of water anywhere. Also, a constantly running toilet burns through water too. Check your meter. Good luck.",1698796866.0

"Palestine","t5_2qhak","I'm confident Israel *does* have access to precision weapons capable of minimizing casualties, the US has been using them for 10+ years. Notably, in the Battle of Mosul, the US made extensive use of weapons that are designed to *kill the occupants of a single room* (there is a chance of killing more people than that, but it's far reduced). The US has been using Predator drones to literally stalk targets for days and weeks to wait for an opportunity to strike them while minimizing civilian casualties, often destroying only 1-3 vehicles in the process.

The US was still criticized to hell and back for this.

Meanwhile Israel is destroying entire city blocks of high rises at a time to destroy a hand full of targets.

Israel doesn't give a fuck about civilian casualties. If anything, it's apparent they've chosen to use methods *other than those* that would minimize civilian casualties.",1698796867.0

I've wasted several months of my life and I'll never get it back, I have to accept that and move past that bit by bit. You just have to do one small change or action that leads to something better and keep being consistent towards it, and it's okay to mess up a few times. I'm not perfect and neither is anyone.

You get a bunch of scrapes and cuts, but you won't leave it untreated. You'll put an ointment and a bandaid and let time heal those wounds, yeah? Your body heals on its own with consistent care and time, just like how your habits can be treated with another alternative to it and keep being consistent along with time.

You realize that, you're already ahead of many. It's up to you to take the first steps and slowly move forward. It'll fly by before you look back and see how far you've come.

And don't worry about girls. If you like someone or if someone approaches you, take a chance. But first, you and your well-being is most important. I hope the best for you and may your journey lead you towards a better day than yesterday, Prize.",1698796867.0

She was going to work and waiting at the bus stop when a car pulled up to her and 2 men exited the vehicle beside her. They exited their vehicle pointing a gun at her, brought it up to her head, and said “get in the car or I’m gonna blow your fucking head out.” They then put her arms in zip ties and forced her in the trunk. 


They drove 3-5 hours or so and eventually she felt the car become stationary and the 2 men’s voices were no longer stationary. She kicked the trunk open like her life depended on it (I mean, it did) and ran away as far as she could. 


She was kidnapped in St Louis, MO and ended up in some cornfields in Illinois close to Chicago. I guess the time period in which the 2 men left and she freed herself was when she was supposed to get picked up by another dispatch.


Not sure if she was kidnapped by some low level gang to be pimped out, or if it was an actual high-level trafficking ring. But she was going to get trafficked nonetheless so yeah, it’s real. People get kidnapped all the time everywhere in the world, it’s not that surprising.",1698796867.0

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

>After a long and bitter struggle, a squad of Grey Knights managed to reach the Damnation Cache and close the Warp portal. Starved of their daemonic allies, the Traitor Legions were forced onto the defensive and finally into retreat. Abaddon's forces left Pythos, escaping the vengeance of the Imperium, but the world had been irrevocably tainted by the touch of the Warp, its once proud cities and vast wilds twisted into a nightmarish landscape. **Before the portal was closed, however, Abaddon took with him a psyker, rumoured to be of prodigious strength and the bearer of a unique gift that would aid the Warmaster in his forthcoming Black Crusade.**

>>**From Fulgrim, Primarch of the Emperor’s Children, the Despoiler was gifted with the favour of Slaanesh in exchange for the Pythosian psyker, offered as an unblemished vessel to contain the avatar of Fulgrim’s god.** Ancient hatreds were set aside as the Emperor’s Children aligned themselves with the Black Legion.

As far as the movement actually being worth 15-30xs more, no, it’s not. A rolex might make you money, an IWC most likely won’t increase in value. I know you don’t want to discuss investment potential/hedges but it is a legitimate factor when someone decides to spend that kind of money on a watch(unless you are too rich to care.) While I personally would rather spend $1,000 on a micro brand and support them than some random factory encroaching on somebody else’s reputation and intellectual property, I can understand a few reasons why some people would lean towards a replica. I just think it’s silly that people here have so much resentment towards these brands for being expensive, yet they don’t have a problem wearing the name or supporting illegal enterprises. Micro brands and large brands actually have to spend marketing dollars and pay their staff a living wage. These factories get your hard earned dollars by doing a fraction of the work.

"mercedes_benz","t5_2tglq","The 6 cylinders have round exhaust tips and a shorter rear end whereas the V8s have a longer rear end with side air slats and rectangular exhaust tips, making them wider and sharper in rear. The bumper line is straight on the 43 but curved downwards on the 55/63. 

My first instinct seeing this photo was that the car looked rounder and shorter in rear and therefore was a 6 cylinder. Hard to tell since it’s all black. Other giveaways would be the yellow performance brake callipers on the 63 and a wider and longer front fascia on the V8 models but it’s too hard to see.",1698796870.0
"mormon","t5_2qky2",">The Israelites that were taken from Israel mostly ended up in what is now Iraq, in what is known as the Babylonian captivity. They wouldn't have had contact with or influence on anything outside of that area.

This isn't exactly true. I know my language knowledge is sparse compared to yours. But I understand history pretty well, and this is not historically accurate. The first group of Israelites were taken north to the Assyrian empire, and were very close to the steppe lands. They were practically on the steppe lands, because they were right next door to the later Turks. But I'm guessing you are saying since they were subjugated, there words wouldn't show up as much.

But I do want to point out that it wasn't just a few Israelites that went North, but many from the Northern Kingdoms. I believe the number was at least 100k or more, but I would have to double check. This is documented too with primary historical sources.",1698796870.0

#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

>Ｘ What is the difference between の and が ?

>◯ I saw a book called 日本人の知らない日本語 , why is の used there instead of が ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

>Ｘ What does this mean?

>◯ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

>Ｘ What's the difference between 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意?

>◯ Jisho says 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意 all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does 全く同感です。 work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between は and が ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

It’s the opposite. They are stating they released the card with the intention of creating a temporary meta where cost reduction was nerfed. That means they understood the scope of what this impact would be, understood that they’d change it fairly quickly, and released it that way, charging full amount, and without notifying anyone.

They could have given it away for free, announced it’d be a “one month variant power” or something if they really wanted that.

"Makeup","t5_2qrwc","I'm non binary but I still want to answer! I hated make up and the idea of it until I was like 15 but because of internalized misogyny mostly. But also I felt like people felt compelled to wear it and I didn't want to do something until \*I\* wanted to do it if that makes sense. I was already bullied so I kinda didn't give a hoot about fitting in and stuff. I loved the look of red lipstick and eyeliner so that's what I tried first. I didn't even wear mascara for a few years just those two. Then I loved the creativity of eyeshadows colors and stuff so I tried some weird stuff with it to express myself. Turns out I'm now heavily allergic to any powder or creamy thing on my eyes. (probably always was, but the denial ran deep when I loved the look of something lol I don't sacrifice comfort over aesthetics anymore though I'm too disabled for thisss) I can only do liner mascara and lipstick. Which is fine because I love those most! I replaced the creativeness allowed by eyeshadows with graphic colorful liners and loved to experiment with it at some point as well. I recommend glisten cosmetics, they have nice colors that don't irritate my eyes at all. I mostly just wear winged liner mascara and lipstick now because I don't have the energy or money for more. Never felt the need to dabble into foundation at all tho, I don't like the texture  and don't feel like it's a necessity even if I have ""skin imperfections"" and stuff, I understand the purpose but it's imo not a must to have a nice make up look. I'd say if you don't like make up, and never like, that's totally fine, make up is just a creative outlet like another and something to can sometimes make you feel nice but you can express yourself in any other way and also still feel nice without it!! My advice is just to do whatever you want, no matter what other people do there's no right way to wear or not wear make up if you want to experiment with things do it like you want and if you don't that's cool! And if you're interested in trying liners the best product is nyx matte liquid liner I swear by it, I've tried so many and none ever did the trick for me apart from this one over the many years I've used liner. As for lipsticks my favourite are the retro luxe liquid matte by make up revolution (but I think they were discontinued ??).",1698796871.0

I am also unsure of the meaning of your sneer quotes around ""enlightenment"".    ...when the human race evolved everything and stuff.

Sholars generally put the magnitude of the Islamic slave trade at ~12-million.  With probably a much larger number perishing from starvationor disease on the journey, or from crude emascularion with a hot knife.

I'll look into this ""reading a book"" idea of yours though.  It sounds interesting.

Until I figure out how ""reading a book"" works, here's an ""article"" for anyone curious about the Barbary slave trade.

The lion abruptly stops and says ""Woah! This guy seems tougher then he looks, I better leave while I can"".

Over by the tree top, a monkey witnessed everything. Evidently, the monkey realizes he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. So the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily ""Get on my back, we'll get him together"".

So they start rushing back to the dog. The dog sees them and realized what happened and starts to panic even more. He then gets another idea and shouts ""Where the hell is that monkey?? I told him to bring me another lion an hour ago!!!""",1698796872.0

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","Call me fucking nuts, but for pitching they’ll be ok, just enough.

Max would’ve started Game 7 if needed, and in that scenario, it’ll now be Gray, and I imagine Eovaldi would also be ready to pitch an inning or two, with the only pitcher 100% unavailable being Montgomery

I get it, no Max SUCKS, but I genuinely think it’s ok

For hitting, Garcia has a huge knack for the BIG moments. The Hollywood style “holy shit he shines brightest under the biggest lights” type guy. He’s also got all the postseason RBIs it feels like lmao. BUT, again call me fucking nuts, there’s potential to be ok without him. This is NOT the end of the Rangers

ALWCS G1, Garcia 1-5 with a single, Rangers won 4-0

ALWCS G2, Garcia 1-5 with a solo homer, but the Rangers won 7-1

ALDS G1, Garcia 1-5, 4 Ks, but his he scored a run after he doubled then Carter doubled. Rangers won 3-2, so that is a game where they needed him

ALDS G2, Garcia 2-5, RBI single, other hit a single off the pitcher. Rangers won 11-8, so his contributions helped, but his teammates also went off as well

ALDS G3, Garcia 2-4, 3 run homer by him put the game out of reach (6-0). His contributions absolutely helped, but their pitching held the O’s to just 1, a team effort. Rangers won 7-1

ALCS G1, Garcia 0-4. Rangers won 2-0

ALCS G2, Garcia 1-3, RBI single. Rangers won 5-4 so yea his RBI helped just as much, but other contributors working strong

ALCS G5, we know the 3 run bomb, but sadly that was blown

Now here he goes crazy from here on

But basically what I’m saying is the Rangers CAN find victory without him. Yes his presence in the lineup changes everything and now that he isn’t there it’ll change how they’re pitched. Yes it SUCKS he’s gone, but on a lot of those winning games, contributions come from a lot of teammates not just him. They gotta find that for 2 more wins and it’s home free.

This is not the end of the world for the Rangers. Jan is just fine defensively and his bat ain’t as good, but his speed can potentially cause chaos if he’s on the bases even once or twice",1698796872.0

On your squat past parallel question, it really depends on your goals. If you are at all interested in olympic lifts, you need to, otherwise if you have no mobility issues, all lifters should hit at least legal powerlifting depth, but have no need to go lower. 
Hitting PL depth consistently is both better for having a stable benchmark for a good lift and has some evidence if being better for your joints than an above parallel squat",1698796872.0

"HouseofUsher","t5_107880","Pym apparently didn't have anything outside of the Ushers. He claims that, at least, though he clearly had something Verna would have accepted as the price of a deal. His fate without a deal wasn't certain, either. Verna said it was 50/50 that Camille's file on him would be found. Pym had no way of knowing if he'd end up in prison or not. All he knew for sure is that he was no longer protected if Camille's file was found, and wouldn't be without making his own deal with Verna. 

He was willing to take his chances without a deal, no matter what the consequences would be. I think, as far as Pym was concerned, life in prison, however long he had left, was a better deal than whatever would have resulted from making a deal with Verna, after seeing the cost paid by the Ushers. I don't think it was ever explicitly stated to Pym that only Rod and Madeline made the deal, not Rod's kids, but he had more than enough information to realise that's what happened. Their recollections of meeting Verna would have timed it enough for Pym to realise Freddie and Tammy were little kids, and either none of the rest or only Vic born at the time. Basically, Pym knew that the twins deal cost the lives of innocents, or people who were innocent at the time the deal was struck. It also cost the lives of people outside the family. Pym saw firsthand the result of Prospero's death, for instance. 

The cost of making a deal with Verna is exceptionally high. It was a cost Rod and Madeline were willing to pay until payment came due, and even then it was only their own part of the payment they wanted to stop, not the payment the kids covered. To Pym, I think, no deal was worth that kind of cost. 

I think freedom was like money to Pym. Great to have, but something worth giving up if the cost of keeping it gets too high. Verna's cost was too high, so Pym took his chances and willingly gave up his freedom.

Interestingly, though, Pym is the only conviction post Usher deaths. No matter what evidence they found, Camille's files or otherwise, it wasn't enough to convict anyone. Either that or those people had deals with Verna themselves. Pym, upon being arrested, never said a word other than to plead guilty to his charges. I can't see that as redemption, because he did nothing to help stop other people who were just as bad as the Ushers. He gave up his own freedom, sure, but he continued to protect the rich and powerful who did bad things. Just not actively as he had with the Ushers.",1698796872.0

That said, air could travel between the sheets and cause condensation somewhere in the gaps if it gets cold enough.

"REBubble","t5_3lflvh","The important factor really is how much. People will take a few percentage points of rental rate year-over-year and conflate that into the sky or rents are falling. The biggest issue in a lot of areas is that with the low rates and growing population and good economy, it was good time to start building, so a lot of apartments have come online in the last few years, and more are still coming but starts are dropping. Same with new construction. So it seems unlikely to think that That will continue.

 I'm not sure what percentage of this is apartments coming online and what percentage is investors seeking to rent out long-term when they tried to do short-term. I would guess it's a relatively small percentage that is from these would be short-term rentals converting to long-term, and it's not like the short-term rental market has crashed completely. From what I understand anecdotally, in the Seattle area, people I know are doing as well as they ever have been with short-term rentals. This is despite crackdowns and granted my sample definitely includes outside the city of Seattle.

But this seems very much like a case of someone taking a few small factors and trying to conflate them into something they aren't. There may be some rentals coming onto the sale market, and that might affect prices a little bit. But the idea that some real estate coming on the rental market driving wrench down and that will result in driving for sale prices down seems like kind of a complex stretch that doesn't seem to likely and to the extent it does, would probably take years to trickle down and have any real effect",1698796873.0

I guess we just disagree about the last part. I truly believe children can be successfully raised in a community of good caregivers with (less) exposure to a poor primary caregiver. Harder for the community to cancel out a shitty parent when there isn’t sufficient balance between the two, but otherwise I think having lots of interaction with loving secondary caregivers is ultimately more protective.

Tactician Plus (200 or 300%hp and either +2 or Scaling Stats)  
Stronger Bosses and Enemies  
Lethal AI

&#x200B;

These inflate the numbers so you can min max to your hearts content and still not 1-turn enemies.   
Gives enemies appropriate spells, attacks, actions, and abilities for their class and race (I.e enemies have more spell slots and humans will use different spells than goblins. Also bosses have more stuff)  
Lethal AI (Makes the AI better in some cases. They will use their terrain more, more vertical choices, focusing your characters with less HP or AC, stuff like that).

It's a spectrum for a reason.
You saying it's a terrible depiction and painting out that the actor isn't autistic makes it pretty clear to me, that you want to make everything about yourself. God forbid the show refers to someone else, and someone else finds it relatable but not you, oh no!
I am not autistic  however the doctors believed for quite some time that I am autistic ( turns out I am only a little weird, and very introvert,  that's all), instead I have been diagnosed with ADHD.
And guess what, I'm not offended when a tv show is overdoing something like ADHD or an actor doesn't have ADHD.

"ftmspunished","t5_addfp","ALERT! Here are some common issues with comments that may result in removal. It is also solid advice and doing you a favor if you were planning on just sending a few characters in response. It’s not too late to edit!

 - Too little effort: only saying “DM me.”

 - Too little consent: introducing a new kink without asking, that the OP did not reference. Try to aim for what seems like is being asked for. With something like a humiliation flair, yes, misgendering or body-shaming can be part of humiliation, but you don’t want to assume if it’s not referenced by OP.

 - Here’s how to horny-comment just right: your comment should interact with the kink (post, title, flair) and person (user flair, profile). If you’d like to play in DMs, you may ask if they’d like to chat further, or go ahead and DM them if they don’t say not to in their post, pinned posts, or bio. The OP can and may also DM you themselves if they like your comment.

As other commenters have said, we don’t know when we will die. There is no guarantee that you will have the opportunity to be able to repent. 

As far as the touching I do understand. I was young(er) once. These relationships always escalate in haram ways because of male and female natural attraction. When a man and women are alone, shaitan is the 3rd. There is no possible way to keep this halal at the current state. I will say bluntly that it is not right. There is no if, and, or buts about it. In no scenario other than marriage is this permissible. It doesn’t matter if we cannot “stop”. We must!!

My brother I advise you, and implore out of love for a fellow Muslim. As someone who made mistakes younger in life I promise you you will regret these mistakes. These things damage us, they damage our Iman, and they take us away from Islam. And you cannot know how things will turn out, how you or her will change. We have best intentions with a spouse or partner, but as we age we change our priorities 

May Allah guide us all and keep us on the straight path",1698796875.0

"brum","t5_2rdjk","Honestly, I love Birmingham. I've come from Wrexham and what people call rough is honestly just due to the Tories - The whole of the UK is like this right now.

I particularly love digbeth, edgbaston, the city centre, JQ and the Gay village/chinese quarter. Prices can be a bit high in some areas, but most people are happy and friendly, and I find a lot of joy in finding independent shops and cafés.

The queer scene in brum can't be topped. Everyone I've met is down to earth and kind. Manchester, London and other areas have always got this ""snobby"" attitude about them every time I go...

And not to mention the diversity. Coming from North Wales, I've grew up in a very predominantly white town with very little diversity. Being in such a culture-rich city is a blessing in itself - it makes you curious to understand different cultures, to try new things.

Lyanna was a wild woman, who adored Horseback riding and wanted to learn how to fight.

Robert was a man who adored hunting and fighting and we have no indication that he really cared for a ""conventional"" wife.  He never gave Cersei a real chance (not that it would have ever worked even if he did), he would have with Lyanna. 

He might have even personally taught Lyanna to fight if she had asked him.",1698796876.0

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","I embraced the idea of being a man from childhood because that’s what was expected of me. In high school, Snapchat released a bunch of filters, and one of them was a gender swap filter. I remember seeing myself in that filter and for the first time in a while, I was genuinely smiling. A friend of mine saw it and roasted me for it, and I shoved the whole thing under a rug and adopted a new “personality”.  I used to claim to be Thor. I had a tiny bong that I called mjolnir, I had a glorious beard, and I was built from working at a warehouse and trying to fit in with the guys there. At some point during that phase, I started feeling “different”. I started wanting to understand what makes people themselves, and how deep does the self go. Standard stoner thoughts, shocking right? But I kept digging and digging, slowly combing my philosophy studies with a slight interest in the eastern religion philosophical views namely Buddhism, and I couldn’t understand why I felt the urgent need to know. This studying and reading spread across about four years of varying degrees of urgency, but wouldn’t leave me alone. I tried shrooms and one point and I felt something that I knew I had to escape from, but had no idea what it was. After losing a job (completely unrelated to the shrooms, I was an alcoholic for a while) I spent months just thinking about life and how to become the best person I could be to avoid anymore needless suffering. After I started working again, the urgency returned and it was overwhelming.  At some point, I was scrolling TikTok and came across a transition video. The person posting it had the rough outline of “could I really look like that?” While showing off other people who have gone through the process, and it ended with them being their true self and that kinda broke any barrier I had left from high school. I went to the mirror and took a deep look into my own eyes, and I finally understood. I wasn’t running from my relationship, I wasn’t running away from working, and I wasn’t running away from any unknown omnipotent vengeful fungus, I was running from myself. I spent a few months in denial, and then I caught Covid. While I was very fortunate to have minor symptoms, it made me think about all those we lost to the virus, and how so few people were able to live their lives. I came out after I recovered, and while I have yet to start the medical process to become myself, my life has changed dramatically for the better. I feel better mentally, I communicate better with everyone than I did before, and I finally understand what that quote means; “we have two lives, our first one ends when we realize we only have one life to live”. All this is to say that, while I did embrace and cherish my masculinity, I’ve always been the woman I am today I just couldn’t find the light switch in the closet. It was always right outside the door",1698796876.0

Every creek in the roof send my wife into a worry if its another leak. We usually just turn the mains off at night.

To minimise any further damage, they are currently repiping the roof with Auspex product. They also say that they will fix any leak in the wall as they appear. BGC are in a shitty situation but are thankfully not ignoring the issue.

Therefore, the reunion at the end with Perdita and Hermione is kind of like Shakespeare renouncing his profession in favour of family, perhaps as he knows he hasn’t much time. Either that, or the play is a bit of an allegory for King James I about what makes a good king. The Tempest would then act as Shakespeare’s farewell with him as Prospero of course.

morning fullon definitely deserves its own box, so does uk psy.

all the techier styles are missing. i.e. 2001-style psytek, new flying rhino style. that minimal-influenced ""psytechno"" thing that was popular 10 years ago.

if you differentiate forest prog from dark prog (i never would have thought of doing that) and psycore from dark hitech, prog also needs more styles. new astrix is quite different from zen mechanics is quite different from shiva chandra is quite different from andromeda is quite different from vini vici if you want to include that latter)

i wouldn't make a style called nightpsy. nightpsy mostly stands for darkpsy+night fullon+twilight.

how is psycore atmospheric?

First of all, I didn't know that there is an other app for Authenticator. On android device, I never used or downloaded a second app to be able to use authenticator feature.
So I downloaded it on iOS. And this app seems to works well. But I'm still stuck on the dashlane app when trying to access authenticator page.
Is it normal? Do I need to use the third party app? Can I use the main Dashlane app to access authenticator codes? 

And to answer you steps by step : 
1. I can see the first OTP item in the list because the accordion is opened. But the Dashlane app freeze, so I can't navigate and use the app. I can't show other OTP 

2. On the Android device I only use Dashlane app with the integrated authenticator feature. I have never used or downloaded the third party Authenticator App

3. As mentioned, I have downloaded the Authenticator app (that seems to work). But the Dashlane app still freeze when accessing authenticator feature page. (And so yes, both app are updated and I have reinstalled the Dashlane app twice)",1698796878.0

They spent a ton of money in the 90’s and 2000’s developing hybrid tech, and didn’t actually make a profit off the Prius (usually sold at a loss) until the 3rd gen, more than a decade after its initial introduction 

([Source](https://www.ft.com/content/146ad23c-7230-11e2-89fb-00144feab49a))

That cost might not be something Toyota is willing to invest in quite as heavily today, which is a bit of a shame because the Prius is part of what allowed them to become the global leader in car manufacturing. Once you get used to massive profits and low risk, it’s a tough drug to beat. 

They have a real opportunity to keep doing that: keep making reliable, mostly affordable cars people will keep for a decade while remaining on the cutting edge with some models. The 23 Prius is a nice facelift but everything else has been iterative for almost 20 years.  Maybe they’ve decided to sit this upcoming (current?) vehicle revolution out and jump in as a copycat once EV tech is more mature, with a larger war chest?",1698796878.0

People saying they were going to call the cops on them, calling their Father ""sexist"", comparing kids and saying one is cute another is ugly, how they dress their kids and how ugly the kids clothes are, making fun of their looks, etc. There's a way to have an opinion and not be ignorant. Better yet, if someone doesn't like them, don't follow them, steal their pictures or talk about them, it's pretty easy.

As far as them sharing every second of their lives online, they actually don't, they share bits and pieces and people think they can fill in the blanks to their liking.

So, you dislike them because of their religious beliefs? I don't recall any of them pressuring any of us to agree with their beliefs.

I will defend anyone getting bullied, stranger or not. No one has to ask, it's what I do and will continue to do. Living in this world is hard enough, we're all in this together. How is it ok to just come on a site under a fictious name and say whatever you want about someone? All of us put ourselves out there when we are online. They aren't punching bags, they're human beings, thankfully with thick skin to ignore the ignorance. Another thing, before Rylee was on DWTS people didn't have much to say about her, now they are beating her to the ground. I guess it makes some feel good to do this to an 18 year old that is more mature than a lot of people on here.

I'm definitely not infantilizing them, I'm fully aware they can handle themselves and are not children. I loathe bullies!",1698796879.0

"pharmacy","t5_2qjl3","Be understanding and patient (or as much as you can be) with us. Most important, call corporate and complain about the lack of staffing. However, when you do, make sure to stress numerous times that it is not the staff doing anything wrong, it is not that you get poor service bc of anything we did, but that it is strictly the understaffing that is an issue. And make sure to stress how much of a safety risk it is to the public. Finally, when something does go wrong in the pharmacy, try to find out what is REALLY the issue. 99% of the time, we get yelled at for things beyond our control and no matter how many times or how many different ways we try to explain the issue, customers blame us. The issues most common that are out of our hands completely (there are a ton) are: meds on backorder so we literally cannot get them, insurance will NOT cover the med, doctor left something off the prescription that is necessary for us to fill and we must reach them first to clarify, we are bound to certain laws or company policies and cannot break them (early refills on controls, giving meds for free or loaning meds, etc), and so on. Yes, there are ways we can help to resolve these (call doc to clarify, offer coupon to decrease price on non-covered med, find alternative that is in stock and call md for you, etc), but beyond this, there are major things that are out of our hands that we get yelled at for all day every day. This then uses up more of our time and further hinders our ability to care for other patients. Thank you for thinking of us and wanting to help improve the way pharmacies are run.",1698796879.0

This is my favorite epilogue of all epilogues. >!There is a kid. The kid even gets an epilogue.!<

I recently finished {The Gentleman and the Rogue by Summer Devon and Bonnie Dee} and it has a very nice epilogue, though I don't remember if it's multiple years in the future. The HEA is period-appropriate, meaning they have to keep their relationship hidden. But it's a very happy HEA imo. >!There is a kid.!<

The extended epilogue is what MADE {The Lion and the Crow by Eli Easton} for me. Personally I loved it, but it does follow them to the end of their ever after, if you catch my drift. So I suppose I can see why some people wouldn't like it. For me, the epilogue was by far the best part of the book.",1698796880.0

"classicalmusic","t5_2qhyq","It could well be that Brahms had nothing else to say. I can't suppress a little smile, though, when you say some people presuppose ""he had something better to say and destroyed it."" It is actually known that Brahms destroyed quite a lot of his compositions. Only a fraction was published. He had a painful sense of restraint... but the pressure on him was huge, and ironically it was Schumann who created it. Schumann wrote to the most prestigious music journals of the time that Brahms was the future of music, implicitly suggesting it was now Brahms' task to achieve what he couldn't. And people were certainly expecting great things of Brahms long before he delivered them. Whether the works he burnt were truly worse or better than those he left, we'll never know.",1698796881.0

"vaginismus","t5_2vz6k","Wow, couldn't say it better. It's such a relief, isn't it? The whole mandatory treatment just rubs me the wrong way. I started this rant after seeing a girl talking about vaginismus in a rather mainstream subreddit in my country. Needless to say, some men were borderline creepy, but a lot of others were thinking they're being nice by saying ""of course I would date you IF you're seeking treatment"". This IF pissed me off so much. 

Then another guy said that vaginismus affected women's view on femininity and they should not feel less woman because of that. How shouldn't we?! With all those strong reactions about the mere possibility of not having a hole to put your dick in. So this got me fired up and I wrote this at 2 am lol.

At the same time, this is all so sad, isn't it? Those guys have no idea of what a strong, intimate connection with a partner looks like. They never open themselves outside the expectations. There are so many things that we can do. I totally agree with you, this is such a small part in sex in other circles. I think not being straight helps a lot on assessing possibilities and communicating with your SO or even your fling. 

So yeah, thanks for reading my rant and I share the sentiment. I truly believe people can intimately connect with each other in so many ways than just PiV sex.",1698796881.0

Main issue is shortening the life of the alternator pulling 120 amp continuous. Although you said you have a LI-BIM which does like 15 minutes on 20 minutes off to try and save the alternator. Aftermarket high output can help too depending on build quality, just very difficult to get one rated for continuous duty most of the time the output rating is only for short periods. The rule of thumb is only pull half the rated capacity of the alternator continuously so 120 amps would need a 240 amp rated alternator and that not counting the amps the chassis needs usually around 30 amps.",1698796882.0

And the results aren't exactly something I'd call progress. If Robert Strong is Gregor Clegane, Qyburn has achieved the animation of a corpse into... Something. The cost is not justifiable in terms of time, work, and apparently several people. Qyburn didn't just experiment on The Mountain, he also did experiments on several people at least. As far as I know, there's no conclusive proof it's actually just him in there. At least theoretically, it might not even be just him in there. It may not have been The Mountain at all. Doran Martell receives a human skull he considers to be plausibly the skull of Gregor. Or a man of similar size. There aren't ANY men the size of him.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8",">Sounds like your problem isn't that interested women aren't texting you unless you text first. It sounds like your problem is you are vastly overestimating your own attractiveness. If you are the most interesting/attractive person a woman talks to in a night, you will have her attention, no matter how many others are vying for it.

Right. You're kind of making my point for me.

A guy who gives the girl the number. Pretty much needs to be the best of the bunch. 

A guy who continues to pursue the girl. Doesn't have to the best. He can rely on luck. Because often you're just an Average Joe competing with 5 other Average Joes. All of similar abilities. The only thing separating you guys is happenstance. 

My entire argument is that getting the girls number is more utilitarian. It gets better results. 

Average Joe who always gives his # to girls will just sit and watch his phone do nothing. Because every girl has 5-50 other guys just like him hitting them up.",1698796883.0

And also had one where I was looking at the sky and saw earth orbiting the sun. And it was also duplicated, I saw 2 of them next to each other. And btw yes I was on earth in my dream. And I also knew what I was seeing was just earth orbiting the sun sometime in the past because the solar system is moving through the galaxy, so dream me knew I was seeing 2 instances form the past. And then other people started looking at it too and there were planes trying to stop everyone from looking. 

And then I had a lucid dream where I went in the bathroom and looked in the mirror, realised I was dreaming and remembered the thing I heard about never asking what time it is if you're in a dream cause it will get scary. So anyway, I decided to ask what time it is cause I was curious. And it did get kinda scary after that. Basically I was looking at my reflection with this smartass grin like ""I'm about to find out some stuff lmao"" and asked what time it is. And then reflection me tilted her head to the side and had an evil ""lmao now you're doomed"" grin on her face and her eyes turned black.

""I'm sick of all these conferences. I always say the same things over and over!""

The driver agrees: ""You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place.""

""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!""

So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.

The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :

""Sir, your question is so easy that I'm going to let my driver explain it to you.""",1698796884.0

The are 2 reasons on why they created Hamas,

1.	⁠divide the Palestinian front
2.	⁠Make the Palestinians seem more radical, a bogeyman that they must defeat and cast blame.

There is a corrupt entity within Isreal, just look at  the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","Trust me, not wanting to live and not having anything to fear are two entirely different things. Imagine not wanting to live, but instead of dying, being stuck in your body with no way to move or communicate, no chance of feeding or cleaning yourself. Imagine on top of that, being covered in spiders, insects, snakes, or god knows what else all while not able to do anything about it. Let's say none of those things bother you, there's always murder, r*pe, and any of the above happening to any friends or loved ones.

Hell, sake of argument and all, let's say you truly don't have any fears. A bad trip will put them in your mind anyway. People or things you don't normally fear or hate, shame you've never felt, dangers you've never been anywhere near can be just injected into your head because that kind of thing literally alters your brain, at least for a while.

I'm normally one to give people the benefit of the doubt or at least not care but I seriously hope you're just being obstinate just to argue with people. If you've worked in mental health for 13 years, I seriously hope it was as a custodian or orderly or something, not actually dealing with people because if you honestly think apathy or suicidal tendencies means having nothing to fear, your takeaway after over a decade is basically nothing at all. The human mind is easily one of the most fucked up things in existence and believe you me it can conjure up nightmares you'd never imagine if it's given the right ingredients.

"Filmmakers","t5_2r1ip","So fear wise lenses and lighting will make even a bad camera look at least decent even if you say it’s that way for style. But you can take the best cameras ever made and if your lighting is bad or didn’t bother with it and you use cheaper lenses then it’s not going to look good no matter what the camera is. Plus if you’re just starting out think about it like this; camera bodies get updates to them every two to five years and while that in no way makes them obsolete it does however lower their resale value. Good lenses tend to keep their value. And even if a lenses value goes down a bit, as soon as they make good mount adapters their value goes way back up. Even old lenses from the 60’s like the Helios mk44-2 58mm f:2 lens you see everyone on YouTube raving about was used for several shots in “Tha Batman” that came out a little while back. Granted it was rehoused so they’d have fallowfocus gears, PL Mount and what not, it’s the same optics. Good lenses stay good and will always have a reason to use on different projects but you’ll find yourself replacing cameras in the future more than you’re replacing your lenses. Even lighting does t change much. Other than tungsten bulbs slowly being replaced by LED technology, as long as your lights all have a similar CRI so the color temp isn’t different from different brands then for the most part light is light. Just white balance the camera. Then you’re good.",1698796885.0

"AskAnthropology","t5_2wl4u","In Latin America, at least, it is very common to pray to the souls in the purgatory. This is because it is believed that as they are close to both our world and heaven, they can intervine somehow miraculously in our lives. In return of their favors, you have to pray a rosary (or multiple rosaries) so they can finally reach heaven.

The thing is once you start praying to those souls, you can't get out. You have to pray to them or scary things will start happening to you, so you have to be very careful.

I learned this because one of my professors took us on a field trip to a park where this kind of ritual happens every Monday evening, the day that you are supposed to pray to the souls. It is really interesting to see, because it is literally just a park where kids go to play, people walk their dogs or just hang out, so you wouldn't imagine that  kind of stuff happens there. The thing is that the park has a really deep history with violence and death that isn't that obvious at first sight, so understanding how history and beliefs can come together is simply fascinating.",1698796885.0

> I just let people into my home to get on their feet and volunteered to feed them. I also volunteered to tutor poor kids.

This is all still very vague. Can you relay one specific instance where helped a  poor person? What did you do? What did you give them? How long did they stay?

Traffic and alley rats are enough for me to keep her indoors and never even try to take her out on a harness for the fear that she’d get a taste for it and try to make a run for the door. I don’t think a cat would try to get outside just because they’re bored if they’ve never been out before.

The only difficulty I had/have is that I do adore women and don’t particularly even like other men. Men annoy me. They make my back get up as they say down here. So my only issue in that regard wasn’t becoming a body type I don’t find attractive (men’s bodies are just meh whatever to me) but entering a culture I find boring and juvenile. But I’ve found that despite that there’s no doubt I am one of those self same boring men. And I’ve also discovered plenty of cis men who don’t really care to immerse themselves in male culture so it’s cool. 
2) No. I was never heavily identified with my sexual preference and always struggled to be part of the lesbian community. I didn’t fit and they instinctually didn’t really want me either. I did miss a specific weekly meet up that I went to that was all lesbians but it was a small sacrifice. Never really did Pride and all that. 
3) Yes. All of my lesbian friends either thought I’d lost my mind or were openly hostile to me “joining the enemy”. I’ve since made a few online lesbian friends but the entire gang I used to hang with turned their backs on me. It was tough but I let them go.",1698796887.0

I think it stings that Christine left and other members of the family (her adult kids, Janelle's kids, Janelle) didn't shun her.

This is worse. It seems like you have no idea what this is even about, so I'll just explain it to you. COPPA and privacy protection laws in the EU forbid platforms from knowingly collecting data on children below the age of 13 -- for privacy reasons and because they do not have the legal capacity to agree to the ToS. They legally cannot have a Twitch account, or any other account for that matter, unless the service has serious restrictions in place on collecting data on minors and that's never going to happen because it would allow you to bypass ads. For example if you make yourself younger than 16 on mobile games, you will stop seeing predatory ads entirely because the ad providers may show the ads, but can't target minors based on their device. As a bonus games will also hide predatory microtransactions.

So if Twitch would merely hide the message, then not only is Twitch knowingly retaining data on minors, they would also be doing it maliciously and with intent to do so. It basically makes you even more liable as a platform. So by swiftly banning people who say it they're actually doing you a favour, because then they don't have to purge your data ASAP since it might've been a joke and that can give you time to appeal.",1698796887.0

Speed just never filled out his appeal because he didn't care about Twitch since he had a good YouTube deal going.

Atlas is biased to defend boxing.  He can do that best by being honorable and admit Francis got robbed.

Can you imagine if this was an MMA fight and Fury did what Francis did?  And then MMA commentators showed their bias and disrespect of boxing by claiming we didn't see what we thought we did with our own eyes.  We'd be so turned off by the MMA community.

Boxing community.  Do better.  When an MMA fighter makes their pro debut and makes one of the current HW champs look a fool, just admit it or lose all credibility.

I like Atlas (mostly for his views on boxing reform setting up a unified league with health and retirement benefits, ref reform, etc).  But he's losing (more) credibility with a 97-93 Fury score.",1698796888.0

It isn’t automatically a war crime when many civilians get killed. It is a war crime when they are targeted rather than military objectives. So for example swooping into a music festival and murdering civilians point blank is clearly a war crime.

Like I said I wouldn't be considering it if it wasn't a floor model that was half off the list price.

"DFWcasualencounters","t5_30u6a","We had to remove your recent post on /r/dfwcasualencounters because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can review them in our subreddit's sidebar (on the right side of the screen).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 28/31 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please fix your title and resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdfwcasualencounters).

Finally, please make sure you read the complete Rules and Guidelines on the sidebar.

"NursingUK","t5_38rco","This does happen a lot. Yes.

The thing is, a clinical decision should not just be based on biology. We don't use a medical model anymore, we use a BioPsychoSocial model.

If the person putting the DNACPR Insitu is good, they will have a biological opinion, and raise their concerns with the patient / family.

Then the patient / family should put their own slant on it. Including their own opinion on the biological risks, as well as their psychological opinion (how they feel emotionally about all the outcome, quality of life Vs quantity etc), and their social opinion (support network for post arrest care for example, how they understand their life could be impacted/change).

And then, using all of that information, a clinical opinion, using the BioPsychoSocial model will be made.

When you say you are on the ward and everyone agrees a DNACPR should be out in place, ask yourself why? Is it because biologically they probably wouldn't have a good outcome? Well that's fair, but have you asked the patient why they don't want one? Why the families don't want one? Those opinions are important to a BioPsychoSocial model, after all it's their life, not ours, and if they are.prepared to accept a life of continuous disability, or the risk of being locked in, then so be it..why should that be discounted?

Where a lot of problems arise I find, are when families want to hold onto patients for their own selfish reasons 4
Rather than considering their own relative... But that's why conversations should be deep and meaningful, and we should be talking to patients about their resus status at early opportunities.

I mean, I am 34 and already have an LPA setup for my husband and I, and we know each others wishes.

But this leads into wider issues surrounding death conversations, and the social.taboos our society has.",1698796889.0

"janeausten","t5_2tgww","Go back and read the paragraph and make note of the italics, the exclamation points. Austen is speaking more than tongue in cheek; she is mocking what she says. Actually it is the two paragraphs before and the one after that as well. She is mocking ""Marianne's extraordinary fate,"" a fate that occurs to most people as they mature and learn mature love. She is mocking the romantic idea that love is the superior sentiment. And in case we had any doubts about her intent, Austen reassures us in the later paragraph that Marianne was wonderfully happy as was Brandon",1698796890.0

Recon marines go to the highly volatile places and fuck shit all the way up. Flagships are usually fleet coordinators and quite a few tons of fuck up your day. The roles don’t have much overlap in practical application. 

For example, the USS Ford (the newest aircraft carrier and generally most powerful vessel ever) would never have recon marines, because it doesn’t need recon marines. It has an air wing capable of flattening a country, similar to how the Donnager had the Tachi class fast attack frigates.  They might have some marines, but they don’t have the force that is the best of the best, because they don’t practically need it.

I decided to take power over it by repeatedly commanding it to leave by the blood of Christ, and it is no longer welcome in my home.  I also asked God to open a way for them to go to the light, and told it to go to the light.  No, I'm not an evangelical nut, or a Catholic.

"facepalm","t5_2r5rp","Of course, you are (basically) right about that but Waco and Oklahoma were (almost) 30 years ago and there’s been other stuff (like calling it the axis of evil (that is a retranslation from German, I hope it’s correct) 20 years ago which of course is a reference to religion without the war being religiously motivated which doesn’t make it better). 

Nevertheless, you do have - as of 2023 - a situation where attacks motivated by religious beliefs are predominantly committed by Muslims. 

Of course you could take a case like that of Lori Vallow and count it as a Christian murder spree but even if…. Or, ok, someone like Breivik but I wouldn’t say that religion was a motive there. 

If someone were to burn the Bible, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll be targeted and certainly the pope is not gonna applaud the attacks on someone who burnt a bible. 

Salman Rushdie… unimaginable in Christianity 2023. 

Also, there’s no other major religion that calls for the extinction of people of other faiths. (I mean that many exponents of said religion, of course not all.)

Now, of course sometimes religion is just used as a mask for political goals - something the Christian faith has experienced a lot of times. 

All that being said: you don’t necessarily need religion to commit atrocities and no doubt about the fact that Christian countries have committed endless atrocities. (Not just Christians but still…)

And no, by no means do I want to say that all Muslims are potential terrorists. It would be ludicrous. And yes, especially in Western nations, there are often different problems at the root (which basically lead to someone „going off“) and religion might just be the trigger. 

So, anyway, you do have a lot of attacks where someone yells Allahu akbar but not that many where someone yells holy father or whatever. 

So, it’s not (just) media bias and we shouldn’t ignore the problem of Islamist terror attacks. 
One last point: It is different of course in Europe (where I’m living) than in the USA.",1698796892.0

"SquaredCircle","t5_2sljg","Thanks for the feedback! Most of what you've said is all related, it's down to the database. I sourced the data from a handful of different places, and let an algo pick out the top 500 wrestlers. As a cost saving measure, there is no backend, the entire wrestler DB is served with the front end of the site, and so I had to limit the size of the DB to keep the sites' load speed snappy. Danhausen is not in the DB unfortunately. There are a handful of notable wrestlers who didn't make the cut (PCO is in the DB but Dolph Ziggler isn't) so I will likely revisit the DB and probably double it's size. There is an autocomplete to help you figure out the valid wrestlers, it only appears after you've entered 3 characters. 

I also wanted to include promotion, but (in addition to wanting to keep DB size small), I wanted something that I didn't have to update often. Wrestlers change promotion so often that I'd have to do daily DB rebuilds to keep it accruate, and right now that is a manual job. It's not feasible for me to update it every day, and if it isn't up to date then it's only going to be frustrating that you have to guess using out of date data. 

Eras is also somewhat subjective, how would you rank someone like Bob Backlund, who wrestled in so many eras? Some might only know him for his short attitude era stint, etc. 

All of this is really the reason the Age stat exists. You could guess Samoa Joe, and get a red box for age, so then guess maybe HBK, you'd get another red for age, which would point you to someone a lot older. Basically, if you get a red in the age column, you're likely gonna be in the wrong era. With the limitations I have, I think it's the most elegant way of doing it tbh. 

Fwiw, other metrics I had were titles won, promotions wrestled in, matches wrestled, current promotion and current status (active, part time, retired, dead etc) but found that none of them were particularly suitable for what I wanted. 

The only other solution I thought of was to allow either more or unlimited guesses, which is something I'm still considering if people still find it hard.",1698796892.0

As far as profile and bio vibe, it'd be hard to pin down because I tried so many different kinds of profiles with different mixes of bios (sexy, funny, friendly, sweet, etc) and kinds of photos. My partner and friends and I put a lot of work into developing a lot of different ""vibes"" to try out. 

My success before my partner was also very bad. My partner is my second partner, and my first serious partner. That is from a grand total of 3 non sex worker matches in 13 years of on and off use of dating apps (I'm 31, I started trying to date online at 19) (first girlfriend I met in person)

I truly do not think I look bad. I think I look somewhat handsome. Am I gonna be a model? No, but I don't by any means hate what I see in the mirror.

Off topic, my bad. It’s just this autistic shit didn’t exist in any generation prior to these weird ass self-consumed forever-childish mofos with the mental and emotional fortitude of a leaf in a furnace. 

The secret to long relationships is simply staying in them…even when you don’t feel like it. It’s not that your grandfather or grandfather was perfect, they weren’t, they just realize a flawed individual is as good as it gets, and learned to use the overcoming of obstacles as opportunities to strengthen their bonds rather than an opportunity to write a 95 Thesis on why the relationship won’t work. In life, this shit that tends to work out is the shit you MAKE work out, not the shit that just happens to come about. Your folks stayed together because they had integrity, grit, tenacity, and ACTUAL love for each other not this self-serving tentative affection you all feel for the people whose perceived value to others makes you feel like less of a piece of shit about yourself. 

Now we adopt phrases like “no contact” lol. If that phrase isn’t the epitome of a bitch-made generation that has never had to shit in the dark let alone raise a family through invaders, plagues, no economic infrastructure whatsoever, and no iced mochafrappucianolatte’s or whatever you frail fucks drink religiously to help you cope with the hardness of the most safe and sound society to ever exist.

So works don't save us, but they are the proof of our living faith and our growing relationship with God. So it all starts with faith.

"Pathfinder2e","t5_gkc60","Hey, I've noticed you mentioned the upcoming Pathfinder Remaster! Do you need help finding your way around here? I know a couple good pages!

We've been seeing a lot of questions related to this lately. We have a [wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/wiki/resources/remaster/) dedicated to collecting all the information currently available. Give it a look!

For the short end of things... The remaster aims to republish and reorganise the content of the Core Rulebook, Advanced Player Guide, Gamemastery Guide and Bestiary 1 into a new format which will be more accessible to new players, with the primary aim to remove all OGL content and avoid issues with Wizards of the Coast.

* **Primary Rules changes**: Alignment and Schools of Magic will be removed. Instead, these concepts will be offloaded to the trait system (with Holy and Unholy being reserved to divine classes and some specific monsters).

* **Primary Lore changes**: the classic Dragons will be replaced with new, Pathfinder focused dragons themed on the four magic traditions. The Darklands are also seeing a lot of shakeups.

If I misunderstood your post... sorry! Grandpa Clippy said I'm always meant to help. Please [let the mods know](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPathfinder2e) and they'll remove my comment.

Corday: care to hear what we found under the microscope? seminiferous tubules

Romano: what? 

Corday: that’s right gentlemen, you just biopsied two testicles. 

Later: 

Edson: of course, someone needs to tell the parents that Barbie is now a Ken 

*love him or loathe him, Edson had some petty funny lines throughout the series that only Matthew Glave’s smarmy personal could deliver* 

Carter returns to the dorms and turns off the music 

Lucy: was the music too loud? 

Carter: no the furniture was to on fire 

Lucy: reacts astonished (Kellie martins facial expression here is gold) 

Also Corday and her very southern English pronunciation of Shaft is just chef kiss. She was so dreamy in that period when she was trying to fit into american customs but with a decidedly English slant to it. 

Also Benton and Corday had the best romantic chemistry throughout the series and it was a great shame that Eriq killed that storyline (although in saying that, they had beautiful platonic chemistry after so it was no great loss. Corday with Reese when Peter gets back from Mississippi always gets a wet eye moment from me).",1698796893.0

You are just using the s3 bits of the AWS CLI for your use case so you may be helped by searching or asking the Solaris 11 community for ""*aws s3 client implementations that work on Solaris 11*"" -- maybe someone has something that works outside of the official AWS CLI package

Another test would be using python3 on Solaris to see if the boto3 library is supportable and installable. That would let you write a python script to do the s3 transfer perhaps

It would be expensive for most but AWS supports the SFTP Transfer Family service which puts an SFTP interface on top of the S3 service; running the endpoint carries an hourly cost in addition to bandwidth so its expensive for a weekly 5gb transfer but it would let you use SFTP on both sides as the client with S3 just being the backend data store",1698796894.0

It IS a good term, and supporting arguments using terms that… support the notion should be considered, no?

So, as for

>You added a criterion that was not present in the original question, ""non-critical.""


I admit I made a mistake in putting my answer to the actual question posed at the bottom of my original answer. However I did answer that I dont think we should legally force people to do as the hypothetical asks unequivocally. I would just ask that we recognize that I did as much.

As for my moral aspersions on such things the answers here are sometimes more complicated than just yes or no. I did not add my context on the type of donation not to avoid the question but to better explain where my position changes from a moral obligation to a lack of a moral obligation regarding such situations.

>After reading further, I believe it's likely you were not previously aware of Living Donors

Nope, I am quite aware that living people donate organs very often.

>We do not take organs from donors who will die as a result, unless they are brain dead.

Yup, and I dont believe a parent has a moral duty to do so either. That was my point in separating donations that would entail death and donations that dont.

>Given your misunderstanding of organ transplantation, I'm very concerned about your knowledge gaps regarding pregnancy. 

I am not insulting your intelligence, please give me the same respect.

>1. There is absolutely no such thing as a non-critical organ transplant. We do not transplant organs that we can live without. Donating organs is always a serious procedure. Even donating bone marrow requires several days of recuperation.

I know its serious. Is it true that its impossible to offer to donate an organ if donating it means you won't live? Idk maybe thats true. Either way like I outlined I would not say someone ought to be legally or morally obligated to do so. It would be commendable if someone did do this for a lived one though, hell even for a stranger.

>2. Spleen transplants are not done outside of a research setting; because we can live without them, there simply isn't a need for them.

Okay, you asked for examples of non critical organs by my definition and I gave some. We could nitpick all day. 

>3. You absolutely cannot live without a kidney.

Good thing you have 2 amirite!

>4. Hearts are the #3 most transplanted organs. Kidneys are #1.

But you absolutely can't live without one!? Jokes aside, are you saying we give hearts from living people to people in need? Or are you saying from already deceased people? Just curious here.

>5. Lungs, being an organ we cannot live without, are absolutely transplanted. Lungs are actually the #2 most transplanted organ.

Same question here as with #4. Do living people donate these lungs?

>>It is possible you misinterpreted my resonce here

>Unfortunately this seems to be because you are misinformed about organ donation, which lead you to add ""clarifications"" that were not only unnecessary, but actually confusing. 

I attempt to be charitable to you, you insult my intelligence 🙁. 

>Not everyone who doesn't want kids gives them up for adoption, as I'm sure you know.

If you dont give them up you assume responsibility for them. Simple as.

>I'm curious why you believe there is a moral imperative to sacrifice quite a lot for your child, but not your life.

It seems to me that humans have a unique duty to those that they take guardianship over, especially the young. If you want I can expand on this after we get over this qualm with my addition of my view on the moral component of the hypothetical",1698796896.0

Though; some humans labeled him culprit, violent individual, woman & children murderer without knowing anything about anything, because it was the way it was and not any other way. Andrew fights and fights and fights alone against all across this journey. And gains the ability to decide. What everyone tried to prevent him to do.

"kpopthoughts","t5_2730wn","Like most people have said, the vocals are a huge reason. They have many of the top idol vocalists in the industry and that lends itself a lot to how much I enjoy music. Plus the better vocalists you have = the more you can often experiment with utilizing them (ex. a lot of SM songs have fantastic harmonization in the background, layering). 

Besides that, SM definitely does a lot more solo/unit within their groups compared to other companies. Partially because they have groups/members that stay a long time with them. It’s cool to see how different members within the same group have different sounds and concepts.",1698796898.0

"RATS","t5_2qnh3","We were able to get rid of a similar bug in a day once before. We got the appropriate medication, gave them the treatment as directed, but then we brought them into the sink, deep cleaned the cage, threw away all their fabrics outside, gave them brand new. In the sink, we soaked the babies in olive oil for a few minutes. It's harmless to their skin, but it drowns the parasites on them. I chose olive oil over any medication just because I was concerned about side effects. Then after soaking for a few, we cleaned them off with soap, rinsed and dried them, then gave them too many treats because they earned it. Never saw any signs of them parasites again. 

Growing up with cats and dogs, we learned that flea treatment and similar is an all in issue to tackle. You can't get away with just picking a couple favorite tricks, you have to do it all. Now with rats it can be a bit easier because it's not the whole house, it's isolated to their cage, but the same mindset helped us.",1698796898.0

I have to hide in the United States of America? I can’t sit in a place where there’s windows because I might be attacked. That’s basically what she said. She was trying to be helpful, but you know?

**Brannock sizing:** Heel-to-toe: right 10.5EEE and left 10.75EE (If I remember correctly, looking at the Heel-to-ball, it is like something size 14 at least)

I have a RedWing Iron Ranger 10EE, the left foot is fine but the right foot is too tight, which stretches the leather alot. After stretching, they are the most comfortable boots I have.  
I have a RedWing 10877 Moc Toe 10.5EE. Too long in right foot and a bit long on left one. Too tight on the right foot. 10EE length is right but too tight on both feet.

I have a10EE Alden Indy boot. Too tight on the vamp on both feet. I am not wearing them anymore. On the other hand, 10EEE fits me well in the toe area but is a bit loose in the heel.

In general I would say 10EEE fits me well (or possibly 10EEEE  but I think the heel might get too loose depending on brand, I am not sure).

**Kyle from Baker's recommmend me 10EE.**

This has to do with how the parts are made and who has access to them. Apple’s manufacturing process is considered a trade secret. This means no other company besides Apple will be able to perfectly manufacture a part for an Apple product. There’s always something that’s a giveaway. Sometimes it’s not a big deal but sometimes it is.

The only people who have access to Apple’s original parts (aside from Apple) are called Authorized Service Providers. These folks will do repairs but are unlikely to sell refurbished products as there is little profit due to the cost of parts directly from Apple.

The other factor (especially where iPhones and iPads are concerned) is that these products are made in a factory by machines and a human can’t replicate the perfection putting a device together that a machine can.

"pureasoiaf","t5_3288z","I think the LH's story is another parallel of the Night's King and probably retold in a way that paints the NK as a hero.  It may very well be that Bran the Builder is the villain in the story and was the Stark to become the Night's King.  I'm not sure that we will ever be able to pinpoint the exact individual Stark that became the Night's King, but he was definitely within the immediate family of Bran the builder I think.

I have a feeling that the Night's Watch was actually the Night's King's guardsmen or those appointed as watchmen to make sure the NK didn't escape his prison in Winterfell.  

I will return to the LH at some point, because it will fit into the broader picture (it clearly mirrors Bran's story to an extent, and the reference to dog (Bolton hounds) may be a starting point.

"LesbianActually","t5_3f5dt","I’ve somehow touched a nerve and that definitely wasn’t my intent. I have gone through hell in my past with dating women, from being assaulted and cheated on, having a 3 year severely relationship, get repeatedly unexpectedly dumped and ghosted for no reason. Sometimes I still believe that I am meant to be alone because I feel/love too deep for a lot of people, but regardless, 2 years ago I couldn’t leave my house because my social anxiety was so bad, and so meeting someone in person was a big milestone for me and I’m excited.

I’m not trying to shit on any one, I know dating is incredibly hard for many lesbians. I think dating apps are great, especially if you live in rural areas like I used to. But when you solely rely on them, as I once did, I think it can be very limiting. I’m sorry you haven’t had much luck. I’m sure that’s a very isolating feeling. 

Years ago I lived on an isolated farm and in order to make meet gay people I joined groups on Meet Up. I’ve also made good friends on bumble BFF.

It may not sound like this make a lot of sense because he doesn’t trust any of us or want to be around us but he doesn’t want to stay in his house. He breaks into my dads house constantly to stay. We have everything we can think of that could be a weapon for him out of the house. It’s really sad. He has no friends anymore and doesn’t talk to anyone. 

We’ve been through almost 10 years of this with him. It’s been rough. We’ve tried to have some of his friends try to get through but it’s never worked.

Next Halloween, why don't you and your friend just go out to see a scary movie, or drink a bit? Talking to strangers is even easier on holidays like Halloween, St-Patrick, etc. Use those opportunities. 

You life isn't over yet. If possible, try to save some money and go visit your other friend who is abroad. Or invite them over. Look for the little sliver of potential happiness that are within your reach rather than focusing on things you think you cannot have. Easier said than done, but that's the way to survive ""happily"" (taking for granted you don't have other issues in your life or aren't suffering from depression or other mental illness).

I'm very sorry that you had more health challenges and struggles.  That's really rough.  It takes it's toll mentally.   Here's to all of that being behind you!

I can certainly understand focusing even more on intimacy and bonding after that.

Yes, I really do think it is a little bit of mate guarding and being territorial.  I think it can feel good to slightly feel like someone's territory too, just to an extent.  I'm sure that can too easily go overboard, but I think there's something primal about in in a pure mating way, even when non-monogamy is chosen and there is compersion.

I might have mentioned it before in a reply, but I dated a married poly woman for 6 years +.  It was quite a memorable time.  She had 3 other guys in her life, for half of that time, and just 2 for the first half.

I'm actually a bit of a cuckold.  I do like some humiliation with the open realtionship, but only when it's real.  That also means it's usually not in a mean tone, but just that real comparisons are made and spoken of in a fun or obvious tone.  I'm trying not to date strictly poly women anymore because they usually prefer to not share details and do all things separately.  There's definitely some poly women that are an exception and enjoy sharing sexual details, but....  in general my experiences lacked, even though some details that were shared were absolutely awesome!

I think one can be a cuckquean/cuckold without overt humiliation.  Much of it is silent, but also there's none if you don't view things through a lense of enjoying that the other person is sexually better in some way.   When there's no humiliation, it's more just voyeurism.  I think those of us that are very much into voyeurism like to live vicariously through the other people, or through their activities together.   There's so many reasons or ways that people get satisfaction out of sharing a partner. 

> Our bf's husband, unlike mine, suffers very little fallout from these orgasms, even from two or three in succession. He is younger, which might make a difference, but knowing that we'll be parting ways the day after, going back to our primary relationships could have an influence too. I still wonder.

Age very likely plays a role, yes, but that you don't nest with him might be factoring in too.   Also, you do mate with another male.  His body might be competing even without him being conscious of that.  Studies have shown that men ejaculate a larger volume of semen during intercourse after their partner has returned from a trip without them.",1698796904.0

"guitarpedals","t5_2r0bp","It’s about cigarettes and it’s not a flex and does really matter. 

When you smoke indoors, everything in a room you smoke in gets a reside build up that is absolutely horrible. It permeates everything that isn’t air tight. 

As far as pedals go, it’s not really gonna be a big deal inside a pedal because they are almost airtight. But it gets on the exterior. In an amp, I definitely wouldn’t want the residue in it and especially not on my tubes. Any pedals with vents for a tube are gonna be mucky near the vent. Anything with a fan that sucks air in for cooling is gonna be pretty bad too. Smoke totally screws up computer and gaming cooling systems. And any other device with a cooling system with a heat sink (many amps). My phone case is permanently yellowed on the side I hold a cigarette. 

It’s disgusting and damaging. That’s why I stopped smoking inside my house after my first few years of smoking.

I’m a smoker, whose experienced first hand the residue smoking leaves behind and won’t buy used gear unless it’s from a smoke free environment. And highly advise others to do the same. Unless it’s a great deal and you don’t mind having components that don’t get the proper amount of heat dislocation they were designed to have.

Rent a one-way UHAUL trailer for his stuff, but if possible, move him to the Assisted Living first.    Have him tell you what to take (use a clipboard, take pictures.), but get him out of the way.    
Pack only what he needs / wants.

Abandon the rest.    It's his problem, not yours.   It's also the girl friend's squalor.

More than that, and I'll pay someone to stop by and feed dogs, check water(s), top off chicken/duck feed/waters, or, more commonly recently, my dad will simply ensure he's home and feed for us. 

When it comes to *raising* poultry - that important 6-12+ week period when they're young, you really do need to ensure you're around at least once a day, to make sure they have fresh feed, and especially the first 3-6+ weeks that they have heat available. I let mine out by 2-3+ weeks, but ensure they have access to heat lamps  till 6-7ish weeks when the meat birds are getting ready to go to butcher, and the layers get tossed in with my regular flock.

\- Not that long ago a sushi chef from the Phillippines was kicked out of the country because his *wages were too high,* and he had been living and working here for 8 years.   
\- A woman from Thailand had been working here for 9 years - night shifts as a cleaning lady (working 2 jobs)  - was kicked out.   
\- A young woman from Argentina was recently kicked out after being here for almost 9 years as well. Speaks fluent Danish and worked as a nursery teacher. 

\~ and these are just the more recent cases. 

Personally I like that our immigration laws are strict, but the ones handling the individual cases also need to look at what people are contributing with, because we've declined people to get a residence permit even when they're contributing to our society, filling job positions where they actually lack people and it benefits us to keep them here.",1698796904.0

Não se sinta mal se a morte dela em algum nível trouxer conforto em saber que tudo acabou ou se vc ainda sentir amor por ela, é normal, vc é uma pessoa como qualquer outra, é uma guerreira por ter aguentado tudo isso, vc sobreviveu e pode seguir uma vida nova, longe de todo o abuso q sofreu, pode se reconstruir, o pior já passou, agora é só vc, uma nova você, se sentir q precisa enterrar esse passado pra seguir em frente, então faça ou se quiser guardar essa dor como um prova de q vc é forte e pode aguentar então faça como quiser.
Amor pra mim, é uma espécie de empatia que ultrapassa todos os limites, amor é paralelo à todos os sentimentos, vc pode amar e odiar alguém ao msm tempo, mas, msm odiando vc seria incapaz de ferir esse alguém, é saber seu valor e ainda valorizar o outro acima de si. Realmente sinto muito por tudo que vc passou, espero que consiga encher sua vida de pessoas q te amam muito e supere todos os traumas com o mínimo de sequelas possível :)",1698796904.0

"residentevil","t5_2s0lb","I'll go different and say Village. I think that game on a fundamental conceptual level doesn't work. 7 reinvented the series and rather than build on that style (more intimate, gritty, found footage esque horror) it goes for a weird RE4 spiritual successor.

The 'theme park of horror' idea they went with doesn't work as none of the Lords or their zones really gel together and we don't spend long enough with any of them for them to make a distinct impression. The plot feels very out of place as a follow up to 7 with several lingering threads dropped in favour of the more mystical Mother Miranda plotline. 

Many of the better elements are just shamelessly ripped from RE4. A more generous fan would call it paying homage but I'd say it's more straight up ripping off. The titular Village barely makes an impression and you don't actually spend all that long in the Village itself.

3 is short and missing content, but I'd say the game has better pacing, gameplay and story than Village.",1698796905.0

"NPD","t5_2u6be",">I know my jealousy isn’t valid but I don’t know how to bring it up or set boundaries without being a total fucking cunt.

All emotions are valid - they're just biological impulses we have no control over. In the same way that hunger is always valid, even if you've just eaten. If I burn my hand on a hot stove, I don't measure the temperature of the stove before I pull it away. It's a biological instinct, it's literally wired into you.

You're jealous. Just let that sit. It's okay. You're jealous because what you're hearing is he'd rather have sex with a toy than with you. Let's break it down further - you're jealous of this (but not of other sex toys like vibrators or solo activities like porn and masturbation) but specifically of this. Is that because penetration seems more intimate? Because of his trauma history?

Regardless of the reason, no need to disregard jealousy, it's a fine emotion. It means we feel that we're not getting needs met, that we want something someone else (or in this case something else) has. Does that feel accurate to you in your case?

Once the jealousy feels validated (it's great that we get signals like this! We'd be lost without them), we can consider other possibilities more neutrally and not in desperation or out of an attempt to deny ourselves.

There are many reasons why a fleshlight would feel safer for him than a living breathing human. He's got a long history of trauma around sex so it's probably safe to assume that triggers abound for him in that environment. Other people's needs, their emotions, their reactions, their movements, every single piece of sensory input can be a trigger in different ways, especially if he's had multiple experiences of abuse. There's so many he's probably not even aware of all of them and the extra difficulty is that discussing them with you is likely *also* a trigger because of the shame and embarrassment and pressure from abusers and society to never talk about what happened. So now he's found a safe way to explore the sensations of sex for him.

On to the boundaries point! General rule of boundaries is it's only a boundary if it's around your actions. Anything around other people's actions is a rule (not always bad but in this specific instance, telling him he can't pursue a sex thing that affects only him is going to give a lot of fuel to the sex trauma fire). So a boundary might be ""if you're watching porn, I'm going to leave the room."" He can still watch porn, you just won't be there. If it's a hard boundary for you (unbending, no room for negotiation) then it becomes an ultimatum (again, not always a bad thing e.g. ""if you threaten me, I'm leaving""). 

So it is really up to you to consider: is this what you want to end your relationship over? It's fine if you do - many people want a certain kind of sex and aren't prepared to compromise on that (and it sounds like you've been struggling in this relationship for a while).

>We are trying to find a therapist but it is so hard bc he won’t help me.

Annoying behaviour on his part but the trauma is probably also feeding into this. He might think that the therapist will demand more honesty of him than he's prepared to give or maybe even that you're going to out his whole trauma history to a stranger. Then there's the probable reoccurring fear/shame that he won't be believed, that this isnt something he should talk about, that the therapist will take your side, that he'll be told to ""just man up and fuck her.""

Genuinely cannot even overstate that his issues around sex will probably take a very long time for him to overcome and will likely require a lot of patience. It is a-okay if that isn't something you're prepared to stick around for or if his issues also trigger a sense of insecurity in you that you don't want to tolerate. No one's the bad guy here, trauma responses will trauma respond.",1698796905.0

"AfterEffects","t5_2rc1h","> Silicon RAM equals double the PC RAM

Wtf kind of logic bending is this. RAM is RAM, it is used to store frames to preview in real time. The more you have, the more you are able to preview in one go. An identical frame has an equal size between Mac and PC so there's no reason Mac would be able to store more of them with less RAM.

If you run out of RAM, AE starts writing to disk cache. That's slower to read so the previews might stutter. If you run out of disk cache space, it has to overwrite older previews which is even slower. Another thing to keep in mind is AE stores previews not only for the comp you're looking at, but also for all the precomps inside. So for complex projects you may reach a limit of what your machine is able to render at all if you don't have enough RAM. The only thing that can help at that point is pre-rendering individual comps which is a bit of a headache.

To actually answer your question, generally I feel 32GB is the minimum to comfortably do motion graphics in 1080p. If you're looking to work on some VFX/compositing, use 32-bit footage or higher resolutions like 4k, I'd advise to consider the beefier one",1698796906.0

"shiptdriver","t5_6v60am","I do not recommend this delivery app. It’s a time and money suck. You average $10-$15 an hour. 
I just started last Thursday and I’m at 17 deliveries. The first 10 deliveries you’re Rookie status. This allows you to familiarize yourself with the app and offers and any late deliveries do not count against you. 
During this timeframe you can do only 1 order at a time. After you successfully done 10 deliveries is when the hassle starts. 
I had 2 late deliveries today. 1 was late by 2 mins because the app didn’t load once I uploaded the pic of the delivery. It happens when you are in area that has very little service, so the app just spins. It spun for 3 mins! I was late. 🤬
And then I took a bundle offer-a terrible mistake. 2 orders but, 1 was pre-paid and the other you had make the purchase with the Shipt card. So, you get into 2 different lines to process your order. Also, when you shop at Target you will only be able to fulfill 80% of an order. Most items are sold out, so you spend a good amount of time just corresponding with the customer asking if they want a substitute, so you have to wait for a response. If you select ‘not found’ without giving options they could potentially give you a low rating. Basically as a shopper you are stuck- give good customer service with communication on the chat feature and be late for a delivery or don’t communicate and you get a low rating. 
Also, never take a bundle offer with the same time slot, it needs to be staggered. This guarantees 1 of the deliveries will be late because many of the items are not available. 
Now I have to contact Shipt to have both deliveries ‘forgiven’ because I cannot control if the app doesn’t load precisely before the hour ends and doing back to back and 1 delivery is way up deep in the hills. 
After Friday, once I reach 20 deliveries, Im done. Amazon Flex is far better when it comes to pay and your time!",1698796908.0

> サトシは何が出来るという確信もなかったが、**とるもとりあえずと**視線をタクヤ達の方へと定め、決意を表すようにグッと息を飲んだ。 

In the part in bold, I see a とりあえず. とるも is 取る and も? What is the usage of the と at the end? And what does it mean altogether?

I tried a Google search and results for “取る物も取り敢えず” appeared. It made me wonder if that's what the writer meant but spelled it incorrectly and mistook it for a と-adverb.

I can only speak for my own personal experience, and it does get better. Took me a very long time, definitely over a year.

What you need is family, and friends. You need to keep active, do the things you love personally, and if you don't already exercise, might be a good time to do that.

Physical exercise is, from what I've read, and from personal experience, the equivalent of taking antidepressants. Plus you get out to the gym and you meet new people.

There's no shortcut here. All you can do is take what's been painful and transform it into a strength. Whether that means having experience with the difficult situation, understanding people on a deeper level, appreciating you for you, and now being able to identify potential red flags in the future.

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","If you're currently at a level where Poetics are available/better than anything else (=that expansion's endgame level plus up to 5 levels afterwards, so 50-55, 60-65, and so on), then farming Poetics and buying that gear is your easiest option, although buying HQ crafted versions of the catch-up gear at slightly worse item levels from the marketboard would technically be faster (and much more expensive.)

Otherwise, MSQ rewards are always a good source too, as are Leveling dungeons (so any dungeon that's not Lv.50/60/70/80), which will actually automatically give you one random piece of gear from its loot table that both fits your current job and isn't yet in your inventory upon completion.

If you have a crafter leveled, you can also craft appropriate HQ gear for your character as well, and if you don't, that's exactly what you'd be buying off the market board if you're impatient, and it's also what the MSQ rewards will give you.

In general, as long as the item level of the item is the same, every single piece of gear will give you the same amount of stat increases, just maybe distributed across different stats.  
The only exception to that rule is non-HQ crafted gear, which is the same as the stuff the NPC vendors sell for Gil - those have slightly worse stats than the HQ variants, and as a consequence, they are also worse than everything else with the same item level.

Extreme/Savage gear is *technically* slightly better than the gear available directly before its release, but since you can do all the non-Extreme+ difficulty content even without a proper set of Tomestone gear, they only really are useful for doing more Extreme and Savage, and might be more sought after if you want to try your hand at the few Ultimate fights the game has, but I wouldn't know about that.

As for glowy/shiny weapons, there are a few sources of these - and most of these I'd recommend you go and do after you're max level, since a good deal of the content you need to do to get there can be trivialized by simply having a higher level and better gear.

The sources are, in order from easy to hard:  
The expansion's Relic Weapon - extremely grindy, but doable for anyone willing to put in the time with no need to learn anything more complicated than how FATEs and Dungeons work.  
Those are *technically* a source of the best weapon for that expansion, but just like with Savage gear, the difference between it and the best Tomestone weapon is not that significant, making the latter a better option if you value your free time.  

Crafted versions of Extreme weapons - you'll need an item drop from the relevant Extreme Trial, or from desynthesizing one of its weapon drops, but both the item and the finished weapon can be bought off the market board as well, so doing Extremes isn't actually required to own one of those.  
Since the crafted, shinier weapons only come out a significantly later than the Extreme itself, those are for looks only.

Ultimate weapons - extremely sparkly, with a fight-specific unique effect, but generally styled after some kind of weapon that already was available beforehand, just with way more effects.  
This is the only content in the game that's impossible to do unsynced, so even if you're higher level, you might actually want to wear level-appropriate gear just so you can put Materia in it without  losing the stats in the gear sync process.  
Due to gear syncing works, wearing massively higher-level gear might work too, but I'd recommend reading up on those extensively in advance if you ever intend to do one of these.  
The weapons mmay or may not *technically* be an item level improvement over some of the previously available gear when they come out, but if you chase them for that, you just signed up for a 20-minute multi-stage fight that routinely takes groups weeks, or even months to clear, and afterwards you already beat the hardest content in the game, so what exactly are you going to use it on?  
(Also, I'm pretty sure the Savage weapons are at least on par with those, so you could always ""just"" do Savage instead.)",1698796909.0

It'll shift the conversation back to ""which teams are the strongest and which need to improve, whose on the bubble but has potential"" which is much better for the sport tbh",1698796910.0

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I don't have a story myself, but two from my college days friends. It's 1991 and we were all addicted to a game called ""The Shadow of Yserbius"" which was for its time incredible because it was the first online game we could play together on this new thing called the Internet.  

 Because the Internet was not in common use, it had different rates for business hours and after hours. The charge for using the Sierra network needed for the game was like $20.00 a month, but if you played during business hours, it went up to $70 an HOUR. So friend #1 fell asleep playing the game and woke up 4 hours into the business time with a bill for $240. A lot of money for a college student in those days.   

He then got involved with a girl through the game and ended up suddenly moving to California. She was a huge addict of the game and worked at a water processing plant. Her entire job was to watch a panel of lights for an emergency to hit a release valve. She got into a very difficult battle with her party in the game she could not pause and did not notice the emergency alert light. Apparently,  millions of dollars of damage later...",1698796910.0

Who the fuck are you to tell me how neutron detectors work? You really have the gall to try to explain that to me? Shrink your head a bit bud. 

Secondly, the exact same principles that allow nuclear reactors to work are what allows atomic weapons to work. Atomic weapons go critical based on the prompt (as in - born of the fission event itself) neutrons. Nuclear reactors obtain criticality based on the delayed neutrons (neutrons born of a decay from fission products… like U235 splits into 2 other atoms, one of which decays and releases a neutron). Criticality just means a nuclear chain reaction that sustains itself and is neither rising or falling in power, whereas prompt supercriticality (what makes atom bombs explode) is rising power based only on prompt neutrons. Nuclear reactors and nuclear bombs literally use the same process. Fission of uranium releases energy. You can’t believe that nuclear reactors work and also not believe in nuclear weapons. Feel free to fact check all of this, it’s explained more fully in numerous scholarly sources and articles. 

And here’s your proof, unless you don’t believe that either:

A simple definition is that an ""Evangelical"" is the protestant equivalent of a Practicing Catholic. A more nuanced definition is a Protestant who focuses on the Bible, the Cross, Conversion and Activism (look up the Bebbington quadrilateral).

However, in America, ""Evangelical"" means something different - namely because Evangelical often refers to the white conservative nonconformist denominations that spilt from the white mainline churches.

Except it isn’t. Yes, building more housing will cause housing prices to come down, but it’ll cause more issues too. Suddenly a significant portion of our economy is based around building houses which isn’t sustainable. Eventually we’ll have too many houses, so there’s no point building more housing, but our workforce can’t do anything else, screwing them over. You’d be sacrificing the long term for the short term. Also, it won’t help alleviate issues immediately anyway, there are other solutions that will naturally occur to help out by then, so it’ll be less of a problem.

That and now housing is a systemic asset, so before we can even think about reducing prices, we need to look at unwinding it’s systemic importance first. Our retirements, investments, superfunds, banks, every financial institution and nearly company are dependent on it and would crash, bringing down our entire economy. So firstly, we’d have to remove that systematic importance.",1698796911.0

Other JW parents have torn the door off of their child's bedroom, removed the door, snooped through the child or teenager's phone on a daily basis, and more.

The abuse starts early, as you can tell from this thread:

A year later in a teaching for women on proverbs the sister who taught said ""Proverbs is known as the book of Wisdom""

I'm deeply disappointed by Musk's hard right turn on politics, particularly international politics, since covid. Too much of what he's saying now is painful, pointless and destructive. 

That said, what you wrote in the quote above is bullshit and you must know it. There are many on the left who have adopted a ""de-growth"" mindset and believe having kids is not justified. Calling it a ""death cult"" is deliberately provocative, but there is a real movement here and it is a problem.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","If you (Friend) are going to keep someone with clinical depresson as your BF, you have to learn to accept the many downsides of a romance with someone with severe mental  illness.  One of them is that he probably can barely get out of bed to pee and eat during his down cycles, let alone remember to text his GF.  Similarly, he might go months without seeing anyone outside his family, because it is just too hard emotionally for him to have to interact socially, when he is struggling to remember why he should live another day on this planet.

I assume he is receiving adequate medical care for his condition?  If not, that is something you can do to help.  Urge  your BF and his family to talk to the family doctor about it - it's nothing to be ashamed of, it's a DISEASE.  The doctor will probably refer him to a mental health professional for evaluation and treatment.  Clinical depression is not something your BF can wish away with happy thoughts.  Often it takes a combo of medication and talk therapy, and sometimes cognitive behavioral therapy as well.  That helps ease the symptoms for most, but some people do not respond well to treatment.  People with this awful disease are typically at high risk for self-harm and suicide.

If you decide that it's all too much to bear as his GF, it's OK to walk away from the relationship.  His illness is his to manage, and no one is obligated to sacrifice their own current and future happiness to try and make someone else feel better.  I'm not telling you that you SHOULD break up with him, only that if it's too difficult to stay, it's understandable and it's OK.  But if you do decide to stay, a lot of your time with him will be spent as you are spending your time now: worrying, praying, texting, wanting to go visit him while realizing he probably doesn't want to see you right now.  I'm sorry, but that's the cold hard truth of it.  I hope your BF starts feeling more like himself very soon.",1698796913.0

I’ve seen people be effected by it and never really could comprehend how you could have such an attachment to someone you’ve never met and will never know your name. You’re so insignificant in their life how can they be so significant in yours?

Now I get it. Matthew Perry made chandler only he could be. This character has always been my favorite from the very first quip I ever heard him tactfully deliver. His quick wit and explosive body language made the deliveries all the more better. 

I could go on for hours, as we all could I’m sure. Seeing everyone’s stories and thoughts really helps feel more connected and grounded, I can’t imagine what his friends and family are going through. 

I feel it respectful to mention what Matthew Perry wanted to be remembered for. His desire to help other humans. If someone asked him to help them get clean he would do it. And he converted his own house into a sober living home for men. He wanted us to know that.

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","Ana- A good nerf. I don't think it was quite enough. Nade is still too impactful. Reduce its impact on the team fight and then Ana will be less annoying.

Bap- A good nerf. Not enough. He needs a general numbers nerf on healing and damage.

Illari- I solid nerf. I'll see how this plays out. Might still not be enough.

Kiriko- Fine. I don't think she really needed a nerf but this is fair.

LifeWeaver- Too much for not reducing the time to swap between weapons. Life Grip shouldn't have been a part of this nerf without a like 30% decrease to weapon swap. Also, LW wasn't really a problem, so why the largest cooldown nerf? But whatever, I'll live.

Zen- Honestly, I get it, but rough. Sorry, Zen mains. At least you have more HP to compensate?

Overall, I think they focused nerfs in this order:

Zen, Illari, LW, Bap, Ana, Kiriko

But the order of these six really should've been:

Illari, Ana and Bap, Zen and Kiriko, LW.

Overall, hopefully, Illari is still looked at because her presence in the game takes away skill from Support survivability (Healing Pylon and ridiculous burst heal alt fire). Nade should be reduced to 75% healing reduction instead of 100% and 30% healing bonus instead of 50%. If they do that, they can revert the cooldown change. Bap's numbers are still gonna be insane, so tweak to damage and heals would still be nice. For the sake of Zen mains, I hope you get a little buff of power back. Kiriko is fine.

"OculusQuest","t5_p2wzd","Somebody just wrote an article about three ways to do it:

https://andytran93.com/2023/10/28/boosting-productivity-with-quest-3-the-best-apps-ive-tried-for-using-it-as-a-virtual-display-on-mac/

The reddit thread where I found that link:

https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/17in0dj/using_the_quest_3_as_a_virtual_display_for_a_mac/

My experience:

I've only used Immersed.  It's free, and easy to set up. After a few days I had to register an account, but no payment was involved.  There's a 'pro' level you can either pay for or that's granted free if you continually use it a certain number of days a week.  Five screens vs. three is the biggest difference, I think, but I rarely use more than two so it doesn't affect me either way.

I have an M1 MB Air and a Quest 2 and the screen quality is ""fine,"" but I'm not sure it's something I'd specifically buy a headset for.  I happened to have both, the software was free, and ""hey, this is fun, I'm sitting at my computer in a space station"" (which I am, right now).

There are other options but Immersed works well enough for my occasional purposes that I haven't tried anything else.",1698796914.0

"halo","t5_2qixk","I think one of the issues Halo Infinite has is that its armor has been related to specific cores, making its pool of customization options feel more shallow than it really is. So a free player may get a handful of armor every couple of months, but it feels meager when it gets spread out.


I think continued development towards full cross core customization will fix this. You can already see its effects with helmets. It opens up the door for more customization, and people have been saying Infinite is close to having the best customization in the series. Once we get cross core treatment with shoulders, gloves, utilities, coatings, maybe chest armor, I think people will be hard pressed to say that Infinite doesn't offer the most in the series.",1698796915.0

"therapists","t5_2wlgc","Something to note: A large factor in the traditional MSW-LPC gap has been the fact that Medicare wouldn't cover LPC services. That ends this coming Jan when mental health counselor's become Medicare providers (which I understand social workers lobbied against). So if your focus is primarily clinical, the LPC is better therapy training/prep, and LPC will be more in demand very sson. 

One concern is that most, but not all, federal/VA counselor jobs require counselor's have attended a CACREP school. This requirement is bullshit and will most likey be increasingly relaxed in the next few years. 

There are plenty of case management and admin listings that will acccept counselors, especially once you've got a few years experience. If your focus is clinical, and there's a good program available to you, LPC is a better option. 

My perspective is from a major metro area. There may not be as many options in smaller areas.",1698796916.0

Like for a lot of color blocking it’s nice to use it so that it can really seep into the skin but for mainly black and line work tattoos not everyone needs the saniderm or plastic wrap. I think you can use either it doesn’t matter. Green soap is great and i know Vaseline can work as a lubricant as you’re tattooing bc you don’t want the skin to be dry. For your stencils, Stencil stuff works great and i have watch videos on YouTube of how to properly apply stencils. For after care, dial orange antibacterial soap has worked great for me and i use A&D tattoo ointment which i LOVE that stuff is liquid gold. It’s not too oily like aquaphor but keeps the tattoo super hydrated while healing! I’ve also learned to stop using the ointment after 4-5 days or whenever it starts getting flakey and switching to unscented lotion from then on!",1698796917.0

I still drink decaf about as often as I used to drink caffeinated coffee. 

Once or twice a month I'll have a cup of tea if I really need a boost to get through the work day in the afternoon.

The S-1 as written says that NBH can withhold the subscription rights from any shareholder they choose to put in the penalty box.   They have stated that banks, brokers, and shareholders that are holding as nominees for others will not get the subscription rights,and that the determination of who gets the rights is at the sole discretion of NBH.

I find that a surprising statement in the S-1 and believe it is illegal and why the S-1 has not been

It can be very demoralizing for our editors to spend time working on an edit only to find that OP has chosen the very first submission, which is often not the best quality.

- Remember to zoom-in and look carefully at the submissions before choosing a winner. Recent advancements in AI have enabled some very impressive edits to be made very quickly, however it often results in unnatural distortions of things like faces and hands and background objects that more careful editors can and will correct manually, but at the cost of a bit more time. Again, it's best to be patient.

- Since this is a paid request (you've set the ""paid"" flair and/or you've offered payment) all submissions will be watermarked. Once you've chosen a submission and sent payment, the editor will send you the final, un-watermarked file.

- Once your request is solved, remember to change your post's flair to ""Solved"" by commenting ""SOLVED"" and thank those who helped you.

"AstralProjection","t5_2rylp","I think I’m in the same stage that you are! It is exciting. I would say that I have very much the same experience in the vibrational state.

For me, it has felt like a warm buzzing sensation that feels most centered around my abdomen and chest. My hands feel numb, and usually my breathing quickens or becomes automatic. Once I felt rapid eye movement like you describe. It might be your body entering a REM sleep stage. 

I have also had difficulty with getting out of the physical. Once I felt myself floating over my body but felt the strong urge to swallow and a little bit of fear that zipped me back up. 

Another tip I’ve been reading about from William Buhlman is once you reach the vibration have an “exit strategy”. He recommends suspending all thoughts of the body and focusing on where you want to be. A simple close proximity destination may be easiest like foot of my bed, or living room, or outside my house under the tree. 

There are other more dynamic techniques like the roll-out, sit up etc. You attempt to “roll” your astral self out of your physical body. I’ve only been working on this for a few weeks but feel like I’m getting closer! I had partial success envisioning climbing a rope and pulling myself out of the physical. I like rock climbing so this technique seemed to resonate (literally 😄) with me.

Good luck!",1698796919.0

"CasualRO","t5_50b8uc","Înțeleg sentimentul tău. Am avut și eu o astfel de persoană în viață de care m-am îndrăgostit intens și de atunci nu a mai reușit nimeni să mă facă să mă simt la fel. Când era cu mine îmi zicea cât de norocoasă e că mă are și că nu-i vine să creadă că un om ca mine există și sincer nici acum nu știu dacă a mințit sau nu, pentru că se și vedea pe ea că simte ce spune. O altă chestie pe care o făcea foarte bine era să mă facă să simt că sunt ascultat cu adevărat. Avea obiceiul de a observa și aprecia cele mai mărunte lucruri la mine.

Ei, s-au întâmplat niște lucruri aiurea între timp care nu au ținut de mine și deși am mai vorbit încă un an după, la un moment dat ea a încetat să-mi mai răspundă și aia a fost. Și acum mă mai gândesc uneori la ce face sau cum ar fi fost dacă erau altfel circumstanțele. În același timp mă gândesc că poate e mai bine așa pentru că nu a fost nici fata ideală... a avut niște probleme destul de grave comportamentale, dar le recunoștea și mă gândeam că le va rezolva la un moment dat poate.

În orice caz, chiar dacă mă mai gândesc la ea, nu înseamnă că nu aș putea să găsesc mâine pe cineva care m-ar face la fel de fericit sau poate chiar mai fericit. Trebuie să ai speranță sau cel puțin să înveți cum să-ți trăiești viața fără să se rezume la a găsi ACEA persoană care te va face fericit. Eu am fost mereu bun la a-mi adapta modul de gândire la situația în care sunt. Nu știu dacă poți să treci altfel peste situație decât dacă îți schimbi modul de gândire. Trebuie să fii mai deschis la viață. Nu e sfârșitul lumii situația în care ești. Nu-ți mai permite să te demoralizeze gândul la o persoană care te-a făcut fericit în trecut. Apreciază ceea ce ai avut cu ea și eventual memoriile bune pe care ți le-a dat și atât. E timpul să-ți vezi mai departe de viață, cum o fi ea. Nu știi niciodată când ți se schimbă norocul. Doar trăiește! :D",1698796919.0

I’d avoid just showing up in person as there’s no guarantee there will be anybody there who could answer your questions. But definitely call, message and leave voicemails for places.

"NewIran","t5_76mmwm","The difference between today and the 1970s is that Iranians in the 1970s were very politically active. There were a variety of organizations calling for the overthrow of the Pahlavi government and large numbers of Iranians joined these organizations, gave their time and money, joined military sessions to learn how to use weapons and fight against the state. The Marxists (MEK) and Islamists were particularly notable for this: they went on killing sprees, they bombed the police and disrupted the economy by destroying power grids or cutting off electricity. I see no equivalent to this today.  

>Details surrounding various issues must be discussed and debated but these are some good starting points for discussion, on the topic of LGBT the IRI has already settled most of the debate on what we should do. In the case of LGB it should be decriminalized but not fully legalized we as a culture are not yet ready for such a leap to full legalization, even places like Japan have banned gay marriage never-mind a country like Iran

Honestly I don't think they even need to publicly discuss very specific things like future policy on homosexuality. They just need to be in agreement on some very basic things: democracy, normalized relations with the West, no forced hijab, freedom of religion, etc. The danger of bringing up gay rights is a lot of people in Iran are against gay rights and it can be off putting to them. This is also why I think it's unwise of Reza Pahlavi to be openly supporting Israel - I don't think he and his clique realize this is distasteful to many Iranians. 

As we stand right now, I think the quickest path to political change is Khamenei dying. The protests are unorganized and opposition groups don't have truly dedicated members. We can hate what the MEK stands for, but we got to respect that they're organized and know how to draw dedicated members, instead of Twitter shitposters that show up to protests once a year in Washington.",1698796919.0

And my $0.02:
Unless you have an arrow weight in mind and a certain speed in mind that you don't want to deviate from I don't see any reason to go up in poundage, especially only 5 pounds and to do so requires a limb swap and re-tune. Seems like a lot of work for me but could be a good off season project.
I think it's fairly widely accepted that shooters are almost always more accurate with lower poundage bows. Hitting the deer where it matters, is what matters. For your peace of mind and a little extra speed it could be helpful though.",1698796921.0

There are some that are not reasonable - the height one in particular is bullshit, because essentially every other element is something a person could work towards, and the ""Recently single/divorced"" is really a proxy for ""have your emotional shit together.""  But considering her age, *she's probably looking for a guy in his forties.*  Assuming that's true: 

 \- College ed, reads books, white collar: these are lifestyle matching.  I have a bachelors and date a girl with a masters.  I have tried dating women without degrees.  It does not go well for me.  Similar for white collar; someone who works as a software engineer or marketing professional may not vibe well with a mechanic, trucker, or soldier.  

 \- Owns home, owns suits: these are not unreasonable for a white collar worker in his forties.  Maybe uncommon on the home, I'll grant.  Suits are reasonable; in your forties you've been to a couple weddings and job interviews.

 \- Works out: she very clearly does as well.

 \- Travel: More lifestyle matching.  If she loves to travel and you don't, that's a non-starter.  

 \- Addiction/hunting stuff seems obvious.  There's about a 50% chance she's in the Pittsburgh or Philadelphia regions, so not hunting isn't a surprise.  

Alas, there's really no defense for the whole attitude.  This is all guesswork, because instead of talking about who SHE is, she just threw down a list of criteria.  The criteria are fine; it's that list that's a concern.",1698796921.0

Engineered Stone aka Quartz is basically a fancy version of concrete. They mix up a batch for a slab and then put a nice polish on it. More colours than granite but cheaper,  but still more cost than laminates, but will last forever.

there is no ""ignition vs true ignition"", that concept doesn't even make sense. an ignition can do multiple things, but a weapon capable of it is either ignited or it isn't.

the thorn seems to respond to bam's emotional state, growing larger and shrinking depending on how riled up bam is, but keep in mind that the first thorn fragment we saw, the one at the workshop battle, was hundreds of feet tall and shrank when bam absorbed it. that size-changing property has nothing to do with ignition of the weapon.

Why they're this detailed is that CO used an off the shelf 3rd party product to procedurally generate Cims for CS2. That product doesn't know what the people it makes are being used for so they have levels of detail that would suffice in an FPS game.

Our son was a terrible sleeper and we almost had several breakdowns over the first few months. Comparing to our little girl, she has been a great sleeper in her first week. My post came off the back of a day where our toddler was at daycare. My wife and I were able to go to a cafe by the beach and have some quality time whilst our daughter slept in her bassinet. I even managed to get some cleaning of the house in and a bit of Zelda on the couch while she slept. 

Then our toddler came home and all hell broke loose because he didn’t get what he wanted 🙃 he’s also going through his 2 year sleep regression. 

The flip side of all this is up until now we have been sleeping through the night for a year and a half thanks to sleep training him. We have amazing times with him and get to do all sorts of fun stuff together.

Bibi and Likud must be relieved of their governmental leadership status and Hamas must be eradicated. These are the first steps for policy to take place. Unfortunately, Israel’s inhumane action toward Palestinians does further hatred among the younger generation of Palestinians, potentially creating worse threats than Hamas. 

This is what Hamas wants and it’s clear their leaders don’t care for their civilians. “Our tunnels are meant for our fighters, not our civilians. Israel will have to take care of our citizens.” 

Until Hamas is eradicated and Iranian leaders take their hands out of this, we won’t see an end. Russia, in particular, is embarrassing themselves for getting cozy with Iran and further showing the “western world” that Hamas is a terrorist organization in which 50% of the population in Gaza never had the ability to vote for back in 2006. 

Until Iran ceases its involvement and the Qatari government gives up Hamas leaders, we will not see an end to it from the MENA world and Israel will continue to “defend” itself by colonizing Palestinian homelands in Gaza and the West Bank.",1698796923.0

So each band member gets their own custom mix (or can turn the knob on the headphone to hear the main FOH mix if they prefer).  There are THRU jacks for the L/R channels to go out to the PA.  And then we run long 1/4""M to 1/8""F extension cords to each band member for their IEM's.

I had very little acne when I was a teen. Now 19 months on T I need a treatment for it if I don't want my face to look like the surface of Mars. I also have a little bit of it on my shoulders and back. But the areas definitely evolve (it goes higher on my cheeks now, and I used to have a lot of it in ly forehead, which isn't the case anymore).

I did had a spike in sex drive. For the first time in my life, ot absolutely didn't happen when I was a teen. Bit I did nothing about it for the first months, and you don't have to if you don't want to. I'd just notice feeling a little funny for a minute and then forget it and let it go away on its own.

Not a lot to say about sweat. I've always sweated easily from my face, and got hot easily. I don't think I'm stinkier (at least no one told me so) but I've never smelled sweaty anyway

I did get a lot hungrier though, which never happened to me before.
So overall I'd say your first puberty isn't indicative of how T will go for you, sorry about that :/ More like, your personality (for the horny/angry part), genetics (for the hair grow/hair loss) and physical characteristics (for the voice drop and muscle mass).

People are still convinced of his guilt without ever looking into the facts of the case or his acquittal because he “looked weird” and “acted strange”. “OJ was acquitted” is another one you hear often, as if two completely different cases are comparable because they were both celebrities. Michael Jackson was used by opportunists due to his good nature and when he cut the cord, they tried to extort him. That’s the basic gist of it. Him settling in ‘93 was not an admission of guilt, but rather a decision made for a multitude of reasons, including pressure from his record label to avoid a court case and potential cancellation of tour dates.

It’s a complex tale with lots of twists and turns, but I recommend the Michael Jackson Case For Innocence Podcast to learn the full story.",1698796924.0

"titanic","t5_2ra5c","Steam engines are quiet. So are large marine diesels. It’s because they run at low revolutions per minute.

Reciprocating steam engines are powered by steam pressure, not by exploding fuel-air mixtures in the cylinders. Explosions, unsurprisingly, are loud. And running at 4000 revolutions per minute, internal combustion engines are really loud.

Titanic’s engines probably ran at under 200 rpm, maximum.

What there would have been, for sure, was vibration. Those massive cylinders and cranks going up and down. Plus the vibrations of the propellers, the inevitable cavitation. Vibration was felt throughout the ship, particularly at speed. Vibration in passenger steamships was always a challenge to marine architects.

Marine diesels are an interesting case. I’ve been up close (really close) to large oceangoing tugs pushing barges. Thousands of horsepower, no engine noise. None. I could hear the blowers in the ventilators pumping air down into the engine room, and the sound of the churning prop wash. I suspect the engine noise is very low frequency, below the range of human hearing.",1698796924.0

"Hema","t5_2t8jx","> Can you point to any videos where the metatron was fundamentally incorrect (and did not retract upon discussion).

Can you actually deal with basic criticism without trying to avoid it by reorienting the discussion your pet goalposts? He's repeatedly claimed that homosexuality wasn't widespread or culturally condoned in ancient Greece, which is about as hilariously histrionic as you can get. I couldn't care less about overtly xenophobic cultural supremacist Metatron fan boys (your comment history isn't exactly subtle) coming out of the woodwork to defend the man on the basis of ""he changed his public views on some things when he thought it might threaten his income"". If he's not a bad egg he'd show it by not consistently trying to make blatantly historically false statements about women and LGBT people and the ragebait minority of the week in order to try to court cryptofascist audiences and doing clickbait teardowns of fringe views about ""maybe this emperor was trans"" while not doing teardowns of actually widespread but equally erroneous views more popular among his core demographic (I remember when he used to do this more), and then sometimes apologizing for lying.

Good people don't overtly court cryptofascist audiences. ""It doesn't count because he changed his tune when he got some heat but did it again"" is an extremely disingenuous way to examine behavior, because it's explicitly trying to deflect from criticism, rather than understand and account for it.

""I'm super conservative and facts and evidence are when conservative YT channels agree with me"" isn't convincing when I get it from you or anyone else, and this isn't the first time I've encountered it today.",1698796924.0

Your partner is waving a giant flag telling you that he is all alone there and he is not having anything from this opening up.   
I don't get the FwB in this - these are many people you have daily sex with? What is the difference between these guys and that guy  you wanted deeper connection? How your partner is dealing with that you are having fun and he is doing absolutely nothing far away all alone?  
I think you should stop NM for a while and repair your relationship. LDR are really difficult, because you can't show emotions, hug and deeply talk via internet, even if you are mad and want to rage - you can just click the button and end the call.  If you going to visit him - find him a girl there no matter what he says. Help him with that and THEN you can start NM again when he will have mind occupied with nice girl.   


This is very similiar story I read here, where guy didn't want to stop his gf having sex with others in LDR and he was dying and raging on his blog on twitter, while he was lying that everything is ok during the calls.

"Divorce","t5_2qipv","Adding to the other commenter’s explanation, Stonewalling is about withholding to get your way. So like not speaking to your spouse for three days because they left a light on in a room they left and did not return to quickly enough for your liking is stonewalling. Not speaking to your spouse for days because you want to open your marriage or let your brother move in, or buy an expensive car that will fuck up your finances, or whatever, is stonewalling. 

Grey Rock is about making yourself uninteresting to seperate your life from the other persons. It started as a technique with bullies. Bullies bully for a reaction. You grey rock to stop giving them a reaction so they stop targeting you. It gets used for toxic or exited relationships because people pull the other person’s strings as part of a pattern of the relationship. By Grey Rocking, you stop that dynamic which can lead to a much healthier relationship.",1698796925.0

I didn't provide just my opinion, I quoted from the avma that pit bull types are responsible for numerous severe and fatal bites. The avma provides even more evidence of that in the blog youre referring too. They constantly flip between talking about severe bites and just regular bites which really muddies the water. 

Medico-legal implications of dog bite injuries: A systematic review 2023 cites a 2022 insurance industry study which named pit bulls as one of several vicious breeds. Your link also shows this as the woman who was attacked was literally dragged by the pit bull.

I also found a fun rebuttal to the avma 2014 ""review"" called Selling a lobbying pamphlet as science: Analysis of the May 15, 2014 AVMA pamphlet “Literature Review on the Welfare Implications of The Role of Breed in Dog Bite Risk and Prevention”. This basically shows how the avma abuses language and uses technicalities to lobby politicians against breed bans.

All political policies should be aimed at maximizing well-being for the maximum amount of individuals, not maximizing well-being for ""society."" Maximizing well-being for ""society"" and not for individuals leads to ridiculous outcomes like creating fake jobs just so that the unemployment number goes down.

if your parents car breaks down and they need a tow, they should know where they want it towed to.  if they don't know, it can end up in a tow storage lot and they will be charged high storage fees. if you tell the tow driver you're not sure where to tow it, they will say no problem, we can hold it for you until you figure it out. they will be nice and act like they're doing you a favor, but this will cost you hundreds maybe even thousands. never let them store the car for you. you are better off storing it at home while you figure out what to do with the car.

**Summary:**  Tommy manages to convince his siblings (and Eileen) to make their own Ouija Board. He also keeps stealing their Halloween candy because  sometimes older brothers are just the worst.

*There are some mild Distant Shore and Waterbound spoilers in it as it takes place in 1933 but they're pretty vague.*

Technologist, but that's kind of an xray joke because it really bothers some people. 

If I hadn't seen the imaging myself I'd probably be saying something similar to you honestly. What are the odds a claim like this could be real? But I am an xray tech and I've been doing it for 15 years now, I've looked at a lot of xrays and CTs and all kinds of imaging.

 I can see enough in the scans that are already available to know for certain, that what the doctors in these videos are saying is correct. I believe them because I have enough personal experience to see the evidence and judge it. 

I'm sorry I'm not more convincing to you but if you hear me at all, I wouldn't dismiss the bodies just because it feels like it should be a hoax.",1698796926.0

The First World War’s conclusion is a matter of much debate but one thing that is known is the allies were actually gentle with the German nation in the peace terms especially considering how the Germans have treated the Russians or the French in prior wars (or the Austro Hungarian empire or the ottomans.)  I mean for fucks sake the whole “they were blamed” was because Germany was the ones that declared war on both France and Russia, invaded neutral countries and conspired to create conflict between the united states and Mexico.

It's a little scarce on fat, but that's 2 buns, 3 protein sources (cream cheese, meat, hummus), and 1 fruit exchange. A year into recovery, she definitely should be adding butter to the buns IMO, but this isn't that egregious.

The plates they give you in inpatient are for a weight restoration pace that is *unsafe* at home. Yes, your meals are massive, because they want you gaining like 3-6lbs a week. That is, quite literally, dangerous, without constant medical supervision. .5-2lbs a week is safe for home, and she also could already be weight restored- she has not mentioned her weight.

She's definitely still obsessed with food, profits off of keeping herself scared of food, and is, in general, disingenuous with her recovery (regardless of weight and what meals look like, I think her behaviors would probably warrant a higher level of care than whatever she is doing right now)... but this is really not that bad.",1698796926.0

Arabs claim the 700,000 displaced were unrelated to the war in which they tried to ""de-exist"" the newly formed state of Israel.  Totally unrelated incidents which just coincidentally were happening at the same time in the same place...

Israelis remember it differently.  

Either way, shit happens in war.  Neither side played nice.  Thousands were slaughtered, on both sides.  But if the arabs had won that war, every single jew in the country - tens or hundreds of thousands would have been slaughtered.

But don't take my word for it, the relevant wikipedia page is : 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948\_Palestine\_war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestine_war), it is recommended reading for everyone.  

&#x200B;

The first paragraph:

    
The 1948 Palestine war was fought in the territory of what had been, at the start of the war, British-ruled Mandatory Palestine. It is known in Israel as the War of Independence (Hebrew: מלחמת העצמאות, Milkhemet Ha'Atzma'ut) and in Arabic as a central component of the Nakba (Arabic: النَّكْبَة, lit. 'the disaster').\[a\]\[14\]\[15\]\[16\]\[17\] It is the first war of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the broader Arab–Israeli conflict. During the war, the British terminated the Mandate and withdrew, ending a period of rule which had begun in 1917, during the First World War. Beforehand, the area had been part of the Ottoman Empire. In May 1948, the State of Israel was established by the Jewish Yishuv, its creation having been declared on the last day of the Mandate. During the war, around 700,000 Palestinian Arabs were displaced.\[18\]",1698796927.0

However, from another point of view (political and cultural) French was the dominant language used in diplomacy for some time in Europe, and France itself is a powerful country in the EU. We have a culture of pride and borderline arrogance due to our history as a whole, that translate even in politics and sometimes some people do not want to let go of this pride even for small matter. I think it's still dumb to have this issue considering French is neither a leftover language in the EU or a dying one.

If the important feature is geography, you could just make a choropleth map.

"moreplatesmoredates","t5_2mohet","Deadlifts will cure your back pain by strengthening the surrounding muscle tissue. However, it is imperative that you use proper technique, or else they will make it worse.

From what you're writing here, it seems very likely to me that your back pain is caused by not maintaining a neutral spine during compound lifts.

For instance, pull-ups can easily cause back pain if you bend your spine when you relax your body at the low end of the movement. This is consistent with the pain you're describing when hanging from the bar. It can be corrected by keeping your legs slightly in front of you so that your back stays neutral.

For deadlifts, the force needs to come from your legs, up through your hamstrings and posterior chain. A typical mistake is to extend the legs first and then lift by bending your back. To correct that, you need to learn how to brace properly.

Same for squats. Bracing and maintaining a neutral spine is very important.

In my experience, most physio therapists won't help much with back pain, because they will have you do very conservative exercises with toy weights. The best remedy for lower back pain is heavy deadlifts.

There are plenty of videos on YouTube that do a better job than me explaining the techniques.",1698796929.0

She breezily said “oh maybe I had one, maybe twice.”  That’s the longest conversation we have had the topic. I don’t even know what age she experienced menopause. I know when she was about 50 she thought she was pregnant.

"FamilyMedicine","t5_2ur05","I wish there was some kind of instruction manual for what to expect from which kind of physician, explains common terminology, and details what to expect from ER visits and even hospital stays. How is anyone supposed to know? We're fed a steady diet of obviously wildly inaccurate representations of the doctor patient relationship. Hell, most people believe CPR will save a person nearly every time it's done and have no clue ribs get broken. And what one person is accustomed to from their physician might be a one off, but they don't realize it. 

OP's patient hears the instruction from them, goes home, has questions, and so-and-so says ""Oh! You should call your doctor to ask about that, specifically! I do and my doctor explains things."" Their patient thinks *oh, I didn't realize I could do that*, and makes the call. 

A big factor is also probably that patients hear, ""You have to advocate for yourself. Ask questions. Your doctor works for you! Sometimes they miss things."" 

Then there is the family experience: growing up regularly visiting people in hospitals, having many family members who have been hospitalized, etc. My family tried to stay out of the way of nurses and didn't treat nurses like wait staff, but they did congregate in large groups to visit sick people. They would ask for a drink for the patient occasionally and ask for warm blankets if the patient was really cold. They didn't go stand at the nurses' station to demand things, but they'd ask during checks. 

My grandparents were part of a big church full of people who sort of subconsciously set protocol for how guests were to act in a hospital and around a patient. I guess it was an actual culture? That's how my parents and I learned what to expect in a medical setting: experiences of my grandparents and their multitude of friends. 

It's been a real eye opener to read through some of the medical subreddits. I've been genuinely shocked by my misconceptions and worry how often I've committed faux pas. But who can you even ask about these things? No one has time. A lot of it you wouldn't know to ask in the first place; there's just no frame of reference. 

One of my friends has never seen a doctor as an adult. He last saw a doctor before he turned 10. He's 44. He's TERRIFIED. And it mostly comes down to this type of thing. Many different people have told him what to expect, or say, or do-- but its not homogenous advice. He has a fear of dentistry for the same reason. 

I don't know what the answer might be, but I hope physicians will try not to lose patience. Not every annoying person intends to be.

"ask","t5_2qhlj","Hmm. Question, if you don't mind? 

There are two guys in my life that really enjoy cracking my knuckles (fingers and toes). I do not love this; often it hurts, and even when it doesn't, I get no enjoyment from it. I have made this clear to them.

For both of them, they'll stop if I aggressively put my foot down, but they regularly keep trying (despite protest), and I occasionally give in and let them do it. 

One is a good friend, and the other is my boyfriend. I've let my boyfriend do it more often, and he's basically explicitly said ""if I do it enough you'll start to like it."" I realize how that sounds, but also he's sort of right: some digits don't hurt at all anymore when he does it. (High praise, I know.)

I've known my friend for 5ish years and my boyfriend for about 1. They don't know each other especially; I've introduced them, but afaik they both developed this knuckle-cracking impulse entirely independently, and probably prior to meeting me.

Question 1: whyyyyy? Lmao. Is this common? Why are there two of these people in my life right now!

Question 2: how much of a red flag do people think this is? There has been some other mild boundary-testing from both of them, but neither has had any issues with more ""important"" boundaries.",1698796930.0

They also preyed on various other marine reptiles, such as  *Dolichorhynchops*  as well as smaller mosasaurs;  while it may be unlikely, a non-injected venom could be useful in those cases.  Conical teeth will puncture just as well as globular types, as punctured shells have shown (although this interpretation is still disputed by some workers). What we now know is that puncturing destroyed the ammonites boyancy control, slowing or stopping escape. Your statement that venom proves your point is  built on an a priori argument: A does not necessarily equal B. But hey, you do you.

My general download speeds aren't bad but while ping mainly stays in the 20s and 30s, it sometimes fluctuates to 100+ (versus consistent 10s before) so I'm curious as to what QoL hits the game's going to take because of that.

"u_rewindio","t5_ysdvs","Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3""03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll eyes, Captivate, Charm and Tail Whip along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close with this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat + high HP pool + Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more.",1698796933.0

I had been desperate for a baby for more than five years!! (when my mom died I went baby fever crazy and it was all I thought about like all day everyday, but my husband and I had some big things we needed to wait to be over before TTC. Hence the delay.) 

All that is to say I totally get it and I hope the comments aren’t getting you down. This is probably good prep for pregnancy and parenthood tbh because everyone has opinions on things you’re doing “wrong” and they won’t hesitate to tell you 😅 still i do agree that it’s even more exciting to buy once baby is on the way, however I also understand taking advantage of a good sale.

On the plus side, it tends to be the boys who are most cool with things, since they just see ""OMG her dad builds lightsabers/droids/robots, and they all play video games,"" etc. Her more recent school has been much more open minded as well.",1698796934.0

In my experience many adults come into their intake requesting a female client. This is especially true for clients with trauma (self explanatory) and men. In the Midwest many men have a real hard time sharing feelings with anyone (but especially other men). 

On the other hand, I get more children/adolescent referrals than many of my female colleagues. This is because there are not many male therapists that see kids in my area and many parents want their sons to see a male therapist. Many of these parents either expect their sons to be able to open up faster to a male or expect me to talk about puberty/male social skills with their kids.",1698796934.0

"okbuddyvowsh","t5_303l49","How is flattening a city with bombs a concession for peace, again?

My point is that every innocent civilian the United States killed while ""fighting terrorism"" served as recruitment propaganda for ISIS. It made more people likely to join the 'anti-US' side presented by ISIS. Hamas is counting on Israel killing civilians to justify retaliation just as the IDF does with Hamas. 

If Israel is genuinely interested solely in making Hamas not exist, they are making the wrong moves. There is nothing forcing the IDF to indiscriminately bomb Gaza like they are. They have vastly more power and resources than Hamas. Every building bombed is another horror scene for Hamas to point at and say ""Hey you, don't you want to get back at the people who did this to you?"" to some impressionable Gazan teen. 

The point is not about right or wrong sides, but recognizing how extremism and violence is perpetuated and a pragmatic solution to the issue.",1698796934.0

The one side effect that stays is a lack of appetite and that's the one that works for losing weight. You should stop worrying about getting off of a medication that you haven't started yet. Lol.

Andressen, out of all people, gets a cyberpunk plotline. It is similar to Sakai’s episode, filled with action. I think the visuals do not quite reach OVA4, but the story is a tad better instead. Unfortunately, something that also carries over is the one-off character that I find hard to care about. That mini-montage of Andressen with Oscar at the end fell totally flat for me.",1698796935.0

Meanwhile, public transport in the US is laughably bad. I would say its a direct reflection of our values as a country. Any sort of social service is completely demonized and god forbid we don't try to milk every single dollar from humans trying to live their lives.

I do enjoy video games, but if you're playing 200 hours say per month, there are things you are probably neglecting already, adding a girlfriend like in the post is only going to make that worse, because significant others do actually want time.

"PleX","t5_2ql7e","Since I got a 65 inch TV, I don't even bother with 720p anymore. For me, it's just varying levels of bitrate at 1080p.

But the highest bitrates in my collection usually still top out at 10 Mbps for the video, and 768 kbps for 7.1 AAC audio. That gets me files that are usually around 7-8 GB in size, depending on the runtime, and depending on whether I include additional audio commentary tracks. 

I re-encode my own stuff when I can't find something in the quality I really like. Right now, I'm slowly working through re-encoding all 7 seasons of Star Trek TNG bluray remuxes. But usually I can just download things the way I want, especially for new releases.",1698796937.0

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Yes. That is how social media and the haters and the politicians want you to think regarding incels.

It’s all based on the small number of radical members of specific incel forums, which number 40k worldwide.

Now let’s look at the real numbers. 30% of young men and women in America alone are incels. That makes, what, 35 million 16-30yos? That doesn’t include older people at all. And America is only 1/20th of global population, approx. So we might have 700 million incels under 30, and you can half that for men alone.

So you’re going to take your evidence to label all incels based on a wiki article relating to less than half a percent, and that population are the ones who are that radical they join an online forum.

Sweet.

Why don’t you read the original research papers and then find out what real incels think about their lives.",1698796937.0

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","I mean if you want a specific breakdown here it is. The common theme is they missed the point. 

Suzu-  A one second cooldown does absolutely nothing to address any of the major criticisms or issues with Suzu. Functionally it’s also unlikely to ever matter consistently. 

Lamp- lamp got a small nerf if anything, most of its value came from its once use giving it back its 25cd just like my comment on kiriko won’t functionally be a nerf in the vast majority of cases. He just needs it to save someone once. The hp nerf was a start but at 125 it’s still far to high especially when it prevents people from falling under 25% hp. In other words it’ll still stop eliminations but give people the minuscule chance  of securing an elim faster by breaking lamp (25 hp less is nothing). Never mind that lamp might have secured its entire value the second it’s put down so the 25hp nerf if worthless.

If it’s not clear again they missed some of the major frustrations people had with bap (great damage and healing all whilst having amazing utility) and made minuscule nerfs to that one piece of utility. They missed the mark again, his healing is still top tier and the utility nerf is negligible. Don’t forget they didn’t touch his ult, considering how quickly he can build it because of the healing they probably should. 

Lifeweaver- life grip is still frustrating but at least the cd is sure to be impactful, 19s is a long time to wait for grip especially when in conjunction with the heal nerfs. But speaking of those nerfs his healing is 95% of what he brings to the table, why nerf that when people are having obvious issues with the tree?? He builds it so quickly (maybe less now with heal nerfs) but it’s so hard to deal with unless your entire team takes it down. By then it probably did it’s job of saving someone. 

If not then nerf his survivability, he’s so slippery and tanky (functional 275hp when you consider his 50hp healing dash) mixed in with platforms. Nerfing his healing should have been less of a priority of his ult and survivability. At the very least they should have upped his dmg out put since it’s so unreliable he’s forced into healbot in the first place. 

The other changes actually do have some impact and target the correct issues, illari needed her pylon nerfed and it’s nice to see a reduction in her bullet size. Functionally it’ll make it harder for her to hit shots giving her slightly less reliable dps. Arguably they could have focused other aspects of Anna like perhaps lowering the debuffs timer but it’s fine cd nerfs also good. 

Zen is his own issue. 

But to bring it back it’s not that they didn’t listen to the feedback, it’s that they acted upon the feedback in such an unsatisfactory way. Seriously a one second cd nerf on Suzu? They heard the feedback on Suzu and decided that’s what players meant? It’s obvious they tried harder to target the core issues of some character more (illari) than they did with some others (bap and kiriko). 

Bap is very likely to still be meta after this, I really doubt it’s a big enough nerf to lamp to actually shift him out. Ana is still impactful so she’s not going anywhere and kiri managed to suzu her way past another nerf so she’s still going to be picked often if not outright meta. Lifeweaver will probably drop a little but I think he’s better than people gave him credit, if he wasn’t nerfed he’d be meta next. These nerfs won’t kill drop him far tbh.",1698796937.0

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f",">Not so narrow. Remember GU also had Changeling in the format, so unless you were playing specifically WB, you likely had ways to enable Aegar. 

Eh, with all due respect, that's quite a stretch. Idk if I seen a changling trigger from them once as opposed to someone playing pure izzet giants. 

Just cause it *could* in theory do something doesn't mean that's how it played out in constructed.



>Plus, Aegar allows more than one draw per turn compared to the one-per-round Kutzil offers (first strike/double strike antics notwithstanding). Aegar also punished chump blocking while Kutzil is shut down by chump blocking. And a 3/3 for 3 is much more remarkable in UR than it is in GW. ([[Watchwolf]])

Ok? Idk what you are seeking to accomplish here. Outside of their cmc and the fact they draw cards they are pretty different cards to compare and contrast.

And even if we were to compare them, the fact you are leaving out the fact kutzil **hard** shuts down control and instant speed trickery makes this is bit odd to say the least as thats one of the strongest aspects of the card.


>Aegar was the second best legendary signpost in its format. The top two common Blue creatures were [[Berg Strider]] and [[Mistwalker]]. The top two common Red cards were [[Stomp]] and [[Demon Bolt]]. [[Masked Vandal]] was a high pick. 

Again idk what you're trying to accomplish here. I'm not saying aegar is a bad card by any means, in fact it's a great card however its objectively more niche then this card. 

What it does in that niche is again phenomenonal but I can see this card being ez side board tech and even main board tech in a lot of different g/w/X type decks.

>Has there been power creep over the last couple years? Sure. But no need to sensationalize it.

Coming from the person who typed out a long winded comment in support of a pet card of them?

"MemesESP","t5_10wycq","Las presiones migratorias es sencillo, España debe cuidar sus fronteras, no Marruecos, lo normal es que los paises controlen quien les entra no quien sale, lo que hace España es subcontratar a Marruecos para que contengan las oleadas migratorias provenientes de Africa y asi España no queda como la mala.

El problema es que al igual que España no quiere a los inmigrantes subsaharianos y del resto de Africa, Marruecos tampoco, que por cierto esta saturada, asi que Marruecos se deja el culo para contener para que luego España no la trate como socio y hable mierdas o se meta en asuntos que no le incumben, asi que Marruecos se enchina y simplemente pasa de hacer el favor de contener, sobre todo cuando no se la deja tener un control pleno en el sahara que es por donde entra toda la inmigración, es como si España frenase la inmigración a Francia solo para que después Francia apoye la independencia catalana, como crees que reaccionara España? Mandara a tomar por culo a Francia y les dejara que se apañen solos con la inmigración.

Respecto a ceuta y melilla, te recuerdo que en España hay un sentimiento por recuperar gibraltar debido a su ubicación a pesar que haya sido entregada por España a los ingleses en su momento, te recuerdo que Vox por ejemplo ha dicho y reivindicado a gibraltar como española y no he visto que España quiera atacar o invadir a UK, ni veo que los británicos estén perdiendo la cabeza cuando escuchan a Vox o Alvaro Ojeda, entendemos que hay personas que sienten que por la ubicación geográfica deberia ser española y no pasa nada ¿por que cuesta entender que en Marruecos pasa igual? Los marroquíes y españoles se parecen mucho mas de lo que crees y al igual que hay españoles y algunas figuras públicas diciendo que gibraltar es española, hay marroquíes diciendo que ceuta y melilla son marroquíes.

Hay que ser muy paranoico y tomar a los marroquíes por inferiores o idiotas al pensar que su inteligencia no les va a hacer ver que ganan mucho mas comerciando con España y Europa que iniciando una guerra contra la Otan y la UE teniendo a Argelia con muchas ganas de invadir a Marruecos, simplemente no tiene sentido y son paranoias promovidas por la derecha nacionalista española para ganar votos con el miedo.

Por ultimo, el Sahara es Marroqui, Marruecos fue un protectorado no una colonia e igualmente los lideres de los pueblos saharaouis juraron lealtad a Mohamed V, pero además se firmaron los acuerdos de Madrid donde a cambio de tener el sahara sin problemas, Marruecos pediría a EEUU que reconozca la monarquía española y Juan Carlos como un gobierno y entidad política legitima, otra cosa es que España haya roto su palabra por 2 vez iniciando asi el deterioro de las relaciones entre España y Marruecos.

El punto es que España apoya y patrocina al polisario que equivale a ETA en España, lo que hace que Marruecos pase de cuidar las fronteras y corte el comercio, Marruecos no se mete en los asuntos internos de España o Francia, no apoya el independentismo catalán ni el vasco y por algún motivo España ve razonable meterse en los asuntos que no le llaman, porque una vez mas, no se respeta a Marruecos, no se les ve como socios.

Encima los campamentos del polisario estan en argelia y retienen a la población sin dejarles salir hacia Marruecos donde los pocos que logran escapar reciben una casa, ayuda económica y un trabajo, muchos de los retenidos ni son saharaouis.

No me quiero enrollar mas porque ya me explaye pero son temas largos, pero ya para terminar Marruecos por iniciativa propia firmo un acuerdo con España para recuperar a los Menas, lleva desde el 2019-2020 reclamandole a España la devolución de los Menas marroquies y España ha ignorado todas las veces que Marruecos los ha pedido, no es que España diga que no, es que ni responde. Ademas España siempre puede y siempre pudo deportar a marroquies ilegales, otra cosa es que no lo haga y prefiera dar un papelito y esperar que la gente por voluntad propia se pague un avion y se vaya 😂 que por cierto la gran mayoria de inmigración es subsahariana y del centro de Africa y eso no es asunto se Marruecos",1698796938.0

As far as the body goes it’s mostly clothes and proportions 

Drop weight to 140ish unless you’re 6 ft or above and you’d be suprised how much fat stays in your hip or ass area after being on HRT 

If you need BA you need BA but breasts give the illusion of narrower shoulders and you’ll develop a more feminine posture the larger your chest due to rounding your shoulders 

If after dropping weight you still don’t like what you look like start lifting at the gym lower body only and try to keep your bodyfat at a feminine enough level so you don’t look too cut 

Learn how to use bronzer and concealer for your brow and nose area 

Science shows the brow ridge and noise angle is not only the biggest subconscious que we use to gender people but how we recognize people we know personally 

Until you can get your FFS and brow life pluck your eyebrows thinner and arch them 

Ofc get laser done and good at makeup in general 

Bam ! You’ll pass about as well as most could barring a super deep voice but even that can be trained

"MDMA","t5_2qwvg","The only thing I'd be reporting you for is being aggressively triggered to the point where you've abandoned sentence structure or making sense.  

Firstly can we clarify the AI in your first sentence, does it stand for artificial intelligence or was it an autocorrect slip up?  

If you're saying that MDMA is artificial intelligence because it's synthetic, then I don't think you understand what synthetic means. If not, then please help me understand what point you're trying to make.  

Secondly are you claiming that the only ""real"" MDMA must have used sassafras root as it's initial precursor? and are you asserting that this end product would not be considered synthetic? Bypassing the fact that the safrole oil extracted from the plant would have to be manipulated by humans, several times using a litany of other chemicals before it could become MDMA.  

You seem to think that veganism necessarily excludes consumption of the synthetic, which I'm sure many vegans do try to avoid, however the only criteria for veganism is to exclude foods made out of dead animals and anything they may produce whilst still alive.  

You also seem to be making the incorrect assumption that I'm a Vegan because I have vegan Gel caps. I'm not a Vegan, I have the caps because some of my friends are vegetarian, and gelatine/cellulose cap are indistinguishable in terms effectiveness and can be consumed by everyone.  

Further, you've absolutely engineered your own triggering, through a series of false assumptions so well done on spazzing the fuck out over absolutely nothing.   

Asserting that the use of MDMA in combination with cellulose gelcaps is necessarily hypocritical isn't a tenable position, MDMA production does not necessitate environmental damage.

Please, for fuck sake, slap some decency into my life, whatever the fuck that's supposed to mean, I am truely deficient in decency.  

I'm certain that some vegans become arrogant and preachy and annoying when they first convert, and they're often mistaken when it comes to the realities of industrial farming practices, however I also agree with the notion that a lot of livestock live horrible lives in captivity before they die to become food for us, and I don't think that making an effort to remove yourself from that as much as you practically can from being a source of profit of such industry is not a compelling point of view.  

I'd say that saying Vegans are the worst people is at least hyperbolic, and I'd say bringing racist rhetoric in at the last second, unprompted and unrepentant is perfectly fitting with the rest of your post.  

You're an attention seeking kid with an  undeveloped world view, weak arguments, and a hair trigger to run your mouth on subjects you haven't properly developed your own steel-manned arguments for.  

You wish you could be a provocateur, but you're not even a novice level internet troll, you're a retard with a keyboard.  

Google critical thinking. Listen to arguments for and against the gut feeling you have on a subjective opinion, see if you can see things from all angles. Play devil's advocate with yourself to develop a rock solid way to explain your point of view that doesn't have any glaring holes in it.  

Read more, and practice writing too, your ability to convey yourself will improve your vocabulary and grasp on how to write sentences, ones that make sense to other people and not just you.

That I disagree with. It is my business if I'm being unfairly targeted. And they have to decide if it's worth it for a small matter like names tags or carts vs being accused of discrimination in 2023, regardless if it's intentional or because they're too lazy and incompetent to hold others or employees that aren't their friends/family (major conflict of interest) to the same standard. 

Being expected to be treated fairly is a god complex? Again, disagree. In my case it wasn't a coaching but a warning. But I would have went above them if they tried. And to be honest once everyone is disobeying something minor like name tags or carts it's basically become acceptable too as management has allowed it. Now if they issue a warning to everyone I can accept that. But when they let their friends and family do whatever and try to single someone out, that's a major issue.

None of this is on the national news, it's all on tiktok channels and twitter. I only know about all the tiktoks because of my little cousins. There's videos from almost every major Uni in the US, all of them have eliminationist rhetoric. There isn't a single prestigious Uni or RI that hasn't had these marches.

Most major cities in the US have also had them, and I've been in person to witness them in Seattle. But I've seen video of Portland, SF, LA, DC, Boston, NYC, Chicago etc etc etc.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","There are eight cities on Zurvár Arèáná - seven of them planned by the Konsâtèum during the world's settlement and one founded independently after a schism between settlers of one of the planned ones.

They're all low rise and density with plenty of parks and open space, have extensive light rail for public transport and wide separation between industrial and accommodation zones. The Konsâtèum may (in the opinion of many Zurvár) be dicks, but they did their research when it comes to urban planning.

By Earth standards none of the cities are particularly large. The most populous - *Gorat Bárkalif Ganalû* (""The City of the Great Blue Bay"") - had a population of about 690,000 as of 2020. The smallest is *Gorat Mantábon Dìaz* (""The Free City of the Pine Tree"") with a population of only 24,000 that same year.

Generally speaking Zurvár cities are clean, spacious and pleasant places to live, although they naturally face the same problems as any large population centre, and are expected to encounter more of them as they continue to grow.",1698796943.0

There was a random Japanese performance where one of the members added a high note that isn't in the Japanese studio version, but it is in the Korean version.

I'm just saying this because, most likely, you had a government informant in your group, which is totally normal for Cuba.

I came to find out, the unique ways you have to hum, hold and release your breath while reciting the Quran have amazing impact on our brains beyond our imagination. This in combination with the fact that ayas of the Quran can do literal miracles for different illnesses, mental and physical. Sounds, frequencies, vibrations: they matter, they can make and break things, literally. Just look up visualization of frequencies on YouTube. You can be damn sure the Quran being in Arabic and being required to recite in a certain manner has way more significance than we will ever be able to fully comprehend in this world with our limited senses.",1698796945.0

Common jobs where part-time fixed income workers who will work for less than a fair wage include:

* Home Depot / Menards
* Golf marshals - basically get free golf as payment. 
* Sporting events - PGA is notorious for getting thousands of  ""volunteers"" to work for them. You actually pay to volunteer. Part of the wage is access to the event. People who work for a living can't really do that because you also have to take a day off work. 
* voting precincts and other government ""jobs""
* doordash, uber - let's admit the base pay is so terrible and they limit the number of drivers in an area which limits new workers. 
* bookstores, flower shops, and other small businesses that don't require heavy lifting.

Regardless of what denomination you go with, the rabbi will almost assuredly be happy to help with any concerns about the government.

One thing to note is that culturally assimilating can take some time as many people can be taken by surprise by how different jewish culture can be from regular American culture. My best advice on that is to just get used to arguing with people as arguing is seen as extremely healthy to do about everything all of the time.

"AsOneAfterInfidelity","t5_fxuis","r/Asoneafterinfidelity is an online Peer Support Group and safe space for individuals (betrayed or wayward) who are actively attempting to reconcile after infidelity. Reconciliation peer support is emotional and practical support between people who share the common experience of reconciling after infidelity. (Observers are strictly limited to messages of support only.) Kindly read the rules before participating. For transparency and conflict mediation purposes, kindly follow reddit community guidelines by directing any questions, issues, feedback, or appeals about the sub or individual moderator decisions directly to Mod Mail. No response will be given to DMs and chat requests to individual moderators about moderating issues. We are very happy to receive and respond to your concerns through the official channels!   


Please assign yourself a user flair.For app users, flairs can be added at the top of the main page. Select the three vertical dots and the menu should appear. Instructions (desktop version) [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/wiki/flair_instructions)).

For a list of abbreviations commonly used in this subreddit, see the [Acronym Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/wiki/acronym_guide).

Also check out our list of free resources and recommended books for post-infidelity recovery, found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/wiki/resources).        

RULES

**1. All posts and comments must fit the spirit of Peer Support.**

- Keep comments encouraging, constructive, sensitive, validating, and non-judgmental.

- Speak only from your own experience. Use “I”-statements.

- Asking clarifying questions or offering suggestions is acceptable–if backed up by personal experience about what has helped you in your recovery and reconciliation.

- Do not give advice unless specifically requested by OP.

- Any differences of opinion expressed must be communicated respectfully.

- “Tough love” does not qualify as peer support.

**2. The peer group includes: Reconciling BS, Reconciling WS, Recovered & Reconciled, and Considering R.**

- Observer, Unsuccessful R, and other user flairs are not included in the peer group. Non-peers are not allowed to post without prior moderator approval. Non-peer comments are STRICTLY LIMITED TO MESSAGES OF VALIDATION AND ENCOURAGEMENT ONLY. Non-peers are not permitted to offer opinions, reference their experiences, or give advice.

*All posts and comments are subject to removal without warning. Any users who violate the rules are subject to temporary or permanent ban without further warning.*

**3. No personal attacks, victim-blaming, or LABELLING of any kind.**

- e.g. cheater, narcissist, abuser, doormat, slut, asshole, idiot, etc.

- No Cluster-B or other armchair diagnoses.

- No victim-blaming when the sexual assault of a wayward partner by an AP is discussed.

**4. No misogyny, misandry, toxic masculinity, bigotry, racism or other hate speech.**

- Posts or comments dehumanizing and/or slut-shaming wayward partners or APs will be removed. (Posts and comments related to navigating feelings or practical matters about APs are allowed.)

**5. No anti-reconciliation language.**

- Do not tell someone to just leave the relationship. Attempting to reconcile is a valid choice.

- Unless abuse is present, do not suggest marital status, age of relationship, children or lack thereof as a reason for someone to leave the relationship.

**6. Posts and comments must be directly related to RECONCILIATION**

- The scope of this subreddit is narrow: by and for reconcilers on the subject of reconciliation only. There are several other subreddits that offer support for others who have experienced infidelity. Posts about ending reconciliation are subject to removal as this is a subbreddit for those who are actively in reconciliation or considering reconciliation.This is not a general infidelity discussion or advice forum, nor is it a place to read for entertainment and pass judgment.

You're actually advocating for the cheap despawn mechanic?? Fucking hell lad.. 

But no, a bigger croc would be one that does more damage *and* has more health, nigh impregnable beyond the skull or underbelly. Also means it doesn't do a single attack in a straight line, before de-spawning again.. Rotjaw is easily cheesed and this wouldn't be.

In a ‘normal’ eco upgrade you have an upfront cost which improves your economy and after some time the upgrade pays itself. Then the question of when or if to go for it is answered by comparing the time needed to be repayed vs the opportunity cost.

But wheelbarrow and handcart additionally needs tc time! So the fair comparison is not only time vs cost, but also villagers that you stop producing. Your existing vills will produce more but the villagers that you didn’t create in that tc time would have gathered some resources too, so researching this tech can be a net negative (and is in low number of vills).",1698796946.0

The whole ""born in the wrong body"" is an over simplification by cis people. Some trans people relate to that, others don't. I'm AFAB non binary transmasc, my body is mine and I've learned to love that it functions and serves me well and I even like how it looks some of the time. That doesn't make me cisgender, simply someone with complexe feelings and a single body that will be mine for all of my life. 

There is no simple answer to your questions around non binary or a trans man or agender etc. They are simply labels, words that can never perfectly describe and encompass our identity and experience. You don't have to put a name on your gender - you may eventually use a word to explain it to people, and you may or may not feel like it's a great fit, that's fine. Take your time and be kind to yourself, you don't need all the answers to start this journey towards making you feel better.",1698796946.0

"Genshin_Lore","t5_3p82pr","Exactly. I'd say that'd be understandable grounds for her to turn towards our side. But her motivation isn't purely anything other than the result of her own history. Didn't you read the topic? The only part Pulcinella would play is to coerce her to act on her most destructive plans rather than give her the time to realize she could resolve things in better ways. That both gives her agency and builds on Pulcinella's conniving character which we already knew about from Childe and Scara. And on top of that it makes her redeemable which the other prediction wouldn't.

You're the second person to suggest that being mayor means that he'd have to play a major role and that that saves him from being cannon fodder. Correct me if I'm wrong but when has a mayor been an important role in this game? Even taking the leadership of each region into consideration it's usually just the ones at the very top that ever matter. For example even the other heads of the Tri-Commission didn't matter in Inazuma. We care about Ayato just because he runs the Yashiro Commission which is the one Yae backs. So for Snezhnaya that would be the Tsaritsa and Pierro. Pulcinella doesn't have to be that important to its story and based on what we have seen so far I think he'd be overlooked in that Archon Quest since we'd have Pierro, Dottore and Columbina to resolve. Being the ""god-like"" Harbingers Nahida warns us about I'd think they'd overshadow anything Pulcinella could do.

Now I'm not saying he can't play a major role in Snezhnaya. I'm just saying he seems like someone you'd overlook with all the other things the Archon Quest could be about.

When you say Sandrone are you just talking about the Research Institute and the robots? We really don't know much about her yet. I mean there are fans that say she looks like a Vill-V expy and if she is anything like Vill-V then maybe the World Quests work with her.

That is the 16 member rap group ""Big Boomas"".

They have to fight each other in a frenzy to control the 1 microphone in order to get a chance to spit their rhymes for a few verses at a time. The next one not only has to get control of the mic, but they also must effortlessly pick up on the theme of the rap where the last left off quickly. They do this for the entirety of their show/recordings, and are so incredibly talented you wouldn't know unless you see it live. The donut very quickly and is reminiscent of speedy yet poetic Bone Thugs N Harmony rhymes combined with WWF level wrestling.

Sadly, the man rapping here, known as ""Gang NAM"" (aka ""Grandpapi Styles"" on his solo albums), died shortly after this photo was taken. His final word is immortalized as he followed up the previous rapper, ""Opa OG"", whose verse ended with ""No real (expletive) wanna pound that granny p***y"" - in which he was referring to the late Queen of England.

Gang NAM got a hold of the mic immediately, said ""Would"", and dropped the mic in a very brilliant display of OG BDE. He died a few moments later when fellow rapper ""SheBang"" accidentally punctured his lung with a slightly too sharp elbow jab, for which she's still in therapy as the guilt was too much for her to continue her career.

He is now immortalized in meme history out of respect for being the first OG willing to die to let the world know that he, indeed, ""would"".",1698796947.0

"whenthe","t5_23gidu","It is undeniable that Hamas, not Palestine, did intentionally kill some civilians in Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. However, it is often exaggerated how much so.

[According to Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-19/ty-article-magazine/israels-dead-the-names-of-those-killed-in-hamas-massacres-and-the-israel-hamas-war/0000018b-325c-d450-a3af-7b5cf0210000), military soldiers make up around 50% of all Israeli deaths. Additionally, evidence suggests that many Israeli civilians were killed by the IDF either from [crossfire](https://electronicintifada.net/content/israeli-forces-shot-their-own-civilians-kibbutz-survivor-says/38861) or desperation where they killed civilians to kill the Hamas fighters. Read more [here](https://mondoweiss.net/2023/10/a-growing-number-of-reports-indicate-israeli-forces-responsible-for-israeli-civilian-and-military-deaths-following-october-7-attack/).

Additionally, of the non-military Israelis killed, it is highly likely that some of them were armed settlers, which is a common for Israeli settlers. This would classify them as unlawful combatants, as they would be shooting at the Hamas fighters and thus engaging in hostilities. It is important to clarify that only settlers who actively engaged in hostilities would be considered unlawful combatants, and everyone who did not was a civilian.

Practically every single independence and anti-colonialism movement had the intentional killing of civilians associated with the oppressor. This includes the Haitian Revolution, Algerian War of Independence, Irish War of Independence, Indian War of Independence, Mau Mau Uprising, Nat Turner's Rebellion, and MANY MORE. It is unfortunately an inevitable occurrence. One can acknowledge that the killing of civilians is a tragedy without condemning the group. One should NOT condemn Toussaint Louverture's forces just because they sometimes targeted white civilians.

Also, we have strong evidence that the hostages Hamas has taken are being treated highly humanely. [This Israeli woman](https://twitter.com/prolewiki/status/1711783373142659299) testifies that she and her children were not harmed by Hamas fighters. [One temporary Hamas captive](https://electronicintifada.net/content/israeli-forces-shot-their-own-civilians-kibbutz-survivor-says/38861) testifies that they were treated well. [This released Hamas hostage](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/24/israeli-captive-endured-hell-in-attack-but-treated-well-in-gaza) shook hands with a Hamas fighter, saying that they treated her well. [This Israeli hostage](https://twitter.com/Aldanmarki/status/1714006592662757520) was treated for her wounds in Gaza. It is clear that Hamas treats their hostages well.

&#x200B;

It was entirely defensive and provoked. The conditions that the siege created were absolutely dire. For example, [97% of Gaza's water is contaminated BECAUSE of Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/12/gaza-undrinkable-water-slowly-poisoning-people). Israel completely provoked the war with its continued atrocities against Palestinians, such as [the recent invasion and desecration of the Al-Aqsa Mosque by Israeli settlers](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/4/israeli-settlers-storm-al-aqsa-mosque-complex-on-fifth-day-of-sukkot). Additionally, some evidence suggests that Israel was going to attack Gaza after the Jewish holidays anyway.

 Also, [Hamas has literally attempted peace in the past](https://inkstickmedia.com/israel-rejected-peace-with-hamas-on-five-occasions/), and they always failed. An example not mentioned in the article is the Hamas-endorsed ""Great March of Return,"" which were peaceful protests by Palestinians that ended with a massacre by Israel. Hamas honors almost all ceasefire agreements, but Israel almost always violates them.",1698796947.0

If the term was ""advanced assisted driving"" to show it is much more than cruise control, that is reasonable.

I do sell some items off my menu let me know if you don’t see what you’re looking for on my menu. If you have any questions about my menu I would be happy to explain. If I think you are wasting my time I will end the conversation and you will get removed. If you're rude from the start you will be blocked without a refund. Please check with me before sending money as I will assume it was a gift. If you miss days of gfe or don’t finish your session time it will not roll over it is your job to also interact in your services. If you have not messaged me for 24 hours and are not returning my texts I will stop making an effort because you aren’t active in the services you purchased. I will not make up days unless I find it fair to do so. ",1698796948.0

"FinancialCareers","t5_2scvl","\#1 is the best match for those goals due to prestige and relevancy. Big 4 has a well regarded brand and strong alumni networks. Comp is irrelevant. Focus on comp progression & leveling up within the firm.

Longer term strategy... push to get into a strategy practice or transaction services once you make senior (\~2 years). This will probably bump your promotion to manager back a year but offers far better window dressing for your eventual exit into the target roles. There's longer term credibility in making manager (competitive selection process) but don't stick around after that... your focus will shift from ""doing consulting"" to ""running a consulting business"", which is non-strategic for your goals.... (I'm married to a former Big 4 consulting manager)

\#2 is non-strategic, sorry... you'll get a good idea of how to do Finance at a massive, well run company as part of a large team of shiny happy people holding hands. Nothing wrong there. However, most of your opportunities involve doing Finance at smaller and substantially more fucked up companies run by herds of dysfunctional morons (I do turnaround work). So there's a major relevancy issue.

\#3 is... interesting... but not something I'd recommend early in a career unless you're 100% passionate about the subject matter and know you can make a career out of it. The issue is going to be the exit options, which will be dictated by the firm's prestige and your casework. There's a real risk of being lumped into ""obviously smart, but not sure they're relevant to my business"" for any role outside of the narrow specialty, especially in a down market.",1698796948.0

Before you start the class, see how many practice problems you can find that test different properties and identities because you’ll see them on day 1 and they never let up.  If you have any holes in your math foundation, they will be found very quickly just doing the homework so patch those up now.

If she tries to burst down doom, he has block and now he has emp punch or he cancels missiles and headshots you with higher primary dps. Then with ults, doom can farm emp punch and cancel remech. 

You can't really say dva is doom's worst match up when he can stop dva from diving isolated targets while dva cant mitigate his stuns or slams. Orisa can at least mess up slam, block, punch, or ult. she can peel with gold and stop you.

When in Vegas and California I got spotted a lot by a lot of skinhead types who didn't try and fight or anything 80% of thr time they just reaaaaally are proud of their jew spotting skills which... is alarming lol.ive had some bad experiences, I was in the punk scene as a kid and there was a small group of neo Nazi types that we'd like recreationally fight on the regular. Their leader was a Turkish Muslim obsessed with the idea of Aryan applying to both and we had ironically good conversations when he wasn't with his white buddies. It's suuuuper atypical but I try and befriend the truly bigoted ones tbh since I figured it's really the best shot at making any real impact on anybody personal experiences usually what change people's minds on things. It was one guy that was such a junkie that is super annoying he kept forgetting I was Jewish and tried to get me to join the Aryan Brotherhood for like 6 months so that was highly annoying mostly if nothing else. Certainly varies. America is huge and each city or even parts of it can be different.  States a thousand miles away will be vastly different for better or worse but maybe there's cities there even that are completely cool.  Most antisemites I've met never had a real conversation with a jew and half never saw one.  I've been asked to check for horns twice (o did oblige lol) and one I know was dead seriously.  They weren't even loke antisemitc really even which was wild like if we had horns I would be skeptical at best so anyway that person was both spectacularly ignorant and really tolerant",1698796950.0

It was Halloween weekend, of course there are going to be a few pranks--which is pretty common in the USA.  

That said, a bunch of kids playing ding-dong-ditch doesn't justify pulling a gun on *anyone*, particularly a six year old child. He doesn't deserve the privilege of owning a weapon.",1698796950.0

You guys have got to come up with a phrase other than ""shitting on."" At this point I think all old people are obsessed with talking about poop.

And you've got to come up with a way to stop showing your anger than acting like the most stereotypical 12 year old on the planet. Everyone would be annoyed at a parent shoving interests down their kid's throat, but throwing a fit over someone else's hobbies back in turn isn't any better. Being all ""HAHAHA, NEERRRRRRRRRDS"" sounds like you walked out of some 1990s bully PSA yourself.

Seriously, if you’re actually a kid you aren’t exactly endearing yourself to me. I’m 27, and trust—this sounds intolerable. You’ve got a lot of growing to do and you can start by not insulting your entire audience.

Taking from (https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/menstruation-in-the-bible) we see that early in the Bible, menstruation is labeled ""a women's time"" and not treated as impure or overtly sexual. But later on menstruation is declared ""impure"" and requiring the woman to not have sex during that time.

This is what your title should look like:
>    *AGE [R4R] - Description*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your title:

**1. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. Replace the first ""R"" with your gender and the second ""R"" with the gender you're looking for:** 
>    Use only **M**, **F**, **T** or **A** for tagging gender. Use any combination for couples: **MF**, **FF**, etc.

**4. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject:**

"Dysonairwrap","t5_2giqxd","I know this post is a few days old now, but I want to share a couple observations I’ve noticed come up over and over again over the years. It all seems to come down to a person’s hair type and what they want out of the airwrap. I personally absolutely love mine and would go out and buy another one for full price if it stopped working. It has been life changing for me. I have fine hair (meaning each individual strand is pretty thin), dense hair (meaning a high number of hairs), wavy/curly hair, and fairly long hair - down to about my bra strap in the back. I love a blowout, especially with a little curl, and there is simply no other way to achieve that for me personally other than with a tool like this. It doesn’t necessarily need to be the airwrap, but I’m not nearly coordinated enough to do a blowout with a brush and hair dryer. What I like about the airwrap specifically is that it’s less damaging than many similar devices and comes with many different attachments. The shark checks both of those boxes, but the attachments are a little different. If I had to get a new one tomorrow, I’d probably still go with the Dyson because of the attachments. The bristles in the shark round and oval brushes look to me like they snap my fine hair more, which makes me a little more concerned about breakage.  But, the diffuser on the shark looks absolutely amazing, and I’m very jealous of that! They both get positive reviews, so it seems like they’re both pretty good devices. 

All of that being said, the people who seem the most dissatisfied with the airwrap are those who have very straight hair and want to curl it. This is not something I can relate to because my hair holds a curl pretty well. That should have been a clue to me that my hair is naturally wavy/curly, but I actually didn’t realize that until a few years ago. But, from what I hear from those people, it’s fairly difficult for people with straight hair to get curls to hold using the airwrap. Those people seem to need to use a curling iron to get their hair to hold a curl. 

Another consideration seems to be around product usage, although I don’t notice this one as much as the first. There is simply no way for me to style my hair without using products like styling creams, gels, etc, so I have no problem with using them. There seems to be a contingent of people who want to style their hair with the airwrap without using any products and can’t seem to get the style to hold. I don’t totally follow the logic there, but I bring this up in case your wife is someone who doesn’t like to use styling products. If you know she has at least one or two, this one probably won’t apply. 

So, I’m not saying everyone with straight hair won’t be able to curl their hair with the airwrap or that no one can use the airwrap to style their hair unless they use products. These are the two biggest complaints I’ve noticed from people who don’t think the airwrap is worth it. Again, I personally love it and don’t even know how I would live my life without it anymore, so I’m definitely not trying to dissuade you from getting this! I think it’s really sweet of you to think of this for her, and my guess is that she’d probably be very excited to get it as a gift.",1698796953.0

> I started watching Big Brother at the start of the pandemic and so I didn't get much chance to see the live general consensus on players who came back through the battle back. There's LOTS of talk about how Jag's win will have an asterisk and that he doesn't deserve it at all because of his elimination and being saved by a twist. Is this how folks have felt about battle-backers before? Or is it a little different because they had to at least work harder for it? Or maybe how the twists have played out production wise - that this came from the unexpected production eviction AND that two other men had the same opportunity to come back?

> Disclaimer, I'm pretty bummed by the Jag arc. I didn't mind him much at the beginning and I love a good underdog. Buuuut. Not a fan of the steamroll and REALLY not a fan of how he's playing this end game with how he's treating everyone. I honestly think though - if the comps had been more balanced, it wasn't a total comp steamroll, and he wasn't being such an asshole right now - I would have appreciated his arc and not minded his eviction as much.",1698796954.0

Out of a clan of 20 people, sentiment is similar... I also understand a new subclass can't be the norm on an expanson, but the reveal of TFS didn't looked like ""we've been working on this 2 years""-great. Like, ok, LF was bad because TFS. But where TFS at?

If it had a new subclass no one would mind and they'll buy TFS as much as they did Lightfall, [which surpased sales expectations as per Joe](https://massivelyop.com/2023/04/07/destiny-2-lightfall-surpasses-sales-expectations-as-bungie-apologizes-for-missing-the-mark-on-goals/).

What I am trying to say is, if TFS couldn't release without Lightfall in the middle, and it looks this bad that even internally isn't getting hype... Where has all this time to work been put? How are they expecting a patrol zone, 3 supers, 3 fragments and 2 weapon archetypes to sell as much, or retain as much players as, or I don't know, do as well as an expansion with a new subclass?

"BG3Builds","t5_37byfs","I've played a lot of Tempest Sorc and I don't think it's the most OP. It has probably the most OP single use per long rest damage, but the sustain isn't there. 

Chain Lightning w/ Luck of the Far Realms (or Crit) and Channel Divinity vs 4 wet enemies = 80 (channel divinity max damage) x2(Crit) x2(wet) x4(enemies) is 1280 damage. After that, unless you Crit and only if you still are targeting 4 enemies, the damage is on average 320 total, with a Crit on average its 640. Not to mention that you don't get that many casts of chain lightning unless you're relying on scrolls.

"AusFinance","t5_2uo3q","There are a lot of reasons to abandon the partner track, which takes 10-15 years or so (assuming you are even good enough to become partner)

Lower pay than industry - the gap is increasing all the time as these firms don't move their payscales in line with inflation, let alone with competing institutions - they claim to benchmark but they only benchmark against each other. They say they benchmark to industry, but if they do, they are getting bamboozled by the firm they get the benchmark numbers from.

Longer hours than comps - no TOIL, it's seen as a right of passage rather than an issue. Excessive overtime is expected as you are client serving.

Additional expected work - a lot of the time you are expected to fulfil a lot of jobs outside your core competency as they don't pay support staff to do stuff like prepare pitches, handle billing, etc. But you are also expected to bill at least 40 hours a week. Add onto that, time spent coaching staff.

W/L balance - the additional hours crush this. I only know of one person who made partner after having children, and I don't know anyone who made partner and still managed to have an equal relationship with regards to childcare - every partner is the breadwinner and has a spouse working a significantly more flexible job (if they work). I saw people pushed off the partner track because they weren't doing the massive hours at the drop of a hat.

Add onto that, that a lot of the time, the partnership agreement has changed to favour the older partners (e.g. old PwC partners have a retirement plan where they get $140k, but they pulled the ladder up and don't offer that deed to new partners), and there really is little incentive to become a partners",1698796955.0

I will be interested in finding out who’s the one to blame, what can you do about it. I want to help you because I could feel accomplished I can change something, I can be important for you. If you start getting indecisive and I feel you won’t do what I’m telling you to do, I feel frustrated because now I’m invested but you dismissed my help. I don’t care anymore. 

So for them to be interested and wanting to help it must be something they feel they can change, they can talk someone into doing something, they can change someone’s mind and therefore they are somehow important.",1698796955.0

"formula1","t5_2qimj","Judging them by their progression into F1 is a stupid bar. Teams like Haas, Alfa Romeo and AlphaTauri that traditionally would be very willing to take a  punt on a rookie, have chosen for experience and retained drivers in the past few years with drivers like Hulkenberg, Bottas and Ricciardo who are arguably over their peak. Where a few years ago there was a big trend of bringing in highly promising young talent to have them for years, the teams are now in general moving much more to proven and experienced drivers. The fact that even someone like Lawson can't get onto the grid despite a strong showing in his other competitions and a stellar debute in F1, shows that it's nothing to do with the rookies and everything to do with the general trend of retaining drivers right now.",1698796955.0

"KiaNiro","t5_3ml4b","My 2023 Niro just got a new transmission a month or so ago.  Only had about 15k miles. Luckily it was under warranty. 

Started similar to what you described (noise on accel/decel) and I thought the same thing (Regen brake issue).  

My noise was going on for about a month.  Steadily got worse.  When I took it in, they said it was safe to drive while they waited on new transmission to arrive.  I noticed the ""slip"" for the first time the very next day.  The slip steadily got worse throughout the next few days.  On day 3 after the slip started, I noticed a pretty loud ""knock"" on decel.  Part came in that day and it got fixed immediately.  But I doubt it would have lasted more than a few more days at that point. 

Moral of the story. You're probably good for now but it will get steadily worse and once it hits a certain point it's likely to fail. I know little about cars so I don't know if driving it until failure will damage other systems but I wouldn't risk it if it were me.",1698796956.0

Not needing to worry about some road rage incident turning into a gun incident, random shootings, my son doing active shooter drills, a simple case of bronchitis or other trivial illness being a financial setback, overpriced medical care for generally substandard results, medical insurance companies, rationing medicine, insane student loan debt, a war on poor people, general lack of good public transportation for most of the country and the reliance on constant long distance driving, the politics and more.

"nrl","t5_2qn90","Again, the QLD team skewed origin success far too much for people. NSW team is nowhere near as good as what people make them out to be, I mean just look at the final 4 teams and their origin eligibility. Grant, Munster, Coates, Carrigan, Walsh, Cobbo, Flegler and at a large stretch Welch. NSW: Cleary, To’o, Critta, Yeo, Haas, Martin and at a stretch now Luai. QLD are really great at stretching the underdog status out, but if these current teams or close to them duke it out 1 series win and 1 series loss for another 10 years, that would still be successful for both sides. Origin isnt meant to he dominated like the 2000’s and 10’s. It seems your definition basically hampers every NSW player of this generation, Haas cant be great because he wont dominate origin, To’o cant be great etc. etc. Joey played against 0 immortals for basically his whole rep career, had a much stronger side with Fittler, Bedsy, etc. etc. and basically broke even, and he’s your number 1. 

You and the QLD media may think that 2020 loss was the most embarrassing, thats your prerogative, but personally I have the snapping of the 8 straight as worse. Loosely remembering your lists it had top 1 in Fullbacks (maybe Slater was 2), top 1 in dummy half and centre, Justin Hodges I assume made your list, CP13 and Thaiday made it I assume, and had 3 of the 4 players ahead of Cleary (JT, Cronk and DCE). I dont think that 2020 NSW team had a single top 4 player in it, whilst going up against Munster, Papa, and DCE, who I assume polled high. The talent gap for the 2 sides across both series is heavily swung in QLD’s favour, both teams should have won, but only one of them had a god squad. At least 2020 lost to a top 4 half and top 5ish 5/8 all time, JT, Smith and co got towelled up by Josh Reynolds and Trent Hodkinson.",1698796956.0

And giving someone the means to cheat, as you put it, is not really the issue. If someone isn’t a cheater, the seducer can try all they want, but it isn’t gonna happen.

Não precisa ser gentil. 

Sobre as minhas responsabilidades a respeito do que houve eu sei quais são:
Eu deveria ter sido honesto e terminado com ela quando perdi a confiança, e tenho plena consciência de que agi mal. 
Entendo que nos últimos meses estive com ela por um grande egoísmo da minha parte, de querer apenas transar. 

O fato de eu ter agido mal não significa que ela foi uma santa durante o relacionamento, ela me causou um grande desgaste emocional durante muito tempo. 
Diversas atitudes dela eram injustificadas e desproporcionais, e machucaram muito, e não, eu nunca a agredi e nem gritei com ela, por mais que suas ações me machucassem eu todas as vezes sentava pacientemente e conversava.

Entendo que uma traição machuca demais, e não pretendo fazer de novo.
Vejo esse relacionamento como um aprendizado, nunca estive tanto tempo com alguém antes, e nunca tive que dar fim a um relacionamento. Meu outro relacionamento durou um ano e quem terminou foi a minha ex, não porque agi mal com ela, mas porque ela queria ter um relacionamento aberto e eu não. 

Agora entendo que manter um relacionamento por pura comodidade não traz nada de positivo.

Mas enfim, pode acusar minhas red flags, sabendo quais sao, posso melhorar e não cometer o mesmo erro novamente.",1698796957.0

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","If you paid like $700 for your 1080ti in 2017 (IIRC that's about what I paid for mine) that's like less than $10 a month for a really good gaming experience. If you played games an average of 2 hours a day, 3 days a week (which is a super low estimate for most people on this sub) that's like $0.38/hr. If you played more than that, the cost per hour goes down exponentially. And that's not even including other stuff your GPU does like workstation rendering, stable diffusion, photo/video editing, streaming, video transcoding... the list goes on. There's almost nothing else I can think of that would provide as much value per dollar for that long.

Yeah, GPUs are an expensive upfront cost, but what else are you going to spend that money on that's going to give you better value over time if you enjoy gaming or other GPU-related tasks?",1698796958.0

"LetsNotMeetFR","t5_3bgw1","Je vais te donner un avis probablement subjectif, mais je n’ai pas l’impression que tu as réellement vécu ce que tu décris, j’ai plutôt l’impression qu’il y a des brides de clichés de threads horreurs qu’on peut trouver sur YouTube, rendant le tout assez incohérent dans la situation que tu décris. Par exemple pourquoi regarder par la caméra de son téléphone c’est perdre un temps précieux (a priori si tu venais de descendre du bus il ne devait pas être très loin il aurait parfaitement pu te rattraper) et surtout tu ne te voulais pas discret car tu as couru juste après. Cette situation me rappelle d’ailleurs très fortement un thread horreur de squeezie, avec la technique du téléphone, mais l’homme en question se cachait, le tiens était visiblement en pleine rue à la limite de te poursuivre. 
Je suis assez septique par rapport à cette partie de l’histoire, si c’est une histoire inventée, je t’invite à bien étudier la cohérence de tes propos. 
Si tu ne l’as pas inventé, c’est étrange, tu as peut-être voulu faire dans l’exagération et ça casse la cohérence du récit. 
Sinon une deuxième point que je voudrais soulever est ta narration, tu écris l’histoire comme si tu parlais avec un ami, c’est difficile de rentrer dedans et je trouve ça bien dommage

Weapons lack this. You have to know which tiers are already attached. But the game does not even offer the functionality to check what is attached, there is no HasMod function. So you have to make educated guesses, and keep track yourself. In addition you have to track up to 4 separate mods, because the mods are intended to stack. But you can only stack mods intended for that weapon and only one of each. Accidentally duplicate one and you've broken the game balance. Forget one or attach one for a different weapon, you hurt game balance... The entire system is broken from the ground up.

I'm not saying that getting the season pass, or spending cash to get newly released cards makes the game P2W by any means, but by spending money you are usually buying an advantage because those newer cards are often rather good, even meta defining as we have seen recently. If you want to risk that cash/game currency for that temporary advantage, that's on you, but we all know it'll get adjusted if it was too hot out the gate. 

Nico is the perfect example, with you all the way there, I think she's balanced perfectly. Decks won't rely on her, but she provides a big boost in places and is pretty unique with her mechanic. I doubt she'll get touched for a long while unless crazy shenanigans go awry with her.",1698796960.0

"PersonalFinanceNZ","t5_38zrx","In my mind it depends on how close to reality your example is. If the deposits really are 40% and 20% with a 200k gap then you probably want to account for gains on the deposits, but if the deposits are actually within 50k of each other then it’s an overly complicated model for the value returned. 

Having said that, I get the feeling you’re overthinking it and I reckon you should apply a model that gives you maximum flexibility in terms of contributions over time - deposits plus repayments (including interest). What if one of you wins lotto? Or one of you looses their job and has a spell when they can’t contribute?

The maths isn’t actually very difficult, you just need to think about it in terms of total inputs over the term, calculated when you sell. You simply get your inputs back and then split the capital gains in line with the ratio of total contribution (deposit + repayments including interest). 

So if you buy for $1m and sell for $1.6, and person one has made total contributions of 600k (400 deposit and 200 repayments) and person two has made contributions of 400k (200 deposit and 200 repayments) then person one gets 960k (600 + 60% of the 600 capital gains) and person two get 640k (400 + 40% of the 600 capital gains).",1698796960.0

She manages the gym while the kids are in school during the day, picked them up from school at 3 and then goes back to the gym at 6:30 to teach one night fitness class. So it’s her full time job but she essentially works a split shift.

I've worked for the company on and off for many years, so I know the customer base and how they feel about the product beyond my own experience.  I've used the product for years myself.  It's a fine balance on the internet when any association with a product assumes you're a lying huckster!    So I disclosed and encourage people to do their own research.  I talked to a customer today, actually called him because he ordered 12 heaters and I found that odd.  He told me he had several already and liked them and found more uses for them.  It's a great solution, but I want to make sure my own bias, even based on experience, doesn't define me in some internet trolling sort of way.

Not everyone can appreciate the dryness of British comedy.  And if typical American comedies of today tend to aim for broad laughs and their target audiences gobble that up, this isn’t going to be their cup of tea, so to speak. 

I feel, and this isn’t just my opinion, It’s misrepresenting the tone of Ghosts as we know it.

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","It's absolutely a thing. There is a significant amount of human trafficking in my state. We are home to the busiest airport in the world. People may not necessarily be trafficked from Georgia, but people who are trafficked from other places may come here before being sent elsewhere.

Every now and then there will be a news story about another human trafficking ring in the state that got busted.

That being said, it's far from a ""daily encounter,"" especially if you live far away from the city.

Like other people said, traffickers usually not targeting middle-class or upper-class people. They target vulnerable people, like teenage runaways who don't generate news attention when they go missing. 

You are probably more likely to encounter a victim of trafficking on the streets than be a target of a trafficker. But always stay safe and alert, and if you see suspicious activity, many states have their own human trafficking hotlines to report suspected human trafficking.",1698796961.0

"walkaway","t5_3l2gt","In the last 40 years, we haven't seen Israel shoot first; Hamas (almost annually) runs another set of missile attacks, and Israel shoots back. But no one wants to criticize Hamas for initiating the attacks, for violating cease fires yet again.

The UN established Israel. The allied forces bought the land (at fair market value of the time) and then paid for the Palestinians to migrate to Arab nations around the area. Allied forces negotiated for the Palestinians to become citizens of those nations (agreements the Arab nations failed to follow through on) The Palestinians then returned to Israel, demanding the land back. The Arabs then started a war (that they lost) and the mess continued to escalate.

The 2 party state was originally the demand of the Palestinians. When they got it, they decided.that wasn't good enough. As we go back through the various cease fire agreements dating back to the 70s (and earlier) the Israelis have tried to appease the Palestinians, only to have the Palestinians later break the agreement with attacks.


As for war crimes, your first link lists the Palestinian war crimes first, and goes on to show how when the accusations against the Israelis has any merit, its usually because Hamas (as it has for over 40 years) uses human shields; puts missile launchers in hospitals and schools; even the US military shoots at such targets. Out of all the wars I've seen or fought in, Israel isn't doing anything that isn't ""normal"" on a battlefield. But Hamas raping, murdering infants, torturing? Most the rest of the world agrees that conduct shouldn't be allowed, even in war.

So no, its not ""both sides bad"". One side are terrorists. They aren't official military of a lawful govt. They don't abide by any of the treaties, conventions or rules of war. Sadly, the only way to get them to stop is absolute conquest, unfortunately. Hamas is the same as ISIS, and just like ISIS, if any are left, they'll just reform and strike again.

The only way to stop monsters is to send monsters to defeat them.",1698796963.0

I committed to develop an actual edible and plausible decomposed cheesecake recipe and only recently completed it lol it would be slightly savoury because of the chosen cheese, though.

Like the only way to do that would be to occupancy all of Gaza..... And I don't think you want that as a solution..... 

I agree that the settler advances into the WEST BANK are wrong, and international attention and weight should be there... But ... Checks notes... The current conflict is in Gaza, which does not have settler advances...

Why do you keep putting words in my mouth?

That is not at all what Zionism is. Zionism is the belief that Israel should exist, it does not imply that Palestine should not exist. There are far right Zionists, socialist Zionists, relegious Zionists, secular Zionists, etc. Zionism just means that Israel should exist and anti Zionism is that Israel should not exist. 

>If you consider Zionism to be an existential fight, then many won’t support it and you lose.

3 issues with this

1) Israel currently does not and has never relied on outside support for the survival of its state. Israel has only fought 2 of its earliest wars which could have ended it as a state and for netheir war did outside support determine the outcome for etheir side.

2) Israel has a military that is far surperior to any enemy in the region

3) As a last resort Israel has nuclear weopons. Nuclear weopons cannot be countered. Even the US will never touch North Korea for this reason.",1698796964.0

All this did was enable my behaviour. And over time, it did bother him, until he withdrew and was completely unwilling to try to understand how his behaviors affected mine. And that it wasn't 100% my fault. 

My point being, this doesn't work. The other person needs to have strong, healthy boundaries, which isn't the same as being persuaded to love it, or being comfortable with the constant cycles. They need the capacity to say no, or point out the behaviours. At least, this is what I'm learning is important if I want a healthy relationship.",1698796965.0

But I'm hoping for the Apothecary and the Plenty to do something totally destructive and the Valtay have to abandon the crawl. Carl and Donut have to navigate the remaining dungeon with just the AI running everything.

And Carl isn't the one who makes it. Donut outlives him. The last book, or maybe just last chapter is her emerging from the Dungeon. Everyone here keeps saying they don't know how long Donut makes it... I'm thinking she goes all the way.

If you in any way end up in the pack then it's a bunch of collisions and pushes and racing with people that don't know what they're doing or don't raise clean combine with latency and poor net code and you're in a mess that won't be as enjoyable.

The paper I pointed to is about relatively nascent research technology, with none of the optimization that arises with a real commercial interest, and already Honda claims a 3% fuel consumption reduction in an actual engine, already not far from my bottom estimate of 5%

That 20% of the Carnot cycle efficiency you are holding on to is with existing TEG technology, not specifically developed and optimized technology for this application. As the paper itself mentions, much higher efficiencies could be achieved with purpose-designed TEG arrangements. And, as I already said, Honda already claims a 3% fuel consumption reduction, not far from my bottom estimate of 5%.

And of course, with relatively minor mechanical complexity you could switch to Rankine Cycle generators (as the paper also mentions), with total real world efficiencies that can exceed 40%. That is, with the assumed 50% efficient engine a whooping extra 20%, so that puts the upper limit I placed of 10% as a very conservative one.

Make it a Rankine-TEG arrangement, and now we are talking of an upper limit on the order of 30%. This should not be surprising as these types of arrangements in combined cycle power plants can add an extra 30% to the efficiency of the plant. 

Add to all of that, that for this application you only need a as little as a 100hp engine, and the advantage of the parallel hybrid (with their 150hp++ engines) seems even further away.",1698796969.0

La idea en si no importa. Si vos querés hacer no se, una blockchain basada en pares raros de zapatillas Nike, y alguien viene y te dice ""que idea de mierda"", da igual.

Él entiende perfectamente que el mensaje no importa y nunca importo, es mucho más valioso gastar en marketing y generar ""imagen positiva"". No importa entregar un buen producto, lo que importa es valorizar el stock. 

Después, los que lo bailaron sabroso a Larreta fueron las consultoras de imagen, publicidad, etc. Que le cobraron millones de dólares haciéndole creer que podía ganar, pero bueno.. es un estafador estafado, es irónico y hasta divertido.

Ferdinand Foch famously denounced the treaty as being nothing but a ""twenty year armistice"" for this reason, and he was right.

In the aftermath of WW2 Germany was completely occupied and split into pieces. Germany was not allowed to exist for another fourty years, and for that period it was a pair of puppet states with massive foreign military presence. German education was rewritten by foreigners to be anti-militarist. The senior German generals and politicians of WW2 were not invited to sign the peace treaty and then left to enjoy senior government positions and preach revanchism until they died of old age; they were rounded up and hanged. It was the unrelenting harshness of the WW2 settlement that prevented Germany from ever raising a rifle in anger again.

1. Almost every single one of these positive comments are New Accounts to reddit. Usually done by marketers. 

2. Comments "" I felt like a single cell organism"" . How does anyone know this 'feeling', and the comparison reeks marketing by better U ?

3. They keep hounding me with texts. Why such aggressive salesmen ?

4. The vast majority are old comments. Surely,  if ketamine was that 'life changing', we'd see more. Right ?

5. I'm not seeing the same quick response after people pay, as when they are in discussions.  Almost like you pay, get ghosted until what ?  When ?

6. No office or person. Poor accountability for those with issues using the At Home approach. 

7. I've seen several people who lost their psychiatrists after using ketamine therapy, especially the 'At Home' outfits. Why would a doctor drop someone who is suicidal or on that ledge just for trying to get better ?  Are there negative interactions that aren't being disclosed by the ketamine providers ?

I'm glad I'm not jumping into this. More research is definitely needed. No matter who I choose as my provider. Too many suspicious things going on here ??",1698796969.0

Christianity also uses scare tactics which is stupid. if you could just prove it, why scare some people into believing it?

My point is that there is no reason for people to follow belief system that doesnt make sense and that is unprovable, if they can instead just use other belief systems that are way more effective, logical and real.

If god wanted us to know or believe something, we would.

I am not judging christianity, I am just saying that there are massive logical flaws and no way to prove its real, in fact the flaws prove its false (or that god is acting like an illogical individual, which I find very hard to believe).

Also why confuse people with X religions that are all simmilar and each claims the same stuff (They are wrong, I am right, you go to hell if you choose them)? Its basically guess work if you want to find the truth. (God would be able to control that, wouldnt he)

If Extrav is a problem because it draws into floodgates, then floodgates are actually the problem and they should be hit.

Or do we only care to nerf the stun decks that don't benefit from the consistency of an extra deck? Because Naturia Beast and Barkion, Abyss Dweller, and Bagooska are all very real cards, to name a few.

Extrav is a problem because it's too much to ask that people have backrow removal?

It's a problem because a very specific deck, Labrynth, is hurting the MD money decks at the moment, and thus encourages the use of a counter (Red Reboot) that's too toxic for the game? That seems the most plausible because Konami did, in fact, limit Extrav, but to say that it was deserved is a bit sus.

So my salary grew by an average of \~15% per year (I averaged 3% raises all those years - the big jumps come from promotions).

Personally, before I went to college (at age 26), I made OK money but got tired of being laid off.  Which is why I went to college, as the engineers I was working with at the time weren't being laid off when the rest of us were.",1698796971.0

"CATHELP","t5_2ryza","Well. Let me try. 

A cat that elderly is going to be difficult to integrate with other animals. She's blind, so she has only her ears and nose to rely on. I'm sure your vet recommended trying feliway, but that doesn't stretch to an apartment building. 

She doesn't understand all the smells outside her door, and she can't see to confirm what they are. Blind animals map their surroundings mentally, so if smells or furniture configuration frequently changes, they get insecure; my beagle just trips over things and becomes prone to wolfing down his food. A blind cat I can see becoming overly defensive. She needs as much environmental stability as possible with touchstones to create a solid mental map and lots of places to hide that she knows very well how to access and find. 

She will react to upset and anger in the house as well, so if that's a factor, it needs to dial down. She needs to be secure with you as well - know she is safe. 

In absolute extremis, a vet can prescribe Xanax or similar. 

She will not do well rehomed at this age. It will be very hard to place her due to that and her blindness. Good luck.",1698796972.0

Zhonya's + any ability with a cast time will lead to some funky interactions. You can still get the instant Zhonya's, but for whatever reason, you need to get either lucky or really really spam the Zhonya's to get the effect early on. 

It has been like this always as far as I am aware? It sucks and I hope Riot would fix it, as it affects pretty much her all abilities..? (W and R at the very least, probably E too, perhaps Q?)

For now, the best solution is to always spam the Zhonya's and hope you get an early activation. Or, avoid the item altogether and build a stronger lead :p

"PlayStationPlus","t5_2u8bb","Wild how I got downvoted when Ive been the only one to actually give real genuine answers instead of the same hashed out ""cod, fortnight, or apex. If that's the case might as well download Roblox 💀😂😂 you'd like riders Republic, I'd suggest putting the mode on trickster for a more tony hawk feel, or the other one(forgot what it's called) for more of a skate/session/skater XL type of feel, if you ever played the game steep, it's pretty much that but hold more than just 4 people online. There's mass races which are hard but really fun. The game is NOT ALL ABOUT getting first but more or less just finishing the race, of course you get more points and level up faster if you get top 10 like I have. You can join clans, do trick battles, races or simply just explore the huge map and admire the scenery the game has. It gets a lot of hate now either because people suck at it, but the more of reality is they keep pumping out DLC that yes people have been asking for, but selling it for like $30 each, I'd suggest only getting the DLC you like more in real life, even though I skateboard in real life, I used to BMX so I got the BMX DLC and it was well worth it in my opinion. A more genuine answer would also be  baulders gate, or even tiny Tina's was an amazing game. It just got a bad rep because it was the same creators as borderlands but believe me when I say it is a completely different kind of game. Similar setup. Similar style I do like the graphics and tiny teen is a lot more. However, it's more of a gun and magic casting game rather than an apocalyptic style like borderlands. Every mission from start to finish in the campaign was phenomenal in my opinion. Very fun, alone or multiplayer the class set up and mixtures of two classes like making a spore warden You get a little mushroom minion that helps fight and also heal you pick you back up from going down. The only thing about that game is once you 100% it which is not really hard to do. Just kind of time consuming. That's the only time it'll get stale but other than that, it's a phenomenal game. No Man's sky is also a game that got a bad rep from start but believe me when I say that the game is a thousand times more better than what it was and has more content than ever and this hours of exploration and missions. Isonzo, definitely a great ""old school shooter"" more realistic everyone has a semi automatic and everything is one tap, the officer has a pistol but calls in the teams air strikes ECT. Hell let loose is more fun with friends as it's very frustrating and hard way bigger and better and more realistic than any call of duty or battlefield where killing someone feels like a reward in itself. As far as for honor, I literally just got into it last year and even though I am not going to lie, yes it is pretty competitive and hard. They make sure to put you in lobbies that are similar to your wins and losses, kills and deaths. Having a friend on that game too is very fun because they can teach you and train you how to use characters you are interested in. And also very rewarding when you kill someone, even if it's a bot that you've been struggling on like it gets to the point where if I go into bots now they are all level three and they're super hard sometimes even harder than the people in real life. But that's a glory of the game. It's always a learning curve. There's always a challenge and has a great campaign in my opinion. Some would disagree. Great! Weekly and monthly events as well as new characters still coming out. Even if you just hopped on it and played bots with real people on your team which is very popular, it's really fun.",1698796972.0

New owners as a good will gesture/positive publicity give people flight credits (which expire at a certain date) instead of $0.

"cycling","t5_2qhyi","The info is from what Selle Italia calls a ""Biomechanical Reference Point"" which is where the saddle is 70mm wide.  You can read more here (https://www.idmatch.cc/en/blog/saddle-adjustment-the-brp).

In my experience, my fitter placed a jig with a 70mm opening over the saddle and moved it rearward until it stopped.  Once it was there and vertical he measured it's location to ensure it's the same between saddles.

I think 70mm is the sweet spot for measuring because different saddle lengths.  For example, your Selle Italia is 248mm long while your Bontrager Arvada Comp (I assume, it's what came with my '21 SL6) is 270mm.  If you're measuring from the stem to the nose of the saddle the new saddle would be 22mm (give or take) closer.

"PS4","t5_2rrlp","I got my PS4 Pro in 2017 when my PS4 died. I got the PS4 as a Christmas present in 2014. I'm not a pro gamer either, but being a person who has worked in the computer field and have worked a lot of different types of computer systems & a computer science major, load up/boot up times when it comes to console games isn't a thought to me, die to working on systems that are much faster than the PS4/PS5, so it's just not an issue. Even if I was a pro gamer, with my background it still would not be an issue.

As far as graphics go, I could tell a difference between the PS4 & PS4 Pro due to the TV I have. When I had my PS4 & the beginning of my PS4 Pro,  I had a 32 in Vizio HD TV that output to 1080P. That TV died and I was able to buy a 40 in Vizio 4K that was on sale. When seeing PS5 gameplay videos online, I'm not too happy with the graphics because there a bit of ""not looking real"" to me. Maybe it's because I look at things a bit differently than others. 

But I agree with many of the commenters that the PS4 Pro isn't a bad jumping-in point to get a Playstation. You can wait to get a PS5. It's all about you enjoying your gameplay. And just because something is fast doesn't make it necessarily better. The PS5 doesn't fix Internet lagging, ghetto problem is with the kind of Internet connection you have or use. So all that fast load time means nothing at all if there's glitching when playing a game online or vs another person with a slow Internet connection.",1698796974.0

Especially if it’s an isolated incident. It’s easy for others to judge based on your post, but this is real life. Not just some tv show or fake drama. Everyone is so quick to just say go no contact whenever something happens, instead of trying to work out the differences. He can still be attached to and love his family despite what happened. You can’t expect him to just forget his whole lifetime of family history as if they don’t exist. I think family counseling is a must. Not just for you and your husband, but for all parties involved. If you’re willing to give up your husband and the family the two of you have made together then keep going on the path you’re on.

"exchristian","t5_2r95q","I agree with you 100% regarding evangelical/fundamental religion. From what you have written, it sounds like your son has become a part of an extreme fundamentalist cult. As a mother of two grown children, and a person who has been hurt by evangelicals, my heart goes out to you. I can only imagine the grief you are feeling right now. No one has the right to do what was done to your family-I am so very sorry for what you are going through.

You have a story to tell-and there is definitely an appetite for it, if you can find the right platform. There are some bloggers and YouTubers online that are all about exposing the nasty sides of religion. They give people a place to tell their stories.  I'd be happy to send links of the ones I've followed if you are interested. 

It sounds like you raised a wonderful son, perhaps in time he will see what has happened to him, and want to restore his relationships with his family. Many times young people can get sucked into these religions, and they will think everything is great-they got what they wanted(the girl) but often it is too difficult to keep their resolve to stay in a rigid religion long term. Perhaps because he is young, he will in time reject these depressing and suppressing ideologies, and embrace a life of optimism, and freedom. 

I think I would try to keep showing as much love as possible to your son and his new wife. These hideous religions are all about man made rules and feeling superior because only they have ""the truth"". To help defeat that way of thinking, it requires unconditional love and acceptance.(not easy, I know) Although they claim to, these people promoting and evangelizing their beliefs know nothing about love and grace. It's ALL judgement ,self righteousness, and condemnation of others. I would keep celebrating and doing all those Christmas traditions that are important to you with the kids you still have around you. Make it as meaningful and full of love as you can, and invite your son and his wife to be a part of it. Let them know you still consider him (them) part of the family.  Even if they don't participate, at least they know they are loved, and missed.

"EtsySellers","t5_2wthr","Always respond to negative reviews. But know that the response is meant for future customers,not that particular one. So don't get snarky, don't point fingers. Reply professionally and friendly. What I do is type out what I want to reply, then I copy it into chat gpt and ask it to rewrite it for me in a friendly and professional tone. It always spits out gold. Gets my point across, but in a way that sounds professional to future customers.

Also... Remember that you can only reply once. If you don't like what you replied and delete it with the intent of reposting a reply, you won't be able to. So think about the reply. Sit on it. Reread it and make sure it's how you want the company to be represented before posting.",1698796976.0

"Spiderman","t5_2rw42","IF they are going FULL Marvel universe or at least not completely Spider-Man only for the next game. Which since the Wolverine game is supposed to take place in this universe as well might open the door to this.

Then a Iron Patriot/Golden Goblin hybrid type character would make sense for Osborn in that Game. With him getting a ""Thunderbolts"" type group to ""Apprehend"" Spider-Man (and possibly a few other characters) leading to Spider-Man to stop him. With Norman having a breakdown at the end and going full Green Goblin (basically an inverse with him going Golden Goblin to Green Goblin).

Then Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin shows up in Marvel's Spider-man 3 as the main villain. With towards the end Him being forced to use either an enhancement serum (Turning him into an Ultimate version type Green Goblin) or an unstable symbiote (Turning him into Red Goblin)",1698796976.0

It does have a bit of an indentation for lining it back up as well when you put it on. 

The top filter is also magnetic and sits in a grove, so it's easy to remove and clean. The bottom filter spans the whole case and slides out the front. The only bad part is putting it back in. The plastic frame is rigid but has some flex due to it's length so you have to take a moment to slide it back into place properly.",1698796976.0

I definitely think having kids older is the way to go, even older than early 20s if I’m being honest. From how I see it, you should hold off a kid till you’re past the time period of trying to establish your career. Having kids at any age is a mess, but it’s much easier to have a stable job and income, money saved up, and other things out of the way first before hand. I’ve also seen a good number of people around my current age now (23) who get married young at the end of college and after a year or so get bored and decide that having a kid is obviously the next chapter in their lives. And for some of them that may be true, but don’t have a kid just because you feel bored or aimless with the direction of your life. Don’t do that, both to yourself and to that child.",1698796977.0

"malelivingspace","t5_2v70p","Depends on the situation.

Coffee tables are better for conversations.  If you have two sofas facing each other, then you put the coffee table in the middle.  Everyone sits around the coffee table, and can put their drinks on it.  Pr you can use it for board games.  In general, it feels more natural for most people to converse across a table rather than like naked face-to-face.

Ottomans are better for watching TV.  Most of the time you do not need a work surface.  You'd rather lounge back and put your feet on something.  And you don't want a big vase or some other decor you might put on a coffee table blocking your view.

But these are just general guidelines.  You can always do either one you want.  Especially if you do not mind putting your feet on a table or are not grossed out by possibly putting your tray of food or a drink on an ottoman that someone else put their feet on. 

In general, coffee tables take up more space and visual weight in a room.  Which may be what you want, or not.  And even then, there are plenty if exceptions.  A glass/plexiglass coffee table takes up less visual space than a giant Turkish ottoman.",1698796977.0

I think in a world where Lily didn't end the friendship (which she had every right to do, maybe this is a world there was no confrontation moment and instead their friendship limped along to graduation) snape would probably still hang out with the death eaters and maybe do some work for them just not actually get the mark.

However, if your allies weaken something down to ~20 HP, a level 1 Sleep can instantly take them out with no save or attack roll. The same goes for groups of enemies that don't get instantly taken out by something like a Fireball. And the average roll for Sleep can go as high as 94.5 if you upcast it, so you can adjust your HP threshold if need be.

So Sleep **should** be thought of as a conditional 99% accurate instant kill you can drop while still concentrating on other spells. But it gets ignored because it's implementation isn't a straighforward ""You win"" button.",1698796978.0

Also, I haven't tested it recently but for a long time double stacking solar panels definitely worked. I think you had to make sure they were back to back, as in along the same seam of other blocks, but it was definitely a way to double up on solar charging without doubling the space taken up.

"SpidermanPS4","t5_3f1fs","Honestly I really miss all the gadgets. The 4 we got felt pretty lame except for dealing with nests late game, and then didn't feel very versatile in stealth scenarios. I miss being able to set up trip wires and have the occasional 1 shot web. Without it, it kinda feels like Peter and Miles are just hard mode and easy mode of stealth. I do understand it was to have a quick gadget wheel but I think it would have been cooler to have the full gadget wheel plus being able to assign your 4 favorites to a quick wheel",1698796979

"aromantic","t5_2ug7r","I'm not trying to dispute the therapist's conclusion, as I've never met you and know nothing about your struggles, but this raises a few questions for me. Did the therapist diagnose you with narcissistic personality disorder through the formal diagnostic process? If they merely suggested that you're a narcissist, then I wouldn't put as much weight on it. Also, did they suggest that your lack of romantic attraction is linked to your narcissistic personality? I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that your lack of romantic feelings is caused by your narcissistic personality. I don't really know if there's a link between the two. They're certainly not mutually exclusive.

In any case, best of luck to you! There's a lot of stigma around personality disorders. Society really needs to learn to be kinder, and to recognise that it isn't your fault.",1698796979

"memes","t5_2qjpg","Hello /u/gabrielhuber! **You need to read following message in full. We will NOT reply to modmail messages similar to “what is reason my post was removed?”** 

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
>/r/memes/about/rules
>
>r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

"HENRYfinance","t5_5dbzl7","I think 100k is good.  Always depends on where they want to go though.  HUGE difference as you know between in staate/out of state public vs private.  My attitude has been to pay for their college and a car (not new, used, pre-dinged) and then they are on their own.

We have approx 140k each for 2 kids (one just started college, one is in 9th grade). Daughter decided to go out of state which is expensive even at a public school.  Suddenly learned that she qualifies for in state due to my vet status... saves us 100k over 4 years! Went from having to continue contributing to having a significant projected excess.  Decided to stop contributing to my son's 529.  

I agree though, higher ed has become somewhat of a scam unless you go into certain fields.  Sort of want my son to go into aviation or some type of trade.",1698796979

More directly related to the original topic, there are products for pools that use ""copper / silver ionization"" to reduce the need for chlorine.  Also, most common algaecides are copper-based.  However copper is what really turns blonde and grey hair green, especially when used with chlorine.  So I use non-copper products.

On bleach, I use sodium hypochlorite, the most common bleaching agent.  Less common are bromine-based pool sanitization and peroxide-based.  There are also pool ""oxygen shocks"" based on chemicals like sodium monopersulfate.",1698796979

Disallowed question area: **Medical question.**

NoStupidQuestions doesn't allow medical questions. There's a danger that someone with a similar problem could see your question and follow the advice they find in it - even if you're not explicitly asking for advice - and that advice, *given by random strangers on the Internet*, could have disastrous consequences for them. 

**If you are in a medical emergency, contact emergency services (911, 999, 000, 112, etc depending on your country).**  

**Did you swallow something that might be poisonous?** You can [connect to Poison Control online](https://triage.webpoisoncontrol.org/#!/exclusions). Prefer to talk to a person? It's always OK to call Poison Control at **1-800-222-1222.**

Not an emergency? We *still* recommend you ask your doctor. But if you want to ask on Reddit, there are some options.

* /r/AskDocs, r/medical, and /r/DiagnoseMe answer medical questions (as long as you follow their rules).

* /r/AskDentists answers questions about dental problems.

* /r/AskVet answers medical questions for pets.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Ok, well you could read the writings of the “founding fathers” of conservatism like Edmund Burke, Thomas Hobbes and Joseph de Maistre and their belief that allowing the land workers to have the same voice and say )democracy) as the nobles was profane, the importance of knowing one’s place, the Jeremy superiority of the nobility, etc.  yojj in can read about how conservatism was created out of a belief that the problem wasn’t the feudal hierarchy. It that the wrong nobles must be m charge.  So they promoted free markets as the way to decide who the new nobles should be which allowed for some democracy for the people but still the majority of power and control In the hands of the new wealthy nobles.

You could read a book called “The Reactionary Mind” by Corey Robin, which provides a detailed look into the history of conservative “thought leaders” going all the way back to Thomas Hobbes.  This book uses actual writings from the figures I’ve listed above and more over the decades to make the case that conservatism is, and always has been, about preserving social hierarchies and defending the powerful.  It shows that conservative writer and defenders always tend to defend the idea of putting people in their “rightful place” and how some are more deserving than others.  The “deserving” are always the rich and powerful rulers who deserve all the control and say and the rest are meant to serve the top.

You also have the popular and influential Ayn Rand who regularly writes themes of knowing ones place, the glory and might of those at the top and the rest of us at the bottom should be happy to serve without question.

"BritishTV","t5_2rzot","A lot of soap actors are one trick ponies playing characters not too far from themselves so this limits their potential. When they do pop up in other things, it's often playing a character similar to their soap character.

I also think actors who have the skills for bigger things, get scooped up for those roles before they end up in soap, and those that do are quickly spotted and move on for bigger things before they become memorable for their soap roles.",1698796981.0

"PetPeeves","t5_2qynj","The problem you have, and the problem so many others in the replies have, is you think you’ve won the “argument” because people have told you you won the argument, not because you’ve actually researched anything yourself. What you’re really mad about is the fact someone isn’t doing the same thing you’re doing. Otherwise, why the need to prove something? 

Now, it’s certainly possible someone (your mom in this case) is actively trying to dispute your position on something, which in fairness, is wrong, too and maybe you’re the person on the defensive. In my experience though, especially on this topic, the way these conversations occur is me affirmatively stating I will not take the vaccine and will leave it at that, but the other person feels they have to convince me why I should and rope me into an argument about it. I don’t doubt that your moms position is likely wrong, not based on research but just a reasonable assumption, but I imagine people like your mom feel obligated to present their own “facts” as a way to go on the defensive of why they should do something they don’t agree with.  I may be wrong in assuming this but this is what I suspect based on my own experiences and observations of these debates.

For me, I leave it at I’m not going to put anything in my body I don’t want to, and no amount of argument will change that.",1698796981.0

I saw this meme about a year ago which involved Guts picking up a condom and saying it's for his magnum dong. It touched me spiritually. Since that moment, my life has never been truly the same. Sure, I still do lawn bowls on the weekends. I still attend work. But every second I spend away from Guts, is another second I could be spending WITH Guts. I tell my coworkers that the reason I run off to the toilets every 20 minutes is because I have a bad case of diarrhoea, but in reality I'm browsing for pictures of my chunky M&M to furiously masturbate to. I regret nothing, and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. But my friends and family are starting to get suspicious. I've used the same excuse every day for almost 2 years now. They're starting to annoy me. My life is starting to annoy me. I used to admire them, but now all they are to me are disgusting piles of shit stopping me from spending the rest of my life with Guts. My weekends consist of staring at a poster of Guts for 48 hours, then back to hell for another 5 days. I'm getting tired of everyone's bullshit. I need to find Him, so we can grow old and die together. I want to be cremated and my ashes to be mixed with His.

That might work (though I fear the strong players might just add more clank block and continue exploiting the pre-nerf card's incredible power. It would at least be a real cost; part of how the strongest players got to be the strongest was by being greedy, meaning that they currently hit max clank more than most people.).

>Make the trade off by giving the player a choice between suit-up and other permanent cards. For example suit-up might not work with silent runner giving the player a choice.

I'm pretty sure everyone would just pick suit up.

I'm really not sure how bad of a drawback this is. But if I had to guess, I'd say it isn't enough of a drawback for the original card. Speed is still a bit situational (though warden levels improve its usefulness), and jump boost is still and has always been very situational (though to be fair, when jump boost is good it's REALLY good.). Compared to the almost guaranteed power of Suit Up, I think most players would use Suit Up anyway.",1698796982.0

Interestingly, this goes even a step further and even crosses racial barriers (i.e., all men are “n***as” as opposed to women regardless of their racial background). Furthermore, you will often hear a black woman call a black man a n***a or n**ro, but you will never hear a black man call a black woman either of those (that is, of course, outside of a context in which he’s treating her like one of the bros).",1698796982.0

2. Frye is a lot more competent than she lets on, and Shiver is the exact opposite. Shiver may THINK she's an elegant tactician, but dialogue shows that she's actually impatient and stubborn, fitting the Stamper playstyle. Frye has a happy-go-lucky demeanor, but isn't afraid to bring out the big guns. You may not think she has the grace and know-how to wield the Stringer efficiently, but think again.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Actually, the story of Aladdin comes from a Syrian storyteller who relayed the story to a french translator in the 1700's, who had already finished translating all of the Arabian Nights and needed more stories. A lot of the most famous ""Arabian Nights"" stories (including the Sinbad adventures) are among these later additions. They were specifically written to appeal to Western audiences, and they did. 

The Syrian storyteller is presumed to have made the Aladdin story up, and some of the details of the Aladdin story are reflected in the biography of the storyteller, whose journals are preserved at the Vatican. 

All of that is based off memory, you can google ""Syrian Aladdin author"" and find more information about him.",1698796983.0

&#x200B;

You will run into the same issue other leaders have faced. Your voter base is split between right and far right ultimately fucking you the second you make a plant in the sand and pivot to the middle or the farther rights values and policies (such as re-iterating your stance on gay marriage and abortion or backing off of them as you are currently waffling on when asked) 

No matter which way you choose you will alienate the part of your fractured base that doesn't agree because the party you are running doesn't have consistent values (like you) and is loosely held together by fear mongering, corporate interests and and hate.

Kali Linux is a popular, live OS for pentesting. It's used by amateurs, professionals, and TV shows.  Kali is meant to be used ""live"" meaning it is to be put on a CD/USB stick and not keep it's changes logged. It is not meant to be a platform for daily use, i.e. to run steam or browse social media.
If you are looking for help for your drivers, head on over to [Kali Forums](https://forums.kali.org/) or their [IRC](https://www.kali.org/docs/community/kali-linux-irc-channel/). It's recommended to search their forums first!

If you are looking to use Kali as your main distro the answer is [**don't.**](https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux/) Head on over to r/findmeadistro to find something that more fits your needs.

If this thread was actually something about Kali that wasn't a support request or someone looking to switch to it, i.e. a news item, please message the mods and we'll approve it.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","At 21, you might consider stage instead of age. 21 is young. So, where are you in life? Are you in a 4-year college? Did you recently finish a two-year degree or tech certificate? Or did you start working right out of high school? What are your responsibilities like? Are you only responsible for yourself, or do you foot the bill for family members? Bills or rent or both? How does all of this affect the amount of time you spend with friends? Are there activities y'all could do together that would expose you to more women (not like that)? Things like kickball leagues or trivia nights? 

The CDC reports that the average age of losing one’s virginity, referring to penetrative intercourse, is 17.3 years for women and 17.0 years for men, according to 2011-2015 research data. However, about 1 in 3 men ages 18 to 24 years reported no sexual activity in the past year, according to a study using the General Social Survey. So, your peers may lose their virginity at 17 or 18, but then they seem to be taking a break. 

Should you hire someone? If you're asking, you're not comfortable enough to do it, in my opinion. My thought is to stop focusing on that ""goal"" and start meeting people you might have fun hanging out with. That's usually where the doin' it comes from. 👉🏻👌🏻 And have fun!",1698796984.0

I think the difference, if there is one, between religion and most of the other things you could argue for with this, is that religion seems to be tied to us in a more fundamental way. Not all cultures develop a form of astrology, but all peoples develop some kind of religion. Religion seems to come out of our evolutionary biology/psychology in a way that most things do not.

"GunAccessoriesForSale","t5_h4uwp","Paypal offers two different services.  Paypal Friends and Family (F&F) has zero fees, but offer no protections and makes the buyer vulnerable to scammers.  Paypal Goods and Services (G&S) charges an additional ~3% of the item price (actually 3.49% and $0.49 as of 2021), but provides the buyer insurance in case the seller dissapears without providing the item.  Paypal does prohibit [some specific items](https://web.archive.org/web/20180409201310/https://www.paypal.com/us/selfhelp/article/what-is-paypal%E2%80%99s-policy-on-transactions-that-involve-firearms-faq585) but has a ""catch all comment"" that may apply to others, so NO NOTES IN PAYPAL. As a general guideline, if a buyer wants to use Paypal G&S rather than F&F with an **established GAFS member**, it is expected that they will absorb the +3% fee for the increased protections that it provides them. [Here is a easy fee calculator](https://thefeecalculator.com/). If a seller specifies a F&F price, assume that is his ""to his pocket"" cost. However these terms are up for negotiation between the buyer and seller. It is recommended to pay via G&S and absorb the fee. If the seller mandates F&F, be wary of a scam and use a [Scam prevention method](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy).  Additionally, Paypal has deleted the account of several members due to using F&F for purchases.  Paypal considers this theft from them (you're stealing their fees), and a violation of their [ToS](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full). DO NOT put notes in F&F payments as it is evidence you may be violating PP ToS.

Wars are more than one thing at the same time. From the perspective of the communist Vietnamese, it *was* a war of foreign invasion. They're not wrong about that, from their point of view.

And if you want to go with they are in the same region, yes but on a same region to one meter to one another, the composition of the ground can drastically change, some lands are chimicaly infertile (pH too low or too high) one of the major problem with Israel and their inhabitants is this, like you say, they emigrated, but when you emigrate in a country you don't start yelling that this country is yours now. Plus the majority of Israelians are Europeans, I repeat Europeans in an Arabic country. And yes almost 50% of Jews in Israel are from middle east but 50% of Isralians aren't Jews. And honestly I've never heard anything very good in medias about Israel and I don't talk about Arabics news , I talk about news in France, on tv. We only hear that peoples who said are sorry for Palestinians who are under bombs are arrested because they are supposed to be with the Muslims Brother (idk if it is how their name is translated in English) .

The issue could also be related to your Bluetooth, onboard Bluetooth tends to not work as well as a good Bluetooth dongle as the PC case causes some interference. Also if your using a Bluetooth dongle it should be plugged into a usb 2.0 port rather than a usb 3.0 port.

"HonkaiStarRail","t5_4q5zoc","You can hit higher peaks with a double support hypercarry JY team, but in my experience, Topaz makes his team feel far more consistent and just more satisfying to play.

In hypercarry JY teams he is doing all the work, which means all his strengths and weaknesses are amplified. His aoes will be stronger, but still not as strong as a focused single target DPS, which means it will take long to clear the field of adds so LL can focus his damage. In double Elite floors it's very difficult to just focus down one at a time. 

With Topaz on the team she can cover that single target blind spot and speed up the fight to reach the important phase where LL can maximize his damage. LL having a slow FuA rate also isn't as big of a deal as people make it out to be, because Topaz can still push forward Numby very reliably regardless thanks to her ult, and LL will still being doing a lot of damage.

I too was under the impression that Topaz and JY wouldn't work well together, but after playing around with it for awhile I love it. I really doubt I'll go back to a double support team anytime soon, unless we get someone else that just has perfect synergy with JY.",1698796986.0

"LordofTheMysteries","t5_2idcvs","1300 or so chapters, won't feel like much, spend free time reading 10 or so chapters a day (you will end up reading more, you will stay up late reading) you will end up finishing it in a month which is great, (I find switching between different story's annoying, and hard to keep track of, so when I was reading this was a bonus), 

I know this seems like blasphemy but if your gonna read it either unlock each volume in its entirety when your up to it (on webnovel) or read on a different site. This is because having to wait to read the next chapter is gonna drive you nuts, and it will take literal years to finish it if you only read a chapter a day. 

Overall, I am a fast reader, yet it still took me around a month and a half to finish.

when reading, ***remember***, **everything** is significant, whether in meaning, symbolism, wordbuilding, or foreshadowing. (most of the time you will only figure out how later, and you ***will*** facepalm yourself for not noticing)

this novel has a lot of symbolism and deeper meaning in names, powers and history. 

(I know this is what alot of people say these things about their favorite novel, but there is a reason this novel is still our favorite well after reading it)

I recommend just starting to read it, even if it is just the first chapters. time will fly by, and if your enjoying the novel the length won't matter anyway.",1698796987.0

I’d personally mind less if it was done by a person who was more familiar with her hair texture, but since I can’t account for that, I’d just prefer that teachers leave it alone.

That said, if she had longer hair that was constantly hanging in her eyes and I just left it down, I’d imagine that would be frustrating for the teachers and my daughter. So I’d be much more understanding of them touching her hair in that situation.",1698796987.0

I guess the lens I see it through is mostly can you be emotionally attuned & present with baby a chunk of the time? Are you ARE (Accessible Responsive Engaged)? Warm, loving, caring? And not just the mom (insanity, we do need a lot of people, especially so can get a break so we can be attuned and present) but other loving adults, too. 

I love that my toddler has close relationships with grandparents, day care teachers, and my neighbors. I think people get it weirdly confused that you have to be with your baby 24/7 for them to be securely attached???

I have thought - we are lucky his temperament is chill and his little personality is funny, silly, and magnetic. He will fake laugh, cough, and sneeze after you and just has these silly little “party tricks” - I think stuff like this plays a big role in him getting a lot of positive feedback, not only from us but the bigger world around him, which of course impacts attachment related things (but are not attachment if I’m making sense).",1698796987.0

It's NOT medical abuse. I'm not doing it so he can ""just have fun"". It's not fidget toys instead of meds. Fidget toys give him something to play with so he can focus on and off meds.

I don't even understand:
>So basically this dr and mom is telling the kid he only gets to be able to function properly when it’s important to other people, but not full time for his own wellness. 

I'm teaching him ways to function when he's not medicated. It's actually harder to handle a kid with ADHD when unmedicated so if I was trying to medically abuse him I would have him on the highest meds all the time. 


I don't know why you assume I've done no research except his doctor. I wonder if you have because I'm not parroting what the doctor said or one web site. He's seen many therapists and counselors, I'm involved with his school, and actually I'm proud at how informed we are to best support our son.


And yeah his routines work for him, not doing it just for me. His routine for school every day is exactly the same. He picks out clothes the night prior, down to socks and underwear. He puts away his backpack and supplies in the same place at night so they're ready to grab in the morning. He puts on clothes, eats breakfast, brushes teeth, packs his backpack including his lunch and water bottle and puts on his shoes.

It would actually be so much easier for me to do these things for him because many times he forgets a step. This is for him to be able to function when unmedicated. He takes his pill in the morning but it takes a while to kick in and it wears out in the evening. So what should I do about that time he's unmedicated in the evening? 

Your whole rant was just ridiculous, which is why I didn't want to respond, and there's so much to address but I'll just leave it at what I said.

And while it was never proven a family member claimed that staff from certain agencies knew the boy was troubled and easily led as did the program coordinators and yet still thought it was a good idea to leave this kid in a position where he was clearly being led by the other youth.

That is the reason why programme staff testified in court that before the stabbing the offender was clearly the follower however after the attack the pecking order had very much evened out.

With regards to the mother being a scumbag - just another reason to have this referendum and define if killing kids is indeed a principle of the treaty like the previous government seemed to think so.
Given half the national caucus is against abortion you would have to imagine killing innocent kids is probably frowned upon too...

Nem tűnik nagy dolognak, de én annyira hálás voltam, hogy férfi létére ilyen kis apró, női dolgokat sem felejtett el, mint pl a hajgumi, hajcsatt. 

Szeretem, amikor csak úgy meglep egy csokor virággal, vagy egy szál rózsával. Tudja, hogy imádom a vadvirágokat, így volt, amikor direkt olyat vett nekem.

Nemrég említettem, hogy szeretnék szedni terméseket és készíteni belőlük díszeket. Mikor elment egyedül túrázni, útközben szedett nekem tobozokat.

Van, hogy megemlítem, hogy mennyire megkívántam pl. egy édességet és másnap azzal állít haza.

"casualiama","t5_2sxwp",">Were you opposed to the US fight against Al-Qaeda or was that vigilante justice too?

I think you are getting confused about the analogy of the gunman and the actual situation. The analogy doesn't really work because in that scenario, hunting down and killing the bad guy is vigilante justice (a crime here in the US), but in the situation in Israel, it was a terrorist act and a declaration of war. Even though some actions are considered war crimes during war, countries do horrible things in the name of war often without any consequences. 

I'm not sure that the US handled the wars in response to 9/11 very well. A lot has come out that shows mistakes were made and how the US went to war against Iraq on a false pretence and how Bush misled the country about who was responsible. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan cost thousands of lives, trillions of dollars and the US mostly failed to achieve its goals in Afghanistan, leaving the Taliban in control and leaving behind many people who aided the US in Afghanistan. 

>Did you march in protest when 250,000 Iraqi and Afghani civilians died while US eliminated Al Qaeda? 

I do not march in protest. If others believe in doing that, I support their right to express their views in that way. I don't support innocent people being killed in wars by the US or any other country. Whenever possible, it should be prevented. 

>If you see it as different the only reasons could be: 1) you don’t think Hamas is as bad as Al-Qaeda 2) Iraqi and Afghani civilian lives are worth less then Palestinian civilian lives or 3) American lives are more valuable than Israeli lives.

Additionally, employer-sponsored health insurance didn't just come from corporations.

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","Piauí aqui, vamos à lista:

Bomba: um salgadinho estilo coxinha, mas a massa é um pouco diferente, menos densa. Normalmente é recheada de queijo, que fica bem derretido, e presunto cortado em cubinhos e costuma ser bem maior que coxinha.

Paçoca de carne de sol: não tem nada a ver com a paçoquinha de amendoim (olá, Pernambuco), é um acompanhamento feito com farofa e carne de sol desfiada ou moída. Não há nada melhor pra acompanhar um bom churrasco, se tiver um vinagrete e tão. Dá de mil a zero na salada de maionese. No Piauí quando se fala em paçoca ninguém pensa no doce. O doce nós chamamos de paçoquinha ou paçoca de amendoim.

Arroz Maria Isabel: esse eu sei que existe em outros estados, inclusive no sudeste, mas no Piauí fazemos com carne de sol tradicional daqui e não com charque ou carne seca. A carne de sol é um pouco menos seca, mais suculenta.

Creme de galinha: esse eu não sei se existe em outros estados, mas nunca vi ninguém de fora do Piauí que conheça. É obviamente salgado, feito com frango desfiado, milho, creme de leite e muitos temperos. Todas, eu digo TODAS, as festas de aniversário dos anos 90 tinham creme de galinha. Só de pensar já tô salivando. É coisa linda de deus e eu, que não moro mais no Piauí, morro de saudade.

Pão de queijo: mais uma coisa que tem o mesmo nome de algo famoso de outro estado mas não tem nada a ver. É um salgado com recheio de queijo. A massa é parecida com pão tipo brioche, quase doce, e o recheio normalmente se usa um queijo bem salgado e que derreta facilmente. O contraste faz a diferença e a maciez da massa é absurda de boa. Em alguns estado tem enroladinho de queijo que é parecido, mas a massa é diferente.

Bolo frito: mais um salgado, esse acho que tem em outros estados (se não me engano em minas chamam de Bolo Frito de Polvilho), acho que a única diferença no Piauí é o formato. Normalmente ele é trançado (em forma de tranças).

Com certeza tem muito mais coisas, mas como não moro mais no Piauí há quase 20 anos devo ter esquecido muita coisa boa de lá.",1698796990.0

"worldofgothic","t5_2u3ss","I went full jack of all trades (1H, crossbow, 4th circle magic). It was hard at the start, but fairly viable in the end since everyone is overpowered in the end.

You'll need 120LP for the magic circles and whatever else for mana. You'll finish the game at around level 56, so assume reaching level 45 before doing final game stuff. It sounds like you should have enough LP, but given how many non-combat LP sinks there are, and weapon mastery which is needed for advancing in your guild (you'll need at least 40% modified combat mastery in one of the two combat skill that define your guild), you'll be a bit starved for LP.

To pull this off, try not to spend any LP on strength or dexterity. At least not over 30. There are plenty of potions and foods that permaboost those stats, and unlike Gothic 2, you can freely use those permas at any time in Archolos. However, remember that Archolos doesn't have tablets that boost your weapon skills (there are books that provide, in total, less than 10% boost to each skill), so that's where you'll have to be careful about wasting LP. I'd recommend getting to 30% in your preferred skills, and using rings for the rest until late in the game.

Beyond that, the game is fairly balanced - there's an equal number of dex and strength weapons, 1H and 2H weapons, bows and crossbows, and you can go for your preferred weapon type since the very start. The only thing that's poorly balanced are the blunt vs bladed weapons, with blunt ones being more common in strength weapons (damage type is much more important in Archolos).",1698796990.0

I'm not gonna say to just copy paste my workout because we're all different. What I will say, you need to look up shit regarding mind muscle connection and time under tension. Vital concepts to look good and others explain it elsewhere. 

Essential lifts, squat, strict overhead press, and bench press. More controversially, deadlift. Squats definitely just go heavy, sets of 5 are good. With overhead press and bench press, you can productively use either hypertrophy principles of time under tension and mind muscle connection, or you can go heavy for sets of 5. For deadlifts, it's controversial but warming up to a set of 5 is most commonly advocated. 

As for the rest, principles of hypertrophy. Mind muscle connection and time under tension. Pick your own lifts, but I'll tell you the body parts you need to hit. 

Upper chest. Incline bench is common, so are cable movements. Any movement where your arms start far out and move closer together. Dumbell flys, peckdeck machine, and cable flys are common. 

Overhead press hit syour whole shoulder, but emphasizes front delt. Gotta hit side delts too. Dumbell lateral raises and lateral raises machines are common. Cable lateral raises are also common. 

Back: gotta do lat pulldown and some kind of rows. Seated rows, bent over rows, and machine rows are all common. Some people like dumbell rows. 

For legs, honestly squat is enough and people doing more than squat usually just get too sore and do less squats than they should.",1698796991.0

If it worked it would be part of a particular GUI is a  nonsensical argument. We aren't speculating about life on a distant star we are speculating about a 20 something year old feature that anyone with 2 mixed DPI monitors could test in 5 minutes. 

This is a standard rhetorical technique used by liars, hucksters, and internet weirdos everywhere. They assert if A then B, not B therefore not A without ever proving that if A then B is valid and fully disregarding the fact that we can measure A and assert it directly.

The actual relationship in this scenario is if A then maybe be. Not b therefore NOTHING

If X has a feature that allows one to scale monitors in mixed DPI scenarios MAYBE common GUIs for desktop environments would included it. The most common GUIs for GNOME and KDE do not include this feature ergo nothing.

""We will always struggle vs bigger teams"".

That’s funny.

Last 6 games vs Napoli: 3W, 2D, 1L
Last 6 games vs Juve: 2W, 3D, 1L
Last 6 games vs Lazio: 5W, 0D, 1L
Last 6 games vs Roma: 4W, 2D, 0L
Last 6 games vs Inter: 1W, 0D, 5L.

Extra: Last 5 vs Atalanta: 4W, 1D, 0L.

We are literally only weak to Inter. Our most recent meetings against Napoli and Juve were games we were the better team, decided by player mistakes that don’t define our strength against the big teams at all.

As for the CL, only player mistakes in front of goal (again) is the reason we didn’t beat Newcastle. Result vs Dortmund is positive despite a lacklustre performance (no one kept them scoreless at home at least in CL since City 2 seasons ago IIRC).

Last season we did badly v Chelsea, maybe they are another weakness we have. We beat Spurs. We beat Atletico season before that, were robbed vs Porto, were respectable vs Liverpool given they were at the top of their game then.

Game vs PSG was ass, but all teams have shit games occasionally. Even if we lose to them again, they’re the better team and we shouldn’t expect a win.

The disposal company _that should be subject matter experts_ would have to report it in the first instance. And if they _were_ experts they would know there wasn't actually anything to report. 

They couldn't do that without a warrant and they wouldn't get a warrant for that. 

Any lawyer would have a field day if the government just kicked the door in and ripped into the walls of one, _let alone two,_ properties. 

If this is true they were absolutely looking for a drug lab _not mercury_ and would've had a warrant to avoid legal issues, which according to you they successfully avoided. 

And if somehow a dumbass at the disposal company called the authorities and exaggerated how dangerous mercury is successfully, the authorities green lit tearing 2 houses apart based on that, expert advice was to go in blind and rip everything to shreds _when surface swabbing is how you find it_, then sure that's fucked. The sheer number of failure points and idiocy required to get there, just suggests you have it all wrong. Or are making up a yarn.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","nah man dont worry i play a lot of fighting games myself (didnt really play DBFZ after like season 1 though, didnt really like the direction and no rollback is basically no bueno for me) so i understand what you mean by that. The difference between online play and in person is fucking insane for fighting games and its such a wild west especially if we're talking international too. The prime example of this would be tekken 7 when koreans for the most part were generally the most competitive/best players in the world until the middleeast came into play with arslan ash and a ton of other unknown names dominating the charts. 


the closest i ever got to the top in a ""fighting game"" would prolly be multiversus though if that even counts. I got top 500 and managed to beat a few pro players from evo top 16 as well before the game shut down",1698796993.0

The Palestinian exodus of 1948 would NEVER have taken place if the Arabs of Palestine and the Arab League had accepted any of the previous proposals for peaceful coexistence, be it One State or Two States, including that of 1947, instead of going the way of the War of Extermination against the nascent Jewish state.",1698796994.0

"Interrail","t5_2rv8d","Replace some big cities with smaller, quieter ones. You’ll get less exhausted and visit more unique places. 

When it comes to European cities they are all similar to visit in that you go see 1) the main square, 2) main cathedral, 3) main museum, 4) walk by the river. 

However, if you’re planning to have cities as your base for visiting more rural areas, then it could work but make sure you have enough time.

My suggestions about my country:
- spend time in the Alps
- skip Milan and Naples for sure and spend more time in Rome. 
- Venice is surely unique but it’s too busy to enjoy. Organise a quick stop there and spend more time somewhere else. 
- Bolzano is a good spot for experiencing norther Italy
- if you decide to stay in Florence, it will be expensive and difficult to find a place (it is small and very popular - very beautiful though so it might be worth it!)
- 5 terre is on your way and more interesting than Monaco imo. If you want to save some, you can stay in La Spezia (not nice but from there you can visit all the small towns easily)

Whatever you do, don’t skip Prague, my absolute favourite 🤩",1698796994.0
