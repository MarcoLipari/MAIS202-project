It comes with MOTOBLUR  ( you can remove all the crazy widget and motoblur by rooting your phone) and the boot loader is locked ( but suppose to be unlock in july with a 2.3.2 update ). The Battery life on my part is OK , if you use your phone as a GPS make sure to buy the car charger because it drains the battery very very fast.


The camera is 5mp the quality is decent its not as good as other phones out there but still really nice, small tweaks and correction in photoshop sometimes is needed. 

I bought this [Skin](http://www.skinomi.com/motorola-atrix-4g-carbon-fiber-skin-protector.html) for my phone it's a techskin from skinomi it comes with the screen protector also. It's a manipulable skin that you apply on your phone that hardens around it, the shield on the screen is self healing. I did not want to buy these rubbery feeling it makes the phone thicker and also I am careful to not drop it on the ground.

The phone comes with 16gb internal memory you can also expend with micro SD card which is definitely a plus imo. The finger print scanner is really nice sometimes it can be annoying because it wont read if you scan to fast or short other than that it's a nice feature.","1309478413"

Eitherway the guy is clearly an inconsiderate asshole. He does not care about your feelings. He care's more about indulging his own righteous assholery than making you feel better when you're crying. This isn't marriage material. This isn't even one night stand material.

Throwing an ultimatum at him is a terrible idea. At best all that will do is convince him to pretend to be nice for a time, thus lengthening your misery. He shouldn't need to be threatened with divorce to treat you like a decent human being, let alone a loving partner.

 You're still young. Ditch him like a ton of bricks and fucking run.

Also now you know why it's a dumb idea to get married in your early 20s, cause it makes bailing out on shitty relationships like this that much harder. No relationship ever ended cause they were too happy together but they just didn't have the right marriage certificate, but plenty of people are kept in shitty relationships way past their sell by date because being married makes bailing out of a shitty relationship seem a lot worse than it actually is.","1309478440"

Although those same industrialized nations are mainstream atheist, they don't have a homosexual majority as they do an atheist majority.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Hey there,

I recommend this guide for modding:
http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3310676

I think it may be worth trying out some mods on your first playthrough. At the very least, a user interface mod is a great idea because the vanilla UI is awful.

I also don't like how vanilla Oblivion handles leveling, for a bunch of reasons.

1. Since the world levels up with you, you don't feel like you get stronger over time. I think that's pretty lame - why level when you don't get stronger relative to your environment?

2. If you don't level efficiently, you can get underpowered. To level efficiently you have to be aware of what skills you need to ""level"" on your way to leveling to get maximum attribute bonuses while not wasting potential levels for future bonuses. But I don't enjoy that process - I want to do things because I want to role play them, not so that my character remains viable. The other workaround for this is to choose useless skills as your major skills so that you can control when to level. That's no fun either; I want to start with higher levels in the skills I will actually use!

To get around these problems, I like having a mod that gives creatures a static level (OOO, Francescos) and that changes the leveling scheme so that I pick what I want to improve when I level, so that I can do whatever I feel like doing (Oblivion XP, gives you experience for lots of things you do, and you appropriate points when you level, Fallout style).

I also highly recommend Deadly Combat - it gives much more depth to the combat system and makes it a lot more fun. Consider other mods if they interest you!

Also, be sure to CAREFULLY read installation instructions for all mods or Oblivion will crash a lot. And that's frustrating.","1309478447"

I'm about 3.5 days clean now and I've heard that after a couple of weeks the smell of cigarettes starts to really become unpleasant to you. I'm going to give it three weeks and see if I care to start smoking again.

Anyways, I started smoking shortly after I started drinking. I was drunk, friends smoked, offered me one, I said fuck it and tried it. And I enjoyed it. So the next time I tried two. Then I bought my own pack and smoked it over a few parties. Then I smoked while sober. Then I smoked while sober again. Then finally I was buying three or four packs a week and had to admit that I officially qualified as a ""smoker"".

To be honest though, smokers get way too much flak for their habit. Lay off a bit haters.","1309478451"

&gt; Editorialisation of titles will be extremely frowned upon now. For example, ""Terrorist group bombs Iranian capital"" will be more preferable than ""Muslims bomb Iran! Why isn't the mainstream media reporting this?!"". Do try to keep your outrage confined to comment sections please.

framing the debate from the outset is good, but not in the title.

that aside, this is an interesting submission. i wonder if there has been a president and secretary of defence of the united states *not* involved in managing an existing war or launching another one. if war extends to the covert influencing/initiation/financing of foreign conflicts, then surely no president or secretary has had entirely clean hands, and any freedom/peace overtures will seem hollow. but if war is an extension of diplomacy (or was it the other way around), then it is a reality that a person in a position of power has to confront, and there is a possibility that someone fundamentally rational and peace-loving  (if such a person exists) will have to, in some circumstances, make some pretty tough decisions either extending an existing conflict or initiating another one. i would hope that this person has explored every possible avenue short of war/conflict, and i have no reason to believe either obama or gates, as seemingly rational people, have not done the same.

now on to gates. i know very little about him, but i remember hearing a speech of his to a conference some years ago and he seemed like a character out of a le carré novel, murky by virtue of his stint in the cia (and iran contra if i'm not mistaken) but also very straightforward, funny and seemingly decent. how decent is something difficult to know given his line of work, but he seems to command the respect and sympathy of a broad spectrum of people, which is surprising given how polarized the u.s. seems from the outside.","1309478459"

For one not every moon has been landed on and there is a fuckton of them, and i have no doubt that sending new probes will yield much more information.

I should try figure out how long a Jupiter-orbiter can look at different moons and how many moons it can get a good look at.

Another idea, could something like [IceCube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IceCube_Neutrino_Observatory), but with the km^3 s of ice right next to the vacuum of space instead on Earth with atmosphere yield information on cosmic rays? I suspect that the noise from the lower energy cosmic rays is terribly high relative to high end.(And you have to stop the regular light if you don't measure from very deep ice)

Radio measurements on signals from the moon due to high energy neutrinos causing charge to produce breamstahlung are also being proposed. Quite possible that stuff like this on other moons is interesting too.","1309478501"

simply put, if he's on the lease, he cant leave anymore than you can. you're both responsible for paying rent for each of the months outlined in the lease agreement. 

one thing you could try doing, as unethical as it might sound. would be to talk to the apartment managers and tryt o get yourself off the lease. do it without his knowledge and you'd leave him hanging by his balls.

you also try just being honest with them. see if maybe they'll agree to just go ahead and sue him for breach of contract rather than evict you if you cant make rent?

At the end of the meal, my friend comes over and hands me $40.  He said, ""David was our waiter, he did a great job, but the guys I'm eating with are British and they paid the bill, so I'm not sure whether they tipped or not.  Can you ask David and give this to him if they screwed him over?""  I said sure

Next time David wanders by, I flag him down and explain.  David says, ""Oh, no, he didn't have to do that, that's too nice of him.  I haven't even looked at the check yet, but I'm sure it's fine"".  I said, ""Okay, well, go look and if you feel like it was unfair, I'll be sitting right here, otherwise, I'll just give my friend back the money""

David goes over, looks at the check, stands there a minute and walks back over to my table.  He quietly says, ""Uh, I don't really know how to say this, but....well...the bill was $197....and they rounded up to $200""

Providing a basic salary would get rid of a huge bureaucratic overhead while at the same time making the rat race a little less intense. People wouldn't have to work as much in jobs that they hate and could give back more to society either by spending more time with their families, doing voluntary work or educating themselves in areas we right now don't value because there's no money in it.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","You misunderstand all three of those arguments.  For instance, this:

&gt;at best convinces people of a deistic god

Patently untrue, Aquinas' arguments demonstrate the existence of a God which is at all times sustaining and in intimate communion with all creation.

&gt;Whatever is ""outside"" space and time that began all of space in time is only a ""god"" insofar as it began the universe. You can't make any further assumptions about what it is.

Is not the case according to Aquinas, in the Five Ways alone he derives quite a bit more about God.  

&gt;And that's assuming the universe has a beginning. 

Aquinas' Cosmological argument does not predicate that the universe had a temporal beginning, it is fully compatible with an eternally extant universe.

&gt;And that's assuming you can convince the other person of the presupposition that ""everything that begins to exist must have a cause"".

Can you point to something that didn't?  

&gt;is simply an argument from ignorance. ""We don't know how something as complex as this universe could have come to exist without something guiding it, therefore God did it"". ""

That is absolutely and 100% not in any way Aquinas' teleological argument.  That seems like a caricature of Paley's teleological argument which is fundamentally incompatible with Thomistic metaphysics.  This is Aquinas' Fifth Way:

&gt;The fifth way is taken from the governance of the world. We see that things which lack intelligence, such as natural bodies, act for an end, and this is evident from their acting always, or nearly always, in the same way, so as to obtain the best result. Hence it is plain that not fortuitously, but designedly, do they achieve their end. Now whatever lacks intelligence cannot move towards an end, unless it be directed by some being endowed with knowledge and intelligence; as the arrow is shot to its mark by the archer. Therefore some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end; and this being we call God.

do you see how it's not what you describe?  The Ontological Argument and Aquinas' Five Ways are some of the most misunderstood arguments I've ever encountered.  There really is a lot more there than what commonly bandied about strawman versions would have you believe.  ","1309478517"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I got mine out a few years back. The main thing I remember immediately following the experience is being really woozy from the anesthesia. I felt like I could kinda function, but I was pretty wrong. Parents driving me home, decided to stop for jamba juice or something b/c they thought it might be good (and it was) but upon getting home I knocked it over b/c I just didn't have the hand/eye coordination to pick it up off of the kitchen table. So ya, watch out for stuff like that, it can be annoying when you first get home. Anyway, after that I think i went to take a nap and when I woke up it was all good.

The most important thing I can say is to make sure you are on top of keeping the sockets clean until they heal. It is quite important, and you wouldn't want to end up needing to have more crap done to your mouth b/c you didn't take proper care.

Honestly the pain wasn't bad at all, and I think a lot of people (maybe those with a super low threshold) over hype it. They gave me a big bottle of painkillers after the surgery, but I never felt the need for one (although tbh I'd much rather deal with a little pain than take pills for it, I'm much more afraid of the painkillers).","1309478520"

And even with the very limited number of subjects that have been in these studies, there were transpeople whose brain make-up fell well into the area of their birth sex, and not their gender.

**TL;DR:** Gender and ""brain sex"" are not the same thing, don't correlate perfectly.

Ok, let me try get this out properly.
&gt;    However, adding personal agendas to a topic where none are required is equally offensive and pisses me off, as it distorts the clarity of the message.
*I don't really understand this. We both posted our opinions. Is something different when I post mine compared to when you post yours?*

Yes, I posted an opinion based on the video, which contained her agenda (you can choose what that is for the sake of brevity.) You posted an opinion based on my comment, which added a moral angle which was not present in her agenda, thus inserting your own (being that killing for food is wrong.) I may be splitting hairs here, but I felt you took the original message and molded it unnecessarily to fit your worldview.

&gt;    Your arguments about chickens and carrots DO NOT stand, as they are not equal comparisons in the light you cast. Her comparison equalizes the two and does not attribute characteristics to them (like vertebrate vs. invertebrate) in order to make her point.
*Perhaps I'm misinterpreting her (although neither of us have access to her true meaning). I would be interested in knowing what you think she meant by that.*

I think she is breaking it down to the atomic level. Everything that *is* is nothing more than a collection of energy. When we consume, we transfer that energy as food into our body, regardless of the physical manifestation of said energy. In that sense, there is little difference in the energy value of what is consumed. I think she is being more ethereal rather than scientific, so biological differences don't apply.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My experience was very easy. I remember going in to the doctor's room, and sitting in the chair. After a quick explanation of what was going to happen, they asked if I was ready to get the IV inserted. Needle went in, and the nurse told me ""You're probably going to see the ceiling do some funny things, just keep your head back and relax.""
After about 6 seconds of nothing, I decided to see what the ceiling was doing and looked up. It went from being a normal flat ceiling to a morphing whirling wall of AWESOME. Then as soon as I went to say ""Yeah, it's working"" I was in the recovery room laughing my head off.
Apparently when the teeth were extracted, I asked the nurse if she thought my mom would like to keep them ""because she always liked that stuff when I was younger.""

Recovery took a few days for the swelling to subside a bit, and by the end of the week I was mostly back to normal. During that time, I built an insane fortress in Minecraft, because on the painkillers EVERYTHING was amazing.

tl;dr advice: Don't pick at the sockets, don't smoke, don't force yourself to do anything besides recover. Make sure to follow cleaning instructions that the doctor has. You'll probably be eating nothing but soft foods/liquids for a while, but it's not that bad. Just... try not to smoke or suck anything through a straw. That makes things bad.","1309478564"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;  People are not supposed to be omnibenevolent and omnipotent. God is.

I agree people are physically incapable of being omnipotent or omnibenevolent. But there's a huge gap between doing nothing and doing everything.

Besides, 1% our income is a far cry from being omnipotent or omnibenevolent.

Does it mean:
* It'll inconvenience us?
* Force us to make an effort?
* Take sacrifice on our part?

Yes but if you truly believe people are worth it, you'll take the time and energy to do it.

And have you considered that God decided to demonstrate His omnipotence and omnibenevolence through other people?

&gt; If God used something like 0.0001% of his infinite power (less than that), then all tragedy on Earth would cease.

There's a couple of points here:

1. If you have an issue with His method, I can certainly sympathize because I wish God would flex and just make things happen too. But you and I are not in a position to be able to see everything He does. There's things happening that we cannot see or understand.

2. What you call tragedy may not necessarily be all bad. Would you be the person you are without the hardships in your life? It's sad but hardship makes us better people. It refines our character.

In other cases, God says that He purposely takes the righteous away because they don't deserve to go through the punishment He's about to unleash on the wicked.","1309478572"

You may not be able to be romantically involved at the moment, but you could always be good friends (in the true sense of the word) and support each other.  Unconditional love isn't a romance-only thing.  My best friend and I love each other.  There hasn't been a romantic element to our relationship but we are close none-the-less.  Part of the reason I don't try to move things along is because I don't want such a relationship to distract her from doing the things she would do well to experience as part of growing up (she's 21, has taken the MCAT and is looking to get in to med-school).

Would I like to be in a more exclusive relationship with her?  Sure.  But I respect her and her life enough to let things play out naturally.  She's not going anywhere and I'm not going anywhere.  Regardless of what happens, we'll still be friends because that's the foundation we've built.

I guess what I'm saying is, you can still care about someone even if you can't be with them but you don't have to put your life on hold.  If you're content to wait, so be it.  If you can't, so be it.  But you are the one that has to make the call and take appropriate action.","1309478584"

The first one is not a claim or an assertion at all. It is merely the lack of a belief. The second one, however, is an assertion, and it is an assertion every bit as unprovable as the assertion that there is in fact a god (due to the fact that you can't prove a negative). 

Most atheists who have done a fair bit of thinking about the subject are not totally gnostic in their atheism. Even people like Richard Dawkins maintain at least a sliver of agnosticism about their beliefs, even while acknowledging that the possibility of the existence of a deity is incredibly small.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Nothing in this article asserted that nicotine was harder to quit than heroin, it said it was more addictive. That is based on the percentage of people that use once that later become addicted. Now it is very debatable on whether heroin or nicotine is harder to quit (they are the 2 always considered the most difficult). Heroin withdrawal is by far worse, like not even in the same universe as nicotine, but nicotine relapse is much more common than heroin. This is less due to the strength of the addiction but the availability and social acceptadness of nicotine. If you go out with friends, even if they know you are trying to quit, they will smoke in front of you and offer you a smoke. We don't tell smokers that are quitting to completely alter their social group to get rid of any smokers, we do that with heroin addicts. That means that triggers and cravings are much more common with nicotine use than heroin, couple this with the fact that relapsing on nicotine doesn't stand to destroy your life and relationships and it means that it is harder to stay quit from nicotine. 

I think trying to say which drugs are harder to quit is an assinine activity though, for the cocaine addict that has never used heroin, cocaine will always be harder to quit. It is perspective. Statistically speaking though, nicotine addiction has a higher relapse rate than heroin, so that is why it is commonly cited as being harder to quit. Now, nobody can argue that nicotine is a much more addictive substance than heroin, those numbers are quantifiable with scientific evidence to back it up.","1309478589"

Common descend with current apes was in serious trouble, as we discovered that humans have 23 chromosome pairs, while hominidae have 24 pairs. Which would have meant our ancestors are way more back, similar to pigs.

But clearly they don't choose the acceptable labels because they don't always feel it fits because their identity is coming from somewhere deeper than social formatting.

If their gender is not coming from the environment where is it coming from?

&gt; You are stuck in the heteronormative framework because you don't understand why people act against the social constructs that are put on them.

What is your explanation of why people rebel against the social models?

I am suggesting that they rebel for the same reasons people rebel against heterosexual norms. Because people are born that way. And further that there is a relationship between gender expression and orientation.

It applies quite well to Reddit.

Not every page will look the same every day, but sometimes they won't change as often as you'd like. So, posts like [Who wants to reduce the flagrant karma-whoring](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/icoif/who_wants_to_reduce_the_flagrant_karmawhoring_and/) and [If you look at r/politics, whine whine things will never change](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ic9uq/if_you_look_at_r_politics_today_youll_see_exactly/) will be as ever occurrent as the picture submissions you're peeved about now. 

If you're like me, the posts bitching about a trend are more annoying than the nuisance in question. The bottom line is this: if you start enforcing rules that **917** out of **566,584** readers concluded was a good idea, you're going to run off the other 99.9984%.","1309478631"

At some point I notice that 2 of my opponents both have an Academy Ruins on the board. We figure out that these must have been on the board for at least 3 turns, and the reason this took a while is because the guy that played the second one didn't put much effort into announcing it. To make matters worse, the previous 2 turns (which would be the 2 turns of the guys with the ruins) were both filled with very bomby plays and included them tapping out. Both players clearly had no other land in hand.

There was no judge there, so one of the organizers of the event eventually decided that both lands would be sent to the graveyard and that was that.

Was that correct? What would you have done?

But clearly they don't choose the acceptable labels because they don't always feel it fits because their identity is coming from somewhere deeper than social formatting.

If their gender is not coming from the environment where is it coming from?

&gt; You are stuck in the heteronormative framework because you don't understand why people act against the social constructs that are put on them.

What is your explanation of why people rebel against the social models?

I am suggesting that they rebel for the same reasons people rebel against heterosexual norms. Because people are born that way. And further that there is a relationship between gender expression and orientation.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I don't look to turn someone away from Christianity. But I do look to turn them away from bigotry, to help open their eyes in how their unthinking support of laws that strip rights away can bee seen as religious oppression. I will also argue for reason and against superstition. Faith, I have no problem with if it helps you. Try to teach children in public school that the Earth is only 6K old, I will challenge that. Deny homosexuals the right to marry because YOUR beliefs state it's a sin, I'll challenge that. Allow the organization supporting your religious beliefs to continue sheltering evil behavior, I have a problem with that. Minor foibles by individuals come with any organization. But when the ratio becomes disproportional (see Congress for another example of an institutional corruption unchecked), it needs to be addressed.

&gt;I do know God is real. Jesus is LORD. 

No you don't. You believe God is real, you hope God is real, you're going to act as if God is real. But you don't know. If you did, you wouldn't need faith. You have personal experience that you accept as evidence. I get that. But by that light, all believers ""know"" that their god exists.

&gt;I'm just making sure you know what you're doing is actually worse than a casual unbeliever. 

No it's not, because I'm not against the belief you have so much as against the institutions of money and power that have grown up out of those beliefs, and the bigotry that is a side dish that seems to grow in the dark corners. Your personal testimony of God isn't the issue. When you vote to keep ""In God We Trust"" on our money is. All citizens don't trust in god, and government shouldn't be at all involved in this concept.

&gt;You are partly responsible for every little evil thing someone does that you influence. We'll all see judgment someday. 

There is no way I can be responsible for anything someone else chooses to do. If there were, then aren't I also responsible for all the good things I've encouraged people to do by being a good example, by speaking out against the evils their pastor/priest/church is continuing to do?

&gt; Do you really want things more difficult on you for being responsible for other's sin? Jesus is the only one who gets you out of that.

If there is a God (I doubt it, but I could be wrong), and he's a just god, then I won't be punished at all for speaking out about the dangers, evils, and corruption in religious institutions any more than I will be punished for speaking out against these same problems in government.

&gt;Why do you want to wait til the last minute to accept him?

I won't be ""accepting"" him because there is no evidence he is any more of a god than am I. Accepting some of his teachings, sure. Jesus taught much that is worthwhile. Some is not. But I cannot ""accept him"" without believing the following:

1. God exists
2. God created the Universe
3. God has a plan for mankind
4. We are God's children
5. Jesus was the Son of God (sorry those who believe in the Trinity, that just cannot make sense to me!)
6. Becoming a Disciple is the only way to be ""saved""

I don't believe ANY of those things. I can't pretend, if God is real he would know I was lying and judge me worse for that. All I could do is say, ""I lived my life the best way I could figure out. If you wanted me to believe, perhaps you should have spoken up in a way I would accept. Or made it possible for me to 'just believe'. As it was, sorry, but there was far too much data to suggest that religions were man-made institutions and not godly institutions.""","1309478649"

"LosAngeles","t5_2qht0","&gt;Income tax above 350k, and Corporate Taxes are EXTREMELY low and are in dire need of being updated.

Income tax at that rate is 10% and goes up to 11% at over a million dollars. How is that EXTREMELY low? Probably on par with some of the highest State taxes in the country. 

As far as corporate taxes are concerned, I have a corporation and I have to pay 800 dollars a year in taxes even if I lose money. Most states don't have anything like that. 

And also, spending has increased in California. Even if you take state spending as a percentage of GDP, it's gone up another [2% of gdp](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/downchart_gs.php?year=1992_2015&amp;view=1&amp;expand=&amp;units=p&amp;log=linear&amp;fy=fy12&amp;chart=F0-state&amp;bar=1&amp;stack=1&amp;size=m&amp;title=&amp;state=CA&amp;color=c&amp;local=s) and that's looking at spending in the best possible light.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;The ""forced arbitration"" clause is in every rental agreement, sales contract, employment contract and service contract you sign. 

That doesn't make it right. Not to mention that the company is typically the one retaining the arbitration house. If an arbitration house decides too many cases in favor of the little guy, the company might take their business elsewhere. 

&gt;So the arbitration claim is included to keep the escalating cost of lawsuits out of the bottom line. If we weren't living in such a litigious society where a lawsuit against a company is seen as the ticket to wealth, maybe it wouldn't be there but we do and it is.

That is in no way, shape, or form my problem. 

&gt;Think about it, one jury that just happens to take the side of a persuasive lawyer and the company can go out of business. They have to protect themselves.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","My views, if you're curious, are that we're moving to a point in population and mobility where it doesn't make sense to have things like states.

Rather, we should just have smaller scale collectives of people that can determine their own social policies for themselves, only loosely confederated. I think that this would sort out many of the problems with effects not being felt by decision makers and much of the creation of perverse incentives (ie, creating incentives for 'bad' behavior). I, additionally, think that problems in replacing structures for say, building freeway systems would be outweighed by the benefits of decisions being local to those they impact.

Further, I think that we should encourage (and certainly enable!) the movement of people between collectives so that they can form groupings with similar social views and people are neither trapped in a place they don't wish to be nor coerced to participate in a system they find intolerable.

It's likely that we'd find many of these collectives operating in a generally socialist or even communist fashion - that's fine, perhaps even ideal, as cooperation has *always* been the best human strategy.

I do think, though, that it would solve the problem that many people in the US feel about not paying in to such systems, once they were able to observe what they did compared to ones forced to compete. I think it would also solve the problem of people not wanting to pay in to the society for benefits they enjoy: we can kick them out more easily for not wanting to participate.

The main point though: states on top of collectives are superfluous and harm people who don't wish to be included, ergo, we should switch over to a system of confederated collectives at a smaller scale.","1309478671"

Prostitution and drugs do no cause ghettos.  It's to opposite: Ghettos cause illegal activities.  That's why there is a correlation.

Illegal drugs, prostitution, and other black market activities are big money because there is little competition.

There are many guys who wouldn't mind spending some money for no strings sex.  There are also women who are willing to have sex for cash.  When you disillusion yourself, prostitution is just an exchange benefiting two parties.

The main basis behind the anti-prostitution side is that women who are desperate for money will be exploited.  This is just lingering chivalry.  It's just like how we don't put women into combat situations.  Our military exploits men, but that's fine.  Dangerous occupations exploit men, but that's fine.

I don't *like* being at war with other women, but there is this type of girl that must command all male attention around her and finds other girls a threat. I've been in this situation before where another girl was bitter and unwelcoming because another female appeared that might threaten her hold.

"Military","t5_2qh8y","as far as job opportunities once i got out i feel like i got a bit lucky. i used a military only headhunter that recruits for the oil and gas industry. i was in contact with them during my last deployment and they had a job pretty much waiting for me once i got out. my navy paycheck stopped and my new jobs started it was that easy. 

some bits of advice regarding that. what you work on will not directly relate really to any industry as the navy and other branches i assume dont want engineers or technicians, they take to long to train and move around. they have gone the way of automated test equipment for most I level facilities basically a very large very expensive piece of equipment that spits out a bad component ID after a battery of automated tests. you dont learn shit. as far as O level unless you are going to do contract work after you get out it is far too specialized. so i will say LEARN YOUR THEORY, the basics they will teach you about electricial/electronics. the NEETS modules they tell you to read. that shit is gold, it is basically EE course material summed up in navy document form. this will apply to all electrical fields of work.

once last tidbit, decide early which you are going to do, stay in or get out. dont flip flop and prepare everyday even your first toward that goal. the navy will on occasion brainwash you a bit with the patriotic stuff. boot camp will do this as you will see, everyone will leave saying they want to ""do 20years"" etc etc. the truth is if you know what you want you can be taking advantage of money that is there for you through you whole 4 years or more if you choose, there is tuition assistance(not your GI bill this is separate) for you to take classes 100% reimbursed. among other programs. also dont fall for the ""fiber optic tech etc etc certification schools that try to get you to touch your GI bill early they are a ripoff. as long as you qualify based on service once you get out the post 9/11 GI Bill is pretty much a 100% and then some free ride to college. take advantage of it. good luck.","1309478700"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Shoveling money to students via loans is what made tuition so high that you can't do that anymore

Goddamn this is the worst and most false talking point there is.

This is why tuition is going up at public institutions (i don't give a shit about private):

1. State funding for higher ed has decreased in all states - what this means is that the less the state subsidizes your tuition...the more you pay! You were **protected from the market value** of your education by taxes...but in every state people kept electing ""no more taxes"" and ""lower taxes"" politicians, so instead of paying an extra $20 out of each paycheck they're paying an extra 10,000 to send little Jenny/Johny to school. GG. 

2. Public institutions are generally research institutions. Research subsidizes pretty much everything on a campus - including tuition. This is how it works: scientist Jill writes a proposal and gets a grant for 80,000 for researching clams. The Uni scientist Jill works for takes a full **half of that in ""overhead""**. Congress keeps cutting funding to the NIH and the NSF and NASA...so they have less money to grant out for research...meaning scientist Jill can't get more money, meaning the Uni's income drops. 


So, you don't like paying $$ to go to school? Stop fucking voting for less taxes and goddamn pay your fair share.","1309478703"

The point is, if I run for president at the end of WWII in Germany, should I be comparing myself to Hitler and as my central slogan ""I won't kill Jews""?  It's not really salient because so will all my competitors.  Nobody is running against Bush.  People are running against Obama.  Comparing them to someone not even in the running is pointless.  It makes sense to say GOP candidate X will continue Bush's policies, but if and only if you say that Obama won't.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","I can't speak for Jeffrey Tucker, whom I greatly admire.  What I can say is that some of the brightest people you will ever meet have spent many years pondering the question of Christianity...  So, it's not necessarily the case that fine argument points and cleverness will take you one way or the other.

I myself believe that anarcho-capitalism is more coherent with Zen, Taoism, and the idea of emergent or meta-intelligence.  Oddly enough, I wrote about this on my own blog just a few hours ago...  not plugging anything, just saying... if you're interested in the idea of meta-intelligence vs. supra-intelligence w.r.t. the way we interact and order our societies, you might want to read my latest essay on http://www.nationcrafting.com

I would be fascinated to hear Jeffrey Tucker talk about this, but I have a hunch that it's a subject he just knows in another way, without having to put it into words.  It may not necessarily even be anything about catholicism, except that it gives 'form' to an awareness.  What I've read from Tucker in relation to catholicism is more to do with sacred music, which is in itself a form that transcends words and reason, which is why I'm thinking about this. If you've ever read Wittgenstein, you'll know what I'm talking about...

Perhaps it just doesn't matter.  He's a fantastic guy, there's no doubt about that, a real breath of fresh air...  and he writes great essays on Misesian thought.  The fruit of his labour is there for all to see.

&gt;For a moment her brain reeled with confusion. Then came a moment of blazing truth. ""No!"" she cried triumphantly. ""Like and equal are not the same thing at all!""

&gt;""Good girl, Meg!"" her father shouted at her.

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","&gt; Remember there was people posting up on facebook how proud they were of the carnage they had caused. These are not good people who get caught up in the moment. They're bad people who saw an opportunity to be bad.

Think about this for a moment. Those were mostly guys in their late teens early twenties, they were high, they were part of a large group, many of them probably posted this while still being engaged or shortly after that. The adrenaline buzz of things like this can last quite a bit. I haven't heard of people en-masse posting these things a day later, this all seems to have been posted either during the rioting or shortly thereafter.

&gt; There's two things that keep society lawful; extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation.
Those with extrinsic motivation would steal from you at the drop of a hat if they know they won't catch trouble for it. Those with intrinsic motivation will not steal from you because they know what you have doesn't belong to them, and stealing is wrong.

Yes, under normal circumstances where you act as an individual this is true. But the moment you get into a group that actually changes. 

Example: If someone screams for help in an area with a large crowd the probability of someone coming to his or her aid actually **reduces** with each additional person in the vicinity. Personal responsibility gets cast off towards other people along the lines of: ""Well, I don't need to act, there are so many others around if it really would be important they would act.""

The same holds true in reverse as well, as you are in the middle of a group of people you are (or feel) close too your personal responsibility diminishes, you subject yourself to the groups actions and go with it.

The Stanford Prison experiment is an excellent example of that where ""group anonymity"" and a wrong sense of empowerment lead to serious transgressions.

&gt; Extrinsic motivation comes in the form of laws or religion, intrinsic motivation to do the right thing is entirely different, and there are a hell of a lot of people who are solely driven to remain lawful through extrinsic motivation alone. Those people were the problem at the riots.

Only that this doesn't really work all that well. The US has capital punishment in many States and yet murders are still being committed which is pretty much true for any other country as well. Any criminologist will tell you that deterrent by punishment or law does not work. Why? Because the majority of people by and large is not interested in going against society, the handful that is willing to go against society will do so in the believe that they can get away with it and will do it anyway. So ""scaring"" someone to ""be good"" is not going to work.

Furthermore. The moment you are in a group of people that all think the same way you do (in this case RIOT!) they become the dominant arbiter of what is permissible and what isn't. Again, this is why it is important to remove people who cross the line as quickly as possible before the herd mentality sets in.

&gt; You can't help it; every society has it, but it's very weak to turn around and say that it was spontanaity that caused the riots. I'll bet the day before in high school Nathan Kotylak was talking about how he was going to riot downtown if the Canucks lost... Same with the rest of those tools too.

Unless you can prove that though you're just wildly guessing without any fact to back up that assertion. Criminologist and Sociologist have spent decades trying to figure out why we do what we do and how we can manipulate the outcome, they all don't agree with you or the majority of the Monday morning quarterbacks.

It may be a hard pill for you and others to swallow, but the people who crossed the line on that Wednesday were people like you and me. Just like the hundreds if not thousands who crossed the line again over the course of the next week when they decided that they required payback and had a right to live out their anger.

BTW, that so many people had no problem uttering threats, committing potential acts of criminal harassment and stalking tells you something about how well laws work as a deterrent.","1309478743"

And it should be an obvious point to anyone who understands basic economics or simply history, as you seem to.

&gt;If you take/read any basic economics you will see that in many cases, market failures occur because we cannot satisfy the needed conditions and thus regulations are in place to correct these.

You could say I took a few courses. Enough to know this isn't true or you aren't phrasing yourself correctly.

&gt;Also, since risk adverseness varies, some regulations try compensating for that.

Which by definition is a horrible idea.

&gt;And if you say that these problems could be dealt with w/o a gov

Any serious economist you speak too will tell you that most market-manipulating laws and regulations are done in the interests of producers, not consumers. It creates market problems, not the other way around.

It's really not - by this point in his life, he's so far away from orthodox phenomenology that it's only by virtue of his earlier work that he can be considered a phenomenologist. In fact, by the late 1920s, (I think - might have been early 30's) Husserl and Heidegger were trying to put together an anthology of phenomenological work but the project fell through because they couldn't even come to an agreement on what phenomenology was. By this point, (1950's) he's really doing ontology, specifically trying to answer the question 'what does it mean to be in relation to technology?'

A person who progresses (there's that word) to being world-centric or post-conventional, could be part of an open-minded religious group that would embrace tolerance and what we consider, perhaps, ""liberal"" values.

From any level of development a person can have experiences of emptiness, selflessness, etc, however, it is their level of development that will frame that experience for them.

"canada","t5_2qh68","Ok in simple terms The HST is a bad tax for working class citizens who buy things as consumers. THe HST is not revenue neutral but is in fact a massive tax grab by the government while at he same time they are giving a huge break to multinational corporations and businesses. This type of thinking is reflected in the ideology of the American Republican party Speaker of the house John Bonner recently spoke and said , 

“What some are suggesting is that we take this money from people who would invest in our economy and create jobs and give it to the government. The fact is you can’t tax the very people that we expect to invest in the economy and create jobs,”

This is exactly the same here with the BC Liberals and the implementation of the HST . It is a massive 2.8 billion dollar shift in tax collections from corporations to the consumers. 

I am fundamentally apposed to this mentality. These companies do not reinvest they hoard.

The only thing that improves the economy is when demand increases and if you tax the people too aggressively they have less money and demand drops and good working class people LOSE their jobs.

I am not all over the place , my logic is sound.","1309478764"

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","Back last summer. I acquired a bit of liquid dose we had been taking for some months and, with a friend of mine that was relatively inexperienced with psychedelics, took three doses. The night began alright and we listened to some Portugal. the Man during the come up, but somewhere between our sad excuse for a ""trip sitter"" bringing a girl home to fuck and  me trying to lead my friend down the path to a glowing experience. I myself managed to find myself gone in the throws of a mystifying experience. I was quite disoriented and  I broke the bong stumbling around, after this I was just hallucinating really hard. I followed my friend down a hallway as the walls looked like the caverns of time from WoW and he spoke to me calmly about the how slow, absolute, methodical, and endless the passage of time was. 

Anywho. The next thing I remember I am rising from the chair i sit in and running through what I perceive as an endless black expanse with information flowing on either side of me. Well I should have known the information I was surrounded by were walls because BAM. I run head straight into a wall after running down a long hallway. So essentially at full fucking sprint. Acid sprint, You know how that is. 

I collided with the wall and my astral self blasted off into the extremes of reality. I spun in a whirlwind of everything experiencing extreme heat and extreme cold. I felt the entire world come up my nose. and I became all. 

So the nose sensation was my nose being decimated by the wall. I broke it and when I came too  and got untripped out everything was all good. I went for a walked and chuckled about the insanity. And planned how I was going to fix the hole my friends wall before his dad got back from his vacation.

Needless to say I patched that shit and apologized a whole lot. His dad didn't notice so it was all good. And hell he didn't freak the hell out like me either so I figured he had an alright time. ","1309478766"
"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","I'm pretty sure that's wrong. If, during a round of priority, either a player uses his priority to put something new on the stack, or somehow a trigger goes off and puts something there, the current round of priority is abandoned. SBAs and triggers (if relevant) go off, then an entirely new round starts, starting with the active player.

So, as far as I know, if you're NOT the active player, you can't react to your own play. You only get to pull that stunt as active player.

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","Displacement is horseshit to be honest, this post and the guy I quoted was more talking about supersports. Guys coming in asking about Ninja ZX6Rs, GXRs, R6s, etc. The same goes doubley true for Ducati and Triumphs in my opinion. All these bikes I mentioned are nothing more than street legal track bikes.

Some 600s are fine to start out on, but in my opinion it's more about horsepower than displacement. I would suggest for a newbie to definitely stay less than (or at least NEAR) 65 horsepower. It's plenty fast for the power to weight ratio and you could still out accelerate 99% of cars on the road. 65hp is also fine to pull away from things in highway situations.

As far as the bikes you mentioned, SV650 is a good starter bike...the FZ6, not so much. The FZ6 has some pretty serious balls to it, I think they are pretty close to around 100 horsepower (+/- 5).

The **maximum** power bikes I would recommend (off the top of my head sports bike wise):

* sv650(s)
* gs500(f)
* 650r
* ninja 500r

"science","t5_mouw","Also, if the research is faulty, then it would succumb to added scrutiny.  Similarly, if the research holds water, then it will be confirmed by further research.

In other words, no single conclusion is automatically the ""new"" science.  It takes the consensus of many studies and various forms of research fact-checking each other to confirm or refute studies such as these.

Pres. Reagan once supported the funding of research that hoped to prove that abortions were more harmful to the mother than taking the babies to term.  But the science didn't survive such bias and proved that abortions significantly reduced the mothers' health risks instead.

The youth development system stinks. Mostly because good players play on teams whose goal is winning the immediate tournament. So the best 12-year-old, who may display all the skills of a center-back or DM, is made striker. Because next year, he'll be on a different team.

The goal is always immediate accomplishment, not long-term player development.

But your information is out of date when it comes to MLS academies. All MLS teams run academies -- it's a requirement of the league. And they have the incentive to do so because academy players can be signed without going through the draft.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt;I think the point of the story is that the changes to OpenGL are too little, too late.

If anything, the point of the story is just the opposite: you can always fix your mistakes and move on to a bright future.  Here's the relevant quote:

&gt;So Microsoft purchased a bit of middleware and fashioned it into Direct3D Version 3. It was universally reviled. And with good reason; looking at D3D v3 code is like staring into the Ark of the Covenant.  
&gt;...  
&gt;...  
&gt;Thus the stage is set: Direct3D vs. OpenGL. It's really an amazing story, considering how bad D3D v3 was.

At this point in the story we could say that D3D was completely fucked.  Too little too late.  Well, the story kept going.  The story didn't end there.

If this applies to D3D it also applies to OpenGL.  The story isn't over yet.  Plus, D3D doesn't even want to be cross-platform, so right from the start it made itself irrelevant in the modern world, which doesn't tolerate walled gardens easily and happily.

We see this over and over.  For example, at one point Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 has decisively trashed Netscape Navigator and emerged a winner.  Of course now we all know how that story turned out and we also know in what light IE 6 is seen today, even though it was a ""winner"" back in the day.","1309478802"
"politics","t5_2cneq","You can't just lower costs by putting more people in a system of insurance though. Yes there is more money to pull from, but that means people are paying more than they should be. Also, even though the industry is established, the more people in a system will (at least in the short term) will be subject to the 'law of diminishing returns', meaning that in some cases, 1000 people might get less value from a system that had 500 before.

&gt; The mandate mentality is basically an economic precautionary principle that attempts at lowering costs through a proxy.

I understand that, but let's say I am a billionaire who drives my car once a year, it would seem silly that the state needs to force me to have insurance for the whole year, when I hardly drive and can insure myself.

Rings are won as a team, stats are accumulated as an individual.  If I'm going to pick an individual player, I care a lot more about their individual accomplishments rather than the accomplishments of the team they played for - at least until there's a mathematically rigorous way to measure the relative importance of a player to a team's success.

&gt; We have come to a point in football where we have to reevaluate the 'numbers' concept for receivers. Its too easy for a WR to put up amazing numbers in this pass happy league. Numbers can't be enough to label you great anymore.

Numbers only mean as much as the relative context they're in.  If 15 TDs is high this season, then 15 TDs is a good stat for this season.  If every second string receiver in 10 years can catch 15TDs, then a good stat is going to be higher. Stats are relative and derive their meaning from their value in relation to other stats.  There's never going to be a need to re-evaluate numbers other than what raw numbers we consider ""good"" or ""great.""","1309478808"

I mentioned that I didn't want to live with my SO (we'd been going out for 3.5 years at the time), and if I ever decided that we should live together, the place would have to be big enough for each of us to have some private space - our own hobby rooms etc. She pipes up about how our relationship is just wrong, how it will never work, you HAVE to live with your SO, if you can't there'll never be a future for you etc etc etc. 

My SO an I have a pretty unique relationship and he's a pretty unique guy but it works for us. I've stopped counting the times she called us/him weird and looked down on our relationship. In the meantime she'd never been able to hold down a relationship to save herself. Literally every one of her relationships had been an epic fail. I'm not being spiteful, it was just the hypocrisy that really got me along with the constant barrage of ""your relationship is weird"". Whatever, she's apparently with a good guy now, she's going to ""marry him"" but I once again I've forgotten how many times she told me that about others. We talk in a limited way at social gatherings (we have some of the same friends) but otherwise I've cut contact. Sometimes you just need to expel negative people from your life, they do nothing but wear you out and bring you down. ","1309478817"

"glutenfree","t5_2qx1l","Hey, I can actually answer this! I've worked for the last year as a special-diet personal chef and GF baker, as well as being GF myself for about 2.5 years, and have done a lot of research into the business aspects of things

First off, the obvious: some of that markup is because GF is trendy in industrial food and trendy means ""markup."" There's been 300% increase in GF products since 2005 (I think it might be closer to 400% now, but that's the citation I have in front of me). It's something a lot of existing businesses are capitalizing on in a big way, because it's very popular right now. 

Secondly: The US government subsidizes wheat, which means, at least to US manufacturers, it's CHEAP. However, the combination of flours that make tasty GF products aren't, which means there's a significant difference in cost for ingredients. Example: as a wholesaler, I can buy 100 lbs of Bob's Red Mill regular all purpose for $50. To buy the ingredients to make up 100 lbs of my regular all-purpose flour blend, I spend $95. That doesn't even begin to factor in dough additives like xanthan gum, or the extra cost that goes into ensuring that other ingredients (milk, butter, sugar, etc) are also GF.  

Thirdly: Because of most folks' gluten sensitivity, GF products can't be made in a shared facility. That means that investment has to be made into a GF facility. Outfitting a commercial kitchen isn't cheap - think high five/low six figures for a small operation, and you'd be pretty close. Even in an industrial situation, that facility has to be kept separate from gluten containing ingredients, which requires remodeling and reformulating the line. 

Fourth: There are current bottlenecks in supply (not enough trained bakers, the food science behind GF baking is still very new and successful implementation of ANYTHING requires a lot of research and development, distribution isn't in place in certain areas, etc), and an extremely high demand. Low supply + large demand = rising costs. 

That doesn't even begin to get into the issues of going through certification (stupid expensive, unreasonably so for small businesses), or even just the process of testing for gluten like Bob's Red Mill (that's also pricey). Just the startup costs alone ensure that a GF business will have to charge more than its normal wheat-based competitors.  

**tl;dr:** It's trendy, the ingredients are more expensive, facilities and equipment can't be shared, and low supply + large demand = $$","1309478825"

Are the oceans purged every time there's a thunder storm? Water has fairly high resistance, people. If anything your electric attacks would have lower range underwater. I do agree that it would essentially short circuit and shock you as well as your target (probably in addition to everything in a *small* sphere around you since the entire volume occupied by the water acts as a conductor so the potential gradient would be the same in every direction), but that would really be the only difference.

As a foreigner, if somebody asks you to think of America and Americans, he's one of the first names that trips off your tongue. For better and for worse, he embodies the idea of the American project. Poor boy made good, liberated, bombastic, joyful, naieve, troubled and dissolute. The thing that made his revolution in music and society so effective is that he never set out to start one, he was merely different and couldn't be otherwise. Jesse Jackson credits him as one of the linchpins of the civil rights movement not because of any public speeches and demonstrations, but by being the most famous white kid in the country singing black music, performing with black people and to black people in unsegregated crowds. His impact on American society wasn't through pronouncement but through an assumed mode of being which belonged in a different world to that of McArthyism, segregation and victorian sensibilities. Michael Jackson contributed wonderfully to a new world that people such as Elvis and other pioneers such as Little Richard, Marlon Brando etc brought into being in the post-WW2 American shake-up, but he did not live in the right time to flip the world on its head.

The workplace may not be the *sole* measure of a university, but it is the largest one.  I fully accept and support the notion that it helps produce well rounded and interesting individuals, but that is not as important as the productivity gains it offers society as a whole.

Lastly as to the question of why we are still stuck without a proper education system, I believe it is because the education system is a slow lumbering beast.  Technology has only really burst onto the scene in the last decade, vs. the centuries of formalized education.

Just like when an empire collapses it won’t come with a bang, but rather a trickle.  Year by year more courses and professors will shift towards new teaching and testing methods.  If by nothing else the current administrators will simply die of old age to be replaced by children who grew up with the technology.  You won’t need to explain the flaws in the system to these people as they were the ones thinking the very same thing as they went through their own education.

It's like assuming that just because a small denomination of redditors need to be babysat and spoonfed, the rest of us do as well.
2. I believe that what makes r/politics unique is its lack of censorship, making it a public forum for open political discussion and a wide array of differing opinions. There are HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of white-washed PC news sites that feature completely formulaic news articles devoid of any witty commentary, we don't need r/politics to turn into another one.

In my opinion, the LMG's (other than the M60) offer no real advantages over the AR's. Sniping is kind of niche in this game, either you do it well or you don't. I don't do it well, so I stay away from it. I don't think my game suffers for it.

"pilots","t5_2s5ve","So you want creative, huh...

I'm told that starting out with a glider rating and then moving up to PPL can save some $$.  That way you learn the basics of controlling a plane in a (cheap/hour) unpowered glider, and then make the transition once you know how to fly.  This obviously depends on there being a glider place near you, which depends on if there are areas favorable to glider flight near you.

A general tip- don't start in a glass cockpit plane, learn on a cheap plane with steam gauges (traditional round instruments).  Cessna 150's are great for that.  

Look for flying clubs in your area.  A flying club is an organization that owns one or more aircraft for the exclusive use of its members.  You pay a monthly fee and an initiation fee usually to a flying club, but in exchange you get to use the aircraft often much cheaper than simply renting.  Flying clubs are usually quite friendly, often have monthly meetings you can just show up at, and also have a list of instructors approved to teach in club planes.  This can save you a few bucks.

Also, save up enough money to do your first ~10-15 hours before you start.  Don't do this if it will push flying off too far, but if you can get to solo plus a few hours flying as frequently as possible you will save money in the long run.  In the beginning before you get comfortable with flying you will forget more in between each lesson, so the more time you take between lessons the more time you will spend re-learning.  Ideally before you solo, you'd be flying 3+ times per week.  That will spend a lot of money quickly but it will mean spending less in the long run.  

Once you've done 3-4 flights and you know you're serious about this, buy yourself a flight bag and some gadgets.  I recommend the sportys flightgear series bags, but its a matter of personal taste.  

Buy a decent headset.  Many will disagree with me on this, but I think if you're serious about learning to fly, spending the money on a good headset will help you out.  At around 8-12 hours or so I got myself a Lightspeed Zulu ($850) and it made a large difference.  The extra noise reduction and extra comfort allowed me to focus and concentrate more on the lesson, and I got out of the plane with far less fatigue.  A lot of people will say don't bother spending that kind of money until later, but I believe it took a few hours off my training.  And if you are serious about flying, it's something that will be with you for many years.  So do it right the first time.  You should also get a portable aviation radio (ideally one with VOR) and keep it in your flight bag.  Electrical failures do happen (the plane will run just fine without electrical power) and you want to be able to communicate if/when it happens.

Also, since money is an issue for you (and even if it wasn't), here's some good advice on flight training....

Learning to fly is hard.  Don't have any illusions about this, getting your license is hard work and like any other serious undertaking it requires commitment to see it through.  There are a few points in the training where you will get frustrated and annoyed, the joy of flight wears off a bit and you start seeing the hard work underneath, you will consider dropping out, you will say 'i wanted to learn to fly, now i can fly, so what if I don't have a license, I did what I came for so let's stop spending money'.  Or at least part of you will think that.  These periods usually come just before a milestone, like pre-solo you'll be going around your airport's traffic pattern so many times you'll get dizzy, or before your final checkride you'll be thoroughly sick of stalls, steep turns, and your flight school's practice area.  As someone who went through all that, I can tell you with complete conviction- **stick with it**.  Once you hit that milestone (solo, solo cross country, checkride) the reward is well worth the effort put in to get there.

So start flying a bit, take a discovery flight, do 3-5 hours worth of lessons and then stop and think.  Make a decision, is it something you're going to follow through to the end.  If you decide to stick with it, then make a commitment to yourself right there that you WILL follow this through to the end.  That's when you should buy a good headset and other gear.

Also, your instructor is the most important part of your training.  You need to have an instructor that you mesh well with, who can explain things in a way that makes sense to you, who can teach in a way that suits your style of learning, and who you get along well with.  If you find yourself getting frustrated by the lesson a lot and you think your instructor doesn't mesh well with you, try another instructor.  It's well understood that not every instructor is a perfect match for every student.  At the end of the day, it's your money.

Hope that helps!","1309478910"

I regards to the story FF has always been a bit nuts, but nuts that we could like until XII + XIII both of those i couldn't care about the characters and the main story was so off the wall that it left me not caring.

Now my main problem with the franchise, the gameplay. FF for me has always been about the fights, you had to use your head, ff tactics being the best example. now i know that for the console FF it had to be simplified to a certain extent but really after IX any form of complexity left the FF franchise(with the exception of the mmo FF XI, that was hardcore). FFXIII got alot of stick for being too linear and praise for its combat system  ""paradigm shift"", But for me it was the opposite. I could have forgiven running down a straight line for 3/4 of the game if the battles had been even slightly engaging, everything in that game could be fought by selecting auto attack/battle. 

TL;DR Yes i think it has, stories make no sense (worse than usual) and combat has gotten so simplified that i feel like i may aswell not even be a part of whats going on.

I hope you don't get caught for the sake of your kids. Hurting other adults is fair game, so fuck away. But by cheating on your wife, you are fucking with the history of your children. You are fucking with their potential memories. 

Look, women get married and divorced all the time. Hell, many women are happier with their second husbands. Women can recover from the divorce, children't can't. They become forever split, bouncing between two parents. I guess what I'm saying is cheating is worse on kids than adults. 

So don't get caught...for the kids.

History lesson: Kashmir was a princely state in the British Raj. It was left independent when the British left in 1947. Pakistan wanted to annex it so they attacked in 1948. Kashmir's ruler who was Hindu went to the Indian government for help. India drove back Pakistan until a Line of Control was established that forms today's defacto border. 

About 45% of the original Kashmir is now the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. About 40% is the Pakistani territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit. The rest (mostly uninhabited mountains) belongs to China after they attacked India in 1962.","1309478927"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","My diet is loosely based on keto, but I drink milk twice a day with my protein shakes, so it's a little higher carb than keto.  I stay away from carbs, and only eat meat, green veggies, nuts and dairy.  I eat 4-5 meals a day.  A typical day will be:

Meal 1: Casein shake with ~ 8oz 2% milk

Meal 2: ~8-10oz chicken breast, spinach salad

Meal 3: Either a snack of ~2oz cheese, handful of raw almonds, and some bacon or other leftover meat in the fridge, or some chicken breast and salad/green beans/broccoli

Meal 4: ~8-12oz chicken/steak/ground beef, spinach salad/green beans/broccoli

Meal 5: Casein shake with ~8oz 2% milk about an hour before bed

My routine is an upper/lower/upper split, 3 days a week, with cardio in between.  I lift monday wednesday friday, HIIT cardio (usually bike or weighted sled) on tuesday thursday.

Mondays: 
Weighted Dips
1x5
2x10

Chin ups/Underhand grip pulldowns
1x6
2x10

Military press/OHP
3x6-10 (i was stalled at 95x10ish for a while, dropped reps to 6 and upped the reps to get the weight moving up again)

Tuesday:
HIIT on a bike, 1 min sprint, 1 min slow for 30 min after a 4 min warmup with a 3 minute cooldown.  My heartrate fluctuates between 150-180 bpm the whole time.  I time it myself with my fingers on my throat for 10 seconds and multiply, so instert whatever user error you want here.

Wednesday:
Box Squats
1x5
2x10

Rack Deadlifts
1x5
1x10
go effing heavy

Abs
I use an ab wheel, 3x15

Thursday:
same as Tuesday

Friday:
Pulley rows with a straight bar (like the one for pulldowns)
1x5
1x10
Switch to V-handle
2xfailure (whenever your form starts to break down, not complete physical failure)

Incline Bench
3x6
switch to closegrip
1x1 short of failure (don't die)

Dumbbell Curls superset with Dumbbell Tricep Extensions
3x10, rest 30 seconds in between every set (1 set curls, rest 30 sec, 1 set tri ext, rest 30 sec, etc until finished)

On the 5-6 rep sets, increase the weight every week.  On the lighter sets, only increase the weight every 4 or so weeks.  After 8 weeks, deload by halving the reps and sets (if it's a half set or rep, round it up, duh)

tl;dr:  I'd say that most of my success is from being relatively new to the routine, and although I have a decent amount of experience lifting, it comes in bursts of 3-9 months.  I think I should stick with it better now, since I no longer have the gf that showed no appreciation for my efforts.  Also, I am VERY strict with my diet all week, but go out drinking friday and saturday nights, and don't mind eating carbs on saturdays.  I am 24 years old, after all.  Besides that, consistency is key.

Most fruits and vegetables available for consumption today bear little semblance to their wild relatives, due to generations of artificial selection and breeding imposed on them by man. So these are, in a sense, ""man-made"" like the styrofoam cup o' ramen I'm currently wolfing down.

Certainly there are a lot of artificially produced foods that are bad for you, but there's a lot of stuff in nature that will kill you just as fast if you put it in your mouth.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I compared Rosa Parks to the power you have as an individual to change things as opposed to waiting for laws to change. There's a great passage about civil disobedience in a book called the Ethics of Climate Change; because when it comes to our changing environment, we will be pretty screwed if we wait for everyone to have laws to abide by to regulate the changes which are desperately needed. It's great that you're such a Rousseauian in your way of thinking about human nature and its regulation but that can be pretty utopian in a society where people are still taking the wheel after one too many despite it being made illegal...

I haven't been to China so I'll believe what you say, I know they have a very very poor record when it comes to treatment of animals (and human rights..); it isn't as much of an ethical concern over there as it is in the West (I am generalising-everyone is obviously not like that, the concept of animal rights is just as not embedded in the culture from what I've been told.) Are you sure about the very little pain they suffer? Can I have some sources? Because given what I've seen in Europe, in the US (things improved briefly about a decade ago when Temple Grandin was somewhat involved in the ways Cattle were taken to the slaughterhouse for example-only to absolutely plummet) and elsewhere, things have, as said before, plummeted (and I'm not getting this from Peta by the way). We've had several cues about it in the news this month alone (Australia banning live exports to Asia, Iowa and other states trying to make it a criminal offense to film inside abatoirs and livestock areas etc), I mean just look at the price of meat around you, something that cheap must not have cost much to keep alive.. I remember when tesco brought out their £1 or whatever it was chicken, and that was the first time I thought about it. Oh and these practices aren't just bad for livestock, they're bad for you too as a consumer; the Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, to give you a popular example, is linked to meat and bone meal which was one of the cheapest ways to eat cows.

&gt;I'd still eat one though, they're going to be there whether I do or not, so I will.

But see this is exactly where we disagree. When a city sets up a bus route running once an hour from say, 10pm to 12am, this bus route is only set up because there is a demand for it. You can think, 'well it doesn't matter if I take that bus or not, it'll still be running', but if thirty people think like that and stop taking the 11pm and 12am, the city would eventually cancel this service. It's basic economics. It's this precise logic which leads to people not voting and to idiots being elected into office by a minority of the population. In Europe for example, whenever there is an election, the extreme-right voters almost always come out en masse because they know that other people won't bother.


*I have never in my life, met a proselytizing vegetarian, neither has anyone I've ever asked about this, this despite my intense fear of taking a few in as a flatmates and thinking I was going to be berated for grilling some frankfurters. What I have however met are needlessly aggressive omnivores who at the mention of 'does this have meat in it?' will absolutely lose it on my friends. Saw it but this past saturday at a hen do when two girls started sniggering about someone explaining that they just don't want to encourage bad farming practice. Also saw it in a tapas bar when two friends tried to trick another into tasting a ratatouille-type dish that had meat and then laughed and said ""¡Haha ! ¡ El plato tenía carne!"". Tell people in the context of outings that you're vegetarian/ask if there's a veg option, do it for ten days and come back and tell me you haven't heard the majority of these without any provocation on your part: http://www.flickr.com/photos/smiteme/4170866438/
It is the single most baffling thing.
Just the fact that in every single one of your replies you had to say 'I will still eat my pork' shows this paranoia that you expect vegetarians to come take away your pork like a lolly from a child. Not in any of my replies have I said 'you shouldn't eat pork', I mean come on I even mentioned I'm part of Compassion, an org which is NOT veg but fights for the changing of laws regarding the welfare of livestock in the EU. I encourage my friends to eat meat from farmer's markets, local butchers, etc. and to reject the crap they're getting at the supermarket.","1309478953"

I just call out their name, and then look at the student until he makes eye contact with me and stops talking, and then say ""thanks.""  Sometimes I say the student's name multiple times if necessary.  They know exactly what they're doing wrong, you don't need to spell it out for them for the thousandth time, just call them on their shit.

Also don't wait until after class to deal with it, like lizzyshoe said it sends the message to the other students that such behavior is acceptable.  Call them out during class, and if it's bad/repeated, talk to them after class as well.

I also disagree with laboski's suggestion.  Unless a sassy demeanor is your typical style or you are playful about comments like this, it's just going to start a power struggle with the offended student.

I don't like the response of simply waiting for them to shut up either.  It majorly disrupts the flow of instruction, takes too long, and the student hasn't really suffered any consequences.  After all, they are probably sick of hearing the teacher talk anyway.

It's all about show in this country. Why spend 100 dollars on a purse, when there's one that's 1,500 and comes with a brand name on it? Or why wear a 20 dollar polo, when the 65 dollar polo shirt has the logo of an expensive company on it?

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","I think I must not be understanding what you're saying.  I am assuming this:

""If demand increases and supply remains unchanged, then it leads to higher equilibrium price...""
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand

As I imagine it, each time one new person decides to use bitcoin, they first have to obtain some somehow, so they exchange either another currency or goods and services for them at the current market rate.  This is one more person willing to trade something of value for bitcoins, which has the effect of bumping up ever so slightly the price that other people will charge to part with their BTC.  Fixed supply + increased demand = increase in price.

By similar logic, each time someone stops using bitcoin, the price goes down a bit.  So, gradually, over time, the net influx or outflow of users (and the items of value they bring) to the bitcoin economy could cause the price to go up or down a lot.

That's how I see it, but you seem to be arguing that the price has to go up first before more people will participate in this economy.  How does the current total size of the economy keep any particular additional person from participating in it (unless they themselves need to be doing multi-million dollar transactions)?  Or are you just saying that there are not enough participants in the market for someone who wants to engage to find someone to transact with?

Please explain, if you care to.  Thanks.","1309478985"
"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","A *great* moral teacher? Well that's a difficult measure. The Bible is popular and it has some good moral teachings but so does Harry Potter and the later expresses greater moral subtlety.

For example, Jesus talked of beating disobedient slaves severely while lightly beating slaves who didn't know they were doing wrong. Anyone of us could improve on that. Some of what he said was good but he didn't improve on Socrates.

&gt; The servant will be severely punished, for though he knew his duty, he refused to do it.  ""But people who are not aware that they are doing wrong will be punished only lightly.  Much is required from those to whom much is given, and much more is required from those to whom much more is given.""  (Luke 12:47-48 NLT)

"microgrowery","t5_2s5jo","I would make an array of CFLs where the ballast part can be separated from the rest in some way and then you can vent that heat out without it staying in the box.

One example is just cutting five holes in a piece of cardboard or wood or something and pop the CFL bulbs through those holes.  The board should be big enough to create a compartment at the top of the box.  The exhaust should pull from the top and therefore the air will flow over the bulbs, around them into the top section and then out through the exhaust fan.  This keeps the bulbs cooler, their ballast heat away from the rest of the box, and still allows normal cooling.

That's just one idea.  Another is to add CFL bulbs around the sides and such to add more light in the box but with minimal additional heat.  Many times more intense light is not as necessary as just more light distribution.  A few more 25w bulbs in the corners may add enough light to make quite a bit of difference without adding too much heat.","1309478996"

What's interesting is that president Obama kept Bush's secretary of war (defense) while candidate Obama spent so much time picking the Bush strategy apart. What's interesting is that Obama has accelerated the war across the globe and been awarded a peace prize.

However, i'm sure they are waiting for the right moment to get in. And in that case, i would choose Audi .. Porsche would never go into F1, they belong to endurance racing and VW doesn't match with F1. It was a good move to go to WRC. Though it's a pitty they pulled out from Dakar.
Anyway, it seems that for the time being Audi won't pull out from Le Mans and hopefully we will see them competing against Porsche!! It would be epic.

The more manufacturers competing in LMP1 the better. Hope the rumours about Toyota are true and that Peugeot keeps on with its efforts.

Darwin also initially presented his theory of descent with modification (not described by him as evolution) with Alfred Russel Wallace simultaneously in 1858, before actually publishing solo in 1859.  Seeing as the Linnaean Society meeting at which the joint presentation was made (at which Darwin was not present) was on 1 July 1858, 153 years ago, the title is wrong but whatever.

Of those many who came up with the idea before Darwin one may also look to Erasmus Darwin, Charles's own grandfather.  But there are of course 3 stages of scientific discovery: first they deny that it is true, then they deny that it is important, finally they credit the wrong person.","1309479015"

My home's electricity was done by some CFD who put everything on a few 30A breakers with 14 gunge wiring, so I actually run everything I can through as few strips as I can.

T1 - Play a Inkmoth Nexus, a Memnite.  Tap &amp; activate the Inkmoth.  Play an Opal and tap it for W, play a Glint Hawk, bounce the Opal.  Repeat.


With a god hand you could get all four Glint Hawks out on T1.  It's unlikely that will happen, but you can squeeze out extra mana from your Opals later on doing just this.


It's also a White spell, which matters more if your running Shrines main board.

Because you are promising to forgo sex with every other person on earth, except your partner. This is a HUGE thing because sexual desire is an incredibly powerful motivator and the longer the desire goes unfulfilled, the more powerful it becomes. This is why the obligation is implied with monogamy.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Two things:

1. Just because the lab is overloaded doesn't mean that you can just quit collecting evidence. Swabs don't cost much and don't take up a lot of room. Better to take a quick sample at the scene just in case it becomes important later instead of waiting and having to go back for it, assuming that is possible. The sample may turn out to be nothing of interest and never tested, but you can't always predict that at the scene.

2. The rape kit situation is awful, but isn't necessarily comparable. Depending on where you are, there are legitimate reasons why a burglary sample may be tested while a rape sample sits in storage. RuleLawyer points out a number of them. There are places where rape investigations basically grind to a halt because the kits aren't being processed in a timely manner, but there are also labs storing kits taken from victims who later recanted their stories or decline to file charges. In those cases, a DNA hit on the burglary is more likely to be of use than one in a case that the victim does not want to go anywhere.","1309479079"

Second time you have made this claim without any specific details.  If you are referring the cuts that I think you are, your stance is pretty insane.  If you have other ones in mind, I'll need some details before I can judge the merits of your argument.

Do you have these details?  Are you willing to provide them?  Or are you just blindly repeating something you say on the Rachel Maddow Show?

&gt;Then, he went and made huge cuts to education and health care spending, among other things. Walker did not just limit teachers ability to strike, he crushed all public unions (it should be noted that the unions agreed to pay/benefit cuts, they were just protesting the union busting) .

Really?  I'm pretty sure I read a link in this very thread that said that almost 200 teacher's jobs were cut after the union refused to increase contributions into their pensions.  Doesn't sound like they were crushed to me.  Additionally, an increase in contributions to their own pensions has the same effect as a pay cut and you claim that the union was fine with pay cuts so what is the problem?

&gt;Also, he has refused hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in federal spending.

More details please.  Give me info about what he refused specifically and what actions he would have to commit his state to in order to get the funds you speak of.

&gt;He has kneecapped craft breweries from being able to compete with the 'big guys'.

Again, details please.  Also, did this move have any affect on the teachers or are you just throwing in some unrelated stuff to try and fit in more attacks on Walker?

&gt;Walker has abused his power by overturning laws created by local cities.

Details please.

&gt; He has rescinded a law requiring disinfected water in Wisconsin.

Details please.  

&gt;He gave the son of a huge campaign donor a high paying job that he was not qualified for.

He gave him the job?  Or a member of his staff recommended him for the job?

&gt;He wants to give hundreds of millions of dollars to out of state investors.

Details please.

&gt;He wants to stop defending the state's civil union laws. He is disturbingly 'buddy, buddy' with David Koch. He tried to limit the public's access to ethics files. He has refused compromise on many different bills. He wants no-bid sales of Wisconsin's power plants.

More details on all of these please?

&gt;Is that enough?

No, without details, your entire list is pretty meaningless.  Some of the things you've listed certainly seem like a good reason to attack Walker, but without seeing details and unbiased commentary on the reasoning and success of these measures and decisions, how can we make an informed decision about how to view them?","1309479081"

I thought I would put together this little tirade of mine in so much as what I see as a gathering of storm clouds  on the Internet Marketing Horizon. Recently marketers have been pulling out their hair as Google's Panda hit the realms of Cyber Space, with a resounding jolt and a resulting thud, many a marketer individual and corporate hit the bottomless pit.

Since that eventful day, many a marketeer has been thrown into a tailspin, there have been calls for the lynching of Panda and all associated with the concept, many a person have packed it in giving up on efforts to make a go of it in Internet Marketing as a career. Some are even foreseeing the decline and eventual death of internet marketing.

And who can blame them, without Panda it was was no piece of cake for newbies and inexperienced persons in spite of what Gurus of this trade would want to tell us with all the mumbo jumbo about tricks, white hat or black.

The trouble with all this is inherent in the Global economy that we all have to survive in, if the big shots in world economics cannot get it right you can imagine what this means for us mere mortals, so what is there for most people to do?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Interesting arguments, for sure. But until the government actually passes a law, regulation, etc. which asserts to forbid a private action, or until the government seeks to penalize an allegedly improper action already taken, then there's probably no constitutional violation. 

I think that that's generally true of constitutional violations. If a government agent, like a cop, threatens or insinuates that she is going to do something which you believe is a violation of your rights, like an illegal search, it's not actually a violation until the search actually occurs or the search is explicitly allowed by law/regulation/etc.

However, there is considerable variation.  I've been to many that fit your description and I've spoken with anthropologists who have done their field work in Methodist churches that were little more than book clubs and that expressed a desire to see the day when a belief in God were no longer necessary.  

On the other hand, I have a dear friend whose husband is a Methodist minister and his views are probably closer to those of Southern Baptists or various charismatic churches.  My grandfather, who was a Methodist minister, was somewhere in between these extremes.  In any case, from the interviews and observations I've done in my own field work, i'd say that those of the most liberal varieties probably do tend toward the agnostic.  However, I would say that they are more interested in having a sense of community, particularly one through which they can work for social justice, than they are with covering their bases.","1309479093"

If you choose to enter the tunnel, when would you decide to turn around? What's the motivation for turning around once you've entered the tunnel? If you went into the tunnel for eight hours, didn't get
anywhere, and went back another eight hours back into the room, what
did you accomplish? The end of the tunnel, and freedom, could be 50ft
from where you stopped and turned around, or it could go on forever.
You really wouldn't know anything more than if you had never gone into
the tunnel at all (where, again, the end of the tunnel could be 50ft
from the room or it could be miles and miles away). Eventually, you'd
need to just keep going further and further if you wanted to escape so
it would make sense it just keep going in the first place, if you
decide to take the tunnel. At least that's what I'm thinking right
now.

I don't think the ability to backtrack in the tunnel changes the
decision process (but I could be wrong).","1309479112"
"askscience","t5_2qm4e","As Lightfoot has alluded to, gravity is a key factor.  This is because if you scale up a body structure, the mass increases as a function of the volume, which increases as a cubed function, while cross sectional area increases as a squared function.  As you increase the size of something keeping everything in proportion, you quickly reach a point where the mass of an organism becomes too great for it to hold itself up.

On land, this is particularly relevant for animals that move around.  It is also relevant for plants, which can grow to be much larger than animals due to their rigid structures that don't need to move around too much, but there is still a theoretical limit on size for the same reason.  The largest living organisms on earth are distributed.  There is a mushroom called Armillaria solidipes that has been found to span nearly 9km^2 , and certain other plants and fungi can grow over exceedingly large areas, but these are connected by root or mycelia systems, and are arguably connected systems of clones rather than one giant creature, so the boundaries become a bit fuzzy.  They escape the volume to cross sectional area ratio issues by not existing as one solid mass.

In the oceans, all bets are off, which is why the blue whale is the largest animal that ever lived.  Their size limitations are probably based on food intake, environment and their genetic history (they evolved from much smaller animals).","1309479113"

Furthermore, Jesus was crucified because he was a revolutionary; one can't go around proclaiming the advent of another kingdom when there was already an empire in Rome which people paid taxes to.

I suppose it's not a bad thing per se; as the books reach a wider audience, more people will be able to enjoy an excellent series, and perhaps even begin to raise their standard of what constitutes good literature. 

It's just odd to see Martin finally recognized for his contribution to *literature*, and praised by media outlets, so long after he started, and in large part due to the show. I think the books stand alone, and it's odd for them to get grouped together with and reviewed simultaneously with the HBO series, seeing how long they've been out. 

I don't begrudge individual fans who are just discovering the series. 
But for most of us, particularly on ASOIAF, it's a bit weird to watch all this unfold. With regard to chronology, the popularity of ""game of thrones"" is the equivalent of a newfound obsession with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone.  Both books came out around the same year, IIRC.

Second, to be perfectly honest, Portland is full of ""good beer"", but there's surprising little ""world class beer"", especially stuff in bottles with wide enough distribution to show up on the average beer drinker's radar.

Seriously, name one:

* IPA or Imperial IPA from a PDX brewery that can stand up to Pliny or HopSlam.  Workhorse or Blue Dot are about the only things I can think of that come close, and they're plagued by a lack of distribution compared to 90% of the IPAs on that list.

* sour beer that can compete with the likes of La Folie.  Cascade's stuff is pretty good, but most of them lack the depth of the truly great sours because they refuse to use any wild yeast and so they have to rely on the character of the barrels and the sharp acidity of lactic acid to sour them up.

* year-round local stout that can compete with Old Rasputin. I'm drawing a total blank on this one.  The Widmer W'11 Stout was good (especially for the price), but that was a one-off beer that may not ever be seen again.","1309479125"

"writing","t5_2qh2n","I use the zaggmate iPad combo everyday. It's great if you have a need for ultra portability. I also have two other laptops that I use for more powerful apps, things like Final Draft and other tools simply not available on the iPad.

Documents To Go is somewhat more compatible than Pages for some Microsoft formats, and less so for others. Pages is more fun/smooth to write with, so there's that too. Many iPad apps are semi functional that way, so you often end up buying different apps. Good news is nothing is very expensive, so you can easily do that. I filled my iPad with apps for less than one copy of Microsoft Office.

I find the iPad to be more useful than a laptop for things like note taking, mind mapping/brainstorming, and email, because it can be carried anywhere and is always on standby with a long battery life.

There is simply no good way at the moment to transfer to/from Final Draft, but some apps will take in an import halfway decently. I usually just start or import on the iPad, and export later for final cleanups. I too have been waiting impatiently for Final Draft to get their app on the market.

Short answer: I wouldn't be happy with JUST an iPad, but I get a lot more stuff done because I have one in addition to a laptop, due to the iPad's portability. I even type out some things with the virtual keyboard, which I hated at first.","1309479135"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Yes! It's not impossible, people! I had to do it. I had to tell my bf of 3 years (at the time) that I couldn't be monogamous and that I loved him so so much but it was impossible for me to be happy in a relationship where there were no options for sex outside the relationship.

And you know what? No, he wasn't happy at first but he was willing to work on it and I was just so happy that he wasn't angry at me, and we took it super slow and worked out a compromise that I only be with other women for now, which (now that he has opened his mind) he is actually REALLY INTO, and very excited when I find a girlfriend.

I have to say that you owe it to your partner to talk about it. And, their reactions might surprise you. I wasn't about to live my life in a relationship that wasn't 100% satisfactory, but I wasn't going to cheat either.

You know the funny thing? Now that I know I have outside options, I feel more monogamous. I have less of an urge for sex with other people. I think being forbidden from it made it more tempting before, but now that I know that I can go out and hook up with somebody, I am much more likely so say ""Eh... nah"". :)","1309479143"

&gt; So I'm left wondering, do you ever suffer? 

oh yes.  I'm not an Arhat.

&gt; And if so, on what grounds do you make the statement that the third noble truth refers to realization of a permanent cessation of suffering?

because I have had experiences that gave me insight into how its accomplished.  that's what temporary meditation experiences (nyam) do : they give insight so as to work along the path further.

also, its buddhism 101.  there is no way that cessation of dukkha is only temporary.

&gt; 1. Dukkha-dukkha (pain of pain) is the obvious sufferings of: pain, illness, old age, death, bereavement

you don't get out of this one

&gt; 2. Viparinama-dukkha (pain of alteration) is suffering caused by change: violated expectations, the failure of happy moments to last

this one you definitely cease for ever

&gt; 3. Sankhara dukkha (pain of formation) is a subtle form of suffering arising as a reaction to qualities of conditioned things

and this one (graduate school)

In high school I had a good friend who was a little person (4'6""). Never did anything with each other because we both had partners at the time. Well a few years later we where hanging out, and we had a few drinks. 
It was awesome. We continued to see each other for a while purely for sex. I went off to the Air Force and didn't have much contact with her during that time. When I got back we starting talking again. 
We added the title bf/gf to each other and shortly after she got pregnant.
On the 5th month of her pregnancy she lost our child. It was too much for us emotionally and we drifted apart.

That essentially robs the newbies of the best advice they could be getting. That might sound a little arrogant or what not, but realistically I still see a lot, **a lot** of god-awful advice come up in r/fitness.

So really, cleaning up r/fitness is the best thing for future visitors looking for advice. And it seems that as people become part of r/fitness  and become more and more active, they eventually find FCJ for the derps and AF for the non-newb stuff.

Sure, giving your dogs pieces of plain meat or rice is great, but giving them something more complicated/unknown (like something pre-prepared, or that contains many spices/unknown ingredients) is not the best idea. Not only is it often unhealthy for them (most prepared meals contain a lot of sodium, which isn't good for dogs [or people!]), it's hard to predict how they'll react.

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","With your last sentence, I agree completely. For a fuller explanation:

For Lord Ashdown, I thought that the principle is sound - the system we live in must be democratic. There's no question there. But I've put some thought in to this, and I question:

a) how does this make things more democratic? More elections doesn't necessarily equal more democracy IMO because I see democracy as an end point where the will of the people subject to rational argument is enacted. The whole point of elections to me is a way to achieve democracy and you can't have democracy, surely, without accountability - if you can't judge them on their performance, why elect them - and if you have one chamber where you elect them but they're not accountable, how is that democratic? Moreover, if you do have two accountable chambers (like, say the US or Australia) why does that make the system as a whole more democratic? If I support in the lower chamber party A's schools policy and they have to alter it substantially because of party B's elected presence in the upper chamber, who do I hold to account for that policy's results, especially if it fails? Party A for compromising, or party B for forcing the issue? If we only elect one chamber, regardless of what compromises are made it is always clear that the party responsible is the one in the lower chamber. The onus is on them to make sure it works. As is common in management circles, if more than one person is held responsible for something then that usually means no one is.

b) the issue of the Senate running riot as such a non-possibility. Lady Boothroyd has a point when she mentions that because of our uncodified constitution, it's very hard to pin down the powers of a body at any given time. For example, the Scotland Act says that the Scottish Parliament has no power to issue referendums on independence, but in light of the 2011 elections, the UK government has already accepted that the Scottish Parliament *can* hold a referendum on independence. The problem of unforeseen consequences is doubly true because of our lack of legal hurdles to stop our institutions.

c) whether our checks and balances require or even could have the Lords/a Senate step in. The House of Lords is chiefly a revising chamber and it works well as that. It amends 64% of government bills (and even occasionally - 1% - defeats) that come before it and can be overridden when the Commons does not give in. The Australian Senate is very much a check and balance chamber and it amends 24% of government bills and even defeats 6%. But the volume of amendments is much smaller - the Lords passes an average of two and a half thousand amendments to 30 bills each session, the Senate an average of six hundred amendments to 150 bills each year. It tackles big political issues because it is a political chamber with political members. The Lords tackles non-political issues because it is mainly a non-partisan chamber with a lot of members who are not too fussed about partisanship. When you consider all the defeats the Lords causes the government and the lack of defeats the Commons causes the government, why is it that the Lords (possibly the busiest revising chamber in the world) needs reforming when the Commons (one of the weakest check-and-balance chambers in the world) quite clearly needs the attention more? If the Commons were a political check and balance chamber, then the Lords could keep its revising role and the two chambers would complement each other rather than our constitution being a choice between one or the other.

On Lady Boothroyd's arguments, I see a great deal of merit in what she is saying but there are some issues remaining, such as:

a) whether the comparison of the Lords with the chiefs of defence staff, the judiciary, cabinet, etc is valid. The judiciary and chiefs of defence staff carry out commands by parliament; the Lords, while subordinate to the Commons, is still a house of parliament. To describe peers as equivalent to them understates the importance of the House and its functions and is a deliberate attempt to obscure the debate.

b) that the bills provides 300 jobs for the boys on the party lists - while it will end up with an upper house mainly full of party politicians, to say it's party lists is not true, not by the draft bill anyway. STV is one of the best electoral systems I know of; it gives voter choice in a way few other electoral systems do. It is not a closed party list which provides quite possibly the least choice of any electoral system. That's a slur which does not deserve the time of day.

c) whether the idea of electing a chamber in thirds is such a horrific idea. I personally don't want the Lords elected, but I got the impression she paints it to be an Orwellian measure. It's a legitimate way of doing things, but IMO only if you see the entire point of parliament as being a political check and balance rather than a combination. This also seems to be hyperbole.

Lord Ashdown was right to say that the Lords needs to work better and that you can't ignore the issue just cos the public don't care. Lady Boothroyd was right that the only reason the government provide (and, indeed, the only argument that really holds much water so long as you see democracy as a necessary input not an output) is that it's not democratically legitimate, that election is no panacea to the problems the Lords faces, and that we can't decide the constitution on the coalition's best guesses.

For me, I come out ultimately on the side of appointing the House of Lords. I'm not convinced by doing it for life (terms may be more appropriate) and much reform needs to be done to make the Lords more effective (more select committees, better co-ordination between peers and MPs), but I'm even less convinced that elections will make our laws better or make our system more democratic.

If there's a part of parliament that needs reform most, for me it's the House of Commons, where when it comes to legislating MPs see themselves first and foremost as party operatives fighting for their leader not members of the Commons fighting for their constituents.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There's a significant number of questions surrounding the actual worth of GMO's.  There's also different definitions to GMO as well.  Some people would define the outcomes of radical hybridization via cross-breeding a GMO, while others (whom I tend to follow) define it where the genetics of the organism have been tinkered with via true genetic splicing.

Having said that, I think that [redcolumbine's note](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/idqb1/i_have_a_serious_question_how_do_you_feel_about/c22x3l7) is the biggest thing.

Of course there are times when you could probably just drink the water, in my honest opinion, that is the majority of time. 

The thought though that the majority of the over-cautious warning system stems from the american legal system? Who am I going to sue if I get the hersheys out on a trail? 

One time having any intestinal issues makes you do a few things, wash up both self and cooking/eating utensils WELL (again too lazy to italics) and treat your water. Its not expensive, and its not really a hassle. I don't have a filter, I just use tabs.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Yeah, but Muhammad lucked out that it was early in the language's development, and there was no formal rules. Check this excerpt of an article out:

'On the other hand, the Bab’s violation of grammatical rules, particularly rules governing case endings, is reminiscent of similar irregularities occurring in the Qur’an. For Muhammad, there was no fixed grammatical standard by which to abide. Rather, the Qur’an was the first extended work in Arabic and it became a model for the development of the language. However, when grammarians applied their rules to the Qur’an, the text was not always agreeable. Therefore, they went to some lengths to try and explain why a word that had the correct case in several instances was suddenly improperly declined in a similar grammatical position, rather than accept that Muhammad might not have always been consistent. 

Even though Muhammad was fairly consistent, his few inconsistencies are excusable since no standard existed at that time. The Bab, on the other hand, was certainly aware of the rules of grammar that had been the standard for over a thousand years. In the letter to  Isfahani that I quoted above, he demonstrates a knowledge of the basic rules for Arabic case endings. Despite this, the Bab frequently violates them. But, as pointed out above, so does Muhammad, although with less frequency. Therefore, perhaps the Bab deliberately violated some of the rules of Arabic grammar to further enhance the Qur’anic flavor of his ayat, or “verses.” This was the Bab’s name for a mode of writing that was purposefully patterned on the Qur’an. However, the Bab also does this in works that he does not classify as “verses,” like his scientific treatises. Therefore, if he broke grammatical rules to enhance the Qur’anic flavor of his “verses,” he nonetheless carried this practice into his other modes of writing.'","1309479226"

I would hazard a guess that for the most part people talking about that are in the USA (also China and Japan have fairly long work hours, anecdotal evidence). Almost everyone I know working in academia in the states says ""don't do it"". I think that kind of work environment is bad for people's social lives and happiness. 

I work in Australia, with a successful research group that publishes a lot of high impact factor work and pulls in a **lot** of funding, but noone spends 12 hours in the offices every day. Our director would easily be the busiest person here, but he is managing a research group of ~60. All the women here are happy (including me!), some have kids, some don't, and none are as neurotic or ""no-life-except-the-lab"" as what some people describe. Work hours are flexible, researchers with kids have leeway to work around their kids hours.

It's important to keep science in mind - even fingerprinting, for example, as so much science in it. Which dye would you use? If the print looked old, perhaps cyanoacrylate exposure is the best bet? If it's recent, ninhydrin might work. Or when taking a cast of an impression - crowbar marks on a breaking-and-entering scene, for example - which casting material works for painted wood?

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","All well put. I think I was just using a more robust sene of understanding than you allow for. Thus, I didn't get what you were trying to distinguish.

In Vedanta, they teach about the Self. This is just the flip side of no-self. It is taught that we are always already the Self, and enlightenment is realizing again that one is the Self. How is it that one can be something yet not realize it? One's mind is ignorant; it is full of thoughts that tell it something contrary to the truth. What, then is enlightenment? It is the removal of this ignorance. Or, put positively, it is the knowledge (understanding) that I am the Self. It is the re-ordering of one's basic concepts in accordance with the truth. Not just one belief added along with another, but a re-ordering resulting from testing and abiding in this truth.

While an initial look at this truth might be unforgettable, it generally takes time before one completely identifies with the Self/no-self. Habitual fears and unhelpful thoughts re-assert themselves. The mind still tries to contract around some identity; often, the ego takes hold and tries to create an enlightened identity instead of relaxing into its un-knowing.

My point is not to have a pissing contest here but to say that old habits die hard, and the ego is a tricky bastard, and it finds all sorts of ways to justify itself and build itself up. These are things I see in myself. Let us just be watchful of it as we try to relax into no-self.","1309479238"

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","Well, let's say your dad is a general contractor and he buys vehicles with his company. If he leases the vehicle in the company name and you are the primary driver, he can write off the lease payments and upkeep, wear and tear, mileage, etc. With a purchase, that doesn't happen. Leasing has substantial tax advantages for the self-employed and for business.

A great example of leasing being terrible is something like a Chevrolet Malibu. Leasing is predicated on the predicted future value of the vehicle. The more the lender wagers it will be worth, the less money they want from you. If a $20k car is going to be worth $10k in 3 years, they want you to pay that $10k, plus interest. If they think it's going to be worth $12k, they want you to pay $8k, plus interest.

Well, a Chevy Malibu or Impala is worth nothing in three years because they don't hold their value. In that situation, a lease is often costlier than buying new - or even better, buying a used, late model Malibu.

Leasing also rarely makes sense for inexpensive automobiles because the payments are often within 10% of a more expensive and more substantial vehicle. And since cheaper cars cost less, the monthly payment is low enough that you may as well just buy it.

Luxury marques don't have sales. They don't discount new cars. Look at a Mercedes ad. Leases and used cars. It's unseemly to put a prestigious car on sale. If you want a discount, it's hidden in the lease. Often times it's cheaper to lease the car and buy it at the end of the lease than it is to buy it outright when you're talking about those kinds of cars.

Another interesting example is all leased vehicles come with GAP insurance. So if the vehicle is ever written off as a total loss, you walk way scot-free. You could have a Chevy Impala that is -8000 in value one week before the lease ends, it gets stolen and you are released from any liability. That -$8000 if you owned it? Your equity disappears.

Leasing is more expensive for insurance, unless you always carry the lowest deductibles and highest limits. Leasing contracts require you to take expensive insurance. 

Ultimately, leasing is really a case-by-case basis. Like a Honda: If you know where to go, leasing a Honda is vastly cheaper than buying. In Boston, you can lease a Honda Civic for 2 years for $3000. I'd rather lease that car and save the money I'd be making on purchase payments and a down payment. Equity in vehicles is dangerous because they're a depreciating asset. Which is also why I would never buy a Mercedes S-Class. You lose your shirt on those. But if you want to buy an S-Class? Get a used one with the depreciation gone.

If there's a specific model you like, it can be decent. But to me, I think about say...the new 2011 Hyundai Elantra and you can finance it for about $350/mo for a GL automatic or lease it for $260/mo with 0 down, I think buying is better. But if it's leasing a 2011 Honda Civic for $99/mo with 999 down or buying it for $300/mo with 999 down, I would lease it.","1309479245"

The two alternatives (and I believe they are mutually exclusive, but who knows): eternal universe or temporal both seem pretty absurd.

In the case of the temporal; a universe with a beginning and possibly and end, that does my head in. To think there was some configuration of the universe where there was no space-time and then there was, and that it will exist for a time (time being something it created) and then it won't exist anymore seems like non-sense. Where's the trigger? Why now? How?

The other alternative, that the universe is eternal is almost equally bizarre, I mean how can something be if it has no beginning? There is no analogy in real life that we can point to that is comparable, everything has a beginning, although it seems that not everything perhaps must have an end.

"battlefield3","t5_2rlua","&gt;From the opening park, you need to push underground through a dark, bombed-out metro tunnel section, and then up and out onto the downtown city streets for the final confrontation in front of the Paris stock exchange. This seamless transition in the map between contrasting areas is something that makes it feel like so much more than your typical walled-in multiplayer arena. For a sense of scale, each of the different areas in Operation Métro would be large enough to house a very good Team Deathmatch experience.

"DJs","t5_2rddy","Sadly not much (amateur), Mainly Traktor with ableton. No problem with USB and a controller (cheap numark) it works. My biggest complaint is that the audio drivers for the 1201N can be wonky (started noticing it with ableton) and require me to disable and re-enable the audio probably can be fixed if you use an external audio usb or from controller (I'm lazy I sometimes just use headphones from laptop). Ram is another issue, if you're going to use it with Traktor and ableton or serato and ableton for live mixing I'd suggest getting 3-4gb of ram, I start getting low mem warnings when running both on just 2gb of ram.

Since the GUI and all that stuff is offloaded onto the nvidia video card the netbook can devote more CPU to processing for audio so it works really well actually. I usually analyze tracks before mixing takes about 20 minutes with 40 tracks or so and dumping songs onto the decks doesn't cause any noticable lag/issues.

&gt;The purpose of praying is to establish a personal relationship with God
  
Although, for me even in my early years I never bought into that very idea of establishing a true relationship or direct communication line via prayer. Always sounded hokey to me. 

I do however subscribe to the notion that prayer actually *can* work in the same way that meditation or even how athletes visualizing success yields favorable outcomes. (ex. scoring winning basket or nailing a gymnastics routine)  Far fetched you might say, but focusing and training your brain for success *can* help, the same way catastrophizing may in fact assure doom.  

Don't get me wrong im **not** suggesting causality by means of prayer.  Instead, that focus and visualization postures your brain for success.

- Without the pre-workout meal, the pre-workout nutrition (what you consume 15-30 minutes prior in liquid form) becomes ever more important and much more substantial. If you do not have this part down to a tee, your performance could suffer.

- Regardless of whether you hit the per-workout nutrition (liquid) perfectly, there is just *some* reason that your strength levels go down. It is almost 100% consistent across the board that without one *solid* meal in you, you will not be as strong as you would have been given that meal. I don't know why pre-workout meal == strength, but it just does.

So omitting the pre-workout meal *might* make stool a bit worse (due to breaking the fast with fast absorbing liquids), makes the fast absorbing liquids much more important and prone to f--- up, and reduces maximal strength (which might be a moot point for fat loss and bodybuilding).","1309479280"

If you're getting bored together there's two ways out.  Kill the boredom or fall into a meaningless/dead relationship.

Ask yourself this why are you two bored?  What is driving this emotion?  To enjoy each other's presence in silence and loving it is one of the greatest feelings ever...  Until you get there consider alternatives:

1.  lie in bed discussing ideas, concepts, intellectual discussions, laugh at the dumb people you've encountered, laugh at yourselves and each other.

2.  When number 1 gets boring or you're out of ideas.  Mutually agree to not see each other until you've both finished at least one different thought provoking book.  Then go back to scenario 1 and you can discuss what you've learned and thought as can she.  And you've gotten greater insight and it's almost like reading two books for the price of one!

3.  1 and 2 can be repeated as often or as least often as needed for the entire life of your relationship.

4.  Go do random things for no other reason.  Go to that random park at 1am you've always passed by but never gone to.  Skip rocks in the pond while joking about the idea of getting busted after hours.

5.  Try psychedelics (if she's open to the idea) Eat some mushrooms, try LSD, whatever.

6.  Rearrange furniture, rooms, art, be creative.  If you don't like it you can always move it back.  If she's got posters and artwork on her walls.  See if she'll agree to both of you taking it carefully down. (promise her you'll help her return it to how it was if she doesn't like it)  and then do it to your room or vice versa.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Probably shouldn't say, but if you do talk to someone higher up in the company, do not be surprised if they say something like ""This very rarely / never happens."" because it happens a lot. My dad works for a UK carrier as a fraud and security investigations officer. He deals with all the internal fraud and such, and also the customer related situations that are going to require investigation and disciplinary action.

For example, there was recently a case where a child's phone had come back from repair, the SD card full of fairly hardcore pornography. He reassured the father of this child during his investigations that this very rarely happens. Not so. It happens a lot. This is because company policy states that when phones with SD cards come in, all the SD cards are removed and chucked into a bucket. The data is supposed to be wiped from them, but more often than not, a lazy tech will not clear them all. Then when someone grabs Little Tammy's 4GB MicroSD card from the bin, he's possibly grabbing Sir Big Pervy McSmackbottom's 4GB MicroSD card, filled with eye searing, hot thrusting, sweaty-backed action.

My advice would be to raise the matter with a higher up in the organisation. Ask if they will have an investigation's officer on the matter, and if they do, get his or her personal number or e-mail. They will most likely raise the matter with the police if it should come to that, but based on the evidence you have (Time of sending, phone number of guy at shop) and the paper trail that holds the phone in the shop's custody at the time, what will most likely happen is that Mr SlappyGiggles O'PervyPics will get slapped with a suspension or termination of employment. Depending on the content of the picture and local laws, there might be enough to prosecute, but I doubt it is worth it.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","He was a beserker. Every time that Foppa got the puck everyone held their breath because they knew that something impossible was most likely going to happen. 

IMHO he was the best passer that ever existed. Frequently he'd draw two defenders, he'd level one and fake the remaining out of his jock, pass up a shot and put the puck directly on the tape of a team mate. 

If Foppa was on the ice, every team mate kept their stick on the ice because the pass could come from anywhere at any time. In the early Denver days, Marc Crawford would be beside himself because Foppa would almost always pass up the shot in lieu of a picture perfect pass.

Yeah, he had a rep as a diver but he did whatever it took to win, all the while being very self effacing.

He'd get this ""look"" when he was about to unleash his havoc that would cause the hair on the back of your neck to stand up.  You'd be like, ""Oh Fuuuuck, here we go...""

Harrigan's - Is this just local? Maybe maybe not. They make a damn fine prime rib, which is only served after 5PM.  

LiteBite Mediterranean Cafe - I have heard some people complain about this place, but it is definitely one of my favorites. Get yourself the Gyro Supreme with Hot Sauce. Their baba ganoush is decent. 

One Guy's - Shoot yourself in the foot if you haven't had this place yet. Traditional Calzone is the way to go.

Star's And Stripe's Drive-In - DISCLAIMER: I used to work there. That being said, go eat a Chihuahua and watch a couple movies on the cheap.

(Taqueria) Jalisco's - That's some damn fine Mexican food.","1309479321"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I thought I did not need a degree. I had several years experience as a IT/Network technician and a few certs (A+, NET+, a couple OS certs). Then my job was cut and I found myself with a income and a family to support.  Unemployment only goes so far. So long story short, I enrolled into ITT after looking at several alternatives. While there I got a job at a local company performing help-desk work. A little simplified for my experience but paid the bills. While there I worked with career services and one day i got a call out of the blue. They needed a technician for 3 months worth of work on a military base in the clinic IT shop at 3x more current pay.

After a lot of soul searching and talking with the wife we decided it would be better for me since I would make in the 3 months what it would take me all year to make at my current job.

While I was there I was approached by another person at another company that had seen my knowledge and knew I was in school at ITT. They offered me a job at my now current pay rate but I had to move. Needless to say, I jumped on it. 

So for me my decision to go to ITT has not only be very beneficial but I have also learned a great deal. Even so much as I am now teaching the network admins some new things I just learned.

TL;DR lost my job, enrolled at ITT. Got job from it and now make bank and they pay for my school.","1309479323"

"selfhelp","t5_2qho7","Hey, I'm young (25) and I was just recently through some tough times, but nothing to the extent that you have been through. I will give you my input, and hopefully there is a thing or two that I say that may help you. Please take my advice with a huge grain of salt, if something resonates and helps you, good, otherwise know that it may make sense for you to completely ignore me.

First, there is going to be pain and you are going to feel sad. One thing I've learned about myself is that anything you hide or run from catches up with you sooner or later. Part of the healing process is crying, feeling the emotions that you feel, writing down and accepting the thoughts that you have repressed, and overall accepting anything that you have been in denial about. I once heard a quote, ""That which you resist, persists."" I would recommend meditating to get a better insight of what your thoughts are, a lot of resistance is ingrained deeply, and you really have to watch your thoughts closely to catch them --- meditating gives you greater awareness of your thoughts are. The weird thing is when you accept your sadness whenever it arises, the world slowly becomes a lighter and lighter place and it slowly becomes easier and easier to smile.

I think making a plan of action to get to where you want to go, and trying your best to follow through on that plan of action is important. Seeing a therapist, placing yourself in situations to make friends, explaining yourself to your bf and asking for forgiveness, etc. 

What I can say is that if you accept where you are, and decide you will do what it takes to accept, work with, overcome, be at peace with what has happened in your life when you come out the other side (will take a long time) you will be a tremendously strong and beautiful character. The journey will teach you many lessons and you will grow as a person. If you decide that you'd rather hide from your shadows, they will be with you for the rest of your life. After the traumas you have suffered, pain is part of the healing process and you have to deal with it sooner or later.

The journey will surely be a long one, so try to cultivate self-love because it will make the journey easier. One thing I am starting to do every morning is spending 10 minutes straight writing all the reasons I love myself. I figure it'll plant the seeds for positive self-loving thoughts in my mind. Avoid unnecessary stressful situations, try your best to be forgiving of yourself, eat well, get rest, get exercise, take vitamins. 

Again, I'm young, no psychology or psychiatry background. Just someone who has been through some relative tough times recently, but nothing to the extent that you have been through. This is just my very amateur take of your situation. Best of luck.","1309479329"

If you tamper with that, then EVE would not EVE but one of many Free to play games. I'm sure I can be proven wrong but EVE is a niche game and real time SP is one of the biggest selling point. 

I started EVE because I hated grinding after I leave the game for awhile. When you start up again, you'll have to grind back up to be usable and all of your epic items are trash now so you have to grind that too. If we allow purchase of SP, then EVE should go to F2P or P2W. 

I am currently playing World of Tanks. I can purchase tanks that speeds up my income and experience. The problem is, if they shut down tomorrow, I would find another 1 of many F2P games. Do I like it? Yes. Do want them to keep going? yes, since I finally got tier 4 tanks. If EVE shuts down, I'd have a problem because of my built up SP, my ships, stuff and friends would not be there.

The Germans have been joined by the Swiss, Italians, Thai, Japan (probably) to add to multiple other countries that already refused to allow nukes to be built. Even China is reducing plans for new nukes and increasing its renewable energy targets due to Fukushima: http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/id90t/chinese_provinces_suspend_nuclear_power_plant/

You're badly misinformed about running costs of solar (close to zero) and wind power. Nukes cost billions to build, a lot to run and billions to decommission. Then there's the waste that needs storing for 100,000+ years. Who knows what that cost will be - including the inevitable radiation leaks that will kill.

For someone who claims to be studying nukes, you don't seem to know much about what is going on. My advice: abandon the nuke studies and get in to renewable tech - that's the future.","1309479348"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I'm a 26-year old male programmer and I think your guy's behaviour sounds a lot like me a couple years back when I was in school... super focused on learning to program and terrible at detaching from my work. 

My girlfriend, who I've been dating since I was 19 and am now engaged to, used to complain about similar things -- I wouldn't talk about non-technical things, wouldn't do nice things for her, wouldn't just spend time with her (I was either coding or wanted to be alone). I was also distracted during sex because I couldn't stop thinking about the project du jour. I also drank alcohol to help shut my brain off; it never got too bad, but I was concerned about it becoming a habit sometimes. 

Honestly, I wonder why she stuck with me sometimes.

I still am like that a bit when I get going on some project, but something has changed in the last few years. Programming is the sort of thing that demands 100% attention in order to do effectively. That sort of focus will mess with your head if you keep it up more than a few hours a day (the 8 hour work day is a myth), and it can be *very* frustrating when you aren't able to give it 100%.

One thing that helped is that I stopped being so focused on programming and tried to branch out into learning more about science and history. That helped keep my head on straight about how unimportant the minutiae that I was spending so much time on is. Gaining confidence that I actually do know what I'm doing, enough humility to admit when I don't know something instead of pretending to know everything, and realizing the importance of good communication skills also helped keep my head on straight.

Something you might try is to take an interest in his work. Ask him what he's working on and what he's struggling with, then keep asking questions to help him reason through the problem. That may sound a bit odd -- wouldn't it just encourage him to spend more time thinking about technical stuff? how will I be able to understand what he's doing? -- but talking through programming problems is a [tried and true method](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking) of problem solving. Your questions may help get a problem out of his head, make him see you as a partner, and can be an opening to discussing things that you actually want to talk about. :)

I could go on, but if you have any particular questions to help understand what's going on in his head, I'd be glad to answer them. The important thing is that the positive things you mentioned about him (""I love him very much and we are compatible in so many ways. He really is a great guy and caring boyfriend"") are the important parts. Stress management and work-life balance are skills that have to be learned.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","For me, it's just one of those games that becomes much better with co-op.  If you're playing through it with someone, you're both leveling up together and exploring the city and if you have some creativity then you can make the game fun for a long time by creating your own things to do.

Not to mention the Keys to the City DLC which is free and adds even more replayability.  Basically it lets you spawn any item whenever you want, and if I recall correctly it lets you max out all your abilities.  I'll give you an example of a game my friend and I created with this:

Basically, there's an area of the highway that stretches around the world where there is a fairly sharp corner and cars won't be able to put the brakes on if something is in the road (for those who played the game, it's the area right outside the cave connected to the abandoned quarry).  So we would spawn some ramp trucks, put them right in the middle of each lane in the highway and creep forward until cars started spawning.  The cars would come speeding around the bend, launch off the ramp and get sent flying.  Whoever could launch a car the farthest would win.  And when there's a big pile of cars, you can just blow everything up with your maxed out explosion skill and cluster grenades (practically a mini-nuke) and start over.  

I don't remember how we figured out that cars won't slow down around that bend, but it's just an example of how you can find something interesting in the game by exploring and then use it to create something fun.  As a general rule of thumb, ramp trucks make everything better.

It's one of those games where you can think to yourself ""You know what would be hilariously fun?"" and then just experiment with your superpowers and items until you find something that works.  

And even if you're not the type of person who likes to play games like that, it's still a blast to jump from rooftop to rooftop and go completely overboard in killing enemies.  Is one guy shooting you from far away and annoying you?  Teach him a lesson with a semi truck to the face.  Group of enemies/civilians clustered together?  Use your spring-jumping SUV to squish them all at once.

So basically, it's a lot of fun.","1309479357"

That is in keeping with the 1st step that you are ""powerless."" I understand the way they spin this to mean you don't have control over everything and you should let go, in a zen way. I agree with that approach, but the other definition is enforced as well. You are nothing, you will never be able to live without the support of AA. You are in for life. The longer you attend, the more you are driven deeper into the vault of an AA identity and an oddly proud ""otherness"" which rejects ""normies"" (those who aren't hopeless lifelong alcoholics) for the safe womb of only associating with other members.

UltraDavid of http://www.dpgatlaw.com/, who is a real laywer, with a real law degree, thinks this bill is an absolutely terrible idea. He's also a commentator for the Fighting Game Community and is regularly seen on leveluplive's stream, every Wednesday night, for Wednesday Night Fights, and does commentary for many major FG tournaments.

He probably has a more valid opinion than you do.

The simple fact is that the proposed law encompasses too many thing due to it's vague wording, and the distribution of copyright materials is already covered under civil laws. Game companies turn a blind eye to streaming of their games to other people because the presentation of their games via streaming media gives them exposure (which is a good thing, since video games are an interactive medium, which is completely different from movies/cinema.)

Even game companies are upset about the proposed law because it means they no longer have control enforcing copyrights for their own products. It is currently equating streaming of games to, effectively, the resale of illegal replications of games, which is simply fucking moronic, but because it is now considered a *criminal matter* would be enforced by the government, and not the companies that actually produce the content.","1309479364"

Of course it's a fuel, and it's actually quite good on its own.  That said, you are correct that it wouldn't be worth doing now if the government cut oil subsidies tomorrow.  However, it could be worth doing if more non-petroleum energy infrastructure went up.  Particularly nuclear, solar and wind, as none of those translate well into vehicle power supplies.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","-make jewelry with your bridesmaids to wear at the wedding. It can be a bonding thing, and can be done relatively cheap (someone said she was part of a group who did this so I'm just re-stating her idea because it sounds awesome.)

-let bridesmaids provide their own jewelry and shoes to go with their dress. Since they will be picking out a dress (or using one they already have) that's more their style, then presumably they should have at least something that goes with it. Think pearls, or simple chains.

-Personally, I wouldn't require them dishing out on mani/pedis for the big day. It's a fun, girly bonding thing, but you can just as easily do them at home for a fraction of the cost.

-hair and makeup: again, something that I don't think bridesmaids should have to pay for themselves. If a bride is that concerned her ladies need to look professionally done, then she should probably be shelling out at least some money towards that herself. (Note- slightly biased towards not having make-up done professionally since the two times I've seen it done on my already gorgeous cousin for a wedding she ends up looking like crap because it's so overdone and just not her.)

D-Day is Aug. 7th because that's the first pre-season game, the HoF game played at Canton between the Bears and the Rams. 
If a expedited free agency period and something that resembles a training camp can happen in time before that game, we'll have a season. The closer we get to that game the bleaker the outlook gets.

My opinion? They'll get it done as long as they can pick up the pace. Time is running out and there's a lot of work to do, meeting only a few days a week right now isn't helping.

Killers in Eden is about cooperative hunts on gray whales between a pod of orcas and a whaling family on the southeast coast of Australia.   

From personal experience, I have had numerous interactions with cetaceans, many of which highlight their extreme charisma, intelligence, and curiosity.

* (c) The constitutional powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief to  introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations  where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the  circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2)  specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by  attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed  forces.

* [War Powers Resolution](http://www.policyalmanac.org/world/archive/war_powers_resolution.shtml)

&gt; The current U.S. military operations in Libya are consistent with the War Powers Resolution and do not under that law require further congressional authorization, because U.S. military operations are distinct from the kind of “hostilities” contemplated by the Resolution.

To be clear...You are no longer making the argument that the war is constitutional because we are in the UN? And are now making the argument that the military dropping bombs on foreign countries is not a hostile act covered under the War Powers Resolution? 

If Pakistan launched 100+ tomahawk cruise missiles, conducted recon missions into our country, sent their intel services into our country, provided refueling operations for Iran as they bombed our country and dropped JDAMS on the White House...You do not think we would view that as a hostile act? 

&gt; Is SCOTUS the only arbitrator of what is constitutional? 'Sole arbitrator' is not a term I used. The main thrust of my argument was that your opinion that something is unconstitutional doesn't make it unconstitutional. It is open to interpretation.

I agree, some racists thought that 'separate but equal' was constitutional. It obviously wasn't. I have provided very clear evidence that this operation is not constitutional. 

&gt; Does judicial stripping exist? Yes it does, but it is limited to appellate jurisdiction. SCOTUS cannot be stripped of original jurisdiction. I did clumsily respond to this point.

* In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction

The Supreme Court's power of judicial review is derived from appellate jurisdiction. I agree that Congress cannot prevent the Supreme Court from hearing cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party. We, of course, are not talking about original jurisdiction though.

* the President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation --Obama

And as for making different parts quickly?  have you ever used a 3D printer?  They are insanely slow.  They are useful for creating prototype parts, or one off plastic parts.  For anything else there is mass production.  Just the injection plastic itself is way more expensive than anything you can make with it, if it is mass produced.  ","1309479399"

"Bass","t5_2qpc3","Solo bass: [Michael Manring - Soliliquy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eTBc7aWBGw) - Arguably the most influentual bass album I've yet experienced. Completely rewrote the way I looked at the instrument.

Bass/Drums Duo: [Ruins - Pallaschtom](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHrZ3_Ru040) - These guys (4 different bassists over time, same drummer) have been making batshit crazy prog rock/noise for the past 25+ years. The last bassist left around 2005 and the drummer/mastermind of the band has been doing solo shows and reinterpretations with a saxophonist since then. 

Full Band: [Unexpect - Fables of the Sleepless Empire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Ks7EnZ_E) - Just released but rocketed to the top almost instantly. There's a lot going on in their songs (which stylistically speaking are something like Cirque de Soleil gone insane meets technical death metal meets symphonic electronic *something*) but somehow their bassist (on a 9-string behemoth of a bass) manages to steal the show. Amazing work in both high and low registers.

[Behold the Arctopus - Nano Nucleonic Cyborg Summoning](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEX4BQ72lNA) - Sort of cheating since the band technically doesn't have a bass player but rather a Warr Guitar player, which is a sort of reinterpretation of the Chapman stick that can still be played like a guitar. Incredible, complex, atmospheric instrumental math metal.

[Intronaut - Prehistoricisms](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNkRnMGEHVY) - Joe Lester, the 5 string fretless bassist for Intronaut, has some of the most tasteful bass playing I've heard in metal, on this album especially. He gets some good lead parts and uses some particularly beautiful chords.

[Marvin's Revolt - Patrolling the Heights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb2MsSolDvU) - Sheer toe tapping, no-nonsense rock. It's a shame these guys broke up recently as I just discovered them only a short time ago, but their last two albums were just about perfect.","1309479406"

I know when I went to college, what I learned and what I then applied in practice (on Co-Ops and in subsequent jobs) is a LOT different and often contradictory.

But, I had to go to college because my 12 years of development experience before college is often looked at as being ""Not real work"" (words from one potential employer).  Funny enough, I mostly rely on my work experience over my college experience (good for theory and what to strive to, but not necessarily practical).

I guess that's why our career counselors at college said the recommended order for resumes is Name/Contact (of course), Objective, Education, Skills, and then Work Experience.

Btw, I was ultimately offered a job at that ""not real work"" company and turned them down.  They were jerks on so many levels.

"Intactivists","t5_2si5s","i was just reading about the rabbi yitzchok fischer of new york, who infected a number (it is impossible to say exactly how many) of children with herpes by using a centuries-old traditional method of circumcision. he came to the public attention after one infant died. the health department of new york, knowing the demographics of their population, has made no attempt to ban this particular practice, but has merely discouraged it; to which the orthodox community (or one segment of it, at least) has replied, ""sorry, this is just what we do.""

herpes is an incurable infection, but generally not fatal, and as far as we know only one child has died from this particular practice. just hypothetically, if the city or state of new york were to attempt to regulate this practice, is the occasional death or infection of a child enough to meet the standard of strict scrutiny? or do you think that orthodox jews are entitled to a religious exemption in this case?

i bring it up because it (oral suction, or metzitzeh b'peh) seems to lie on the borderline between the obvious, unprotected neglect of the followers of christ church and the protected, very minor harm associated with normal (i.e. non-oral) circumcision. can or should this practice be prohibited, in your view?

comparing it to the tattooing case, most religious circumcisions occur in the home, not a medical setting, and are performed by people who are not (correct me if i am wrong here) licensed surgeons or medical professionals. is it reasonable to expect that, if we must cut off part of a child's genitals, we do it in as safe a manner as possible? or is genital surgery rightly the province of some fervent religious individual with a blade?

and if genital surgery should be performed only by medical professionals, how exactly does it fit with the hypocratic oath to ""do no harm""? accepting that genital dismemberment represents at least some (minimal) harm, and is not a treatment for any existing or future ill, is it right for a doctor to perform it?

i also refer you also to the case of keemonta peterson, charged with assault and criminal mistreatment for circumcising her son with a box cutter and pliers (again, in my state. is it something in the water?) http://www.khq.com/story/14410727/oregon-woman-faces-charges-in-home-circumcision

ms. peterson felt in all sincerity that circumcision was her religious duty, and when she screwed it up (again, she is no medical professional) she sought medical attention. her son may well recover full use of his genitals (that portion of them remaining, of course). is it right to charge her?","1309479451"

&gt; 'Revolution' is no longer a pretentious or condescending term, but a material and political reality

'Hipster' Ron Paul and his 9/11-truther-fringe-racist-basement fans have been using this word for near 4 years now for that exact reason. 'The revolution is alive and well' is something said by Paul on many occasions, it is.

We are already seeing an intellectual revolution with regards to government power, and the crony policies they implement.

People are waking up, and seeing clearly that the government as a whole no longer serves the interests of the people, but the interests of a select few at the expense of the people.

"sandiego","t5_2qq2q","Hi my name is Dan, owner of OnFrontStreet.com. Im new to reddit, and still learning but I love all the feedback I'm getting from it. 

I want to thank everyone who has checked out and liked our California Burrito Flag t-shirt. I want to let you know that these t-shirts are printed on The Anvil 979 100% preshrunk heavyweight cotton. We have a few sticker packs available on the site as well as some other tees we designed. 

I know $25 seems a little steep for a t-shirt, especially since we are online only and charge for shipping on top of that. We are a very small operation that wants to create something unique and take it to the next level, that's why we took the time to design it, pick a quality blank to print on, and wrap each individual shirt like a burrito in the yellow wrapping paper, just like an actual burrito shop. 

This is really only for true California Burrito fans. We do a lot of social media promotions where you can get deals or free shipping for your next order, so if you like what you see, add us on Twitter, Facebook, &amp; Tumblr and stay tuned for our giveaways, contests, and deals.

If you are too frugal or think its priced ridiculously, then this is not for you. Go spend $6 on a blank tee at Wal-Mart that will eventually get the blown-out bacon neck, or perhaps that same $10 Old Navy tee that everyone has. But don't get me wrong,  I really do value your feedback, this will help my small company with future projects.

Also for those who are interested, we are currently working on getting actual flags done. Stayed tuned on our FB or Twitter page for more info on when that becomes available. 

I would like to hear what you think. Im open to suggestions, feedback, and harsh criticism.

Thanks everyone!

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This guy has a few flaws in his argument:

1.  The claims that by not washing your hands after you pee spreads deadly coliform bacteria everywhere and that everything is going to get infected because of it.
Now, yes there is bacteria down there. But it's also on your arms, your face, ***your hands***. Take a microbiology class. Wash your hands and do it like your life depends on it. Now take a standard agar plate and wipe your freshly clean fingers on it.  (make sure you don't touch anything after you wash your hands, make sure they air dry!!)
Now store it in any kind of incubator and you will see that bacteria will grow rampantly. But wait, you put your hands in your mouth, and your girlfriend puts your dick in her mouth! Even then you aren't going to get an infection because the dose is too small. Your frontline immune defenses will take care of it without even looking up.
As for infecting everything, bacteria (like us) need a fairly specific environment in order for them to live. A door handle for example isn't very hospitable to the kind of bacteria that live on our skin. They will die fairly quickly after being put there.

2.  (sorry, I know this is picky) but I think this is something EVERYONE should know. A woman's vagina **does not lead to her urethra**. Shocking, I know! So it wouldn't make much sense to say that bacteria get on the surface of a vagina, a penis rams them in like a civil war cannon, and the woman gets a bladder infection. There are 2 holes people!

The budget was exceedingly low. The main thing that The Asylum is known for spending money on is cool box covers since that's what's going to pull in a casual video browser, but not the production itself. And yes, CGI footage was flipped and repeated just to save money. I'm sure the flipping had you fooled, right? You totally thought that it was completely new footage, right? Sure you did.

Technically, the other Mega variations weren't actually sequels since there were no repeated characters. I think they just figured they had created a brand recognition with the word ""Mega"" so they were going to keep on cranking it out.

Sean Lawlor who played Lamar is a native Irishman so he has a genuine Irish accent. Was he referred to as Scottish in the movie? If so, I assume that was a line that should have been changed to fit Sean but wasn't. Sadly, Sean passed away a few months after Mega Shark was released","1309479481"

"IWantOut","t5_2r5hw","I've made good money with my content on my web site, and believe I will via the ebooks too (I've made my living almost exclusively online via my site the last 10 years). The original poster asked for ways to make money from anywhere online, and that's exactly what I've been doing. The ebooks were but one of three methods I described in my original post to this thread, with all of them meant to work together.

Ebooks are new to me, because I waited until the market had became more coherent and easier and more cost-effective to enter (it was utter chaos for many years). But I've done books before. In the 1980s I desktop published on demand a high priced small business manual that I sold through a company that made some of the tools and supplies described in the book (so we both made money). But I've also made money writing manuals for corporate engineers. 

The first ebooks I've published contain content I did not expect to ever be among my top sellers, but rather content I knew I could get out the door the fastest and easiest, and thereby create a new product line while also learning the ropes of the new business. Have I had sales? Yes. But so far those revenues only amount to a small percentage of what I make with my web site. But my web site is much better established than the ebooks. I expect that to change.

At one time my web site made far less money than my ebooks do today. In fact, compared to how gradual the ramp up of income from my web site was in the early days, my ebooks are taking off like a rocket! Ha, ha. But I simply expect more from a venture now than I did then-- partly because my bills are lots bigger.

The ebook market is still tiny compared to what it's going to be. Shakeouts of various ebook readers and formats are still going on. So far as ebooks are concerned, it's like the internet just before a decent mainstream web browser came along. But at least some of those guys who got in around then ended up making the big bucks, in the long run. Sometimes in surprising ways.

I'm an entrepreneur. I try to get in at the right moment: not too early, and not too late. Doing that might mean not making much money at first. But it might also mean making a killing down the road. And I've made a few decent killings before.","1309479505"

Stand in front of a mirror and look at your shoulders. Do they slouch forward? If so, that means your spine is not supporting them, your muscles are, hence back pain.

Then, another test, sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front so that your torso and legs make an ""L"" shape, [like this](http://www.yogatic.com/yoga-dictionary/dandasana/), (but you don't need to raise your arms). Can you sit upright with a straight back without using your hands? If not, you have tight hip/buttock muscles, which includes any muscle that attaches at the head of the femur in the pelvis. So, this includes hamstrings, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, piriformus, etc. If these muscles are tight it prevents proper postural alignment, and that will lead to a sore back.

The best thing I ever did to eliminate back pain while sitting was to learn yoga. Now I do sit upright, I can sit like the woman in the picture, and there is no back pain.

I've done most of my sitting on a bench.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","The laws seem poorly enforced, as well as laws relating to maintenance of the land.  From how the article described the land before it was moved onto, it would seem to indicate that the requirements were met in all but writing, i.e. the land was godawfully derelict with no one tending it, someone needed to live there to maintain it and bring it back up to the standards the law hold and orchard, and it was the owners responsibility to tend it.  The reason the requirement wasn't met in writing was because no one paid enough attention to the land to file the necessary paperwork.  Kind of like that quote in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy; when the electricity bill isn't being paid, the power stays on until you do pay the bill in which case the electric company notices you and promptly shuts it off.

The shows talk about Miyamoto, Bushnell along others who have their roots in console gaming.  Perhaps they spend a few seconds talking about iD.

"teaching","t5_2qyj9","&gt;~ Ask the whole class to just ignore the 1 distraction (person) so this person doesnt get the attention they want.

Do your students actually do this when you ask them to?  Mine would just give that student more attention.

&gt;~For two people, have them complete a behavior essay or a my side of the story and see who did what. This can be shown to parents/admin. if something habitual starts. 

It's great to document repeated or severe incidents, but writing a behavior *essay* for talking when they weren't supposed to seems overly harsh

&gt;~Ask students to summarize/paraphrase/draw pics of the instructions to give them something to do during instructions. 

Do you actually check to see that they do this?  Again this is overkill imo, unless you are giving particularly long/detailed instructions.

&gt;Offer a treat (peppermint) if everyone can do the assignment without talking after the instructions are given. This holds everyone accountable.

Personally I disagree with the idea of candy as reward.  First of all for nutritional reasons, and secondly it gives them the wrong reason to want to do the work.

&gt;~Contact home and tell talk to someone there if possible

This.  Some parents have little to no authority over their children.  But this covers your butt if/when the students' behavior get worse, as it often does.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","&gt;That's all you do in an argument. The most recent one being the myth of Jesus is automatically falsified by the fact no one raises from the dead.

It's part of the Christ hypothesis that people don't normally rise from the dead. If Christ rose from the dead and ascended to heaven, there would be no remains of him on Earth (and most scholars do give credibility to the historocity of Christ), thus if you did find his corpse you did in fact falsify Christianity. Saying people don't rise from the dead and so it is falsified is not what falsification means. Falsification means that a specific claim was shown to be false. 

I didn't run-away. [I got karmajacked by you](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/i2zir/so_since_osiris_and_adonis_and_baccuss_bodies/) and there was no more room to have a discussion with people who weren't intellectually equipped to have it.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Well said, but realistically innaccurate. For the record I am an addiction counselor speciilized in opiate addiction and the neuphysiology of addiction. There is phsyiological addiction, which includes the process of tolerance and withdrawal as well as the neurobiological effects leading to craving of the drug and addictive behaviors. The term ""psychological addiction"" is actually nonsense. There are people that use a chemical regularly that don't develop a biological need for the drug, that is to say their brain chemistry doesn't change as a result of the drug, but those people can stop at any time with no problems except for the fact that they don't want to. Many marijuana users fall into this category, although marijuana is addictive and does create a tolerance and withdrawal syndrome, it is not highly addictive but it does happen. 

Most people call habitual behavior ""psychological addiction"" but it really isn't addiction at all. All that is is that someone has been using for so long they just use without thinking, as though on autopilot. It is like a person who has the exact same morning ritual (shave, shower, dress, coffee, check email, go to work) that they do every single day for years. They have done it so much they don't have to think about it, and if they tried to do it differently it would be exceedingly difficult to the point of feeling impossible. Nobody refers to this behavior as ""psychological addiction"", but absent the brain chemical changes incolved with true addiction they are effectively the same. Of course, habituation of behavior is a neural process as well as the brain builds stronger neural pathways each time you do an activity until it can be done with no attention given, but we consider it more psychological than biological for whatever reason. 

Sorry for the rant, but I really hate the term psychological addiction because it implies that some addiction is nore ""real"" than others and those that are psychologically addicted are just weak willed. In reality if you have an alteration of the mesolimbic reward pathway to adapt to the presence of a drug or behavior causing less sensitivity to it, that is addiction. Anything beside that event is something other than addiction and is addressed in a very different way and deserves its own termonology to avoid confusion. For the record all ""drugs of abuse"" and addictive bahvors make these physical and chemical changes in the reward pathway.","1309479563"

I think it is the reason this subreddit loves Hitchens.  Hitchens doesn't back down and he doesn't give a fuck if his opinion is going to ruffle some feathers.  

This is also the reason everyone loved it when Republic Senator Roy McDonald came out and said, ""You get to the point where you evolve in your life where everything isn't black and white, good and bad, and you try to do the right thing.

Strego got **incredibly** useful lores like Pearl Wind, ForceField, Sour Mouth, Blowfish, and GrandTrain. Relm has the highest starting magic but was a utility character at best, usually using control to cast blue magic back to Strego. Control would disable an enemy allowing continuous steal attempts as well. Sketch was terrible... so... so terrible. To give you an idea of how good magic is... at cap, Relm can do over 6000 damage to enemies in the dinosaur forest with one Ice 1 (weakness).

Characters built to be jack-of-all-trades are generally weaker than dedicated classes. Unless you reach magic cap, then go into strength to Offering + Genji Glove spam. I'd use Strego and Relm over Gogo, Umaro, Setzer, and Cyan any day.

This is all pointless though, the game can be beaten without equipping a single Esper. Quite easily in fact. It matters a little more if you plan to do the GBA bonus dungeon. Or just DualCast Quick + Ultima.

"microgrowery","t5_2s5jo","If you are using incandescent light bulbs then there is your problem.  They put off almost no light that plants can use. Sound like they stretched a bunch in search of light but just didnt have enough usable light to keep going and turned yellow and died.  

Go pick up some CFL bulbs and try and get a few of each spectrum (2700K warm and 6500K cool).  Use the cool bulbs from sprouting until you decide you want to change the lights to 12/12 for flower then use the warm ones.  The more light the better so if you can find some old desk lamps for cheap at a flea market and put 26 watt or higher CFL bulbs in them you can probably get away with 4 per plant through flower and have a nice yield.

Also for soil it isnt bad to use MC or other big name soil brands but I would highly recommend cutting it with 50% perlite which you should be able to find easy in any garden section.  It will help a lot with drainage and decrease the likelihood you will over water them and get root rot or something.  

Getting some mylar or other reflective surface will help get more of the light to your plants as well instead of being wasted lighting the surrounding area.

Other than that just make sure you have good air flow around the plants once they start to grow and that will help further strengthen the branches.

And no not all strains are equal but unless it is strait from brazil or somewhere you shouldn't be all that disappointed.  If you are looking for a certain strain or just good seeds in general then hit up the link on the right ""click here if you.."" and they have a list of trusted seed sites.","1309479587"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","It's not _uncommon_, although as one ages it should become fairly rare, and it doesn't happen to everyone. It _is_ potentially associated with narcolepsy, a disease whose primary characteristic is the blurring of the lines between REM sleep and other phases. The symptom of the narcoleptic that usually brings him to a physician is insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. That said, lots of people have episodes of sleep paralysis and don't have narcolepsy, and one can't diagnose the latter just because of the former.

Although frightening, it's completely harmless. It's a continuation of the atonia (= lack of muscle tone) that prevails in REM sleep during the awake phase. Normally your brain turns off motor signals to the muscles during REM sleep, ostensibly to keep people from acting out their dreams and hurting themselves. The eye muscles and the diaphragm are not paralyzed, allowing eye movements and breathing. The lack of tone can also make certain muscular structures more saggy and thereby worsen obstructive sleep apnea.

When waking out of REM, normally this inhibition should be broken, and normal muscle tone restored; in sleep paralysis it remains low for a short period of time. It's mediated by multiple nuclei in the midbrain and pons, and descending inhibitory fibers.

Some people report they remain frozen until someone touches them, or even just calls their name.

The lack of paralysis during REM, what's called REM without atonia, is also a condition, most significantly encountered in REM behavior disorder (RBD). These patients really do act out their dreams, and can injure themselves or their bed partners, to the extent that wives or husbands sleep in separate beds. They can break stuff around the bed as well. A large proportion of patients with RBD will go on to have Parkinson's disease. This may reflect the pattern of pathology within the brainstem that eventually leads to the classical loss of substantia nigra neurons causing Parkinsonism.","1309479590"

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","&gt;514.2. Second, the following actions happen simultaneously: all damage marked on permanents (including phased-out permanents) is removed and all “until end of turn” and “this turn” effects end. 
This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.  
Edit: to clarify this is under the Cleanup Step section

As long as Virulent wounds trigger is a ""'this turn' effect"" they shouldn't get a counter. To me it would appear that Virulent Wound has the effect of creating a triggered ability and the triggered ability doesn't have a lifetime (meaning it's always around checking if that creature dies this turn, using it's definitions of ""that creature"" and ""this turn"" based on when it was created); it seems to fall under the definition of a triggered ability and not under the definition of an effect.

&gt;603.1. Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect. They are written as “[Trigger 
condition], [effect],” and begin with the word “when,” “whenever,” or “at.” They can also be 
expressed as “[When/Whenever/At] [trigger event], [effect].”

&gt;603.7. An effect may create a delayed triggered ability that can do something at a later time. A delayed 
triggered ability will contain “when,” “whenever,” or “at,” although that word won’t usually begin 
the ability. 

&gt;603.7b A delayed triggered ability will trigger only once—the next time its trigger event occurs—
unless it has a stated duration, such as “this turn.” 

&gt;609.1. An effect is something that happens in the game as a result of a spell or ability. When a spell, 
activated ability, or triggered ability resolves, it may create one or more one-shot or continuous 
effects. Static abilities may create one or more continuous effects. Text itself is never an effect.

It's a lot of semantics but it seems to me it would trigger; 603.7b would indicate it should still trigger (not the contrary), it is still ""this turn"" as the turn hasn't ended yet and the effect is still around. This is complicated though, please let me know if you want any clarifications on my thoughts.

Edit: This is how I see the breakdown of the spell:  
*""When that creature is put into a graveyard this turn, its controller gets a poison counter.""*  
Everything inside the quotes is an effect of the spell, that being a delayed triggered ability that gets created.

Now from all of this in order for it to not create a poison counter this is how I think it should read:  
*[Until end of turn ""when that creature is put into a graveyard this turn, its controller gets a poison counter.""]*

Everything in brackets being the effect of the spell and the quotes holding the delayed triggered ability; with this wording it should be clear (I hope) that the effect (that being the delayed triggered ability existing) would end at the same time as giant growth wears off and therefore when state based actions put the creature in the graveyard the trigger is no longer around to see it happen. This seems unnecessarily redundant and results in the spell not doing what most people probably think it should do.","1309479600"

Ten bucks says they have phone carrier records of a call from him to her from within the charging state or they never would have even charged him.  Whether they can charge her is another question.  She wasn't in that state, but she did do something from across the border that she clearly intended to have all of its effects in that state.  That might be enough to support jurisdiction.

"technology","t5_2qh16","States don't have dominion outside of their own borders, for one thing. That's the constitutional issue. There's a more practical issue as well. 

In NY, where I live, the sales tax you pay usually varies by county. There's a state sales tax, which adds a certain percentage to the sale, and then there is a county sales tax on top of that. There may even be a third level in some places (NYC?), but I'm not sure of that. It gets complicated even within one state.

There are 50 states in the union, and I'm guessing that sales tax applies in most of these states. Amazon, just as an example, sells more than books. It sells all kinds of items. Sales tax usually applies to some items and not others. Sometimes there are even tax holidays which apply to some items and not others. 

A national, mail order retailer is currently exempt from worrying about these sorts of things. If some kind of national law is passed, it's not only going to affect big shots like Amazon, everyone who sells from one state to another will be affected. Figuring out the sales tax for each locality will be bad enough; they will then have to *pay* each separate locality. I'm going to guess that each locality has its own peculiar rules as to how this is done. It will be a nightmare for interstate commerce -- just the kind of thing the Constitution was set up to prevent.","1309479610"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","They're not really cliches if they don't actually recur throughout the series.  They're just things that annoyed you *once or twice*.

I haven't had any interest in Final Fantasy since XII, but let's be fair...you can't list four non-overlapping protagonist types across six or seven games and then say they're *always* there.  In a game where one of those protagonist types exists, the others do not, which is kind of disproving your own point.  What you mean to say is, ""Well, there were those two or three times with the evil empire, and that one time with the evil corporation trying to take over the world...""

Also, on the protagonist, what you're really saying is, ""I was annoyed by that one game with the street urchin and those three games with the amnesiac, and I think there was something about an instrument of the gods.""  

Also, on the subject of princesses and high ranking female members, it would be more accurate for you to voice your complaint as, ""Then there were the two or three games where the protagonist falls in love with a powerful female character...oh, and then there's comic relief.""

These statements are far more accurate but they fall apart because they actually show that Square-Enix varies its character relationships and backgrounds and protagonist types.  There are a lot of things it tends to do repetitively (feminine male heroes, cosmic threats, last minute twist villains) and some things it experimented with but abandoned (powerful female love interest for the hero, amnesia as a plot point).","1309479625"

GRR Walder Frey, but he is not wrong. It is unclear why any bannerman should let 1000s of his men die in order to avenge 1 random rich dead guy. And why should it matter which dead man you follow, they are all the same: lannisters, starks, tyrells. It makes no difference to Frey because it makes no difference to the small folk at all.

"apple","t5_2qh1f","Since you have a new MBP it is likely that the battery is not yet properly calibrated, i.e. the MBP doesn’t really know how charged your battery is and how long it will last. Let it run down (you can use it during that time) until it goes to sleep and keep the MBP sleeping over night. After the next full recharge you should get better numbers.

If your battery is, in fact, properly calibrated and still shows bad numbers you can look whether anything is straining your battery. Open up Activity Monitor to see which apps stress your CPU. You might also want to turn the brightness down. You shouldn’t, however, have to turn the brightness uncomfortably dim to get those seven hours. If you have to, then there might be something wrong with your battery. (Also, if you don’t get seven hours with wireless turned on don’t try and turn wireless off. Those seven hours include WiFi usage and you should get seven hours with WiFi turned on.)

For a preliminary test [check out this freeware](http://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/). If you don’t want to use this freeware you can check System Profiler (it’s inside the Utilities folder in the Applications folder). Go to Power on the left side and check what it says next to Full Charge Capacity (mAh). If you have a 13"" MBP you should have around 5800 mAh, a 15"" should have about 7080 mAh. I don’t know about the 17"".

If you have significantly less full charge capacity you should talk to Apple and they will replace your battery.","1309479646"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Early-game budget tips:

Step 1.) Don't build police or fire stations until you have crime/fires.

Step 2.) Don't build water pipes until you're ready for your residents to move up to middle class: this means having a school.

Step 3.) Agriculture takes up way too much space for the amount of jobs it creates. Unless you are trying for the farmer's market or a ""farming town,"" I wouldn't bother building farms.

Step 4.) Don't build clinics until you're ready for residents to move up to higher class. This means having an effective education system, water, low crime, and nearby recreational facilities.

Step 5.) Pay attention to your demand bars - they are ""city-wide"" demands but you should place: industry within driving distance of unemployed people (they have a briefcase over their house), commercial within driving distance of any residencies, and residencies near commercial and industrial areas with low employees (use the ""query"" tool to see how many people a business employs.) This will prevent buildings from ever becoming abandoned, unless your land value goes down.

5.) It is possible to build a city using nothing wind-power and still stay within a budget, I start it with every city, especially on the hardest difficulty.

6.) Cheat codes don't really help you stay within budget. Also, some of them (such as the opera house) are actually detrimental for larger cities, as they have a ""maximum usage"" stat which, when overloaded, lowers your education rating.

Other tips:

High-wealth residents won't ride the bus, but will ride a subway.

Industry sends ""trucks"" to other cities, adding to traffic. Place industry near the borders of your city to reduce traffic.

Don't build an airport as soon as your advisors tell you. It will really not help at first unless you have a high commercial demand.

Citizens/businesses don't build ""high"" or ""medium"" density buildings until certain population milestones are reached. If you're playing an easy difficulty, it can help to just zone everything as high-density so they auto-upgrade once the limit is reached. Otherwise, you'll have to rezone.

Parks and trees reduce air pollution, but it is almost impossible to eliminate traffic pollution, unless you have mods.

Industry (even farms) add to water pollution.","1309479675"

In your opinion.

&gt;they are myths and little more

Again, your opinion. But you're entitled to it, and I'm not ""controlled"" by anything. How wrong is it to be religious and in that religion, be taught that it is wrong to kill, or steal? Is that really such a bad thing? And does it hurt you know that I worship my God? No. 

&gt;I would just like to know how you personally think it works

Just because someone is born and raised in a religion does not mean they stay in that religion. I'm Catholic and there are so many people I know that were raised Catholic and chose not to continue following that religion. And that's all well and good. I don't believe every law or rule the Pope sets forth and I most certainly don't believe as other Catholics that his decisions are infallible. He's a man. I don't confess to a priest because he's a man. We aren't restricted to stay within our religion (at least as Christians).

&gt; I do honestly think that it is sad to watch- people dedicate their lives and die for these children's stories

Science has not been able, yet, to disprove the existence of Heaven or Hell so how can  you be certain they are children's stories? I mean, heck, even we as Christians, can only hope and pray that Heaven does exist. And honestly, I'd rather live a life of trying to do as Jesus did, as we're taught, and know that I lived my life to help others than say ""fuck it. heaven doesn't exist so I'm gonna shit on anyone I choose"". It's my personal preference that I am free to choose.

&gt;I hate religion and what it does to people

Other than, from what you say, causing people to follow blindly, what else does it do to people? For the Christians that actually live by the rules, they don't cheat on their spouses, have sex with everything that moves, helps those in need, doesn't kill or steal. Why would you hate that?","1309479686"

"scifi","t5_2qh2z","Let's tackle the two major offenders: The escape from the Pandorica and the resolution to the Space/Time mini-episodes. Space/Time first, because the explanations are similar, but Space/Time's is a bit more straightforward.

So, the Tardis is trapped inside itself, with the interior and exterior gradually drifting apart in time. The Doctor knows that there's probably a solution, but doing the wrong thing would destroy everything. So then he thinks, ""Okay, if I try a random control and it works, I'll go through the doors and tell my earlier self what I did.""

His timeline splinters into all possible controls that he could have attempted, but only the correct control would lead to him surviving to go back in time and inform his earlier self. In other words, the right answer was the only one that *could* go back.

So, how does that apply to the Pandorica situation? Seemingly, trapping the Doctor in the Pandorica had a traumatic effect on the timeline as a whole, nearly breaking the entire universe. The timeline spasmed, and, improbable though it might have appeared, the only possible *sustainable* sequence of events formed itself to preserve the existence of all things. Put simpler: The universe is a chaos machine, operating on the ""infinite monkeys"" principle. When there's only one event which will keep the universe from being destroyed, that event will occur.","1309479687"

I know it's wikipedia so probably not the best to use, but I saw the show on broadway in 2006 and when I saw the movie I was pretty disappointed that so much had been changed.  Sondheim who wrote the musical is know in the theatre world for getting very upset for people changing his score.  He shut down a production of Company in Australia because they changed a few words.  Because of this I was surprised how much he allowed to be changed.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Preface: I do not know what the this man does for a living so I cannot say how that could be affecting the situation. Your opposite has succumbed to depression and has fixated upon someone else's problems to distract from his own. You are not insane. It sounds as though you have made genuine efforts to contact him and keep the relationship alive. 

He can be salvaged, but *he* must do the work. As uncomfortable a topic as this can be to broach, I suggest you mention feeling that your relationship has fallen apart, that you are concerned for his well being, and that he does not have to live with his mother. This last statement may make him angry, but it is true. Alternative methods of care must exist unless his mother lives in a highly secluded fortress or wilderness. 

Finding a care giver willing to work fifteen to thirty hours per week should be possible and more than enough to care for his mother. How many of us do even ten hours of housekeeping each week? In this economy, the applicant pool should be large enough for even a picky person to fill this position. 

If his willingness to open up to you does not improve, then either attempt couples therapy or move on. Anything more in depth would be guesswork on my part. 

Good luck.","1309479695"

"business","t5_2qgzg","That's a stupid argument for two basic reasons.  Preliminarily, your comment makes me question whether you even know what property taxes are.  Primer: property taxes aren't payable on a mortgage principal but rather on the assessed value of the home - the Fair Market Value - and home owners can request reassessment of their home value to adjust their property taxes.  

This is the short answer: There is no nexus between the holder of a note secured by a mortgage and the assessment of property taxes.  On the other hand, a merchant is in the best position to record the sale prices of EVERY SINGLE SALE that occurs in the state during a calendar year.  You don't expect the government to peek in on every transaction and record it for you do you?  

Here are two reasons: 

1.  If your bank DID - it wouldn't make any difference to the amount of money you had to pay and it wouldn't make you prefer one bank over another if they *all* had to collect your property taxes . . .

2.  Making someone responsible to collect taxes - as a merchant isn't too far fetched as government has the ability to regulate commerce both explicitly in the US constitution and in various state constitutions, but also has the explicit authority to raise taxes and so long as government CHOOSES a reasonable option - that the person who is responsible for recording the sale is also in the best position to hold on to the taxes . . . that is EMINENTLY reasonable.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Not so sure about ""Iceland doing fine"" - I'd say they're actually going thru a pretty tough time.

The situation is VASTLY different however.  Iceland has it's own currency, so in the height of the crisis, the currency was able to devalue - acting as a type of pressure release valve.    Greece however, operates under the EURO.  It isn't able to devalue its currency in order to remain competitive.  It has 3 options to reduce its deficit:   (a) raise taxes (b) cut spending or (c) default.  (a) and (b) are an anathema to the socialised Greek welfare state.  (c) is undesirable within the Euro framework.

THe problem with default is that it brings the entire Euro structure into question - something the Franco/German bloc is unlikely to stomach.

The problem with the Euro, at the core, is that you have a single currency, but no mechanism to ensure that the individual member states act responsibly and don't overspend.  They each have their own Treasury / Budget processes making individual decisions about spending, with little to no effective oversight by a ""Central Euro Treasury"".

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I'm not saying that it's bullshit, I'm not saying that it isn't oppression.  My perspective is that direct confrontation leads to militancy on all sides.  The most effective way to get a point across isn't to embody hatred or rage, it's to calmly reassert your position through time and patience.  

If theists were actively killing off atheists for voicing their disapproval, I may have a different opinion, but even then you generally are more provokative to the general mindset when hatred is left to the side and one allows hate to come onto them.  Think about it.  Who do you think had a more righteous fight, the Islamists who hate the west and blow themselves up to prove a point or Gandhi's non-violent civil disobedience, in which many died, but freedom from the opressor was ensured?  Or, closer to home, look at the civil rights movement in the US 40-50 years ago.  Who had more traction, MLK, preaching a message of non-violence but resistance or Malcolm X or the Black Panthers?  

I'm not saying that feeling hate isn't justified to some extent.  It's just that you erode your ability to stand on your own feet honorably when you give into those urges.  Be it in vocal, inflammatory argument or fire-bombing. 

When it comes to atheism in particular, the very concept that is touted about is one of rationality and use of the scientific method in non-belief.  How does emotion play into that at all?  Emotional responses are the very antithesis of logic.  I'm not saying we're not emotional beings (we sure as hell aren't as rational as we'd like to believe--look at the way advertisers trick us into consumerism) but we have an obligation, especially if we're claiming to take the higher, rational and more efficient path, to refrain from use of our anger and vitriol.  To do otherwise cheapens the points atheists are trying to make.

Hate and anger lead to vitriol which leads to destruction, both of the self and the social being.  If rationality is the goal, then emotional response has *no place* in that equilibrium.  ","1309479702"

1) ""Organization must be organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes set forth in section 501(c)(3).""
2) ""None of its earnings may inure to any private shareholder or individual.""
3) ""It may not be an action organization.""

The question was: ""Does Media Matters meet all three criteria?""  Instead of answering that question, you answered the question, ""Does Media Matters meet the third criterion?""  That's a narrower and different question in a relevant way since point 1 is the most contentious.  You replaced the real proposition with a superficially similar, but different (and more easily defeated) one and then declared victory after knocking it down.  That's a textbook straw man.","1309479714"

Nobody has pointed out that:

    a) someone has provided soup
    b) ergo, someone wants you to live
    c) if you attack/destroy the soup production mechanism
    d) someone will be forced to respond

Otherwise, if they didn't want you to live, they would not provide soup, and if there was a chance the soup providing mechanism would fail or run out they would be somehow monitoring.

Also, there is a better chance of finding the outside/something following the soup path than the unknown tunnel.  The soup would have to come from a container of finite volume and therefore could not just go on and on forever.

So attacking the soup hole is the fastest way out or at least to the unveiling of your captor.

There were 2 or 3 moments in it where I was on the verge of tears, and Portal 2 has been the only other game that has done that for me.

Reach's storyline was both epic and felt ""real"" at the same time.

The newest version (thought I do not have it myself, I only have had the TS1 and TS2) also has GPS for geotaggging which is especially useful for people that get out and make use of the camera.

It's not the merchant (per se) who is responsible for sales tax. It's the buyer. However, the laws are written in a way to require merchants to collect the tax and submit it to the taxing authority, because that's much easier to enforce.

I'm just pointing out that Visa being a private company doesn't exclude them categorically from having to collect taxes if that's what the law says they have to do.

""It would be smarter to make Visa (and obviously other online-capable payment systems) collect the tax than trying to chase down every internet retailer"" certainly makes sense, and the fact that Visa is a private company has no bearing on the possibility of future laws requiring them to collect sales taxes.

In any case, certainly Mastercard and Paypal (for example) are parties to the transaction, even if Visa per se isn't.","1309479760"

"tf2","t5_2qka0","A couple recommendations from someone who has been playing medic for a while:

*In the advanced options, you can select to have people automatically call out for medic when they fall below a certain percentage (I set mine at 77%), which puts a little blinking cross over them. This is a great way to know who needs healing, as a lot of people are far too conservative for calling out for a medic. As a result, you'll build your Über faster and you'll keep more people alive.

*Learn how to yell ""Spy!"" (by default: ""x"" and then ""2""). It is everyone's job to watch for spies, but as a medic, yours are the best at spotting them, as you can more easily assess a situation. Do not go to hunt him, but warn those who can kill him more efficiently than you. Additionally, it doesn't hurt to learn [how to change that yell to a single keypress](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Scripting). I will gladly answer any questions on scripting, as I believe that not enough communication goes on in tf2 in the public servers, which frequently results in needless losses or deaths.

*Survive. You are the medic. You are the giver of life. It is imperative that you learn how to hide yourself behind obstacles and heavies. Your life is precious, as you also hold the lives of others in your hands. As such, standing out in front or in the open is a good way to lose whatever ÜberCharge you have. One way to increase your survivability is to keep moving. A moving target is slightly more difficult to stab in the back. Additionally, depending on how your aim with a syringe gun is, you might consider using the [Blutsauger](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Blutsauger) rather than the stock Syringe Gun for running away. It has saved me a few times, as my goal is just to run away rather than kill someone with it.

*On a related note: Don't underestimate the stock Medigun. The Kritzkrieg and the Quick-Fix are nice for certain situations, but there's nothing quite like a good 8 seconds of invulnerability to take out those pesky engineers. If you are the only medic on your team, I highly recommend sticking to the stock Medigun until you can really differentiate when it is appropriate to use something else.

*As others have said: Use it, don't lose it. Your ÜberCharge is the efforts of everyone in keeping you alive while you keep them gunning. As such, dropping a full ÜberCharge instead of using it because that one sniper wasn't worth using a full 8 seconds of invulnerability is wasteful. Don't be discouraged if you drop one though, as it will happen. You will fail to notice that spy as you're running to the capture point, Heavy in tow, and he will stab you. That's what he is there to do. But if you can help it, use it rather than being too conservative with it. (On that note, however, don't just use it just because you hit 100%. If you don't see a single enemy, there is no point.)

This is such a subjective term. What does intolerant mean? ""Religion is dorky""? ""You should be an atheist""? ""You should be a Christian""? Or is it, ""I will kill you if you don't do as I say""?

.

Is this:

""I think it is very beautiful for the *poor to accept their lot*, to share it with the passion of Christ. I think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people.""

— Mother Teresa

.


""I want you to just let a wave of intolerance wash over you.  I want you to let a wave of hatred wash over you.  Yes, hate is good — Our goal is a Christian nation.  We have a Biblical duty.  We are called by God to conquer this country.  We don't want equal time.  We don't want pluralism.""

— Randall Terry

.

or this:


""When I, or people like me, are running the country, you'd better flee, because we will find you, we will try you, and we'll execute you.  I mean every word of it.  I will make it part of my mission to see to it that they are tried and executed.""

— Randall Terry

.

or this:

""We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity.""

— Ann Coulter, conservative author

.

""I believe it’s a lot easier to change the Constitution than it would be to change the word of the living God, and that’s what we need to do is to amend the Constitution so it’s in God’s standards rather than try to change God’s standards.""

And there's the money question.  Asking for an official apology is ALWAYS a precursor to demanding money.  It causes too much notice if you ask reparation or restitution so you ask for it to go to a fund, which is of course managed by the wronged party in question.

Australian immigration policy has done some disgusting things in the past that we should all be ashamed of, but their complaints are chiefly relating back to the 1850s.  

If you want to further the education of the general public as to the entirety of the history of Australian immigration then by all means do so, but to simply lecture of the disadvantages of one particular race would be, well, discrimination.

I already mentioned I accepted the common descend. I have been reading about this (including the link you provided). I will give you an example: hominids (""great apes"") which is said to be where human and apes evolved from. The only reason scientists do not consider this ""great ape"" to be human is the understanding of human properties at this day of age. 

It really opens more questions that I have been honestly looking to get answers for;

- classification and reclassification changes alot ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igq_niFmXNs )
- that video comes to the conclusion that we are still monkeys.. okaaay.. that is a label what if we say monkeys are a type of human? you see labels/classes keep changing.

That is the part I already went over.

By the way; I have been looking for any evolution tool that is a set of database records of what the classification is and the properties it carries. for example in a similar way presented in the video.

Assuming we can get it polished enough and convince the Mojangles of the power of unit testing (or dare I say, test driven design?) I think it could be a huge step towards increased Minecraft quality.

Until then I think the idea of a test map is great! Even if Mojang itself doesn't take advantage of it the map would be a fantastic asset in determining all the tiny tweaks to behavior that come with each new patch. The idea sort of reminds me of the acid tests for browsers.

In fact, having a comprehensive overall test that exploits a bunch of well-known block effects to produce a well-defined specific result would be handy too so you can load up a new version, start up the test and quickly know if anything has changed before drilling down to see what the specific change was.

If you have a server available, putting it on peaceful and starting with a flattened test map would be a great way for redditors to collaborate on test development directly.","1309479795"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","It depends on how you want too look at it. The games themselves do not really follow a story (at least not one that's much more interesting than go here, now go here, something dramatic happened, now go here, now go here). There is, however, a very rich back story that you discover through playing the game, and just about everything in the game is designed to tell that story. It's very well executed, but you only see it if you go looking for it.

Personally I think the games would have benefited from having a bit more story in them as it helps to drive the exploration that lets you see the amazing back story, games like Deus Ex do this excellently where you have reasons to go places and do things, but in the course of doing these things if you hack a computer or pick up a newspaper you find out a little something, and you can piece these things together and learn a lot about the game world.

TL;DR - I would agree that HL2 has bugger all story too it, but it still contains a lot of story.","1309479799"

"startups","t5_2qh26","Layer 2: New communication protocols and servers (services) to host and facilitate them.

As you probably noticed this thing goes beyond what existing protocols can do, so it obviously needs new protocols to share context information, support various advanced types of posts, connect contexts and sync them. So there is a need for servers which implement this.

User doesn't need to be aware of it, of course, he just downloads ComCen software and uses it. This software can do both ""legacy"" communication protocols as well as well as newfangled ComCen-specific. And it uses ComCen-the-Company's servers.

Layer 3: Open protocols, bring-your-own-hosting, clouds.

Now a lot of people do not like proprietary protocols, and I see no reason to use them. Moreover, most of the stuff can be stored in form of files on servers of user's choice:

 * maybe his own servers
 * maybe Amazon S3 (or other ""cloud storage"")
 * maybe servers of his friends
 * maybe on specialized ComCen hosting servers

So if you make a post it uploads some files on YOUR server. Then other servers and clients learn about it, download files, decrypt and index them and show to corresponding users.

Layer 4: Indexing servers for distributed data.

Users downloading posts from each other's servers would quickly run into performance issues. So there is a need in indexing servers which will optimize new post discovery.

So in the end I see it like this:

1. User can use any kind of compatible software, maybe a flagship ComCen client, maybe some web app, maybe a browser add-on,  maybe a simple client.

2. User's post is encoded and uploaded on server of his choice.

3. Post is discovered either by indexing server or maybe by a fat client directly.

4. People who are authorized and interested in reading this post will read it in client of their choice, in presentation of their choice.","1309479819"

For example: people will buy Apple products simply because they are made by Apple and will defend to the death how awesome it is even when confronted with conflicting information.  Most of all, ""fanboyism"" irrational.

Then you compare games that are of very similar genre but end up playing differently for various reasons.  I prefer Battlefield games to CoD because I like the team/squad-oriented gameplay, the large-scale battles and implementation of vehicles.  I don't think that makes me a fanboy.  

I prefer Diablo games because they are fleshed out better than Torchlight 1.  Diablo 2 offered a higher difficulty curve (I played Torchlight on hard and it was still incredibly easy, which bored me), more classes, and most of all, MULTIPLAYER.  Does that make me a fanboy?

Just because two games fall into the same genre and share lots of the same features doesn't mean that somebody that prefers one over the other is a fanboy.

1) The team that loses will be the one with the most snipers and spies.

If you push back into their spawn, instead of holding the point, they're going to get stronger and stronger due to the resupply locker at their base. That means they *will* wipe your push eventually, and now they'll have a free ride back to the point.

On the other hand, if you hold the point, and defend it with something better than 3 snipers and 4 spies, you just have to wait for them to come to you.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","Just go look at the [Historicity of Jesus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus) Wikipedia page.  There are enough references there to indicate that there are, in fact, historical references to Jesus of Nazareth sufficient to assume he existed.  More so than many people of history that we never even question, such as Plato.  

Many people want to say Jesus never existed just so they can dispel the entire Christianity ""myth"" whole-cloth.  It is not that easy.  History does contain references, many of them, to the man Jesus of Nazareth that the Christian theology depends on.  Regardless of what you want to believe there was a man that existed by that name as far as anything can be ""proved"" by historical records.

Also, people question the veracity of the Bible constantly but nobody ever questions the accuracy of the writings by Homer, which have extremely fewer copies available and many more variances and errors between the copies.  The Bible has very few variances between the available copies and has been impeccably maintained throughout history.  It may be a religious text, and subject to some editorializing, however it has been shown to be an accurate representation of events as far as history can be used to verify them.  When combined with other texts and sources from the time, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Gnostic texts we can see that the Bible's record is actually pretty accurate in so far as it describes historical events.  

Other references to the miracles also exist in the form of people trying to explain them naturally and therefore discredit his divine source of power.  If he did not exist, and furthermore did not perform miracles, why would secular authors at the time feel the need to discredit them?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yeah, I mean the thing is, North Korea is not a normal country. It's not hyperbole at all to say that everyone there is severely brainwashed. I simultaneously hope for and dread the collapse of the government, because on one hand, things will be better without an autocracy, and on the other hand, it will be one of the worst humanitarian crisis in history. For every soldier that gets sent in to occupy the country, there will need to be 10 psychologists. People living there have been brainwashed since birth to believe that Kim Il Sung (Jong Il's father) was a diety. They've been taught to believe that North Korea is the last bastion of civilization and that everything across the border is barbaric chaos and ruin. It's like a twisted version of Plato's cave. There's no music (except propoganda tunes), no arts of any kind, people are routinely sent to reeducation camps for the most minor infractions. And there's the specter of what we don't know hanging over all of this. We have no idea how many people have been killed, whether they have the missile to reach Japan (they have nukes). The person who knows the most about North Korea could probably tell you everything they know about the country in around 45 minutes (according to my comparative politics teacher who specializes in China Studies).

And as with any dictatorship, food aid is complicated. It's unlikely that it will go to the people who need it most - the ruling elite in Pyongyang are **ridiculously** more wealthy than everyone else. And then there's the security situation. They WON'T let us into the country. Technically we're still at war with them (there is an armistice) and we don't recognize them diplomatically. And no, North Korea (as far as we know) doesn't take help from Iran. They're close to China but even China is weary of their antics. Occasionally, some kids of the elite are sent to schools in China. When they're there they're viewed very much as being completely insane. Occasionally, some refuge will trek across China and try to break into a western embassy (they're treated in China the way we treat illegal immigrants in the US) because there's a rumor that if you get in the door, they have to be given citizenship. As for food bring the South closer, ain't gonna happen. Imagine the Israeli/Iranian nuclear situation and then put them right next to each other. That's how this is. As for the North blaming us for their people dying, it won't fly. It's their government, it's their country, it's their fault. No government in the world seriously thinks otherwise (including China). And access to their country in general? Not going to happen. The minute they start letting foreigners in, the whole thing could collapse. They'll never do it willingly.

Basically we're stuck. We don't have the political capital for another regime change. China won't tolerate that (they don't want a US backed power on their border - North Korea is very much a buffer state for them). Plus we're already having trouble in the Yellow Sea with them - naval control and all that. And China really is the key. Most of North Korea's aid comes from China. If we could somehow convince them to drop them, change could be possible. That's very unlikely to happen. As China grows in power, we'll be engaged in (hopefully) friendly competition if not outright polarity. ","1309479848"

With respect to a breakdown of the differences, Acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (ACSS2) is down-regulated in ketosis (as you aren't storing fat as much) so alcohol takes longer to break down. Its also been hypothesized that alcohol dehydrogenase gets down-regulated since the lack of carbs leads your body to produce fewer natural alcohols. This hypothesis seems pretty reasonable to me since we know the opposite to be true with increased alcohol intake. 

So same processing but different efficiencies.

Alcohol with delay fat breakdown (same as in non-ketosis) since it takes metabolic precedence so it should slow down weight loss but won't kick you out of ketosis permanently. This of course assumes you don't have carb-rich drinks and kick yourself out the same way you would with fruit juice or soda.

Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY white country and ONLY white countries to “assimilate,” i.e., intermarry, with all those non-whites.

What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries?

And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn’t object to this?

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;When those vehicles product more pollution than other vehicles that I have to breathe and contribute to global warming which could kill a huge amount of the earth.

When it comes to air quality and global warming, you're barking up the wrong tree.  See my analysis [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/id78w/the_entire_state_of_texas_has_been_declared_a/c22wm12).  Personal vehicle use is maybe 20% of all CO2 emissions, which is less than half of emissions caused by electricity generation.  For what it's worth network traffic is impossible without the flow of electrons.  If you're going to complain about peoples' choices in vehicles, please keep in mind that you're not exactly helping the situation.

&gt;And when those vehicles use more oil that leads to more middle east wars that contribute to MY personal safety being impacted because someone thinks he needs a pick up truck.

You're creating a false causality between oil usage and war.  Oil usage does not cause war.  Militant countries cause war.  It might be a war about oil, but that's like telling a kid whose divorced parents are fighting over custody that he/she is the reason they split in the first place.  You're also using hyperbole to relate the wars in the Middle East to your personal safety.  You are probably more likely to have your rights trampled by a citizen of your own country than getting shot at by a non-American militant.

The problem with your argument about consumers' choice in vehicles is that there will always be a top contender for vehicle CO2 emissions.  Once everyone stops driving trucks they don't ""need"", large sedans will be considered ""wasteful"".  Unfortunately, part of living in a *free* society involves people doing what you think they should not be doing.","1309479882"

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","&gt; I want to push my current job towards HTML5 but they don't want to invest any time in it so I am going to rewrite and redesign a small part of the application on my own dime.  

For what features, exactly? Perhaps you should take a read of [Dive Into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.org/) to get a better understanding of it. To quote Dive Into HTML5, [""It’s not one big thing""](http://diveintohtml5.org/introduction.html).

&gt; I am not versed enough with CSS to know what I should be doing in CSS versus in Javascript

CSS should *always* be your first go-to for *any* sort of styling, using Javascript for very complex styling that you cannot easily/at all achieve with CSS (very little), and scarcely-to-not-at-all if possible.

&gt; (for example who knew you can do hovers in CSS, back in my day we used javascript!).  

CSS has had pseudo-selectors (like the `a:hover` or `a:visited`) since CSS1. They're a pretty significant staple of CSS (for link styling, drop-down menus, other things), so I'd really recommend learning them. CSS3 has a significant amount more selectors (that you can fallback to javascript for; I believe jQuery supports the CSS3 pseudo-selectors). Check out [this article on pseudo selectors (incl. CSS3)](http://css-tricks.com/5762-pseudo-class-selectors/).

&gt; For a start I want a page with a header, sub header with tabs (images will/may need to be created) [...]

First: create some wireframes on paper. Just rough sketches, they're to get an idea of the layout. Next: make a simple mockup in your favorite graphic manipulation program -- I really like Inkscape. You may also consider designing these to a grid, as grids are fantastic for this sort of thing as well as web design in general (I've got a bunch of links on grids if you're interested).

&gt; and an option bar which will stay in place at the top of the window when scrolling down (I know there are SO many ways to do this, what is the right HTML5 way?)

CSS would be the best way of doing this, though you may choose to use some sort of new [semantic element](http://diveintohtml5.org/semantics.html#new-elements) of HTML5 (if applicable), though it won't do anything to the functionality of the site, as it'd just be another block element.  The CSS for a bar *fixed* on the screen would be something like this:  
    #options {
        position: fixed;
    }
Look into the [CSS `position` property](http://www.w3schools.com/Css/pr_class_position.asp).

&gt; which will need to support drag and drop for re-ordering the items.

Ah! This is something HTML5 can help with. But you'll need javascript, too. [This article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/dnd/basics/) should give you some insight into the process and ideas behind it.

&gt; Want to work with me and help me out? Since I am doing this on my own dime I don't have much to offer, but ultimately this is for a business so I would certainly be willing to pay you from my own pocket.

Sure! I'm always up to having the opportunity to helping out and learn more in the process (: I should really try to get a better grasp of the drag and drop type stuff anyhow. PM me with the best way to be in contact with you. Even if you're not interested in working together, feel free to PM me if you have any other questions, as it keeps my brain sharp.

2.  Credit card companies have been fucking people for years, mostly the people with bad credit.  If you don't want bad credit, be financially responsible and pay your fucking bills. The only reason the credit card companies can fuck people is because NO ONE READS THE CONTRACT.  It's all written there in black and white.  Yes, the fucking is completely described in most cases and people sign anyway because they need credit cards to buy shit they don't need.

3.  I agree that you shouldn't be able to sign away your right for redress where criminal conduct happens but if I recall correctly, if you work for a company, you CHOSE to work for them.  Read the fucking contract.  If you don't like it, don't work there. You act as if you're doing the company a favor by working for them.  You aren't.  You're getting paid to do a certain job a certain way in a certain circumstance and if you don't like it, you can leave.  If they don't like what you're doing, they can fire you.

"PS3","t5_2qhhw","The ""emulator"" probably will be able to handle all PSP games, much like their system is capable of handling PS1 games, but they aren't going to just let you play your existing PSP games on it. To do that, you'd need to plug in a link cable from the PSP to the PS3 and run the game off the UMD drive, turning the PSP into an expensive external CD Drive. I doubt Sony will want to do that. Not only for financial reasons, but possibly because they simply don't want to invest the time to solve the technical issue, as well as the overhead of having to deal with a larger number of products they would then have to support.

Instead, what you'll see are HD versions of PSP games being offered up for sale for the PS3 at an equal or higher price than the PSP version.

When Sony dropped the backwards compatibility support for old-gen games from the PS3, that was a sign on where they were going in the future. They aren't going to help you play your old stuff on new hardware, they want you a new version. PS1 players can't pop in their PS1 disc and play their original games, but for a few bucks then can re-buy it on PSN and play it just fine on their PS3 &amp; PSP.

Much like the engine for running Minis &amp; PS1s, this new engine will be hidden from the end user. All they'll see are HD versions of PSP Games for sale that are PS3 exclusive.

This isn't about letting players play their PSP games on a PS3. It's about letting developers selling their PSP games to PS3 players.","1309479903"

There's a lot more to plating bacteria than what they showed.  There are millions of different bacteria, and some only grow on certain kinds of agar, some grow at slightly higher temperatures, some at slightly lower, etc.  

Our hands are covered with bacteria (it's mentioned in the video that our hands are one of the dirtiest areas of our body) however they said that the hand swab showed very light bacterial growth.  That suggests to me that they didn't swab well enough, didn't plate well enough, didn't incubate well enough...or something.  

The doctor they interviewed is correct...urine is sterile.  Doesn't mean I want to touch it, though.

They only looked at bacteria, not viruses.  Viruses wouldn't show up on an agar plate.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Using the word ""Darwinism"", saying humanity aren't ""just"" animals, and insisting that ""we are so much more than gifted chimps""... it all reeks of creationism and yet he's an atheist who's keen to agree with evolution (""the brain is an evolved organ as it most surely is"") but he'd like to put humans on a pedestal; to keep them distinct from animals and not *merely* as the most powerful of animals. Well I don't see the harm of 'non-pedestal humans', or what his point is. He's probably read *Unweaving The Rainbow* but I suspect that he didn't take it to heart.

The end of the article seems to sum up his ideas,

&gt; we don't have to believe that the only alternatives to supernatural explanations of man are naturalistic ones that see humans as part of the biosphere and, ultimately, of the material world, beholden to its laws. Challenging these assumptions, and waking to the possibility of entirely different views, promises a thrilling intellectual, and indeed spiritual, adventure.

Some days when her little bro is napping and she wants me to entertain her, I just walk outside and start doing yard work, etc.  I ignore her pleas to find something for her to do.  Soon enough, she is lost in her imagination &amp; I can observe &amp; praise her for being so creative and self directed.  She feels proud of this.

I must say, I'm NOT a single parent so have a little break every night and weekend.  Perhaps you could find some teacher friend to trade play dates with for a little time off?  Day camp sounds great too! :-)

All we did was talk online, he didn't like talking on the phone... played a few games together here and there. I ended up spending more time with someone else and we now live together. I still talk to my ex from time to time and I really feel like our breakup was the best thing ever for him. It burned a fire under his butt and he now seems to be living a life that he is very content about. My bf atm and I had only been talking for about 8 months before we were thrown into living together. Oddly enough when we met it didn't feel weird at all.

But that's a different subject and irrelevant to the disaster.

We didn't mind giving Alabama assistance for the horrible tornados, and rightfully so.

ME2 almost felt like a reboot of the series in some ways, while ME1 felt like a game that could have stood alone plot-wise, sorta like they made the first one without certainty that the trilogy would ever be completed. I hate to compare them to such famous movies, but they remind me of the first two Star Wars movies. The first could definitely stand alone, and the second is a bit more highly regarded but takes a rather different path. In both Empire and ME2, there are themes of death and rebirth, there are shady characters (Lando and bounty hunters vs. Cerberus), and darker themes. In the first Star Wars and in ME1, you're saving the galaxy. In Empire and ME2, you're just trying to survive, and the threats are darker, sneakier, less obvious.

If they can not explain the mechanism for which sweeteners affect diet, then they have to appropriately control, or do a more refined study in which to discover the mechanism that sweeteners affect diet. 

Like I said elsewhere, it's entirely possible that overweight people just use diet soda to wave away mass amounts of calories obtained elsewhere. Furthermore, we know that high intake of carbohydrates affects blood sugar\*  far greater than diet soda would, so it is much more likely that these people are overeating because there is still too much sugar and simple starch in their diet.

It is much better than the alternative. [My reasoning: [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/i4sd7/i_just_cannot_comprehend_the_stupidity_and/c214g3o).]

We live in the Age of Information and christians are not utilizing or even abusing that fact.  Christianity needs to keep up with the times otherwise it will be left behind as its archaic views will no longer remain relevant.  

God gave christians a brain but they refuse to use it!  Christianity can't defend itself because it uses logic and arguments that are simply too un-evolved compared to today's knowledge.  Knowledge that can be instantly updated and spread.

From my view, christians aren't bettered for being christian.  What have you learned?  God stuff.  Well what can you do with the God stuff?  It's not for now it's for later.

Has the knowledge of God stuff allowed you the ability to create anything that betters mankind?  Any sort of breakthroughs? A new battery perhaps that lasts a really long time and is bio degradable?
Did you invent or discover a new food source?  What does christian science have to say about dark matter?  Math?

Why doesn't christianity balance any of their focus on things that can quantitatively improve the body/mind temple of its practitioners or the religion itself?  By concentrating on only one aspect and forgoing the rest, christianity has done itself a greater disservice than even satan could devise.

What is worse is you continue to do it to yourself.  Thinking that the world needs to change instead of you.  When it is you that needs to keep up with everybody else.","1309479976"

It's basically impossible to diagnose what's wrong with it sight unseen without more information. I second taking it to a watchmaker, they should be able to give you a good idea of the issue and repair cost. 

As a side bar, one of my parts houses is showing I can buy a brand new 2824-2 movement to replace the one in your watch for $119.95. Industry standard capstone markup doubles that cost, add in new gaskets and let's say an hour of labor to do the movement swap and test water resistance and you're looking at about $300 for that extreme. If you're quoted more than that ask just what they'll be doing.

Be sure that the columns in both tables used in the joins have non-clustered indexes on them; this will improve the query speed quite a bit if they are not. Also any other columns in the where clause could probably benefit with indexes.

So both URLTable.URL and TableOfIPs.IP should have non-clustered indexes.

Also, you could try parsing out the IP addresses in a more efficient mannar than using the LIKE operator.

CASE
	WHEN (LEFT([IP_ADDRESS],0,7) = 'http://' THEN RIGHT([IP_ADDRESS],7,LEN([IP_ADDRESS])-7)

If they're in grade school, I'd honestly think about something like Tai Chi to start out with.  It will give them strength, balance and a good foundation for other martial arts that they may choose to take.  That and they probably won't be going around thinking they can become a schoolyard bully.

Once they get into grade 5/6/ Jr High, if they're still into that sort of thing, then maybe a more combative martial art like boxing or judo/jujistsu/wrestling depending on what they think is fun, we had a few wrestling classes in gym and we all loved it, but unfortunately there was not league or anything to get involved with to pursue. 

I think for kids it would be important to have a more traditional class to start out with than a straight up MMA class, mostly for the self discipline that they focus on, and with those, I feel that it's more who's teaching than what particular style it is.","1309480028"

"asianamerican","t5_2rfyw","A bit late to the party, I'm afraid...

&gt;regarding Asian Males, makes us seem a bit whiney and weak.

I agree. That part was a bit disconcerting, in how he reaffirmed a ton of negative stereotypes about Asian men as ineffectual, fragile and socially witless. 
Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading about the Bamboo Ceiling and agreed with a lot of what he said about the ""traditional"" perception a lot of Asian Americans have about hard work (""Shut up and do it""/""Hard work pays off""/""Actions speak louder than words""). Coming from a large Asian American community (Los Angeles, whutuuup), I can see that the sentiment resonates a lot with first-gen immigrant families here, if not in second-gen too. 

&gt;I want to see more articles that focus on the core issues such as media portrayal of Asian Americans, The Bamboo Ceiling propogated by whites (and not the fault of asians as is implied in the article). 

I think it's difficult to say just white folks are to blame for the Bamboo Ceiling. Academia, let alone Asian people themselves, refuse to study their own history in America, so we remain blissfully ignorant a lot of the time about how fucked we sometimes are. At the top-tier institution I study at, our Asian American groups are huge partying-/network-fronts, with no real intellectual or political substance. No edge at all. Even though our population on campus is close to 12% or higher, we have at most 1 class a year devoted to anything related to Asian America. 

Moreover, blaming whitey for all of this requires delicacy and careful distinction. It's not the lower-SES white Americans refusing to hire or promote APIAmericans. It's the over-established, nepotistic affluent classes who are thatching the Bamboo Ceiling. These folks are the same ones that are pitting other minorities (African Americans, Latin@s, etc.) against us -- placing us on a pedestal while shaming the others. I believe our pedestal status (propagated by higher educational attainment, higher SES in East Asian immigrants, etc.) simultaneously empowers us in a small, harmless way and allows us a half-assed invitation into WhiteMiddleClassAmerica. We feel better than the ""dirtier, darker"" minorities, and I think this is reflected in our sometimes easy ability to puppet the bigoted, ignorant attitudes white America has against these groups too (""We did it, why can't they?"") This prevents us from making the vital community/network connections we need to advocate on our own behalf.

&gt;I also want to see more positivity and examples of successful Asian Americans who are breaking through these barriers.

Yeah, I'd love to see that too. But unfortunately, until major media outlets/corporations are run by open-minded, socio-politically aware folks (i.e. not ""Whitey"" or ""old white farts""), we're always going to be relegated to sidekick status or b-list, grindhouse, indie films. 

Sorry if that sounds hater-y. No disrespect, I feel very much the same way you do at times.","1309480034"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I know it sounds like something someone's mom would say when a kid is asked why a bully picks on them, but: they're jealous. Seriously, if they have kids or even if they're planning to, they're jealous. That has been my experience, at least and the experience of many other childfree people in my life. 

It's not that they don't love their kids or even that they regret having them, but those of us who are childfree have SO MUCH FREEDOM comparatively. Most of those people who judge or criticize might not even realize that they're jealous, but it is often the case. 

Anothing thing might be that they just don't believe you. Although the number of people/couples that don't want kids is supposedly on the rise, having kids is still the norm. AND people who have kids might have thought they didn't want them at some point in their lives and then they either changed their minds or had a ""suprise"" kid and then they're happy. 'Cause who doesn't love their kid, right? So they think that you are like them and you only think you don't want them because you don't know what it's like (yet).

Anyway, enjoy your childfreedom. The criticizing might never end, tbh. I know people in their 40s who dont have kids and don't want them and they still get nagged about it. I think it's one of those things we just learn to live with. Meh.","1309480037"

- Lost all of my weight in the last 3 months (the amount of time I've been watching my diet), but I've been working out over a year.  I didn't lose any weight when only working out.. started falling off at ~10lbs/month when I started eating right
- Exercise (mix of light strength training and cardio) 5 days a week, 1 hour per day since mid 2010
- I've been following a diet that puts me at a caloric deficit of around -1000 to -1500 per day.
- I don't watch carbs/fat.. strictly calories in-calories out
- sorry I don't have any better old pics.. I've done everything I can to avoid cameras for the past several years
- When I first started working out, I couldn't do even one pushup, I had to do inclined pushups on a 3-foot tall desk, last week I maxxed myself out at 40 non-stop REAL pushups!
- Been trying the online dating thing, and found someone great.. and may soon have my first date in over 5 years. :D

If we are there to offset another $1M in losses, then yes.  Value is created.  But if we don't recoup $1M from putting those two in Afghanistan, we have lost money.

So re-tool.  I would rather we tax and spend that $1M on 15 teachers.  Think of the value that will create.  Or one mile of highway in West Virginia.  Or 10,000 chairs to sell to Mexico.  The point is, Military spending is an artificial value; much of that value never comes home.","1309480070"

If you receive models that are messed up beyond some simple repair work, call GW and they will replace them. Bent models are easy to fix with a little hot water.

In addition to the apparent work, the house is extremely energy efficient, with radiant heat and on-demand hot water.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; If the US prints more money, why would the price of commodities denominated in foreign currencies also go up?

Because if foreign central banks let their own domestic currencies appreciate against the US dollar than it will be clear that the *reserve asset which gives their currencies value*, is in fact not a good store of value. Thus destroying their own currencies and losing control over their ability to centrally plan their economies.

It's helpful to think that it's the US dollar having value that gives the other fiat currencies their value. That is why non-US countries must print when America prints. Their governments are forced to if they don't want to lose control of their people.

Try and think of the world for the 20th century as one giant central planning experiment. Once the US isn't able to centrally plan any longer, then the governments of the other countries will lose control as well.

&gt; What should happen is exchange rates fluctuate to make the dollar cheaper and preserve the purchasing power of the other currencies.

Their currency's purchasing power is because *the US dollar has purchasing power* though!!! That's the problem! Their ever-expanding fiat currencies only have the *illusion* of having value because the global reference point which everyone looks to currently, the US dollar, *is also expanding*! If the people stopped looking to the US dollar as their reference point then it'd be obvious their own domestic currencies are expanding upwards and upwards and it wouldn't make any sense to store your wealth in them! Those nation's governments need men to store wealth in their domestic currencies in order to maintain control!

If you are a government leader in a non-US country you ultimately will *need* to print as the US prints!

&gt; So they also decide to print more money, thus driving up the price of commodities in their own currency.

Yes. They have no choice. It's better to lose control *later* when commodity prices get out of control then to lose control *right away*.

&gt; Why are we blaming the US for this decision?

It's not the US's fault, it's the *world's fault* for using the monetary arrangement that we do. Who cares though. We're going to get rid of it and move to a new and better one soon enough.","1309480104"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; with both a GUI and text format

Perhaps I wasn't clear. I was talking about having the documentation for the configuration in a file separate from what the GUI manipulates. You don't have to edit in both the GUI and the text file if the comments in the text file are still applicable. In exactly the same way, you don't have to change comments in a program if they're still applicable to whatever changes you're making in the executable code.

If you're updating documented parts of the system without fixing the documentation, you're doing your job wrong. Indeed, if you're changing parts of the configuration without knowing what the configuration is supposed to do, you're doing it wrong. If you don't even remember it was documented, you need to go read the documentation in order to remember what's in it; that's why it was written. Hiring people who do their job wrong is what you need to fix, not your GUI or text file configuration. By ""you're doing it wrong"" I meant to imply that *first* you read the documentation, then you update it to be correct, *then* you make the changes.  If you make changes without updating the documentation, you're doing it as wrong as if you write the requirements after you're done coding.

And yes, I have seen configuration programs that go out of their way to preserve comments and formatting and such, but I agree it's uncommon and difficult to get right.","1309480132"

I've been to a decent number of AA meetings because I got caught drinking/smoking pot underage. 

AA really reinforces the idea that you're not going to be friends with the same people that you were - and it says that you won't because you can't be. It says that surrounding yourself with that type of temptation is a bad idea and that it will backfire.

People do change when they get sober, but a lot of the things she discussed are absolutely in the AA program and would 100% supported by most of those who attend. They aim to provide an entire new social network for people because they believe that hanging out with their old social network will lead to relapse and ultimately death.

AA operates by making the decision to drink a life or death decision. The mantra is essentially that you will be sober, dead or in jail, and those are your only options. So things like marriages and friendships become a bit of secondary concerns.","1309480138"

Have you not heard of the massive costs of drug law *enforcement*? Think police officers, courts, cells, warrants, lawyers, time and the blow to productivity from a person who gets a conviction instead of a diploma. That can't be explained to someone dumb enough not to figure it out.

&gt; Territory for racketeering. These cartels are becoming the local government They are literally taxing people in the territories they own, taking in money that way. Also they are profiteering from the smuggling business. They are still in the drug trafficking business, but it has become just one part of their operation, and they are finding other ways to profit.

Just plain retarded. Serious violence is concentrated in 9 of the 31 Mexican states. These are the border states, and the reason is because of the flow of drugs. Human trafficking is a limited and less lucrative enterprise, which could never support the massive standing armies of each territorial cartel. Specifically, marijuana accounts for over 60% of cartel profits (according to an approximation widely republished and accepted by American conservatives). You don't know anything about Mexico or economics.

As for Elizabeth Taylor, supposedly she did not have true violet eyes, just a deep shadow of blue that appears violet in the right light/with the right makeup. [Source](http://www.slate.com/content/slate/blogs/browbeat/2011/03/25/elizabeth_taylor_beautiful_mutant.html)","1309480165"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Now, this started off as one paragraph, now its a short story. But at least its the story of my life, conveniently packaged for the Internet to mull over.  
  
I'm a pragmatic agnostic. Personally, the existence of any god is completely irrelevant to me. I have my own morals, I have my own ethics, and those generally align with the rest of society and make other people happy.  
  
I have the ability to live without a god. If, someday, there is absolute, unwavering evidence that there is a god, and he/she/it is pissed off at me for not worshiping it, I don't care. If that means that I get the last opportunity to repent and submit to this god, its not gonna happen. I am who I am, and will not change my apathetic views just so I don't have to spend an eternity in this so-called ""Hell"". I will continue to live my life, morally and ethically, not scared and not giving a fuck.  
  
Furthermore, I generally have no problem with people that do believe in something. Anyone can live their life how they want, as long as it does not interfere with me and they have no issues with me. Funny thing is I often get called ""close-minded"" just because I am agnostic, which I believe is the exact opposite of what I just explained. Yet these people that say this are apparently ""open-minded"" yet have issues with me not believing in what they believe in. Oh well, unless you try to start up an argument about this, I don't give a shit what you say, it just makes me rise up above you that much more.  
  
And this may get me downvoted to Hell, haha, but I just don't understand religion as hard as I try. The thought that some all-knowing, all-seeing, invisible 'being' in the clouds really gives a shit about what I ask it for when on my knees is just unfathomable. And sounds dirty. That this being cares about me, whilst obviously ignoring more pressing matters going on in the world. And good things happen to good people for a reason, bad things happen to good people for a reason, good things happen to bad people for a reason, and all that jazz. I don't understand, maybe (and sorry for lack of a better word) I am just too rational.  
  
But oh well, take that however you want to take it. This is me, and I don't believe because I don't have to. I life my life with such kick-assery and give no fucks about worshiping deities.","1309480166"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","I particularly wanted to look at the D&amp;D products of today. I'm certain if you go digging through the TSR archives you'd find plenty of questionable images of women. That is beyond the scope of what I wanted to talk about.

There is something there with skimpy clothing on a 'heroic' woman character. Lara Croft is a great example. On one hand you have a capable, female adventurer. On the other hand you have some hypersexualized top-heavy doll. I think there is a lot to be discussed if a character like that is something that promotes, or degrades, women. I can see arguments for both camps.

In the end though, I do think that 4E has done a better job of promoting positive images of women in their art.

"ruby","t5_2qh21","&gt; So do you envision there being easily available tools for doing more in-depth static analysis on dynamic languages soon?

Absolutely, and they're already getting there - pylint is an excellent tool for Python, [JSlint](http://www.jslint.com/) and the [restrict mode](http://restrictmode.org/) checker for JavaScript are great too. There's been work on an optimizing PHP compiler, [phc](http://www.phpcompiler.org/), as well, though I don't know if it does much to find bugs or just compiles.

&gt; Do you think there are aspects of Ruby that make it more or less amenable to this vs. other languages like PHP, Javascript, or Python?

In the general case, it's less amenable, but I personally find that makes it more fun to work on. 

1. There's more than one way to do everything - see my blog post on [block usage inference](http://carboni.ca/blog/p/Laser-Infers-Block-Use-Patterns) and I bet you'll learn something unexpected. Having widely-varied syntax and ubiquitous use of blocks means the tool needs to be able to understand a lot of code before you can understand anything, if that makes sense. These aren't asymptotically-significant challenges - but there's this sense that there's always something you're missing, and you're usually right.
2. Widespread use of metaprogramming, `eval`, reflection, dynamic constructs like `{method,const}_missing` make analyzing real code hard. While these are possible in PHP, Javascript, and Python, they aren't used nearly to the extent that they are in Ruby.
3. Parsing Ruby is just plain hard. The other languages you mentioned have relatively simpler grammars to deal with. I use Ripper which is brutally hacked into the YARV bison grammar, and it's had some really glaring bugs along the way.
4. Ruby has a fair amount of implicit semantics - some of which can be strange. Like how local variables are created by the parser, all the block argument-munging semantics... it's hard.

That said, you can do anything in Ruby you can do for those other languages - it's just a matter of how hard you have to try. And Ruby doesn't have ridiculous constructs like PHP's `$$var` (or `$$$$var...`), or the rest of PHP's design disasters. But things like `const_remove` *ruin* lots of opportunities, and that's one of the few constructs I simply do not handle.","1309480225"

There are many people in this thread who are arguing that voting based on ""I like that"" is a flawed system and they are unhappy with the results. Thus, what they ""care about"" is some subjective standard of quality, regardless of individual likes. What they want is some measure of control beyond what they currently have in order to regulate content according to their vision, for what they deem to be the greater good.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","For the sake of the whole planet, I want the world economy to slow down overall and to accelerate in the US, Europe and Japan. Unbridled economic growth is never good, SUSTAINABLE economic growth is the key. The regions who are experiencing economic growth these days are the least developed and least prepared to deal with the challenges of using nuclear energy.

Well, I don't live in a poor part of India, but I don't have 10 children either. While I want people to have access to basic infrastructure, I don't really think the world needs more Indians (1.2 billion). So it's a question of responsibility which involves decisions that must be made by the Indian people and the Indian government to control their population growth.

If you have an out-of-control birth rate, don't expect the world economy to skyrocket just to feed people, real life doesn't work like that because basically economic growth brings along bad environmental consequences, such as depletion of natural resources and resort, for instance, to complex, sometimes risky technology such as nuclear power.","1309480223"

so going over that:

&gt; Radiometric dating is based on the constant rate of decay of radioactive isotopes

so assuming that the consistency persists beyond 10,000 year or 1000,000 year. Which I said may or may not be valid because no scientific data go back that far. Also; the rate may differ based on other factors.

Please read under limitation:

&gt; **Radiation levels do not remain constant over time**. Fluctuating levels can skew results - for example, if an item went through several high radiation eras, thermoluminesence will return an older date for the item. Many factors can spoil the sample before testing as well, exposing the sample to heat or direct light may cause some of the electrons to dissipate, causing the item to date younger. Because of these and other factors, Thermoluminesence is at the most about 15% accurate. It cannot be used to accurately date a site on its own. However, it can be used to authenticate an item as antiquity.

So In general, it is acceptable for science but you have to keep in mind that the chance of it being wrong is very high.","1309480234"

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","You realize the carbon tax is a regressive tax right (just like an tax on gasoline)? It hurts consumers by implementing this and with simple economics you can see that there is a substitution effect happening with this tax. So while the idea might be all pretty and well sound, this is hurting the consumers the government is trying to make ""better off"". 

I think people need to do some major homework with how taxes work in an economy. HST might have streamlined the taxation process but in the end sending out cheques to offset the higher tax is eliminating the income effect (so called, ""revenue neutral""), the substitution effect still exists and is creating a larger burden on consumers than with the previous system. 

EDIT: I just want to say that I'm not necessarily anti-HST. There is benefits to it and I'm still undecided which way I'm going to vote on it. I'm pretty mad that I was lied to by the liberals but I'm going to really try and put my feelings aside and vote with the data instead. ","1309480245"

"feminisms","t5_2qhba","&gt; Many pushy guys look at their own tenacity as admirable

Completely agree with Infuser - different cultures and subcultures have different scripts for how courtship is supposed to go.  Those which value 'strong' men often set up shit tests whereby prospective suitors must risk face by 'proving' sincere interest through persistence.  ""I have a boyfriend"" is a familiar one hereabouts, which must be a pain in the ass if you actually do have a boyfriend and are not interested.

To anyone reading who wants their disinterest to be believed, I recommend learning the hard stare.  People get way too caught up in 'niceness' and in being polite, even when a situation merits assertiveness.  I'm not sure if this is all social conditioning or a genuine overactive desire to be liked.

Either way, if you can't bring yourself to tell someone to fuck off in as many words, try this instead: lean back/away from the person, tilt your head forward so that your eyes roll up to maintain eye contact.  Poker face - don't smile or grimace.  Don't say anything, you just said no politely, you don't need to say anything else.  Don't be goaded, you don't need to qualify yourself or refute anything some idiot says.  If you absolutely must make any further communication do so with gesture, point to the door or just open your palm, telegraphing the you are about to slap the person.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I often say that Martin Luther King, Jr. only told part of the story when he said that people should be judged by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin. What this leaves out is the fact that our character has a skin, and that skin has a color or nature.

It is important to include a dimension such as this, but it doesn't mean going as far as your question goes. It reduces our conditions of responsibility, of credit and of blame, but it also resituates the area of responsibilty. When you say ""skill"", for example, this is something that, to some degree, we have some ability to learn and improve. At the same time we know that talent varies, and all sorts of factors go into establishing skills. This all changes the way we accord merit or demerit (don't know what is the best word here).

This is in some ways a fairly obvious truth, yet on the other hand really dealing with it requires nothing short of a whole change of life and society. There are enormous implications if you want to open up the question. It's not a simple matter, but at the same time it is somewhat revolutionary, albeit in a new direction, to take this basic condition seriously. 

But like all revolutions, it turns on truths that are already all around us and affect us in enormous ways all the time. To really begin to enter into the problematics, themes, issues, disciplines implicated in the observation requires a special work of path building and language/concepts that are fit for the task. On the one hand, they may be terms one might find in psychology of learning and not so far afield. On the other hand, it leads to a kind of decisive confrontation with the very space of action indicated by the King quote, for example. That action is submitted to thought in basic ways, since actors in the world are all under the purview of these issues. Our relations to one another, our sense of action, of responsibility and so forth are all disrupted fundamentally. At the same time this opens enormous ranges of possible positive change as well, putting emphases much more on the work of the impartation of ability and taking emphasis away from stark arenas of judgement and action. 

This leads to critiques of ""meritocracy"" as such, at least insofar as it is involved in either a stark existential mentality or in a capitalization of production/performance. Yet in limiting and in a certain way deconstructing these and other such arenas, the road is opened to doing the work needed to effect real and positive change, as in the famous adage ""teach a man to fish and he will eat for a lifetime"". 

It is possible to make one's way through these issues. In entering them, new ""gestalts"" or wholes, major themes and way points develop and can be clarifed. I call entering this work and truth nonviolence thoughtaction, which unfolds envolutionarily. 

What is critical is to realize what happens when you hold to this issue as expressed in your question. One may happen upon it and move on to other things. Then one may carry it along and it may begin to sink in and become operative over its ""jurisdiction"", so to speak. In a way that is part of your question: you are mulling over its implications with regard to the meritocratic as such, which in general is really a kind of major stratum or dimension in the world all around us. 

The truth of the issue, as available as it is, may lead to its unleashing and the unfolding of the thoughtaction that realizes its implications in one thing after another, to the point of realizing a kind of radicalization of consciousness and being in the world, just as we think of when talking about ""becoming radicalized"" or""having one's consciousness raised"". Or it may likewise unfold in the form of a ""philosophical engagement"" which may be, for some, a textual exercise, an academic enterprise or an engagement with, and being engaged by, being in a truth that issues and propagates effects all over, as may occur for some when they undertake philosophical issues and questions.

But the issue is furthermore shot through with a *gravity*. Since merit, skill, ability and character all pertain to how we do things in the world, how we understand, grow, engage, politicize, treat others, etc., this implies the issues of harm, violence, mortality and amelioration in the world. To the extent that critical moments within this ""problematic"" are opened up, one may step into an understand that the are, and already have been, engaged in these issues such that they are primary, emergent fundamentals involving critical thought and action in response to a needful world in which we are already engaged in various conditions of relatedness and responsibility that can be developed. 

Such a path entails something along the lines of a ""spiritual engagement"", a way of life, a discipline, yet takes these things into question, just as your question already takes into question the arena of judgement of, say, Martin Luther King, Jr. While it doesn't necessarily have to take as strident or revolutionary, or cause-based a form as King's, it is radical enough to constitute something essentially and irreducibly revolutionary.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Well said. I have to admit that the first thought I had was ""this guy obviously hasn't actually been addicted to heroin."" And ultimately his analogy of the 'whole steak' versus '200 pieces of it' and the percentages of users that become addicted to each are speaking to the nature of the psychological addiction, not the physical addiction. And the interviewer, I think, hits the nail on the head. The reason only 30% of heroin users actually become addicted is not because heroin is physically 'less addictive' than nicotine, but because heroin isn't sold in convenience stores where you can get a '20 hits' for $10, and you have to stick a needle in your arm to deliver it, and it's surrounded with a social stigma far greater than that of smoking. You can't shoot heroin while driving your car to work in the morning or waiting for the bus. All of these aspects are factors contributing to the psychological addictiveness of the drug.

What I would have loved to ask Dr. Linden is the addictiveness of prescribed opiate painkillers versus nicotine. I wouldn't be surprised to see such opiates having a '% Addictiveness After One Use' far closer to nicotine than heroin.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;So once you find examples of when it doesn't...I'll be happy to consider alternatives to Keynes.

Greece, The Fed, America as a whole, Spain, Portugal....  Have you missed every bit of financial news for the last 6 years?

&gt;Yes and no, though. I agree that people are dumb and that you should just let them do whatever. But along with drug use come other problems...a lot of which don't go away by ""just legalizing it"". This is why we need a Controlled Substances list...should marijuana be Schedule A? Doubt it...should it be legal? Sure. Should cocaine be legal? Probably not.

Yes drug use comes with problems, and virtually all of them are solved by legalization.  Maybe not directly, but most definitely as a result.  Take a look at Portugal who has done it for a while now.  People are going to abuse drugs no matter what, its part of human nature, legalization opens to doorway to helping those people rather than punishing them.

&gt;Fair enough. Except for the fact that a lot of people wouldn't stop to converse, they'd just throw this shit in the waste basket...kind of the norm in politics...

"linuxadmin","t5_2r9lc","I work in HPC, so I have an idea about managing many systems, so I'll try to chime in.

Basically, our standard linux clusters and all handled by a headnode, which runs something you might find useful: xCAT. There are other pieces of the headnodes, but xCAT would be the only thing you'd find interest in...

http://xcat.sourceforge.net/

xCAT handles all of the normal network services (DNS, DHCP, etc), but it also controls:

* node deployment (TFTP + stateful/stateless boot, kickstart, autoyast, etc)

* package deployment upon install, custom post install scripts)

* power control (IPMI, bladecenter controls, HMV) 

* KVM access, etc. 

* It fully supports these clients: RHEL/CentOS (+KVM virtualization), SuSE, Windows Server 2008, VMWare ESX (ESX host node deployment, VM deployment/migration/etc). 

* ( Hardware support includes: IBM, Dell, HP, and probably some others

Bonus, it's open source, and highly customizable. It can be configured into a hierarchal setup, with a xCAT master controlling different environments that have xCAT service nodes of their own, that serve their own separate networks. 

As for how it fits into your environment, it probably would only go so far. You can create custom images for different server groups (application, compute, storage), and use configuration management tools to synchronize settings to servers. We also use custom RPM repositories for software. 

We combine all of the above with GPFS, properly segmented networks, and some planning for our deal anyways...","1309480316"

"comics","t5_2qh0s","&gt;It's relevant because God being outside of time is why he can have knowledge of events **before** they happen without being the cause.

Before, you say before, and yet god exists outside of time. There is no making sense of this god knowing anything before or after it occurs.

&gt;God can know what decision you will choose of your own free will, and have laid plans **far in advance** to work with your decision.

Again, you say ""far in advance"", and yet this presumes a god which necessarily exists within our time.

&gt;That's pretty central to the determinism argument. Heck, the term itself refers to time based causality.

Not at all. Determinism states that everything happens such that for the conditions which preceded them, nothing else could have happened. If you've read up much on general relativity, this offers a description for the progression of the physical world without a singular dimension of time. Even basic relative notions of time don't really posit its actual existence, but only predicate it based on the observation of moving objects in comparison to one another.","1309480328"

No, that would be a dramatic oversimplification of Harris' point.

The idea is that the moral weight of a life is derived from the depth/quality/whatever of their consciousness. This does not imply that lesser lives are valueless, just relatively less valuable.

Torturing a fly is immoral, but only a little bit, because the fly's experience is much shallower than ours. Torturing a pig is much more immoral, and torturing a human more immoral still.

He was not arguing that from the perspective of these aliens human life is literally worthless. His example was that their consciousness was ""to us as we are to bacteria"", and his argument was that this would imply their moral weight would be equivalently ""to us as we are to bacteria"".

&gt;THE ORIGINAL POLO® BUTTON-DOWN:
&gt;
&gt;
The story of the original Polo® Button-Down dates to the late 1800s. While on a European buying trip, John E. Brooks, the grandson of our founder, observed that polo players had cleverly anchored their collars to their shirts by means of buttons, thus keeping their collars from flying into their faces during gameplay. Inspired by what he saw, he came back to Brooks and introduced the original Polo Button-Down to America that same year, thereby changing the face of menswear forever.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","I always found that StarCraft was very unlike chess and much more like go in the sense that it's a game of *forcing luck*.

Chess is a game of combinations and anticipating all possible paths, thinking ahead and considering all options when you make a move.

In Go, like StarCraft, you in fact don't know if a move is going to play out well, but you know of each thing you do that the chance is higher that it plays out well than that it doesn't, all the little things like building placements, deciding your timings, deciding what to scout, in the end the player that made the best decisions in the match most likely gets the victory because it statistically worked out the best for him or her. You make moves which you hope will benefit you later, even though you're not yet completely sure in what way. You fly your mutas around the map in a direction that is not likely to be spotted, you place your dark shrine in a location that is unlikely to be scanned. You don't go void rays against blink stalkers because the chance is very high they will get sniped and you do go void rays if an observer flies into your cannons and dies because the chance is low that they have decent anti air.

The other thing is that in StarCraft, vision is a resource that must be allocated and acquired, which adds a unique dimension that also makes it unique from for instance poker, Poker may have incomplete information and forces you to guess and read the psychology, but in Poker, information is not a resource, in StarCraft it is essential that you sacrifice other resources for the acquisition of information, which gives it a character unlike any other of these games. You can choose to allocate more resources to obtain information and thus be better able to decide what to do, or you can choose to not do so and simply take your chances and still be right, much to the frustration of your opponent who did make his second observer and died to your blind timing push.","1309480394"

What voltage are you running at? High voltage can heat up the gel causing the polymer to lose strength and smear the bands. Try lowering to 100V, might take longer but you'll get a less smeared image.

You can also try running the gel in the fridge, which will keep the buffer and gel cool all throughout the run.

It also seems like you could decrease the volume of sample loaded, which will decrease the size of the tail, but will decrease signal intensity somewhat proportionally.

Also you can just google ""gel smiling"" you'll get more suggestions than you could ever try ([Here](http://www.6mgel.com/gel-smiling.htm)). However my best guess is that it has to do with the heat.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","The basic idea is this (google the keywords for specific examples and more technical details):

* Send a GET request to a web site. That looks like GET &lt;stuff in the URL that comes after the server name&gt; --  in the case of a simple google search, GET search?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1040&amp;bih=654&amp;q=email&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=  of course you have to escape special characters if you're putting this in code.

* If you google for the correct format of a GET request, you can even do this by hand. Telnet to the web server at port 80. (This works for most web servers but not all, because of how they're configured.) Quickly, because it will time out if you take too long, type your GET request (for example: GET /index.html ) and press enter a couple of times. The web server will give you the raw web page, with HTTP headers, and close the connection.

* Your program will need to do this, just in code of course, and you'll need to parse the resulting web server response in order to grab the information you want.

* Most languages have a library that will handle the low-level details for you, so you don't have to deal with sockets and telnet and even the http protocols. Perl, for example, has a library where you simply call a get() function and pass it a url, and you can call various functions to get the pieces of the resulting http header or the page itself. Then you can feed the page into a regular expression (or a series of them) to parse through the html and grab whatever you want. This is the tricky part because writing html-parsing code is not simple.

* POST requests, or requests involving sessions or cookies or https are more complicated. Figure out how to do a GET request first, and then work your way up to POST.","1309480415"

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","As an anarchist, I don't deny being an idealist.  However, I try to avoid being ""unbelievably optimistic"" by being more realistic and practical about my idealism.  Note that I didn't say that lynch mobs could never occur in an anarchist society—let’s also not forget that they occur in state-government societies too (vigilante groups and corruption arise even within law enforcement organizations).  Once you are living under institutionalized state-government corruption, in say Libya, Iran, Haiti, etc., without access to legal channels of changing things, there is not much else you can do but resort to violent and non-violent forms of extralegal direct action.  I will even admit, unlike some anarchists, that some of the stateless societies of the past, present, and future aren't places we'd want to live due to the predominance of violence and other negative factors.  

The historical record is imperfect, and while relatively rare, some of the most peaceful societies that have ever existed have been stateless. However, there have been quite violent stateless societies too--just as there has been variance between states at different places and times. However, the same could be said of state-governments.  Nazi Germany would be the obvious example, while Somalia is a favorite example that gets mentioned when someone wants to derail a discussion about anarchist philosophy (To be fair, some anarchists don’t know how to deal with such criticism when it is made honestly and with an open mind either).

So my previous comment about a hypothetical future “modern” anarchist society organizing alternative systemic social channels for collecting/weighing evidence, wielding diffuse sanctions, and restoring social harmony was not made without any evidence to back up its potentiality (no matter how remote).  The “primitive” stateless societies that have actually existed are distinguished by their use of diffuse sanctions (gossip, name calling, arguing, fist fighting, killing and ostracism) and religious sanctions in the absence of legal sanctions. Ideally, the more non-violent of these diffuse sanctions could be wielded by roughly anyone and everyone in the community.

Concerning “primitive” stateless societies, anthropologist Harold Barclay says:

&gt;“In many societies, fines and other punishments are meted out by an assembly. Radcliffe-Brown calls these ‘organized’ sanctions. Yet they are still not ‘legal’ but have the character of diffuse sanctions, of a more formalized type, if the assembly has no authority to use force in executing its decisions. In such instances the assembly members act as mediators rather than judges and are successful to the extent that they can convince two disputing parties to come to some compromise.”

Mark Cooney points out that:

&gt;""...the state's system of social control--law--is just one type of third-party settlement. Settlement can be much more informal, conducted by family members, friends, neighbors, or community leaders. Informal settlement usually takes the form of mediation in which the third party facilitates an agreement between the principals, or arbitration in which the third party devises a solution to the conflict but lacks the power to enforce it. Whatever form it assumes, informal settlement has much the same effect as law; reducing the likelihood of violence among the principals. Law has always attracted much more scholarly attention, but its peace-enhancing properties are not unique.""

Mark Cooney hypothesizes that the relationship between the state and lethal conflict is U-shaped. It's not negative as Hobbesian theory predicts. He says, ""A combination of materials from anthropology, criminology, and political science suggests that rates of lethal conflict tend to be high when state authority is absent and also when it is extremely strong or centralized."" In his paper ""From Warre To Tyranny: Lethal Conflict And The State"" Mark Cooney says, ""One implication of my argument is that the most common criticism of anarchism-that it would inevitably increase violence-appears to be true only under some conditions. In highly centralized nations that are experiencing a wave of political executions, lethal conflict would surely decrease in the absence of the state. But in democratic polities, the sudden disappearance of the state among people long accustomed to legal means of resolving disputes would create a void likely to be filled, at least in part, by violence. However, a gradual reduction in state authority might allow people to develop alternative nonviolent ways of handling conflict, such as negotiation, mediation, arbitration, avoidance, and toleration.""  These are the alternative diffuse social, as opposed to legal, channels of dealing with conflict that anarchists promote as ideal.  

Mark Cooney says, ""There are several examples of nonviolent stateless people...One well-documented case is the Semai, a group of about thirteen thousand people who live deep within the rain forest of the central Malay Peninsula in small bands rarely exceeding one hundred people...Each band has its own well-defined territory and a headman whose authority is based on persuasion, not coercion..A second example is the Cheyenne Indians of the Great Plains of North America. For most of the nineteenth century, the Cheyenne were equine hunters and gatherers. Although they counted among their numbers many hot-headed young warriors who regularly raided and battled other tribes, the Cheyenne succeeded in keeping intratribal homicide within reasonable boundaries. Over a forty-five-year period (1835-1879) they had some sixteen homicides, giving them an annual rate of approximately 10 per 100,000, about the same rate as the United States today...While this might initially seem quite high, remember that it comes from a society lacking the benefit of modern emergency medical care so that many wounds that today could be treated would then have proved fatal.""

However, I still don't claim to know with certainty what will and won't work within our ""modern"" context.  No one can.  Situations are different and are constantly changing after all.  If hierarchy is good at producing some of the economic results we want in some instances, then maybe we could allow a capitalist-like currency-pricing mechanism to take its course as long as it remains subordinate to the decisions made by the larger anarchist delegative direct democracy. So maybe you could have society authorize people to take some portion of the commons to manage in a more traditionally hierarchical corporate way. 
Maybe an anarchist society needs some internally hierarchical organizations (like a military with a traditional chain-of-command) to sustain the rest of its egalitarian structure in a “modern” context as much as possible? If it could indeed be kept under collective control, and society benefited as a whole, that's about as ""capitalist""/“statist” I could see some anarchists allowing things to become.  The authority of these things will always be questioned and struggled against by anarchists to create a more ideal world regardless.  People taking matters into their own hands against oppressive/exploitative institutions/groups/people have always been and always will be a part of human society.  Even if we can never achieve a society that looks exactly the way we want, many of us believe that the freedom and equality we have today under the rule of state-government is contingent upon an ever vigilant populous willing to wield direct action in line with the anarchist spirit.  If it were up to the ruling political and corporate elite, we wouldn’t have near the level of participation in the system that we have now.

So I'm even philosophically agnostic about my own anarchism. I don't claim to know that we can completely do without the state to create a ""modern"" anarchist society. I just think it is something worth struggling towards. We won't know what is possible unless we reach for the impossible.  Like Rudolf Rocker said, “I’m an anarchist not because I believe anarchism is the final goal, but because there is no such thing as a final goal.""  I'll accept that some people might not find me anarchist enough to cooperate with at times. Maybe I am not welcome in the anarchist movement of some people. We've all just got to try to find a shared basis around which we can engage in some healthy cooperative conflict without competing against each other.

1. set her birthday party for an (arbitrary) day that her boyfriend was volunteering for a friend(something he'd arranged far in advance). Apparently without asking him.

2. got so pissed off when he said he couldn't attend she posted that she was breaking up with him and how he was some sort of massive asshole. (Making a private matter public.) 

3. some other girl was supporting her saying stupid shit like 'you don't need no man'; 'friends are more important then boyfriends.' (Oh, rlly? So why is she having a nuclear meltdown because her boyfriend is helping out a friend instead of going to her party? I guess friends are more important then boyfriends but friends are not more important then girlfriends?)

Now, erasing the data is also a physical process. If you were doing information theory, you would just say that the entropy is gone when the data is deleted, but you're actually doing physics. So since erasing data is a physical process, it can't reduce net entropy; the physical entropy used to store the data can't just disappear, no matter how you erase it.

If you wanted to be clever, you could avoid the first paragraph entirely by just saying that thermodynamic entropy turns into information entropy; it sounds like that's how it has been explained to you. But the problem is that makes the second paragraph much less clear, because it's not immediately obvious that information entropy *can't* just disappear when the data is erased.","1309480437"

No, I have not been hurt or ""violated"" since I lost the weight (although I was before I lost it, so my fears about assault are not unwarranted), but the increase in the amount of unwanted attention has been noticeable and at times disturbing to me. I don't think it's fair to say it's a ""boogeyman"" I've created.

based on the sign and plan.  Things came out well.  I caulked the heck out of those
and now the signs need to be taped up so I (or someone else) can prime them.  
Strangly enough the signs part was absolutely the hardest part of [all of this](http://i.imgur.com/S2I8P.jpg).  By 
far. I've cut my hands up, I have crap all over me, I'm exhausted, but I am very
satisfied with [the progress](http://i.imgur.com/HyABB.jpg) for the day.  I feel a sense of accomplishment.

tomorrow -

I'll be building the first layer roof supports tomorrow during the morning, and 
trying to get as much as I can on the actual first layer roof cut and placed. I
have some things to do during the day off and on, so work on the ol' girl will stop
for a bit. Then the second roof layer will be built.  Those roof layers will need 
plenty of caulking (I've used SOOO many tubes of that stuff, it's getting 
ridiculous).  After the second layer is built I'll have to make a base (real easy) 
for the light, place it, caulk it, tape the police box signs up to keep paint off 
them, prime all of it, and then it's ready for its first layer of paint.  then the 
""windows"" need to be built.  those can be simple pieces of wood with trim screwed 
on to look like windows, all hinged to open up if she chooses to do so.

so that's the plan.  it should be done by around the 5th of july I think.  I hope.

boys so fast!

This is something I've never understood. If there is no answer from the other side, how is there a relationship?  I couldn't imagine having a relationship with someone when I spoke to them, and they never spoke back. 

While one may claim that they get the answer in signs from god, that would be like having a relationship with someone in real life, and they don't answer ever, but leave cryptic signals that one may or may not notice.

It makes no sense to me.

I started low carb because I'm over 200 lbs, so to eat 200-250 grams of protein a day, I eat a shitload of food, and didn't want to waste precious stomach space with carbs.  It also keeps the calories down, obviously.

Thanks, btw.  It feels good when people notice, and I don't think people realize how much little compliments feel great for days afterwards.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The FCC was created to prevent this type of information control.  During the cold war, one of the most important differences between Russian news and US news was that Russian news restricted what its citizens could easily learn.

In the 1990's the FCC rules were changed.  Leveraged buyouts put a few very powerful individuals in charge of the flow of information.  The internet was a slight correction to this, but the vast quantity of information, minus fact checkers for most of it, doesn't lend itself to focusing the average American on news that has far reaching results.  That was the power of headlines and the 10:00 news that has been lost.  

The media was called the 4th estate.  After the 3 branches of government, which was to balance power, the media was the watchdog.  Reporters regularly drove politicians crazy by challenging their statements.  Watch a press conference from the 70's or earlier.

As you can probably tell, I'm rather new to Reddit.  I don't know anything about the poster.  But if you think this is unimportant because it's something everyone knows, you misunderstand to power involved in controlling our media.  You fail to understand the implications of this post.

I challenge you to find news articles and watch news shows from the 70's.  You may find them boring because there is a lot of information.  It's less entertaining than today, but damn, we knew a lot more about what was going on and why it mattered than the average American knows today.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","ok, that would work in theory, but Joe doesn't put the money in the bank. he spends it on food and worthless junk at Wal-Mart, and probably makes a few minimum payments on some maxed out credit cards. (we're a consumer nation right? yay!)  the american savings rate is what, maybe 2%, and has been negative until just recently. 50% of americans have no savings at all. they live hand to mouth. half of the ""upper 50%"" have less than 20k in savings/retirement.  it's safe to assume that 80% of americans have negligible savings, no real savings plan, and on top of that, are probably loaded with credit card, car payments, and home debt.

have you not seen the rise in commodities and metals? it's easy for economists to stick their fingers in their ears and sing ""cpi, cpi,"" but the cpi is a grossly lagging indicator, and dismisses ""volatile"" items that, again, make up a large portion of Joe's budget.

my point is, a lot (at least 75%) of Joe's money is likely already in the economy, it went to Wal-Mart, then to their suppliers, then probably to China, (who are willing to absorb some of our inflation) and then into a Chinese grab for commodities, spiraling prices here.

i hate to use the term ""real economy"", but there's a huge disconnect here between the statistical economy on paper, pushed around by wall street, bankers, and economists and average americans in the real economy.   you can look at M2 and shadowy M3 figures all you want, and yes, you will see massive deflation. but isn't all of this ""deflation"" simply destruction of paper gains on paper mortgages, bundled, collateralized, with paper interest included, insured, then resold over and over? none of that ""money"" was real to begin with, although the few who turned them over at the right time benefited greatly.

the deflation and liquidity trap are all on paper.  in the ""real economy"" inflation is real, it's increasing, and it's hitting the limping consumerists who make up the majority of the economy. if the DJIA dropped to 200 points tomorrow, 75% of americans would be materially unaffected by it, and 50% wouldn't even know what that means in the first place. (they may all lose their jobs the next day, but there is little vested interest in the capital and financial markets) which is why, in my opinion, the fed propping up the markets with QE1&amp;2, and all of its intervention had little effect on average people (actually hurting them) but obviously benefitted the financial class with bailouts on their bad paper and rising capital markets.

now i'm just ranting about the pure idiot consumers who make up the majority of our economy and ivory tower elitists, but there's a huge disconnect somewhere, neither side seems to understand the other.

summary: i think the inflation is already here. they money has been spent, not deposited. deflation is statistical, and meaningless to 80% of people.

Many (most?) of us believe that prisons, and contemporary society, breed crime. 

&gt;Every society has the criminals it deserves. -Emma Goldman.

This isn't to say that a person *deserves* to be raped or murdered, but that there are obvious factors that contribute to the creation of rapists and murders. The state and capitalism are not helping to do away with these problems, but instead they are actually creating more rapists and murderers.  
My ""better than prisons"" idea is to actually eliminate the ""need"" for prisons, and this actually involves eliminating prisons themselves.","1309480474"

Religious shit is bad now but look at how bad it was twenty years ago, Don't Ask Don't Tell was attacked for being *too* liberal, DOMA was put in effect ""just in case,"" the President himself (Bush-41) said he did not believe atheists could be considered true citizens. And thirty years before that there was still morning prayers in public school, bible study in public schools, ""blue laws"" restricting most work on the Sabbath, homosexual acts were a crime, saying ""fuck"" was a crime, atheists could be banned from holding elected state office in more than half of the states, mixed race marriage was still banned in about 1/3 of states, and the census showed almost no one reporting as atheist.

Today gay marriage is slowly becoming the law of the land, DOMA is not being defended, DODT is repealed, the President goes out of his way to include non-believers when talking about groups in the US, and atheists and non-believers are far and away the fastest growing group of people in all 50 states. And please don't stand here and tell me that the stigma about atheism is going up because it just isn't. Compared to our little group of atheists most states are still very backward but don't try to tell me things are not better than they were and are not continuing to get better still. ","1309480482"

I don't notice it when I'm lifting, but the next day I get a really bad, dull ache right where the femur his the pelvis, and it an radiates down to my knee.

I'm lucky in that I've figured out how to keep it from happening (stretching, rolling, and very careful about my form), but I think I know the type of pain you're talking about and I don't envy you one bit.  If I experienced it every time I squated, I just wouldn't bother.  It wouldn't be worth it.

If you're able to do all the lifts you say you can, don't sweat it.  You'll be fine.  By the way, do you ever do front squats?  I only ask because they have never bothered me one bit, and if whatever is going on with you anatomically is similar to what I've dealt with, they might work for you too.","1309480484"

Again, it's not my fucking problem, and you shouldn't be able to force me to give up my right to petition the court for damages just because your insurance is fucked up.  

&gt;Your idea that a company only gets sued because they do shitty things is just naive. People sue all the time because they're broke, they're angry, and parasitic lawyers exist to tell them they've been wronged and it's time to get what's theirs from those rich bastards.

And most of these get tossed out before they ever see a jury.

"masseffect","t5_2rc19","The way I see it, ME2 is kind of a bridge to ME3. The choices you make set you up for the final battle that we are all waiting for in ME3.

Shepard knows that Sovereign was one of many Reapers, and it took a lot of work and cost a lot of lives to take down a single Reaper. I think that's why the relationships you make in ME2 will be crucial for the final battle in ME3.

We still don't know from ME1 whether saving or killing the Rachni was a good idea, so all the seemingly meaningless decisions we make in ME2 shouldn't be any different. For example, maybe killing Sidonis on Garrus' loyalty mission will have some negative repercussions later on. Maybe not.

The Collectors suck as the villains, but ultimately they're being used by the Reapers. We know that they have a special interest in humans and it's bad enough that innocent civilians are being abducted to be ground up into Reaper-paste. But isn't the Illusive Man a villain as well? Especially if you don't give him the Collector station at the end. And it's already been revealed that Cerberus is going to be the villain in ME3.

The sucky thing about DLC is that some of it really changes the plot. Especially Lair of the Shadow Broker. And I guess Arrival does too, to some extent. Arrival just isn't the best gameplay-wise. Don't bother with Overlord. I'm not sure about Bring Down the Sky for ME1 since I can't get it to work so I haven't played it.

tl;dr - Yes, there are unanswered questions left at the end of ME2. That's why there's a third game.","1309480495"

"science","t5_mouw","Pointing out the potential conflict of interest allows us to acknowledge that fact and take a closer look. Presumably they wouldn't have published research that presented that saturated fats did cause harm. One might ask how many other studies were thrown out because they didn't paint their industry in a favourable light, or how many other negative affects saturated fat has on the body which weren't presented. Meta-analysis is particularly susceptible to bias. It's very easy to apply unnecessary selection criteria which reflect a certain motivation.

I have an educational login. Here's the final statement in the discussion:

&gt;In conclusion, our meta-analysis showed that there is insufficient evidence from prospective epidemiologic studies to conclude that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of CHD, stroke, or CVD. However, the available data were not adequate for determining whether there are CHD or stroke associations with saturated fat in specific age and sex subgroups. Furthermore, there was insufficient statistical power for this meta-analysis to assess the effects on CVD risk of replacing specific amounts of saturated fat with either polyunsaturated fat or carbohydrate. Finally, nutritional epidemiologic studies provide only one category of evidence for evaluating the relation of saturated fat intake to risk for CHD, stroke, and CVD. An overall assessment requires consideration of results of clinical trials as well as information regarding the effects of saturated fat on underlying disease mechanisms, as discussed elsewhere in this issue. [Meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies evaluating the association of saturated fat with cardiovascular disease]

There are more issues discussed, but the source is copyrighted, so you'll need a subscription to read it in full. They cite previous studies which *do* show a positive correlation between decreased saturated fat intake and lower risk of CHD. They discuss the issues with limited information provided in the studies they sampled, particularly insofar as total daily caloric intake and associated nutrition. Also see [this response](http://www.canibaisereis.com/download/scarborough-overadjustment-obscures-true-associations.pdf). The tl;dr is that this meta-analysis simply fails to find a correlation, for many possible reasons listed. Other studies have. Given this, coupled with the motivation behind the research, it would be best to rely on existing research. Among others:

Prediction of Cardiovascular Mortality in Middle-aged Men by Dietary and Serum Linoleic and Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids, David E. Laaksonen et al.

"technology","t5_2qh16","The XP -&gt; Vista UI redesign was the largest one I've experienced (I didn't start really using Windows until Windows 2000), and it really wasn't a huge redesign.  The task bar and start menu were still there.  The start menu acted slightly differently, but it's not like it was hard to figure out (a single tree view instead of a context menu hierarchy).  The windows themselves looked different, but the buttons (minimize, maximize, restore, close, context) were still in the same locations.  Menu bars were still docked at the top of the screen.  There's still a notification area at the right end of the task bar, with the date/time.

If you want to talk about UI redesign, talk about the Ribbon UI.  That is a far greater redesign than anything the Windows OS itself has undergone.

Windows may not come with as many bundled applications, but then again, why would I want them?  I prefer to pick and choose my programs.  Most of them are free as well (to take iTunes as an example, I use foobar2000 for the same purpose).

Three cats just doesn't feel right when we're used to having 4.  See, this place was designed for my cats.  It's a lot of space, (2800 sq ft).  The pet door opens on a big backyard backed by 27 acres of common space.  The street out front ends about 150 feet from our lawn, so there's very little traffic.

Animal shelters tend to frown on outdoor cats.  Our current self-appointed mouser spends most of his time on pest patrol, but he's pissed  right now, because the cat door is closed.  His feet look like he's been walking in broken glass, (burrs maybe?) so I want him to spend more time inside.

**Several months later, another cliff face is discovered on the other side of the mountain, parallel to the first one. This one has holes as well, but not the perfect human silhouettes that the other side had. They are vaguely human, but the limbs are so thin and stretched out that they resemble worms rather than arms or legs. A science team has arrived to investigate. One worker shines his flashlight into one of the holes. To his horror, he sees something alive very slowly coming down the tunnel—its face twisted and squashed against the rock, its arms extended to unnatural lengths and curved.**

"science","t5_mouw","1) While you are sort of right that meta-analysis is possible to replicate for anyone with access to scientific journals, it is still pretty damn annoying. I did one on CVD and air pollution for my senior thesis: it was a lot of work. I'm not about to go replicate this one, though I did read the study and tried to scrutinize their methods just from what they reported without going back and checking.

2) One of the things I saw while reading the study was a part in the discussion section where they examine the possibility of publication bias (there's even a graph- you can see some of the smaller studies tend to have more significant results, which is a sign of publication bias but hard to verify), and acknowledge that it existed somewhat. Hard to get around, but doesn't mean that there's no point in doing a meta-analysis or that its results are inherently less valid than another study- there are flaws in every study design. 

3) Also, anonymous-coward is right that in this case publication bias would favor an effect being FOUND, and this study was going with the null hypothesis. Thus, evidence that their sample was skewed in the direction it was actually makes their estimates more conservative and therefore potentially more plausible. 

However, the results do seem intuitively weird. I'm kind of hung up on the factors they sometimes did and sometimes didn't control for, like other types of fat, and total caloric intake. Also the sample size, as they admit, was actually too small to be broken down into demographic categories (age, sex), after a point, and it's very possible that these categories have considerable influence on the effect being investigated.","1309480554"

"politics","t5_2cneq","The middle class spends most of what they make just to survive.  They need to pay bills, food, medicine and save very little.  This is immediately injected back into the economy and thus keeps the economy running. Giving it to an already wealthy individual who is likely to bank it, does not. I am not sure why this is a difficult concept for so many.

Currently the ""job creators"" have more capital on hand than ever yet unemployment is at an all time high. The ""job creators"" argument for lower taxes on the wealthy is a lie.  Since the GW tax breaks have been passed the inverse has been true and the gap between the rich and poor is approaching what it was during the great depression.

Think of it this way.  You have a group of people constantly passing a finite set of blocks back and forth to each other yet there is a few who only collect blocks and then selectively pass back only a fraction of what they receive. What do you think would happen to the volume of blocks being passed between the rest of the group?

* How do I feel about this?  I have no idea, I'm in shock.
* How *should* I fell about this?  I should be angry.  I should end the relationship.  That's what everyone else does when presented with this situation, so it must be the correct answer.

I think our culture values strict monogamy so much that it almost pushes it on people.  For example, I was really disappointed by the ending of ""No Strings Attached"".  Of course, since it was a mainstream romantic comedy, I knew what the ending would be before I walked in.

I have been vegetarian, vegan, raw food throughout the years before I found a balance - at least in my experience, my bf of 6 years' only concern was that I felt good and healthy.

 Your boyfriend should really consider that you are doing it BECAUSE you want to be healthier, give him some facts and let him know that you've researched it (you have, yes?). Ultimately it is not his decision to make,especially if you are considering staying together for a long time, you each need to be able to make your own decisions. It sounds like maybe he is afraid of something unknown (vegetarianism) and maybe has only heard bad things, so he is concerned for your wellbeing, which is good - but not if he is considering breaking up with you for changing your diet?

Are there other signs of him trying to control your decisions, or is this a one time instance? Always remember, you need to take care of yourself first and foremost - you can't help others if you're not well enough to help yourself.


Also! It's really not that difficult to accommodate a vegetarian diet. Though I am not strictly veg, (only turkey, fish and eggs, really) I've never ever had an issue not being able to eat out at a restaurant. Especially if you do not have an issue with meat touching your food, you can just pick it out.

&gt; Because there are people who think the Fed must be responsible for everything -- at least everything bad.

The FED is bad because our monetary system is bad and it's basically the lynch pin to it all. That being said, it's not like it's those central bankers fault. We the people of the earth are on net *asking for this sort of monetary arrangement*. We will get rid of it when we the people ask to get rid of it. We will likely not do so out of reason but instead from it simply performing horribly.

&gt; The Fed caused the worldwide housing bubble, which in most countries much bigger than in the US ... the Fed causes worldwide commodity price rises in foreign currencies not tied to the dollar, etc etc.

Yes, indirectly. It's because the fiat currency of foreign governments only has the illusion of storing value for its people so long as the reserve asset of the monetary system, the US dollar, is able to maintain its store of value. Thus as a government leader, if you want to maintain control over your nation's economy, you cannot allow your own domestic currency to appreciate against the US dollar for any considerable length of period of time. You must print as the US dollar does. If it prints a lot, you must print a lot.

It's not the fault of the Americans. The Americans have the FED, which is the key to the whole monetary arrangement, but at the end of the day the world is *voting with their actions* to keep this style of monetary arrangement. It will change quite quickly as soon as the people vote with their actions that they do not want this monetary arrangement any longer. This likely won't come about through them reasoning it out, but instead from the monetary system simply bringing them into an ever-lower standard of living.

&gt; If only the Fed were so powerful. I wish!

The FED plays the music and the world must follow as it does so. That being said, the FED is forced to play music all the time. It must constantly expand its currency.

&gt; But commodity price moves are clearly driven by the fast growing Asian economies, from China on, via plain old-fashioned supply and demand.

Their economies are trying to grow, yes. The current monetary arrangement is greatly impeding worldwide economic growth relative to what it could be at if we didn't have this sort of monetary arrangement.","1309480590"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","That's not what I am saying.  Basically, the whole idea of judging people with arbitrary morality by the tenets and stories related in ancient desert writings is completely asinine.  For example, how many people suffer just because of the religious intolerance of ""vice""?  Yet no one is punished and imprisoned/killed for not providing for the poor, or getting divorced, because it is just an inconvenient tenet that no one seems to want to remember.

However, at the same time, so many of the same people make myriad religious compromises because it is convenient to do so and less convenient not to.  There is just no consistency and their beliefs are just so absolutely arbitrary in both application and substance.

So it burns my britches when religious folk decide that they know the right way to do something because their religion tells them how it is, when basically they are likely just ignoring anything they don't happen to agree with in the first place.

Religion ends up being a reason to justify intolerance of anything that a person doesn't personally feel comfortable with.  However, the things in the bible that also make the same people feel uncomfortable, are just ignored.

I get pretty tired of having my freedom and life infringed upon by a bunch of religious people with no greater justification than simple intolerance.  What's extra annoying is that most of those intolerant ideas are due to propaganda in the first place.  So it's a bunch of people running around and condemning people because our oligarchy told them to (and it was in the bible or something).

"law","t5_2qh9k","It's not that simple.  The law varies mildly even down to *individual judges* who have latitude on matters like when and how motions are to be brought *in their particular courtroom.*  There are many other small differences in many other ways.  If you want to navigate everything, you need a lawyer and a seasoned secretary.  Having them nail down the loose ends would cost as much as hiring someone traditionally.

No, don't read a conspiracy into this.  Courts and judges do certain things to please themselves, not as some racket to protect fees - they're much much much too selfish to give a crap about that.  One court I had to file at required pleadings in triplicate, bluebacked, stapled exactly three times across the top, two hole punched, a little label on the bottom right corner of the blueback with the pleading caption in all caps, and the pleading had to be in 14 point type.

Another court required precisely 4"" of space from the top of the pleading to the caption.  The clerk sat at the filing window with a ruler and measured pleadings as they came in.  Your pleading would be kicked if it wasn't four fucking inches.  Quite a few pro se folks had their pleadings kicked on the last day to file.  They often got a default and were fucked.

And this is just the trivial stuff.  There are bigger ways to screw up.  You pay lawyers to navigate this.  Their hourly charge also supports a receptionist, a calendar person, a secretary, and sometimes a paralegal.  I can't say how important the support staff is.  Practicing law is truly complex and takes years to get a handle on.  Don't expect to get *good* legal work for free or cheap.","1309480656"

I feel the same would apply to Starcraft.

Idra will be the perfect color analyst for any casting duo if he added a tad bit more BM when casting or maybe some lively MC-like fervor.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Clinton liked to use the military to conduct operations that he could use for PR.  This often meant putting people in harms way but limiting their tactics to 'minimum risk'.  Not minimum risk for the troops, minimum risk of political fall out.  Its one thing to commit troops to a risky operations, that's what we signed on to do.  It is another thing entirely to then tie our hands and demand we execute with a minimum of resources or 'noise'.  He also had a fondness for peace keeping operations that were designed in such a way that politicians (not just him) could go to the press and say ""see?  we are doing something"", when all they were succeeding in doing was getting troops killed and destroying moral.  Ask anyone who served in Somalia, Kosovo, Haiti, etc.  Frankly, Im surprised he allowed live ammo to be issued.

On a side note, soldiers should never be peace keepers, it goes completely against their training.  That isn't to say I am against peace keeping as a concept, just that a force specifically designed and trained for such a mission is needed.

EDIT:  I loved my job while I was in (11BC2 was my MOS, I served primarily in LRS detachments).  I had intended to make a career of it.  I also voted for Clinton in 92. The decision to not re-enlist was one of the hardest Ive ever had to make.  A part of me felt I was abandoning friends and people I had served along side for years.  I just could not continue under those conditions.

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","My problem with the HST is that it is more regressive than the GST/PST were. [What's taxable now.](http://www.hstinbc.ca/media/GST_PST_HST_List_v04.pdf)

An example. We'll even assume 10% HST. We need to get three kids ready for a new school year. Let's say $300 for school supplies and $600 for new clothes. Under GST/PST that's $300 + $15 for the supplies and $600 + $30 for the clothes whether it's adult sized clothing or not. Under HST it's $300 + $30 for the supplies. If your kids still wear child sizes it's still $600 + $30 but if they grew big and fast like me they're into adult sizes and that's the full HST for $600 + $60. That's a difference of either $15 or $45 depending on the size of your kids. At $45 extra tax on that one annual trip you're going to need to buy $2250 worth of stuff that wasn't previously PST exempt to break even on the 12% getting knocked down to 10%. If you're a middle class family that's pretty easy but for lower incomes it might not be.

Booze is 3% cheaper. Big deal. $11.50 six pack becomes $11.20. $100 bottle of scotch becomes $97.40. A little better but if I'm buying $100 bottles of scotch $2.60 isn't a huge deal. Restaurants are not passing that on to you so you're still paying what you were before.

Maintaining a home becomes more expensive. Repairing appliances now has HST. Any kind of electrical, plumbing, HVAC repairs now have HST. Landscaping, snow removal, house cleaning services have HST.

The Memberships, Entertainment and Sports Equipment section had a lot of exemptions removed. It became more expensive to go out for fun or keep yourself in shape due to the HST changeover. If you're middle class you probably do a lot of these types of things and they all got 7% (5% in three years) more expensive. Now you need to spend a lot more on the previously non-PST exempt stuff to have that 12% down to 10% be worth it.

All that said, they clearly kept some of the exemptions. Why couldn't they have kept all of the exemptions and kept the rate at 12%? Then literally nothing would have changed except how businesses have to report sales tax. It smells!

Edit: **tl;dr What is no longer exempt is key and I think most people will pay more tax so that's why HST sucks.**","1309480677"

"politics","t5_2cneq","This bill is trying to codify rules that would be a huge step in establishing broader legislative states rights.  The precedence could conceivably allow for states to make their own variations to FDA rulings- and drug companies could be forced to lobby at the state level.  States variously have medical marijuana, legalized prostitution, and statewide medical care, but without validation on the federal level, national government could change those laws overnight simply by choosing to enforce federal oversight.  The Supreme Court has twice ruled in favor of federal jurisdiction in the issue of medical marijuana, and national enforcement of national laws still continues.

I imagine that many members of Congress are not only beholden to lobbyists, but also have an attachment to not changing the status quo in terms of the (im)balance of power and the (im)balance in checks and balances between federal government and the judicial branch.

So with that in mind, I am very curious how the law is being phrased in the new bill.  I would like to see our Congress confirm that states may act as laboratories for different policies without federal intervention- (unfortunately the Supreme Court has ruled for the Federal government laws to supercede State laws).

TLDR:  Any bill that legitimizes states right to medical marijuana probably faces a host of federalist issues.","1309480685"

We were all standing in line with our masks on in the hut. One at a time, the instructor would ask the front guy to take off his mask. The drill sgt. would then start asking questions.

So here I am, a few rows back and I can hear the DS asking each person, ""What's your social security number?"" The person would respond, the DS might ask one more question, then the guy would run out of the shack.

So when he gets to me, Im figuring I'll be hard, take off my mask and just tell him my social like it's nothing. Off goes the mask, DS asks, ""What's your first general order?"" to which I respond all cool like, ""555-55-5555 (not my real ssn)."" Then it dawned on my that I've answered the wrong question all smooth and blew out all my air to answer the question. Panic kicks in because I know Im going to have to breath in the air. Of course I had to because the DS stepped into my ass and put me on like a pair of pants for answering the question incorrectly.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","Here's mine:

http://deckbox.org/sets/57409

(NB: It intentionally plays down a few combos because it's for casual multiplayer and needs to remain fun. If winning was all I cared about, it would have a heck of a lot more ways to get the Worldgorger combo going than it does now).


I decided to move all-in on fatties and have virtually no cheap creatures left, but you do, so:

You _DEFINITELY_ want to have a look at [Victimize](http://magiccards.info/us/en/166.html) and [Recurring Nightmare](http://magiccards.info/ex/en/72.html).

You also need way more looting (draw a card, then discard a card). It gets your fatties in your graveyard and draws into utility and most importantly your reanimators. [Careful Study](http://magiccards.info/od/en/70.html) sets you up for a good reanimate on turn 2, so that's an automatic 4-of. You have a creature fodder theme so look into [Merfolk Traders](http://magiccards.info/wl/en/43.html) which is a 2 mana loot spell that leaves you some fodder. There are boatloads of cheap looters. Cheap is key. Your current deck doesn't have enough strategies for ditching your fatties into the bin. While you're at it, get rid of ALL your discard spells. People will figure out what you're playing soon enough, they won't be ditching juicy reanimate targets. As a rule you'll be reanimating your own fatties 90%+ of the time, even in casual multiplayer.

It's not so good for speed, but being on the draw + having a ravnica double-land such as [Dimir Aqueduct](http://magiccards.info/cmd/en/270.html) can net you free discard by having more than 7 cards in your hand at end of turn. You also need ways to fix that blue, which is so amazing for these kinds of decks, so that helps nicely.

You may possibly need more reanimators - without a reanimation card you have nothing to do, and any removal means you need more, so you should be drawing 3 to 4 of them in a single game, preferably. Having 9 reanimators in the deck is then not good enough, even if you drop down to 60. The looting helps, though. Some more good reanimate spells are [Necromancy](http://magiccards.info/vi/en/14.html), Exhume, and Diabolic Servitude.

There are other cards that are good in graveyards, not just fatties. There's Anger and Dragon Breath in particular which give haste (which is awesome in these kinds of decks, because the fatties come from nowhere).

Worldgorger is an endless combo with Animate Dead (but be careful of instant-speed removal, which will kill you outright!). You may or may not want to abuse it. There are other really neat fatties. It That Betrays in particular is very evil. To shore up your decks' strengths against removal, look at amazing enters-the-battlefield abilities. (I admit I have no nice ETB effects in my deck. I did have a Sundering Titan in there at one point but it was too annoying).


What I picked up from your deck:

Avatar of Woe is just plain a decent reanimate target, and especially in multiplayer odds are you can hardcast her for BB, especially as you'll be stocking your own graveyard.

Diabolic Edict might be worth running, though as a rule I virtually always just reanimate my own stuff, and I don't have enough sac fodder to efficiently play it.","1309480719"

"scifi","t5_2qh2z","&gt; Space/Time first

It was a joke thing done for charity, I don't care about nitpicking. But you doraise a good point, that I'll get back to shortly.

&gt;  The escape from the Pandorica 

Let's, instead, tackle RTD's season 3 finale, which some people complained about because the fact that it started with references to a ""paradox machine"" and ""a network of mind control satellites"" and ended with both of those being critical elements of how the Doctor won.

Many people still complain that it was a ""deus ex machina"" ending.

Until you can explain why that's so much less logical than a story about the universe being ""a chaos machine"", I'm not prepared to accept any claims that Moffat does not make shit up as he goes along.

&gt; In other words, the right answer was the only one that could go back.

In the Space/Time example, there was a straight line from ""shit, what control do I press?"" to ""yay, we're safe"" that at no time was blocked by an obstacle that was removed by one of the aborted timelines.

Well, a somewhat curvy line, but it was a line.

In the Pandorica, the line from ""I'm stuck"" to ""I'm free"" actually went ""I'm stuck"" to ""I'm opening the door from the outside"" to ""I'm free"" to ""and now I can open the door"".

While I'm not going to refuse to watch the show, I will refuse to listen to anyone who claims that this is more logical than any of the other silly things that have occured in Doctor Who, including the recent shows.

&gt; When there's only one event which will keep the universe from being destroyed, that event will occur.

Million to one chances happen nine times out of 10, at least in fiction. But old-Who had the occasional ""let's have a paradox where the doctor meets himself"" fan-service episode (which were generally neat and popular), while new-Who seems to have ""let's have an unexplained paradox"" far more often.

If I can cope with the multi-doctor specials, I can cope with the Pandorica. But I can still refer to them all as slightly silly.","1309480739"

"Eve","t5_2qil9","I think a better option would be Aurum to reallocate SP on a character.

There is a set price per X amount of SP and you can do it as much as you want. 

* Select a skill
* Right click and ""reallocate""
* Message saying it will cost X amount of Aurum
* Confirm and the skill level(s) you selected go back into your SP pool (like when CCP refund us SP)

You get an error message if you don't have enough Aurum for the transaction or it is a prereq for another skill you have. If it's a prereq you would need to reallocate the SP from the ""Top - Down"". 

What this means: 

* You never just shit out SP from nowhere. 
* You can adjust your character to make it more focused.
* Once newbies actually learn what the hell the game is about they can fix their terrible skill choices.
* Gives people an incentive to try out other aspects of the game. Maybe you want to do some mining, but then find out it's about as exciting as stabbing yourself in the eye while drinking bleach. You can reallocate that ""wasted"" time. For a price that is.

Other options:

Ever see an almost perfect character up for sale but wish it had X skill instead of Y? Buy the character, get a bit of Aurum and adjust it.

This solution always means that someone has paid for the subscription time to obtain that SP. Implants are no longer worthless because they still create more SP.

To preempt ""We can just map to something with high SP/Hour and never change it"". Sure you can do that, but you would also be paying cash/PLEX -&gt; Aurum to reallocate it. It would still be ""cheaper"" to properly plan your skills and map correctly.

Right now, I have to tag them with a + from my Stream page or the share box in the black toolbar. It shouldn't have to be that way.

Also, more integration with services like Reader and Calendar is a must before the service really takes off. 

So far, I LOVE Hangout. What an amazing feature. I spent like two hours with 9 friends on it last night. Could see myself using it quite a bit. Framerate never dropped, and it was really stable.

I'm happy with how stable the whole service is overall. The UI and UX are great so far. Kudos to Google on the service so far. The Android app is great. I do like Huddle, but it's pretty much just SMS. It'd be great to be able to continue that conversation on my PC when I got to one.

Overall, the complaints I have are very minor. I love it and can't wait to see more people using it. If all my friends make the jump, I'll probably abandon Facebook once and for all.

Japanese fathers can be hardline on strange issues.  My wife's father is super relaxed about our relationship and easy going on most things, but damn he was hardline on certain issues about our wedding.  Pride plays a big part, and the public face is so important here.

If you plan to 'take his daughter' away to the States, that might be a concern for him too.  Now if you plan to put in a lot of time here in Japan, and maybe even relocate fully here, then he might have an easier time accepting it.

For the record, I am in a similar situation to sat0pi: Canadian living in Japan with Japanese wife.  I speak well enough to fully communicate with most people, and I make an effort to try and fit in with the customs/culture here.","1309480781"

And I'm saying, it just should not be allowed. Period. I should not be required to sign away rights as a term of employment. 

Now, if both sides mutually, and without coercion decide to take arbitration, so be it. But it should never be a condition of a service to be forced into it. 

&gt;You are wrong. Again, do your research before coming to conclusions.

No, this is one where you are wrong. The vast majority of these ""binding arbitration"" clauses generally have the company choosing and retaining the arbiter. 

&gt;Anybody can sue anyone for anything. Just because you signed away your right to sue doesn't mean you can't sue, you could go to court claiming many things 1) you never agreed, 2) such a clause is unconscionable, 3) the arbitration process was inadequate, etc.

The cat got upset and kept hiding under my bed, so we went and lured her out with food and then took her down in the same room as the dog and divided power - one person giving the dog attention, one person giving the cat. They've gotten fine with that to the point they can both lay in the same room without fighting.

I think any core set of principles must have a basis in reason and fact, otherwise they will fall apart under questioning.

Rational and thinking beings question their principles and core ethics; whatever you teach your kid has to be able to withstand rational thought. 

As I was trying to say earlier, I dunno if I got it worded correctly, is that you can force your kid not to question his core values and principles. But by doing this you neuter his ability to think and challenge his own existence. It is downright unhealthy for any person to give up their right to decide what life means to them, especially when they give it up to an institution that profits from ignorance--i.e., religion or a government.

Since we are talking about children, I'll say this, and I hope it makes sense. I despise the practice of teaching and indoctrinating religion to children.

You notice I did not say religion in general. *I hate forcing religion on children.* Once you are a thinking, rational adult, there is nothing morally wrong with exploring religion. But by forcing it on a child you force cognitive dissonance; you are teaching your child never to question outside motives but you are also teaching them **the very act of questioning is morally and ethically wrong!**

My god. Imagine what the would would be like if we as a species never questioned the practices that have come before `*cough* female genital mutilation *cough* human and animal sacrifices *cough* the current fundamentalist Islam states of Pakistan and Iran *cough*`

So yeah, teach your kid to fucking question everything dude. The trick is that the core principles you are talking about, the ones you are afraid of them questioning, must be good enough to withstand a good intellectual flogging. And if your child finds some flaw in your central philosophy? *Good on them.* That's the way it's supposed to work dude.

So Google got a bunch of its employees to install bing toolbar and enable sending data to Microsoft, then went to an unindexed website. Bing indexed it and it suddenly became 'OMG BING IS COPYING TEH GOOGLEZ OMGZ LULZ!'

I seem to recall him suggesting that there is an ingrained drive for (mysticism, magic, etc., I can't remember the term he uses) in man. His reasoning being then that this drive expressed in a controlled environment (with other consenting adults) makes it less likely to have a negative impact on one's life at large. (Arguably, fantasy/sci-fi novels/games/movies serve a similar function). 

Of course his Black Mass nonsense sensationalized the idea to an irremediable degree, but like most of what he espouses, I feel that the core values of his philosophy are more agreeable than the ways he chose to express them.

"Eve","t5_2qil9","I would gather that those figures will have changed a fair bit.

I cannot provide you with any hard figures but in my little corner of the T2 ship production market the inventors frequently come in and flood the market until it isn't even profitable for me to produce from a BPO, they then stay there for months selling their backstock before the market recovers.

An example would be the Oneiros market where I turned a profit of 30% for several months before the inventors caught on en mass and drove the margins to around 5% for several months.
During it's peak I was probably covering under 10% of the Jita market with one BPO, after the crash none of it.
I cannot say how many other BPO owners were in the area with me however.


After the crash I ceased production as 1) it was hard to bring the ships to market before mineral price increases during production wiped out profits and 2) I don't like working for peanuts.
Other markets with larger volumes are not so easily flooded but you have to be canny to avoid triggering a market crash and being beat by the inventors accepting lower prices and making up for it on volume.

Edit - To be clear I suspect that large volumes of ships are still made from BPOs simply because they are usually somewhat viable but in any market with a profit inventors can come and wipe them out.","1309480855"

This article and others about the data establish that this correlation is virtually certainly causation.

The question is how do you address this? Accept it as open immigration is more important than violent crime?

Rejecting immigrants in the problematic age group would not work -- because children of immigrants also participate in the violent behavior.

If it can be shown that the violent immigrants are those that do not assimilate into the host culture are those responsible for most crime (and I believe that it may indeed be shown) -- then non-assimilating immigrants should probably be rejected. I personally believe EU states should not allow non-assimilating immigrants to enter their country, especially not if they have higher percentage of crimes.

I think more than anything, making this place self posts only is importnat in the message it sends rather than what it actually does. As we saw in the threads today, there are a lot of lurkers who are upset by this, but realistically the vast majority of them have nothing to do with fitness and this is just a subreddit they're subscribed to in order to a) make themselves feel like they are concerned about their fitness/health and b) people that love adapting the latest Reddit meme for whatever subreddit they can.

I think it would be great if the self-post rule kicked in and a benign  chunk of the 72k redditors left. I think we'd only need to keep the rule up for a couple weeks a sort of a purge, and then we can ease up now that everyone has a much clearer idea of what the subreddit is for.

For #3 - This only matters for blink stalkers and very small number of units like in #1 because if it's 20 roaches vs 20 roaches and if you try to pull your units back, then they won't be able to go to the back of the pack because they're blocked by other roaches, in the meanwhile, that roach is doing 0 damage.

For #4 - You should at most have 3 hotkeys for your army and 1 for casters (I use 2,3,4 spacebar).  There's no need at all to divide your infestors into 3 control groups and for 30 roaches vs 30 roaches battle, just box half your army and split to get a good concave, that's good enough, no need to have separate hotkeys for them.

For #5 - this is pretty important, have the banelings hit the rines (not just a-move them), and roach sling vs zealot stalkers, have your roaches in 1 control group and slings in another and then move your slings to hit the stalkers while your roaches hit the zealots.

"technology","t5_2qh16","The Swiss, Thai, Italians were never huge on nuclear anyways. In fact Italy has no nuclear plants and never planned to build any in the foreseeable future. Japan still is committed to nuclear despite the Fukushima tragedy. Like I said before, the countries that already invested in nuclear praise it (with the exception of Germany). The only other countries that are anti-nuclear are smaller countries that can't afford it, and don't find it feasible with their current small populations. With growing populations, you begin to have problems. This is why countries with larger economies and populations find nuclear to be the OBVIOUS choice (China, Japan, Koreas, USA, UAE).

China actually has the highest amount of proposed nuclear plant bids in the world. They have 12 nuclear plants, and 24 currently under construction. They are 1% nuclear currently and plan to be 16% nuclear  by 2030 (a whopping 250 GWe).

The fact that you say nuclear needs storage for 100,000 years is a serious over-estimation. Even so, countries like China, South Korea, and India (mainly India) have nuclear fuel recycling plants reducing the amounts of nuclear waste, and decreasing the costs of importing fuels from other countries. They are also investing money into creating more of these recycling plant.

Solar power has also been abandoned by India because of its HIGH COST. India has the highest solar potential in the world (in the hundreds of TWe). But the high cost of solar is preventing them from investing in solar, and instead they are choosing the more affordable nuclear. 


I've done a research paper on global nuclear stance that I can send to you for some fun reading. Try doing some research and not just basing your opinion on one or two highly biased articles. It's amazing how much you can actually learn.

"tf2","t5_2qka0","To specifically address your post:

1. I've had this idea for a couple months (over 6)

2. It could be used in every single official map.  Anywhere you can rocket jump, you can use the telepault.  Even cp_junction has a place where you can rocket jump up to.

3. Its safer than the teleporter because you could put it in a friendly area and it would launch you into enemy lines, among other reasons.

4.  Thanks for commenting! :)

I made a post on this on the steam forums, it got 5 stars:
The telepault: This is a engineer unlock for the teleporter. It launches people in the air like a rocket jump, except you take no fall damage.
Observation: A lot of engineers build the teleporter entrance right after they spawn, but never get around to building the exit.
Hypothesis: The exit teleporter is causing the problem. If there were a upgrade for the teleporter where you would only have to build 1 device, you would see engineers building it right after they spawn and providing a immediate benefit to the team.

Goal: Solve the problem in the observation while providing a new game-changing comical upgrade.

Design: The telepault doesn’t need an exit. This solves the problem observed in the observation. The telepault is very different from the teleporter, making it new. It essentially gives all classes who use it a rocket-jump, changing the game play in tf2. It can make heavy’s fly, and if that isn’t funny/awesome, I’d like to see what is.

Notes: The rocket jump and sticky jump adds a large amount of strategy to the demoman and soldier. Giving all the classes this ability with the telepault will be a huge addition to the strategy of the game. Additionally this will make the dispenser jumping technique obsolete. The telepault will open up all the areas that were previously only accessible by a few classes.

Examples of the telepault in use: In gravel pit a engy on defence could build a telepault that launches people into the entryway to the spawn on the attacking team. Then when the round starts the attacking team are obliterated by the surprise attack right outside their spawn.There is all sorts of new things that can be done with the telepault. This is just one of the MANY examples.

Notes: To build it you would first set it down in the place where you want it, then decide the trajectory. There could be a line that shows you where the telepault launches you too.
I got the original idea from this website and but I expanded upon it myself http://www.pentadact.com/index.php/2008-05-31-team-fortress-2-unlockable-ideas
**TLDR: you use the telepault like a teleporter, except the telepault gives you a rocket jump with no fall damage.**

FAQ:
What is the max length of the telepault?
It could launch you from battlement to battlement at 2fort.
Can enemy spys use the telepault?
Of course.
If your idea is so awesome then why hasn’t it been done yet?
    Actually, it has.  Recently I learned that this idea similar to this was in fortress forever.  
    http://www.fortress-forever.com/wiki...le=Class:Scout
Wouldn’t this idea be extremely limited by map design?
No, the telepault essentially gives you a rocket jump and most maps are built so there’s plenty of places for rocket jumps.
“ The only thing I can see that's wrong with this is that suddenly being able to find any class anywhere will somewhat change the dynamics of gameplay. For example Pyros and Heavies suddenly being able to reach ambush spots (such as rooftops) that previously were limited to Scouts, Demos and Soldiers would be quite a different situation, no? ”
     I don’t see what would be wrong with giving other classes more ambush opportunities. 
Why not just have 1 trajectory setting to make it simple? Giving it 1 setting for launch power would servery limit the possibility of the telepault. Imagine that rocket jumps had only 1 trajectory. That would be pretty lame, wouldn't it?
Plus if you were in a hurry you could leave your telepault before you set the trajectory and the trajectory would automatically be set to 45degrees or something like that.
This idea is unbalanced/overpowered/underpowered.
     If you think the telepault is o.p. or u.p. then there is lots of things that can be changed such as the building costs or range of the telepault or lots of other things.","1309480879"

As far as the old classmates thing, sure. I see your point... There is definitely a big draw to facebook in that it's almost like a worldwide phonebook. But let's not forget another reason Facebook gained traction: exclusivity. MySpace became overrun with idiots, so people left for something that was only available to kids in primo colleges... The less primo college kids followed, etc.

The question is, is Facebook still theirs? How many idiotic wall posts do we see on Reddit every day?

Young, hip, middle class kids are the trendsetters, and they are going to be drawn to Google's less tarnished brand (""Be good"" vs. all the press about FB's privacy issues) and what is likely a more minimal and modern looking interface. Facebook, after all, can't change things too fast or it will lose all those older users who still go to all their websites by googling for them.

I think it's also a matter of fashion. When something gets too popular, it has a hard time sustaining it's appearance of being hip, regardless of its functionality.","1309480881"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Gov Walker gave huge tax cuts and hand outs to corporations. Then, he went and made huge cuts to education and health care spending, among other things.

* The tax cuts amounted to about 1/10th of the cut to educational assistance. Whether he cut medicade spending depends on whether you use previous spending or the requested spending as the baseline. If previous spending is used, he increased it by $1.2 billion, the request was $1.8 billion. 

&gt; Walker did not just limit teachers ability to strike, he crushed all public unions 

* Public employees couldn't strike before the budget repair bill. Collective bargaining has nothing to do with the ability to strike. 

&gt; (it should be noted that the unions agreed to pay/benefit cuts, they were just protesting the union busting)

* Mary Bell doesn't have the authority to follow through on that claim. Walker and the Republicans didn't believe that all of the unions would follow through. The story above demonstrates that this belief had some validity because. MPS refused to take pay/benefit cuts. 

&gt; Also, he has refused hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in federal spending.

* Much of that spending required state funds to match it. For example, running the Madison-Milwaukee train would have been paid for by state funds after the initial cost. 

&gt; He has kneecapped craft breweries from being able to compete with the 'big guys'.

* You won't get much disagreement with me here. I will point out that it was added in the JFC and wasn't in Walker's proposed budget. In my opinion, he should have vetoed it but it wasn't his proposal.  The brewer language was neutered by the assembly to include exceptions for brewers that produce under 300,000 barrels/yr (New Glarus produces 100,000 barrels/yr). In my opinion though, it is wrongheaded and shouldn't apply to brewers of any size.

&gt;Walker has abused his power by overturning laws created by local cities.

* WI is a Dillon's Rule state. Local governments are extensions of the state and thus the state can overwrite any county/city level ordinance. I wouldn't call it an abuse of power.


&gt;He has rescinded a law requiring disinfected water in Wisconsin.

* The assembly added an delay for small cities from the disinfection requirement because the local governments were complaining of the cost. 

&gt;He gave the son of a huge campaign donor a high paying job that he was not qualified for. 

David Ross named Brian Deschane the bureau director of board services, a job that paid $64,728 a year. He was promoted to the $81,500-per-year DOC job later when the department was restructured, a move Paul Jadin approved. Deschane later resigned. I agree that Deschane was probably only marginally qualified for his initial job and certainly not qualified for his second. However, Walker wasn't the one who appointed him.

&gt;He wants to give hundreds of millions of dollars to out of state investors.

* I agree that this is a bad idea. Walker seems to thing that government should have a role in actively helping businesses. I would prefer if he would just get government out of the way. 

&gt;He wants to stop defending the state's civil union laws.

* WI has an constitutional provision in its constitution that prohibits gay marriage or anything substantially similar. Although I personally disagree with it, his stance is similar to that of the Obama administration on the DOMA

&gt;He tried to limit the public's access to ethics files.

* Walker vetoed that provision. 

&gt;He wants no-bid sales of Wisconsin's power plants.

* Why does the State of WI own power plants in the first place.","1309480886"

"SomebodyMakeThis","t5_2rngx","Metacritic is unreliable and is helping (if only a little) in the destruction of the entertainment industry.

Obviously the internet and Piracy are the main things, and I'll get to piracy in a second, but it's not the only thing screwing everything up.  Before the popularization of Metacritic, people found critics who they trusted, whose opinion tended to be close to their own, and appeared to not sell out to entertainment companies.  These good critics thrived simply because they were good at their job, and helped people make good choices.  There were also less popular critics who made the same if not more money, because they sold good ratings to whoever would pay.  Because of these, the rich got richer and the poor got poorer, which is never a good thing.  Luckily, they were not popular, because they were crap and people noticed this.

Now, everyone uses metacritic, because ""the more people's opinions are put in, the more accurate it is!""  This is not the case.  Because now, people are simply seeing one number, so entertainment companies benefit greatly by bribing critics, or even setting up their own ""critic"" sites that metacritic would include in their metascore.  Now, the richer companies got richer faster, and indie producers who couldn't afford to bribe, or wouldn't due to principles, suffered.  It no longer mattered how good you were, only how much you can make!  The worst part is when the better producers wouldn't partake, they would get lower scores for doing the right thing, and a few are starting to diminish.

Not to mention that it has trained people to think of quality as a plain number.  It used to be that people read full reviews, so that the words they were reading helped their opinion, not some number.  A number does not equal a thousand words.  Because of this, the good critics are now makign *less* than the bad ones, and some are turning to bribery.

Now, piracy.  Obviously you advocate piracy, from your mention of The Pirate Bay.  I have never understood how people can be so selfish!  Sure, now we can get movies, games, and music for free, but everyone suffers in the long run, even the pirates!  If producers don`t make money, they can`t make good stuff.  In addition, mroe people won`t want to do it.  The industry gets hurt, and the overall quality of everything downloadable is going down because of it!  Piracy is not just selfish and wrong, it`s even counterintuitive!

Sorry for the novel, but I refuse to sit idly by as we destroy that which we love.","1309480897"

"tf2","t5_2qka0","* Get a mic.  If you can't tell your uber mate what the plan is how can you get mad when he doesn't follow it?  You need to be able to say things like, ""I need to take a demo, one sentry is on the far side by the spawn and one underneath the map room.""  

* A player with a mic is going to be a better buddy than one without.  He can tell you what's around the corner, when to fall back, when he wants a charge, when to push, when he needs ammo.

* With the above two points you'll achieve a zen level of cooperation.  An uber with 2 players with mics can do more than 2-3 separate ubers without that same level of communication.

* A quick click on burning players can keep them from fleeing away for distant health packs.  It lets them know, ""Hey, I see ya.  But you're still at 90% health even if you're on fire so you're low in the queue.  But stick around and help and I'll getcha faster than you can run to that health pack and back"".  Don't mess up your healing priorities over them but it's good to let the know you see 'em.  Usually you only need to do it *once* per round and afterwards they know they can count on you.

* Scouts will commonly run past you trying to go for health packs rather than get healed.  Click on them if you can for the same reason as above but if they run away don't chase them (even if they're on fire).  It's their fault.

* Pay attention to what weapons players are using.  This is hard if you're new and you don't know what most of the weapons are yet.  You'll get it but just start noticing things like, ""Hey, that uber went *really* poorly, what weapon did he have out?""

Edit: oh yeah one more

* Be sure to tell your team the plan with your mic.  You want you and your ubermate in front taking up the damage.  But you want your whole team behind you to deal it out.  Spies should know beforehand so that they can sap while you come in.  This saves you **so much time**.  And in the confusion of the uber the spy can usually escape quite easily.","1309480925"

Marriage contracts are an absolutely terrible way for determining whether or not a person should be allowed a hospital visit.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Organisms use oxygen to [produce energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration), but remember that [oxygen is harmful in high concentrations as well](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity), so there's a trade-off of availability and toxicity of atmospheric Oxygen. 

It's hard to say exactly what concentration is ideal. However, I can comment on other factors that have actually produced large animals. If these all combined at an optimal level, it could theoretically produce huge animals:

1) **Relocation to water**- A decrease in gravity would help give larger creatures, but we can mimic this effect by placing a large terrestrial animal in water. The evolution of whales illustrates how body size can balloon once freed from supporting their body frame against gravity. Here's a mindblowing answer to your last quesiton: **The largest known organism to ever live is alive right now:** [The Blue Whale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale). 

2) **Sexual Selection**- [A specific type of selection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection) that can often lead to an increase in size, especially when strength/combat is important to claiming a mate. Many large mammals exhibit these characteristics (Elk, Giraffes, etc).

3) In a related point, **harem-style mating**, where one male ""wins"" mutliple females by dominating other males with size and strength. Notable examples are Lions, Gorillas, and Sea Lions. 

4) **Abundant primary producers-** Supports large herbivores requiring tons of photosynthetic organisms to sustain them, as well as the large carnivores to feed on them. This could could hypothetically spark an ""evolutionary arms race"" that selects for size survival, though there are limits to this. Think Elephants, Whales, Dinosaurs. 

5) **Anatomical/Cellular Innovations to support nutrient/waste management-** A huge biological limitation of size is supplying nutrients to large tissues, but also removing waste products like heat, as volume (sinks for heat) often expands much faster than surface area (interface to lose heat). Elephant ears, for example, likely evolved to help exchange heat with the outside environment. Living in water would help this problem, but oxygen is present in much lower concentrations there. 

6) **Large Ranges-** Can't have big animals without a big place to live.

edit: I was animal-centric because of the question, but see [gordonj's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/idp3p/under_what_conditions_would_life_maximize_in_size/c22x6g2?context=3) for on explanation on large non-animals, and a quantitative explanation of point #5.","1309480951"

You know what she gets to come home to? Parents, and brothers who support her in making the right choices to lose weight.

If you mean acting, then I'd say start with classes just to get your feet wet. When you're feeling confident enough, get some headshots taken and try to find an agent. And be prepared to suck at auditions for at least a year, which is why you should audition for student films. Even if you don't want to shoot them, the audition practice is good.

If you're talking about directing, then I'd say just start cranking out things just to get into the practice. Put out YouTube stuff regularly and value quantity over quality.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","""A Better Place... Selected Essays on Desire Utilitarianism"" by Alonzo Fyfe does a great job dissecting the ""you cannot derive an is from an ought"" assertion that is repeated as mantra in the video.

Fyfe spends the whole of Chapter 7 on this.

I excerpt his summary below and recommend you all read his book:

""""""
In this chapter, I wanted to show that Hume's claim that you cannot derive 'ought' from 'is' depends on Hume's assumption that 'ought' concerns some 'new affirmation or relation'.

However this assumption is highly questionable.

Hume provides no argument for this assumption.  He simply reported an inability to conceive of how an 'ought' can be derived from an 'is'.  There is even evidence that Hume rejected what would later become the standard interpretation of that argument.

Where Hume says that an 'ought' cannot be found in the object of evaluation itself, but instead is found only by turning one's attention inward to what is in one's own breast, he is still deriving an 'ought' from an 'is.'  Only, he is finding the 'is' in his own breast.  If 'Hume's Law' is indeed a aw, Hume needs to explain how one gets from the 'is' perceived by turning one's attention inward to an 'ought' conclusion.

Hume ultimately ends up giving two separate formulations for 'ought' statements.  Both turn out to be 'is' statements.

To paraphrase

(1) 'Ought' means 'is such that I have a feeling or sentiment of blame (or praise - in the area of good) - in the contemplation of it'.

(2) 'Ought' means 'is in accordance with qualities of the mind that are agreeable and/or useful to self and/or others'.

Both of these give us an 'is' substitution for an 'ought' statement.  If it is so difficult to derive 'ought' from 'is', then how does Hume derive it from either of these two 'is' options?

...

Using HUme's Law itself against somebody who suggests an 'is' reduction to 'ought' statements is question-begging.  The type of response basically states, ""You must be mistaken to think Hume was wrong because Hume was right.""

...

Similarly, the claim that 'ought' refers to some new relation or affirmation raises a huge number of questions.  What is this relationship?  How can the idea possibly enter our minds that this relationship exists [if it does not relate to something that is or is not]?  How is it that propositions referring to this relationship and 'is' propositions can fit within the same argument?  We have as many problems with the 'new relation or affirmation' hypothesis as we do with the 'ghost' hypothesis.  Because of this, it is much more likely that 'ought' represents some yet-to-be-discovered 'is' relationship than that it is something new and outside the universe of what is.

Ultimately, I would argue that Hume had the answer right all along.

Moral 'ought' applies to character traits that tend to cause actions that are agreeaable and/or useful to self and/or others.

Or, in the terms that I use in this book:

Moral 'ought' applies to malleable desires that tend to fulfill, directly or indirectly (pleasant and useful) the other desires of self and other people.
""""""

TLDR, the video's claim that it is a ""logical fallacy"" to derive ""ought"" from ""is"" is silly, and contrary to the video's claim, secular philosophers do have at least partial answers, and if it were true, then theists could not conclude that ""If a God, you ought to do x"".","1309480991"

 Huh? Well it depends what kind of Buddhism you are talking about - things like Huayan Buddhism and Madhyamika Buddhism are uncredibly complicated, but in my personal opinion quite useless. 

 What do you mean by apply to life in general? I don't understand this at all - what does applying Buddhism mean to you? If you mean the practices of Buddhism - meditation or chanting - well I don't see how you apply these things to life, they are just things that you do. And they don't appear to be particularly useful for the core purpose that Buddhism espouses - beneficial in a number areas certainly.

"PhilosophyofScience","t5_2r7mh","All fair questions. I'll do my best to answer them. 

&gt;What about machine ethics, an entire field of study, and the ethics / decision theory surrounding Friendly AI?

This school of thought only matters to the extent that it is relevant to human experience. Without humans, there would be no machines, and no one to think about what's the right way to deal with them if/when they become sentient/intelligent. 

&gt;Do we really know whether or not it can exist, CAN we? If we don't, then shouldn't we confront the problem now, rather than when such a beast appears and we want to make the ""best"" decision quickly?

Same thing could be said about God, or aliens, or anything really. Sure it's worthwhile to consider, and we can't really know. But what's the point in wasting our time with something that's outside of our experience entirely? Also the utility machine isn't really important to me because it's not human. If you haven't picked up on it by now, it's human life that I consider the object of ethics. That doesn't mean that killing off other species is justified, and there are myriad reasons why we should preserve other species and (if you want to go there) coexist with another intelligent alien species should one arrive. I'm not really in the mood to go into the reasons at the moment, but just understand that the concern of ethics are human concerns, and that I also believe the existence of other biological life is of human concern. I know nothing about what kind of creature the utility monster is, so I have no way of passing moral judgment on its hypothetical existence. So what's the point?

&gt;What do you mean by ""sufficient""? Can there ever be a ""sufficient moral system""?

I mean, is that all we need to make moral judgments? and if you read my next bit you'll see that the answer is no, there can't really be a sufficient moral system. You need many theories and schools of thought to describe the physical universe, so why not the moral/philosophical one as well?

&gt;Well, that works in science (when theories are rigorously defined) and mathematics. If philosophy is to be seen as worthwhile and significant, and if it is to really strive for truth and progress, should it not be held to a similar standard?

That's actually a trend I don't really like in philosophy. It developed alongside science and mathematics and as such it tries to sound like them. Those two schools are more conducive to talking in absolutes. I don't think human life really has the kind of absolutes philosophers tend to look for. The whole subjective/objective dichotomy inherently supposes a judge outside of human experience that could hypothetically clarify things for us. That's the problem the existentialists had: they looked outside of human experience for verification and found none. Look, I'm a very religious person but I don't think it's philosophically sound to speak in the kind of terms that suppose this subjective/objective dichotomy with regards to human experience. People get all upset when I say this: ""But then who is the authority for moral judgments??"" Umm, we are. Does that mean that morality is relative? Fuck no. Moral arguments have the weight of the process of reasoning behind them. I can try to elaborate on this if you want, but I'm still working out on how to put it in concrete philosophical terms. I haven't read enough to really make it sound ""pretty"", and at the moment I'm afraid it very much resembles a natural law theory of sorts, and that's not quite what I'm going for. Like I said, I don't really believe in working within a particular paradigm of philosophical thought, and so I don't have that kind of solid backing to make a sound argument. I just believe that people ought to stop talking about philosophy like it's science or mathematics, while at the same time avoid the idea that it's ""subjective,"" whatever that means, meaningless, or some other existentialist variation. 

&gt;If these people were quick about the matter (if, say, philosophy was not their main occupation), but gave sufficient justification, would you have this same attitude towards them?

No. I'm more concerned with people who claim to be philosophers and then pull this kind of shit. And I don't claim to have never done myself. Generally the things I'm most critical of are thing I've been guilty of in the past, because then I have the clearest idea of why I think it's wrong. 

&gt;Disrespect of other people? Disrespect of philosophy as a discipline? Disrespect of the philosophy that you banquosghost support?

The first two. In theory, I support all philosophy, because I have this sort of toquevillian idea that even bad ideas are good because they give us a better idea of why we believe the good ones. Hence, Freud contributed to the development of modern psychology because his ideas were so crazy/offensive that he inspired others to get up and try their own hand at it to prove him wrong. 

Sorry that ended up being so long. I never intended this discussion to go so far haha, but I appreciate your questions and I'd love to hear your response on all that if you're up for it. ","1309481003"
"newzealand","t5_2qhma","Kate Sheppard was leader of NZ Women's Christian Temperance Union, a religious organisation which sought to impose their religiously influenced views on people and promote prohibition of alcohol against the will of the country. They also based membership on a race-basis and didn't allow Blacks, Jews or Papists to join. These things would be frowned upon today and pretty much universally hated.  
However, she also did a great service in promotion of Women's Suffrage in New Zealand. That's what we remember her for, the greater good that she did.

If you look in anyone's closet, there's bound to be some bad things. No one's history is unmarred.  

For me, looking at Lange's contributions as a New Zealander, his intelligence and strength of will on the world stage outweigh a couple of bad decisions made in the political arena.  
But I understand that it might be too soon for some people to overlook the political effects of his term as PM and look at the greater goods that arose because of him. That's why I originally said ""t might be a bit soon to put such a recent PM on the notes"".","1309481003"

The main way to visualize them in the end was via debt. (Euler did that, for example)

It looks like there was still some kind of debate regarding negative numbers in Europe - even in the 1700s. (Take a look at [this page](http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/mks/326K/Negnos.html) for an overview) That doesn't mean the notion wasn't accepted by some notable characters, of course.

Why is that?  How did the world's biggest fast food chain switch from selling Coca-Cola and milkshakes to also selling smoothies?  What about when Hunt's ketchup caught the market's feedback about ""high fructose corn syrup,"" and discontinued it from their products?  Isn't that consumer choice in action?

Monsanto’s patent rights seem excessive, notably the rule about farming having to re-purchase seeds after each season and the rule about other GMO firms having to pay for Monsanto’s “patented genes” if they want to use them in their own products.  However, without patent laws, there’s little incentive to invest in research.  Most of the patents should stay, but I personally think they should expire earlier.   

But just because Monsanto exhibits monopoly-like qualities doesn’t mean GMO’s are bad.  GMO’s are great.  Increasing product yield without using an excess of chemicals is awesome; it makes food prices go down without polluting as much and creating super pests.

How do GMO’s make sustainable farming impossible?  People can still farm sustainably now; it just costs more.","1309481061"

An anesthesiology resident at the VA started using opiods. It eventually got so bad that he would dig through sharps containers for unused Dilaudid. He would then shoot up and would often continue working. 

One day he injected himself with what he thought was Dilaudid and soon found himself on the floor unable to move, yet completely awake and mentally aware. It turns out the syringe had been discarded because it had been mislabeled and somebody caught the error. As he lay there unable to breathe he realized what had happened and thought to himself ""okay, if that was pancuronium then I'm dead... please God let it be succinylcholine!"". 

Luckily for him it was the latter. He recovered before anybody discovered him and went right back to shooting up Dilaudid until the day he was caught.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","The idea of a litteral interpretation of the Bible only appeared with the Protestant Reformation. Before that, christians never claimed the Bible was the word of god. In fact, the texts of the canon Bible were selected by the church over time (notably during the Synod of Hippo). Catholics have no problem studying the history of the Bible.
According to the christian faith, god is everything. So his message is not limited to a book, so there is nothing wrong with interpreting the text. The official stance of the Catholic Church is that the Creation's story is a myth teaching values (all humans are brothers, the fact that human can name things is what makes them different than animals...).
For the same reason, evolution makes perfect sense for christians : it's the explanation of how the world function, with every scientific law being god's work (see Charles Kingsley's work). At the contrary, a literal acceptation of the creation's story would mean that god only acted at one time in one way.
So you may believe those ideas or not (obviously you don't), but is false to say that christians can't believe evolution or that they must accept the Bible as word of god.","1309481096"

In fact, it really does seem like manned space exploration is ending.  Will we really ever get to Mars if it is a choice between funding Medicare or a manned flight to Mars?  I doubt it.

I think the Space Age is somewhat unique in the way it opened up new vistas without returning a direct physical reward.  In most of human history travelling to a new undiscovered country meant finding, in a lot of cases, resources that could be fairly easily exploited by even unskilled laborers.

And while it is true that the effort to go to space has created useful technology that is a difficult case to make politically.  It remains hard to convince people that it makes sense to go to Mars when there is so much to be done here.  It sounds like a joyride at taxpayer expense.  A great thing to do if times were good but times are never really good, not for long.

"byu","t5_2qncw","You are seriously so confusing. You seem to have weird points of church history and the anti-mormon book memorized but seem to turn to a random page of it every post. You say you don't believe in church leadership but put stock in a blessing from your home teacher? Again, pardon my forwardness.

Your belief system apparently did turn out to be rubbish because it was based on your ability to sift through the quagmire of admittedly conflicting accounts of people on various sides of issues who lived 175 years ago. It still appears to be. A testimony is based off of revelation. 

And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.

I don't expect you to believe me or take my word for it. I do however think that my position is one that could be empathized with. I think if anyone had had the experiences that I have had they would believe as I do. I believe that the same experiences are available to everyone. 

Choosing to believe in something is a lot like a scale. There can be different things placed on either side. An answered prayer or my experience from my mission might go on one side while some of the weird questions you pose and many other questions go on the other side. The weight we give those things depends on our understanding and faith in different branches of epistemology or the methods by which we gathered that information. I do not claim that the side of the scale that indicates the church is false is empty. I have many un-answered questions. But the church is true side of the scale is practically nailed to the ground by my spiritual confirmations. With that context in mind I look at questions of doubt from a different perspective, one that i believe allows God to answer those questions in his time. That is the pattern I've seen. Trust not in the arm of the flesh.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Healthcare in the U.S. is driven primarily by the fear of legal action.  Doctors don't practice medicine they practice CYA.  If we could remove the threat of legal action we would reduce malpractice premiums and raise physician salaries thus making more physicians.  Also we would drastically reduce the cost of medical procedures and the rate at which they are performed.  Example: if we stopped doing unnecessary CT Scans and MRIs we would have more capacity and dollars to spend on those who truly need one.  However we don't and are pinched.  

If we dropped waste prices would fall drastically as hospitals no longer able to fill schedules with CYA would need to focus on customer care and market competition.  As this happens insurance becomes more affordable and more accessible to more Americans.  Hopefully we could parlay this into a government solution for everyone who can't get standard insurance and become more like our reasonable neighbor.  

Granted it's not that simple but until we have tort reform we can never have medical reform and the system that is beginning to fall behind the rest of the world will continue to get worse.","1309481102"

As its on her back leg i would tend to just leave it as i dont like to get rats operated on near their privates for obvious reasons. Be prepared though as it will grow very large in a fairly short period of time (one month). Generally if a rat is over two years old then operating on them seems unwise but if they are very active then i dont see why not. 

We had one girl who at the age of 2 years 2 months had a large tumour removed and bounced back very quickly. She then developed another one but as she was so full of energy we decided to operate again. Once again she bounced back very quickly but only to develop more tumours. She passed away close to 2 3/4 years old and seemed happy to the last day. 

So imo, dont worry if you cant pay for the vet, as they can live to a good age and seem to get along fine with quite large lumps, just understand that you need to get her put down when its obvious that shes struggling.

Once 3 outweighs 1, it's better than a same-race couple and I think it now does. 1 writes angry letters (some in crayon) while 3 is slightly more inclined to buy (the point of advertizing) and 2 buys the same it would or wouldn't anyway.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","If the tear gas grenades used pressurized canisters, they should get cold as they operate. However, we know that they get extremely hot -- demonstrators need to use heavy duty gloves when throwing them back. This makes me think that they're the type of [riot control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_grenade) grenade described on wikipedia, which operates by burning a combustible mix. The CS is part of the smoke carried away. Initially the temperature may be hot enough to vaporize the CS gas, but with a boiling point of 310°C and a melting point of 93°C it should return to solid state quickly. In normal atmospheric conditions smoke will not stay that hot for more than a moment on contact with the cooler air.

If this is correct, the bucket technique should work, because it will either extinguish the burning material or will cool the smoke/vapor such that the CS returns to solid state and is not dispersed in the air.

I don't see how it could explode. It takes a huge amount of energy to boil a bucket of water. In order to cause an ""explosion"" from heating the water, it would have to boil the water so rapidly that the water vapor pushed the rest of the water out of the bucket instead of bubbling out.","1309481115"

I assume if the waiters and waitresses aren't good enough quality they just wont keep their job for long. 

Perhaps better to genuinely reward good service than to be expected, as a matter of course, to **always** reward people who give just standard or even mediocre service?

.... i recognise it's all so ingrained over there that the current system is unlikely to ever change of course. 



*note: I will sometimes tip more of course, for example I have small kids who sometimes make quite a mess or need some extra attention during a meal etc, we'll give some extra cash to compensate the server in such cases of course... or sometimes just if the service is really great etc we'll give a nice tip &amp; so on... but it's never really expected by the waiter as a right*","1309481121"

Games are fun, and as a source of recreation a totally valid option. I'm not entirely certain what the obsession with the tag art is, its a pretty nebulous word. Video games can create some shared experience and story that people can talk about and relate to, which is fine, but not a particularly rare feat either (even like super bad jersey shore trash tv does this in its own way).

If i had to choose between a world where people played video games all the time or none of the time I would choose the latter. They are fun and I don't apogloize for spending time playing them but they aren't, as a general rule, productive.

He's way past his prime and is injured all too often to contribute much as far as production or defensive prowess goes. A few years ago I'd retract that statement, but these past two seasons it's been embarrassing.

**Underrated**: Trent Oeltjen.

I doubt anyone aside from Dodgers fans have really heard of the guy, but this season he's had occasional call-ups from AAA and has done nothing but produce for the team. Unfortunately with Marcus Thames and Tony Gwynn Jr. on the team as well, he hasn't had the opportunity to start many games. Over on [/r/Dodgers](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/icmbr/hey_rdodgers_whatre_your_thoughts_on_trent/) I posted a more thorough explanation of all of this, but I feel if the guy was allowed to be a dedicated starter, he'd easily start putting up Ethier style numbers.

My family is fine with it, it's the MIL that is upset by our decision. And as my hubby is an only child...well, it does suck for her, but I am not popping out a baby for *her*.  

I think some people are jealous yes. When we book a 12 day cruise to the Mediterranean and they book a Disney Cruise (because it's what the kids want) well yeah. I would be jealous. I think what you said about them not realizing that they are jealous is very true. And of course they don't regret having their children. But when they look at your lifestyle and the things they used to do, the way they criticize your decision comes out way harsh. Some are like, you never know, your birth control method might fail, then you will have a child, and you will realize that children are the greatest thing ever! What the hell is that?!

And you are right - they just don't fucking believe you! They say, you will change your mind, just wait. The older I get, the less I want kids.  

I think people also just like to meddle. When my husband and I were bf/gf - it was when are you going to get engaged? Once engaged (we had a long engagement), when are you getting married?

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","I had an MTB that I sort of converted into a hybrid (skinny slick tires, upgraded to higher gearing) and then finally went all out and bought a road bike a month ago.

It's a lot like driving everywhere in a jeep / truck / SUV, and then getting behind the wheel of a proper sports car. The speed is unbelievable and addictive -- and the ride brutally efficient, stiffer, more uncomfortable at first. And you can't hop curbs and need to be careful about potholes / gravel / broken glass. 

To add to all the other points already posted here, all of which I can wholeheartedly agree with, I must also add: Road bikes aren't as delicate as they look. I know many of my MTB-riding friends think so, and I have to keep explaining this to them. 

I ride in New Delhi, India, where the roads aren't exactly awesome everywhere. Lots of potholes, debris, broken glass, chopped up roads -- although there are good roads and smooth highways too. But yeah, a road bike can take it. However it will be more uncomfortable than an MTB when you do hit a pothole. 

Fortunately, whatever downsides a road bike may have compared to an MTB, you get used to it, because the speed really is addictive. It's so worth the trade off. Basically, if you don't go off-road often, don't waste any more time. Get a road bike, you'll be deliriously happy.

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","Just want to put in my 2 cents as an owner of a Ninja 250 (2010).

First thing I want to say: **It is more fun to ride a small bike fast, than a big bike slow.**


The fun roads are the twisty ones. The ones where the power of a 600 or a litre bike are never really used. *I can outpace most bigger bikes on the curvy roads with my light and nimble 250.*

On my 250, I'm concentrating on riding, and learning how to ride better, not on keeping 100+ horsepower under control.

It can easily handle freeway speeds (I regularly take it up to 140km/h [~87mph] without it complaining). It has more than enough power to get out of the way of things if you need to. It is also super cheap on gas and insurance, and maintenance is dead easy.

I don't regret my purchase. I will likely not be getting a bigger bike any time soon. (every time I seem to want one, I go out on a ride and realize a bigger bike would give me nothing but a bigger ego penis)

Try not to consider your first bike as being your only bike. It nearly never is. (unless you crash it and never ride again.)


**TL;DR** I own a Ninja 250. I &lt;3 it. You'll &lt;3 it too.","1309481250"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I believe your thinking is wrong for several reasons.  First of all, as many others have mentioned pregnancy can be very difficult even when the pregnancy/child is wanted, so going through it when you don't want the child has to be so much harder.  Secondly, I think it's really unfair to draw the comparison between those who are infertile and those who are pregnant and may want to abort.  Why should women suffer through all the hardships just because others are infertile?  While it is a great thing to want to give your child to a family that wants a baby, I see no reason why a woman should feel responsible for another's problems with fertility.  Finally, I think it's really hard to understand how difficult it would truly be to give your child up for adoption unless you've done it.  I won't pretend I know what that feels like, but there's a huge difference between having an abortion at 8 weeks of a mass of cells and giving up your fully grown baby that you just gave birth to.  I'm sure that even when birth mothers aren't prepared emotionally, financially, etc. it's unimaginably difficult to give their child away.  It also could cause a lifetime of concern and difficulty over worrying if the child was okay, happy, in a good home, etc. that I'd also think would be extremely difficult to endure. ","1309481249"
"islam","t5_2qhbp","&gt; I do care that Palestinians are wronged, that is why I oppose Syria and Lebanon and Saudi and Egypt.

Do you think they were wronged though?

&gt;What colonial power do you mean? 

Yes the British, the ones who promised to create a land for the Jews, the ones who liberated the death camps, the ones who allowed mass migration from Europe, all while occupying the local population and ignoring their voices.

If it was right of the Zionists to resist European Rule, then surely it was the right of the Palestinians to resist European Rule, be it by Brits or Jews.

&gt;In fact, I wonder who you mean lived and died on the land. The people there did not consider themselves or call themselves Palestinians until the middle of the 20th century at the least. So I am not sure why you assert that some particular group has some identity and right.

There most certainly where Palestinians living in the region for generations. Are you claiming that it really was a land without a people? I find that too strange to even engage with, the Zionist knew this not to be true.

There are Israelis alive today, whose place of birth is listed as British Palestine. If you mean there wasn't a country called Palestine, most countries following the collapse of empires didn't have the names they do now, but they certainly had people. There where Serbians before Serbia for example.

&gt;A claim? Sure. And in 1948 they took a chance and claimed everything and they lost the war.

Who took a chance on war. Be precise.

I'm not sure how Jordan is relevant at all, and the status of the children of refugees is not one of automatic citizenship. Israel has a very strict policy of it's own in this regard.

Thanks for the link to the Jordanian website, but I think you missed my point. If Israel has the right to be recognised as the *Jewish* state despite it's makeup, then how can it object to Jordan making that same request?

&gt;No, it is a clear example of the problem, but it is not the central issue.
What do you mean, it was the impetus behind it's creation, and the justification for it's excesses. 

&gt;Yet you brought it up and I denied it was the issue. Are you actually a Zionist?
I bought it up to explain how it is used. If you deny was the issue, then how do you explain this passage:

&gt;Because they joined in that crime, because they used violence to prevent Jews from escaping the Holocaust. 

It does look rather strange given the circumstances of the Palestinians, and the magnitude of the crimes of Germany, Italy, Spain. If you want to say the Palestinians are paying the price for participating in the Holocaust, I agree. I wish more people would say the same. It only illustrates the very strange nature  of Israelis creation to the world with regards to the local population. 

&gt;I was talking about the Sudanese crimes. The Sudanese are not Arabs either.

That should illustrate to you why talking about the 'Muslim mind' or whatever the phrase was, is so blunt as to be meaningless. Many Sudanese do identify as Sudanese Arab btw.

&gt;Do you have the same advice for Jews in America, to not get involved in Americas Middle East Policy?

I'm not sure I got an answer to the question. I know many American Jews would like it if Israels opponents shut up, but thankfully that won't happen. It seems rather hypocritical given AIPAC, JStreet, and figures like Palin and Beck taking an interest. The reason I bring Palin and Beck up, is not for guilt by association, but because they talk Israel all day long. They back it to the hilt, but I don't hear many people  tell them to shut up and concentrate on the Congo instead.

&gt;No, Israel is not central and the ""War on Terror"" is not an election. Are you admitting you were wrong or are you going to double down and just lie?

Right so since 9/11 middle east policy has become less important, and no one ever says Israel is the front line in the War on Terror, is that truthy enough for you?

If you really think the Congo is more important than the spat in Israel, please tell  American Jewish groups to stop making Israel a central issue. Stop funding AIPAC, and don't make campaign donations due to a candidates stance on the conflict.

&gt;And you have yet to explain why you ignore multiple genocides and argue that others should as well.

Have I? I have told you many times, America has more leverage in Israel Palestine than in Sudan. It helped create this mess, and it funds it to the tune of billions of dollars.","1309481255"

The details behind HST is that it promotes raw material exports as the breadwinner of BC's economy, and that it is a disadvantage to the service and information sectors. In theory the manufacturing sector will benefit, but British Columbia's manufacturing sector is small, and largely dependent on using local resources from the primary sector provided they aren't exported. Incidentally the majority of British Columbians are employed in the service and information sectors. As such the HST referendum is an opportunity for the residents of British Columbia to vote on BC's economic strategy, either in favour of promoting the raw material export sector or in favour of adopting a different economic strategy.","1309481270"

People don't trust our current version of the ""market"", and trust it even less so when it relates to drugs or inebriants. If you want the market to take hold, you're not going to do it by a massive jump. You use targeted repeals/deregulations(generally anti-corporate/pro-competition ones) like a scalpel to increase confidence in the market's ability to do things, then go from there. If you don't strike some blows to the protectionist policies that fuck everything up first, no one is going to trust the markets enough to try the other things.

Our markets are so fucked up that people don't trust markets. If you don't make an effort to restore that faith before making a significant move, it's just going to blow up in your face.

This effectively eliminates the child from finding a good job in the future solely because of stereotypes that are associated to a person with a name like Starkeisha or DeShawnique. I have my own theories about this, one of which is the fact that parents naming a child Kayshawna are doing so because they lack the education and common sense to avoid names that will hurt the child as an adult. These adults then have children, and make up their own names, just as their parents did to them. This only has to do with race because of the cultural attachments names like this have in society.

All this is saying is that omission is not always subtractive in the world of media. Propaganda and censorship can cater to a certain bias just by eliminating certain viewpoints and information so that you lead the viewer to a preconceived idea. If an example is required, how about a partisan outlet detailing how hard a certain party is working to bring up jobs. While yes, that might be true it might also be true that the other party is doing the same exact thing. But purposefully omit that and you can easily have a percentage of people going ""this is why x party is so great, look at all the work they're doing while the other party is slacking off."" The outlet had to do no fucking work to lead that conclusion and meanwhile this undercurrent permeates through society.

However how many of you actually bothered to read the style guide? It is a pretty excellent guide and specifically mentions how there are circumstances where it has to be used.

'As a general rule, do not use the serial/Oxford comma: so write ‘a, b and c’ not ‘a, b, and c’. But when a comma would assist in the meaning of the sentence or helps to resolve ambiguity, it can be used – especially where one of the items in the list is already joined by ‘and’:

  They had a choice between croissants, bacon and eggs, and muesli.
There are some cases where the comma is clearly obligatory:

  The bishops of Canterbury, Oxford, Bath and Wells, and Salisbury'

All he's really saying is people think he should be one way because of his skin color and he doesn't really do that and people think he's more like another skin color.

Reddit's telling him he's cool cuz he reminds them of other cool people they know with his mannerisms and people tend to be attracted to others like them.

Clothing, behavior, manner of speech are all code to indicate to other people certain qualities - then they get to really know you and start ignoring that stuff.  so you have an intellectual side and you have integrity, but so does he, he just gets made fun of for agreeing with a kinda widespread opinion that how he dresses and behaves happens to portray those qualities better.  If he is deep down a more practical person by temperament than you it'd make sense why he'd choose what he does.  You're both smart guys from what I see but you have different priorities.

An example:  I mean maybe he just doesn't want to have to 'clean up' to go get a job; he's already cleaned up as far as other people are concerned, less effort into changing the wardrobe.  A lot of people (yeah I guess mostly white, what's it really matter between us nice folks) would look at him and think, ""non-threatening"" -- so it's practical, like maybe he likes the way he gets treated by cops, and random people in shops,  busses, etc.","1309481321"

It is utterly wrong and stupid to say that punishments don't work. I didn't say your entire opinion was invalid. I said that your opinion that punishments don't work is utterly stupid. One only needs to take a look at North Korea to realize that punishments work. The question of how far we're willing to punish people is another idea entirely. 

&gt;I'd say that for all intents and purposes, carelessness = recklessness.

That's the point. Recklessness is dangerous, and should be treated as such. We aren't god. We need to assume things to maintain order in any society. We assume that carelessness = recklessness.

"BipolarReddit","t5_2qzru","&gt; I used to want to be a doctor, now all I think I deserve is some job that lets me do something dull and pays me enough so that I can live.

Though I know this is a symptom of your past failures at self-control, I strongly believe that sort of mindset is also causal to your current predicament.

When we think to ourselves that the road ahead should be plain and contain shallow pitfalls, we set ourselves up to live that dissatisfied and non-consequential life.  Even if you're all over the place and small goals are all that seem to work out, you have to allow yourself to dream and ideate for the next steps.  I spent my entire university career undiagnosed, flopping back and forth like a fish out of water most of the time.  I seemed successful to others, I had great internships, but I never knew if the semester would bring straight A's or if I'd be dropped from a program (I was kicked out of my university's Russian department midway through the last semester of language study, i.e. my last semester in school.) When my first major manic period hit (followed by suicidal depression) I lost everything I had built--or so I thought.

I've tried a few different combinations of medicine, various therapy techniques, etc.  Still, things aren't always well-managed.  But finally, I have my sense of self back.  The way I achieved this is by reminding myself of the positive things I have done, the great works I have accomplished (even if I did fail miserably in the end, before full realization of the goal at hand) and it's led to me being able to have greater self-confidence.  I don't entirely trust myself, and I don't know if I ever will, but I've learned to deal with that by *being patient with myself.*

When something that seems oppressively big comes over you, think about everything else you are, think about how you can ameliorate your situation, think about your strengths.  This is a hard and treacherous path we walk, but standing on the precipice and freezing in fear will not get you anywhere.  You have to imbue yourself with the courage to take that next step, and then the next.  And when there is a pitfall, find the shallowest face to climb back up.  It takes moderation, planning and persistance (and a very good idea of who you are--which can be helped by constantly documenting your life, noting what's going on and how it affects you) and even then it isn't always enough.  But, the most important thing in all of this, while you have to take responsibility for the actions you take in life--you can't blame yourself for failure when moods swing out of your control.

Further on the previous note, mood regulation is crucial to success with this disorder in our current scheme of socio-economic organization.  If you feel anhedonic, if you feel depressed or worthless, then chances are that there is a better medication regiment to work out.  Constant treatment is absolutely necessary.

As always, good luck and if you ever have any questions, concerns, worries, etc. don't hesitate to contact this forum or PM me when you are in need--I will respond immediately upon noticing something in my inbox.  You can do this and you can be the best you that there is.  You just have to fight tooth and nail, even when it doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  

We may be mentally ill, but that doesn't mean we're crazy or weak.  We have to be stronger than the average joe/jane if we want to reach potential.  And, honestly, I believe that with the proper attitude and constant proactive self-awareness and action, we can be more attuned with who we inherently are.  And that, that is a gift.","1309481340"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","In my experience IRL and on reddit, many atheists shy away from the strong atheism label when they really are, at least in large part, just as so many agnostics shy away from the term atheist even though they usually are.

Basically, many atheists I know are strong atheists in respect to well defined gods (they actively deny they exist), such as Zeus, Thor, or the Abrahamic God (at least the more conservative/traditional versions of Him). However, they remain weak atheists with respect to a deist god or some other vague or undefined concept of a higher power or spirit because there isn't enough ridiculousness to find contrary arguments and evidence. 

I think this position classifies someone as a strong atheist. But many will argue this.

I for one proudly assert that there are excellent reasons and evidence for disbelieving in the existence of almost every concept of god put forth by mankind and identify as a strong/positive/hard/explicit atheist.","1309481346"

"wicked_edge","t5_2s46m","Follow these tips:

1. Create a good lather from your soap/creme before you go in the shower.  You don't want to waste precious time when you get out.
2. Soak in your face directly against the water stream in the shower for at least 5-10 minutes.  Make the shower nice and hot.
3. Apply your pre-made lather to your face immediately after you exit the shower.
4. Use almost zero pressure on your razor when making the shaving strokes on your face.


**NOTES:**

a. Only shave with the hair until you can get a perfect shave with no cuts and irritation.  Once you can start getting no cuts and irritation, start to shave side-ways after you make your ""with the hair"" stroke.

b. If you face becomes irritated, do not shave for a few days and let your skin heal.  If your skin is dry sleep with a humidifier beside your bed.  I would suggest not using any cremes or unnatural soaps.  Yes, Zest, and all those soaps in the normal isle of the supermarkets are unnatural.  Use a natural organic soap from a proper heath store or all natural store.  Unnatural/man-made soaps dry your face out so badly.

c. Do not use aftershaves.  Aftershaves can irritate your skin very badly and just make things worse.  If you are set on using one, test it on a small patch of your neck or place you shaved first.  I sometimes apply aftershaves, but only 20 minutes after the shave.  *My rule is, if it stings, it'll go red and become irritated so I only apply it after the pores have closed completely.*

Good luck.","1309481362"

The evidence for the existence of Jesus all comes from after his lifetime.[37][38][39] As a result, some critics argue that Biblical scholars have created the historical Jesus in their own image.[40][41] A small number of scholars believe the gospel accounts are so mythical in nature that nothing, not even the very existence of Jesus, can be determined from them.[42]""


Also you will never find someone named ""Jesus"" in history books his name if he at all existed was Jeshua - just like  your ""god"" Jehovahs true name is Elohim which got changed to yahweh and then jehovah :)))) 

Also I question history books given to us in school NOW because history is written by the victors writing themselves as the heroes and the defated as the evil enemy - I don't need to prove jesus existed to prove the bible is false though I can show you all of the inconsistencies in it and how truly evil god is in that book where as lucifer is truly the one that gives us his unconditional love. But hey, there are people in this world that are so attached to their ideals that even when shown evidence they refuse to believe it 

Remember luke 18:22 if you follow jesus' word you shouldnt own anything

Also : Any comment on how jesus' story is almost an exact mirror of Horus?

you seem to be a commie, the truth is chavez isnt comunist nor socialist, he is just a lier that changes his political views depending of the situation just to favor him in the elections, not the country, he always blames some other party, or the united states, or the past goverments, but never provides a solutions to the problems making them go worse, so he must go because he is a burden to the country and the people that wants to be succesful, a lot of capable people have left the country leaving just the poor and idiots.

What if you file in state court and the other party tries to remove it to federal court?

If you can find caselaw, how do you know it hasn't been modified or overturned by another case?  Do you know how to even write a legal brief?

I can throw hundreds of other scenarios at you.  Sure, you might think you found the ""right"" form and then proceed to fuck everything up.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Welll that's a tough one, but if you are not getting anything out of the relationship, if you're not happy to be with her, then why are you with her? Making a list always helped me (boyfriend and I have been together since we were 15) back in the day when I thought about us breaking up. It can help to write things down so you can have a physical aide to help you sort through the things that are floating around inside your head. Make a list of the good things, and the things you feel need to be improved. (Just don't let her find it! Hah)

If she behaves this way now, and you have brought it to her attention but she refuses to acknowledge that her behavior is inappropriate, do you think that she will ever change? There's a lot of give and take that happens in a relationship, and communication is the NUMBER ONE key! It doesn't sound like she is listening to you..this isn't necessarily a deal-breaker, but if she refuses to listen to your concerns and validate them now, with this issue, when bigger issues arise she probably won't do it then either.

If there are very special things you get from the relationship, and this is just an annoyance, I would say continue trying to talk with her about it, you may end up ""opening her eyes""

But if not, you should probably tell her things aren't working out. Is it better to stay in an unhappy relationship where you constantly feel conflicted, or be single and maybe be lonely for a little while, but not have the need to butt heads all the time.


P.S. As I said the bf and I have been together since we were 15 - we still keep an even tab between us. He buys me dinner one night, I'll buy him lunch next time. I buy him some clothes, he'll pay for the groceries.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;For the sake of the whole planet, I want the world economy to slow down overall and to accelerate in the US, 

Wow.  I can't tell if this is more racist or jingoist.  My guess is, both.  

&gt;Unbridled economic growth is never good, SUSTAINABLE economic growth is the key. 

I can't even parse this.  Perhaps you could elaborate on what exactly ""unsustainable"" growth is?  

&gt; The regions who are experiencing economic growth these days are the least developed and least prepared to deal with the challenges of using nuclear energy.

Nuclear power is not a bogeyman.  I promise, there is no nuclear monster hiding under your bed - now please go to bed.  With what moral authority do you tell the rest of the world they 'can't be trusted with nuclear power'?  While children starve to death in India, you each soy burgers.  Nice.  

&gt;Well, I don't live in a poor part of India, but I don't have 10 children either. 

The best way to affect population growth is to sterilize yourself.

&gt;While I want people to have access to basic infrastructure, I don't really think the world needs more Indians (1.2 billion). 

Holy shit.  Did you really just say this?  Welcome to 1912, folks.  You know who else we have too many of?  Blacks.  They should all be sterilized.  /s

You're disgusting.  

&gt;So it's a question of responsibility which involves decisions that must be made by the Indian people and the Indian government to control their population growth.

No, it's a question of ingenuity.  You're literally too stupid to come up with a way for everyone to have what you want them to have, so you think they should be euthanized.  While I'm thankful that speech is free on reddit, if someone were to arrest you for saying something so horrifying, I would probably urge the ACLU lawyer to stop and get a beer with his friends on the way to file your petition against the arrest.  

&gt;If you have an out-of-control birth rate,

What exactly is this?  You've got to love a person who, when presented with an economic challenge, comes to the conclusion that you need to kill the excess buyers.  

&gt;don't expect the world economy to skyrocket just to feed people, 

...so instead, people should starve to death?  

&gt;real life doesn't work like that because basically economic growth brings along bad environmental consequences,

Science fail.  

&gt; such as depletion of natural resources and resort, for instance, to complex, sometimes risky technology such as nuclear power.

You know what's risky?  Reducing your species growth rate because you're afraid that you won't be able to pay your cable bill.  Because let's be honest here - that is what this is about.  You have what you have, and you think that the economy and the planet is a zero-sum game. 1.3B Indians (whom you seem to have a vendetta against) represent a threat to your ability to have your creature comforts.  So your solution is - rather than try and...I don't know *solve* the fucking problem, advise them that they can't live their lives in the manner of their choosing.  

You greedily hold on to the treasures that have been won for you by hard-working individuals who *don't* have your fear-filled attitude toward the future - while insisting that the same be denied to everyone else, on the grounds that *you are too stupid to of a way for them to have it, too.*  

Well guess what, my friend.  There are those of us who don't want to dictate to others how they should live their lives.  There are those of us who would rather do everything we can to support them - regardless of how they choose to.  Let a person help himself to his own future.  

Your kind of anti-science anti-progress anti-humanity hate speech is revolting.  ","1309481413"

I don't think this is a very useful way to define the position. It seems to me that this is simply trying to make the position seem unreasonable by definition.

Can't be going to the moon or Mars when your spending money to create a bigger military and become Lord Sidious of the galactic empire on Earth.

This is a prime example of what I mean that if our agency's that need money they can do things to get the money since our senators are not in the business of giving out money unless they are going to make a buck or two off it to stuff in their wallets and call it campaign funds..If this guy said that 1/2 the money or more was going to go towards getting our ass to Mars I'd fork out the cash.","1309481443"

"answers","t5_2qkeh","I would, of course, defer to those that have a better understanding of the industry than I... but from an environmental standpoint I would advise against this as a career.

Gas prices will continue to be a volatile aspect of the viability of this profession, not to mention the expense of maintaining the highway system in a country with very low population density.

Gas prices as you probably know are heavily subsidized by the government, which leads the cost of gas in the US to be about half of what it costs in Europe. A recent study has determined that the true cost of gas (if you factor in all of the externalities of pollution) is $15 per gallon. I'm willing to guess that the trucking industry will shut down well before the price reaches that high.

The deficit being what it is, both at the federal level and the state level will inevitably result in the number of viable interstate roads shrinking rather than growing over the next 30 years.

And lastly, trucking isn't very efficient, particularly compared to rail transport. Which means that while trucking won't likely die as an industry, it's likely that trucking will be used more and more for short haul rather than long haul freight forwarding.

If the population density were higher for most of the US (like it is on the east coast) then trucking would have a more secure future, but it isn't and many geographers/environmentalists/city planners will tell you cross-country trucking may not be around for the duration of your anticipated career.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt; I'm just pointing out what the thing actually says.

No, that's not what it says.  Someone on Reddit always tries to make an awkward pedantic reading of this kind of thing, but it is not correct to willfully misread the intent of the text.  English is not that literal.  If I tell you that I just ate a bowl of watermelon, that doesn't mean I ate a bowl made of watermelon, even though you could make an awkward argument that it's what I said.

If it had said ""peeing *into* the shower"" saves water, your argument might make sense.  But it doesn't.  It says ""peeing *in* the shower"", meaning that you are physically in the shower stall.  Why are you in the shower just to pee?  Wouldn't you stand outside the shower and pee into it if you just wanted to use it as a urinal?

&gt; Also, this would save more water.

It would save more water, but your bathroom would also smell like urine.  Some of the urine would undoubtedly stay on the shower floor, because it's not being rinsed off.  The rest would sit in the trap.  The whole idea of the trap is that it should be filled with water to block smells and gases from below.  But when you fill it with urine instead of water, it's obviously going to smell like urine.","1309481472"

"soccer","t5_2qi58","It's a bit strange in the US, and varies by sport. 

In US football, the NFL make a big deal out of where players went to university. Not because they learned a god-damn thing, but rather because college football is a billion dollar business in which the talent is forbidden to profit.

Basketball is much the same. They even have the 'LeBron' rule now that says a player cannot be drafted or signed straight out of high school (secondary school).

So players must attend at least a semester of university to be eligible for the NBA. And the academic requirements boil down to the ability to sign one's name.

Baseball is a bit different. College players have always been looked down upon. It's something Americans don't really talk about. But if you want to make the Show (MLB), you sign a baseball contract when you're 17 or 18, and in six or seven years you might make it.

This is why in the US college basketball and football are so important, and college baseball so unimportant. The basketball and football players will be the future pro stars. The college baseball players are already too old to reach the majors. (Note: Some do, but they're the exception, not the rule.)

MLS is trying to implement an academy system as exists everywhere else. As of today, all MLS teams have academies, and they get the benefit of being able to sign an academy player without him going through the draft.

It's a young system, but Juan Agudelo is perhaps the first true quality player that came up through an academy (New York).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I got free passes to an advance screening of some Mandy Moore teeny bopper romantic movie one time, which was thoroughly terrible. because it was a press screening, about half of the audience were way older, and the other half were die hard mandy moore fangirls who won a contest or something. 

Right near the end of the movie, after ninety minutes of saccharine tripe, the climactic romantic scene happens, and the male lead utters some line that really went over the top in terms of sheer badness. I'm pretty sure the line contained the title of the movie.

Right then, some guy in the back makes a huge retching sound, which threw the theatre into chaos.

First, all of the older people crack up laughing, with not a small amount of cheering and applause. The teeny boppers take great offense to this and begin trying to shout down the adults, which of course just makes everyone laugh harder.

For the last ten minutes of the movie it went back and forth like some kind of ridiculous cultural warfare. Basically the funniest thing that's ever happened to me in a theatre.","1309481475"

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","I can't give citations.  My credentials center on being an old fart engineer motorhead, former racer, former wrench.  What I said is just my quick estimation of what one would find if one actually did the engineering.   

Let's see, ... you know the latest, hottest thing is radially mounted calipers, right?  Why such a hot thing? It's all about mimimizing torsional flex.  Now, with that it's all about the flex in the caliper itself but it bears noting because it highlights the issue of torsion and flex.   

The fork assembly isn't perfectly rigid, not even in the best design.  Application of the brake puts a shitload of both stress and strain (using the engineering meaning of those words here) all over the fork assembly.  With single disc front ends - which tend to appear on less costly, less strictly engineered machines - applying the brake causes some flexion in the forks around the front axle.  As i said, or I tried to indicate anyway, it's something you could measure only in a lab or see in computer simulations.  That miniscule change in the wheel geometry _could_, _theoretically_ have some input to the steering response / stability etc.  Not that I have ever heard of anyone actually claiming they could feel it. What's more, to claim that any resultant deviation would be toward the side with the disc, well it could be yeah, it could also be the opposite - without detailed engineering analysis of the forces, maybe running a finite element model simulation, I wouldnt go on record predicting which of the two might be the case.  Further, I think it could, nay probably would, be different for any different models/designs; it all depends on the particulars of the specific components. 

I was trying to be nice, and a little clever in my response.  I now go on record saying that what the coworker claimed is in outer fucking space.  

Edit: I wish to emend.  Not that it _would_ be different for any different models, its more that there's really no way to say whether it would be the same or different.

No, I have not been to a gun show. I do not own a gun. All I know if from what I have seen/read. Having said that, I grew up in an area where a lot of people did own guns for their safety. Not Cabrini Green or Camden, NJ, a middle class working neighborhood in NY. 

While I can admit that I do not know jack or shit about the way gun shows or loopholes work, criminals buying guns in other states and bringing them up to NY is a serious problem. So please, educate me (not being sarcastic here).

On to your argument: I think you mistake me for thinking that guns are bad. I have no problems with guns. Own a million guns if you want. That is not me, but go for it. Having said that, saying that people will just get guns illegally is not an argument for laxer gun control. How about we just keep guns out of everyone's hands? That would be as valid as the everyone should have guns arguments. (I'm not actually saying that, chill, but this is the old ""if we make guns criminal, then only criminals have guns"" line. It's not an argument against gun control, it's an argument for taking responsibility.) 

There has to be a decent medium. If you are saying that there should be more discretion about which crimes keep people from having any guns, then I agree. You want to own a gun, great, no problem. I just think there is some responsibility that comes along with it, similar to owning a car, etc. 

I guess I really do not know much about the intricacies but I do know that there is a problem and I think the status quo is probably not sustainable. So tell me, am I way off base here? IS everything ok the way it is and I am just way off base?","1309481493"

I agree about taking action to meet people -- I just recently started doing this via OkCupid, and will be meeting a girl I met there in a couple weeks. It's only a friendly meeting, not a date, but besides the obvious benefits of making new friends, I'm trying to become more comfortable around women, and widen my social circle at the same time. Girls know other girls, anyhow, so hopefully I can trigger a snowball effect of increasing socialization with enough honest effort.

I think your RPG analogy is apt, but I don't feel like I'm getting ahead of myself as far as dating goes. Yeah, that's the main quest, and you have to complete a bunch of auxiliary shit before you're ready, but that doesn't mean I don't need to hurry. This is a time sensitive problem; my situation gets sadder (and less reparable) as I get older. I've waited too fucking long already.

""You ass looks great, I want to just bury my face in it like it's vanilla ice cream""

""I wish your nipples were in my mouth right now""

You get the idea. Basically have some text sex with her, tell her all the things she makes you want to do to her. Emphasize barriers in the process, for instance:

""If we were together right now, I would ravage you right this moment""

""I want to do X to you but too bad I can't because we're not in the same place"".

This is a test to see how she responds. She could reply with something like ""Well you could come over here"" or ""You could invite me over"". Regardless, just hint around the two of you getting together by emphasizing barriers.","1309481507"

You will be playing scared money to some degree if you are worried about the $ amount, and playing with less than a full stack is almost always -EV (unless you have a practiced short stack strategy).

Other points aside, if you are playing outside your limits - you will be results oriented. This is bad. If you get bad beat after flopping the nuts and having someone draw out on you, you could turn into one of those guys who overbets his hand because he is scared of being drawn out on or having to think too hard (ie. oldguy bets double the pot with 3 players behind, who all fold, he shows top set ""I didn't want to see a third spade come out on the turn"")

Possibly worse, is that if you play poorly and win - you will build habits around those results and eventually lose, and go into a slump where you just can't figure out why ___ isn't working for you anymore.

If you have thousands of hands at the micros, that's great. But your lack of bankroll will distract your brain from the correct play that you learned putting in tons of hours, and focus on results and the $ value in front of you.

TLDR: Get rolled for the game, avoid results oriented play.","1309481512"

I will shamelessly admit that I pirate all of the content on my kindle.  It's so much better not to have to deal with the nonsense of someone revoking your right to read and not being able to lend based on the whims of the publisher.  That said, I own a print copy of upwards of 90% of the content on my kindle.  If there was a simple and easy way of doing it, I would simply donate $10 or so to the authors of the books I read.  The Luddite deep inside of me still likes the tactile feeling of owning real books.

Apple offers the only real solution today, but, of course, giving up some flexibility- it's a tradeoff. I'm a huge computer/tech nerd at heart- been programming since my dad brought home a C64 when I was a kid- I love tinkering when I WANT to tinker.. when I want to get shit done and have shit just work, I have found Apple to be the only company to consistently deliver.

I'm not sure why explaining why I have chosen Apple over the more involved/less stable options makes me a fanboy.. more power to you if you choose to go a different route. As somebody who has used and tried to work around most every option out there, I feel like I have some decent insight. It's unfortunate that, because my conclusion is that Apple is best for my needs, it gets me labeled a fanboy :/ I'm not blindly following Apple because they make pretty shit- they make shit that works together in a way no other company does right now.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Building is actually very easy, contrary to common belief. The components are all built with standard specifications, its just up to you to purchase the correct components that work with each other. Most components work together with no problem, but what you will want to pay special attention to is the graphics and processor slot. As far as graphics, you need to make sure the motherboard can handle current graphics cards, which operate on PCI eXpress slots (you'll want the highest bandwidth x16 slots at a minimum). And then for processors.. you first want to get the basics right; if you want an Intel processor, make sure the mobo supports Intel processors. And then from there you'll need to make sure that you're using the correct pin type (different processors have different numbers of pins, these need to match up for the processor to be used on the motherboard. Past that, everything clicks into place, and there are manuals provided (and online guides as well) to help assist you in the process.

She never wanted to deal with it so she hid the fact that she ate bad food, but she dragged us into it. I have three sons, all are very healthy and slim.

"Watches","t5_2qls5","It really depends on what you are looking for.  

Vintage or New?

Movement - Swiss Automatic or bargain bin?

Complication - Chronograph or simple?

Size - big watches are more in style now but may be dated in a few years

Style - Military, Dive, Classic Dress, Skeleton, Industrial?

If you don't know exactly what you are looking for I would recommend a high quality general use watch.  Nowadays this means a dive watch with metal bracelet.  If you get a simple, elegant design then you can wear it with a suit or blue jeans.

I am not a fan of imitation watches so I generally recommend a watch that either has a high quality movement or brings something unique to the table.  For a high quality swiss automatic in your price range I recommend Sinn for diver style or Xetum for a more contemporary style (both use high-quality, swiss automatic movements).  If you want something military then look at Tsovet (swiss quartz or automatic) or LUM-TEC (swiss &amp; japanese automatic).

I dont know of any high quality classic dress watches in that price range.  I wouldn't buy anything less than an IWC.  The Zenith you linked is very nice but at over $5k your options are wide.

""I found Launcher Pro to be buttery smooth. Well worth the upgrade to +""

I've never tried GO but afaik, launcher pro is the only hardware accelerated launcher, and that's why it's 'buttery smooth'.

Is GO?  As a matter of fact, the only two hardward accelerated apps are launcher pro and Opera mini.  Are there any others?  I wish there was a hardware accel pdf and another hardware accelerated browser as there's a lot I don't like about Opera.  

Honeycomb offers hardware acceleration but no asop drop.  The only other I know is Dolphin HD but hardware accel is only for HC.

edit: I just looked on GO: ""Experimental Honeycomb compatibility with hardware acceleration""
http://www.androidguys.com/2011/05/09/awesome-launcher-adwex-updated-v131/

To clarify what I meant, I mean hardware accel apps on android 2.x and again afaik it's just launcher pro and Opera.  So I'd be surprised anyone claiming any launcher is faster than android.

"japan","t5_2qh2u","What you should do is buy your international ticket to Tokyo, then purchase the domestic ticket from Tokyo to Sapporo during tabiwari (EXACTLY two months to the day). Where you are coming from will help in us suggesting affordable airlines. I find that united is one of the cheapest that does direct flights to places I go. Buying directly through them is sometimes a bit cheaper then going through expedia or travelocity, for example. Korean airlines is another affordable airline you could try. They have flights that head straight to Sapporo after stopping over in Korea.


Also travelocity has a fare watch that I would sign up for if I were you and you have some time to browse. They'll alert you if the prices go up/down/have a sale.


For buying the domestic ticket, AirDO and Skymark are the cheapest to get tickets to Hokkaido. Skymark has an English website, AirDO does not. But AirDO's is not difficult to navigate. 


HIS is a good travel agent to try, but their cheapest tickets usually come as special deals that only allow you to stay a set amount of days. They probably wouldn't be the best option for long term stay.
STA travel is a student travel agency I've used in the past. The have student discounts most of the time.

EDIT: Tabiwari tickets are around 10,000 yen one way. Which is pretty cheap. I've gotten them as cheap as 9,800 before. Happy reddit birthday and an early welcome to Hokkaido! It's fun times up here. :)","1309481590"

"writing","t5_2qh2n","Well, the character was supposed to be a freshman in college who, upon entering, started some sort of work study program. But he offended the administrator in charge of the program and was assigned to assist a janitor in the oldest building on campus. One day he discovered a door at the back of a broom closet. Inside it he found a lot of old garbage and dusty books. One small leather bound book had no dust on it. He pocketed it without opening it.   

Later, he returned to the closet without the book. Standing against the wall was a small man who looked out of place, even for a university. He told the boy that taking the book wasn't going to get him in trouble, but reading it probably would. When he got home, he found he couldn't read it, but in time the patterns started to make sense. Eventually, he'd come to understand the book held great power, and attempt to recite an incantation. The incantation would transport him to another world.  

Of course, it's all much more involved than this, but it wouldn't be tough to change the setting so he finds it as a student in a school set in the other dimension, and seems it would be a bit cleaner.  

Its relevance comes in that, when he gets to the new world, the book is no longer legible, and that's part of what he sets out to do: decipher the book. But in fact the book has some semblance of sentience, and since the boy had served its purpose, chose to obfuscate itself again. The main plot develops as, in seeking information about the book, the boy becomes involved in a struggle of power, etc. etc.  

If I keep it how it is, his character will be influenced by his home world, but it won't be a driving force. Rather his desire to remain and integrate himself in the new world--his desire to separate himself from his past life and earth as we know it--will be a guiding force. 

But I've envisioned another origin where he's somewhat of a ""lost son"" so to speak, abandoned by his family, raised by scholars....steals the book and runs, but can't read it. He only knew it was valuable. The rest unfolds pretty similarly, but his past has the chance to catch up with him, if that's the way things go.","1309481606"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","OK, seriously, I always thought this was a straightforward materials issue. The water is interacting with the skin, either taking something out or putting something in. Osmosis seems like a plausible mechanism.

Now the question of why other skin does not react the same is a good one. Penile skin is awfully loose (most of the time, ahem!) and may not be the best comparison. However skin on the sides and backs of the fingers and arms would seem to be a good data point.

Now what if the skin isn’t the same however? We know that the fingertips are among the most sensitive areas of the body. That’s due to the density of nerve endings there. Perhaps there are other differences as well?

So here is a puzzler. Your mouth is a persistently wet environment, covered in skin. Probably specialized skin, especially on the tongue. So how come it does not pucker? Of course if different skin composition can cause pruney fingers, presumably water resistant skin in the mouth can prevent pruning too. Also, saliva does not have the same composition as ordinary tap water.

I am sorry to hear that :( ... Freedom really is a big tent.

&gt;While I can admit that I do not know jack or shit about the way gun shows or loopholes work, criminals buying guns in other states and bringing them up to NY is a serious problem.

I understand that criminals buying guns in other states is a serious problem. Gun shows are generally made up of licensed firearm dealers. They all conduct the required background check. In order to get the ""gunshow loophole,"" you would have to go to a individual firearm owner at the show, which is quite rare in comparison to the people buying guns. They will never have a table, you would have to find them in the crowd and ask them to buy a gun. The same ""gunshow loophole"" would apply to individuals selling each other guns for personal use. Closing of the ""gunshow loophole"" won't stop criminals from buying firearms, you would have to ban all sales of firearms between individuals (assuming they would be effective, which I highly doubt would be the case). I think this is quite a few steps further than many people are willing to take.

&gt;criminals buying guns in other states and bringing them up to NY is a serious problem.

The problem isn't criminals buying guns in other states and bringing them to NY, it is criminals *owning* guns. Believe it or not, criminals obtain firearms intra-state and would still do so even if NY was able to someone stop ALL firearm importation. And again, ignoring the human/civil rights issues involved.

&gt;Having said that, saying that people will just get guns illegally is not an argument for laxer gun control. How about we just keep guns out of everyone's hands?

I shudder at the thought of the policies you would institute in an attempt to enforce such a thing. It will be absolutely impossible to do such a thing, completely ignoring human/civil rights issues.

&gt; How about we just keep guns out of everyone's hands? That would be as valid as the everyone should have guns arguments.

Valid in what sense? If this includes the government and literally everyone in society, then perhaps you may have a better shot at such an assertion. Is this your assertion?

&gt;if we make guns criminal, then only criminals have guns"" line.

Criminals and the government. It *is* an argument against gun control because the purpose of gun control is to keep guns out of the hands of bad people, but their affect is to keep good people from owning guns. The bad people will continue to own guns because they do not care what the law is (Assuming there actually exists some good/bad dichotomy). An argument that questions the effectiveness of a certain action is absolutely an argument against that action.

&gt;There has to be a decent medium. If you are saying that there should be more discretion about which crimes keep people from having any guns, then I agree.

I am asserting that *everyone* and their mother should be able to practice their constitutional right to own a firearm. Even the ""criminals.""

&gt;I just think there is some responsibility that comes along with it, similar to owning a car, etc.

And that responsibility should be...? I am interested in what you consider as a ""responsibility.""

&gt;IS everything ok the way it is and I am just way off base?

Absolutely not. Everyone should have the ability to own a firearm to protect themselves from others. The right to self-defense is fundamental to our own existence. If you have a right to life, it follows you have a right to defend that life. By removing the ability of citizens convicted of felonies to own firearms, you simply marginalize them to suffer to be criminals and victims forever.","1309481638"

That doesn't excuse selling products you know are dangerous and defective.

2. Always be monitoring Everybody's health, not just your pocket.  Don't think of your pocket as your heal-target, but as the backup on whom to build Ubercharge when everybody else is overhealed.
3. You're a high value target; spys want you dead, so keep an eye out for them.  As a good medic, you'll be the spy's 2nd worst enemy, noticing non-standard behavior and *announcing their presence to your team*.
4. If you see a medic (firing or healing somebody) who doesn't have full health, heal him first.  Your pocket will survive long enough for you to make a payment on your own ""health insurance plan""
5. Unless you're alone, if you don't have your medigun out (uber, kritz, or quickfix), you're probably doing it wrong.
6. Find the Advanced Option that allows you to not hold down M1 to heal.  It will save your mouse in the long run.
7. The uber is more important than a suicidal patient's life.  Patients are back to the front in less than 20 seconds.  Ubers take 40.  (I've been known to let a favorite pocket die because prolonging his life would have risked 80% uber, only to run back towards spawn and escort him back to the front, this time with full uber).
8. You can spy check as a medic while still healing people.  Because you need to move around anyway, and don't need to aim at your target once you're acquired, you can intentionally run into players who're coming up from spawn.  If they're friendlies you up pass through them.  If they're spies, you'll hit them, and you can warn your teammates who will hopefully eliminate him quickly. (I've made this a habit.  If I don't see them fire, taunt, or come out of spawn, I try to run through them before healing them)","1309481677"

Obi and Qui-gon stow away on seperate (why?) ships so that they can warn the Naboo of the invasion. They are arriving WITH the invasion, so I'm not sure how they expected this plan to go. Luckily, rather than landing near the capital city, the Trade Federation lands on the literal other side of the planet (we know this because the Gungans inform the jedi that going through the planet core is the fastest way to get there). Before the jedi know this, they decide to abandon their plan to warn the Naboo and follow jar jar to the Gungan city. Obi wan makes up some bullshit about how what happens to the Naboo will affect the Gungans, despite them being on opposite sides of the planet and Obi not knowing anything about Naboo, and with some Jedi mind tricks the Gungans agree to give the jedi a boat. They warn Padme and they escape Naboo by flying directly through the blockade. The blockade almost stops them when their shield generator fails, but R2D2 fixes the shield generator rendering the entire blockade useless.

"MCNSA","t5_2s61v","I was told about MCNSA in February by two friends who no longer show up much (drgonzo51 and glueandnails).  I was initially excited just because it was a server that was actually running reliably, unlike our poor attempts at doing it ourselves.  For the first few weeks, I figured the best thing to do was to hike a few thousand coordinates away and basically ignore everyone else in my own happy corner of the world (okay, my friends were nearby...). We started some big projects, such as the 40x40 pit down to the bedrock, and I realized that when these two guys weren't on, the game (work) was becoming more tedious than fun.  That's when I first tried reaching out to the community here.  I was floored by the response of people who came to help with projects (even aside from the powers of god that one time in our little hell pit).  The people made the playing so much more satisfying.  I certainly didn't want to disconnect when people were giving up their time on my sake! The more I reached out, the more I realized that like nsanidy himself, the people here care about this server deeply. I've never spent more than 5 minutes on any other public server, but why would anyone ever want to?  I don't know what the others are like, but there's no way anything can compare.
At first, this seemed like an easy way to share and save creations with my friends.  Even though the friends that showed me here are now onto other games and my first creations here are long gone, I still wouldn't go anywhere else. The biggest shortcoming computer games have is their ability to put you out of touch with humanity, but I feel like there's actually a pretty healthy dose of that in these parts.

Personally, I thought the article was well written, and its deliberate, unambiguous attack on the status quo is something most people here would encourage in any forum about almost any other drug.

The author has clearly has extensive knowledge of chemicals and their underlying structures, and his experience in this field clearly extends well beyond the realm of his thesis. I would really like to know what makes you as qualified, apart from your indignance with his writing style, to criticise someone who probably has a doctorate in chemistry...

In any case, this is largely irrelevant, but your ad hominen against the author and his style of writing is exactly the reason we can't have a rational discussion about the decriminalisation of recreational drugs - because what we know, what we already believe, makes us too angry to engage a discussion about anything that contradicts that.

Finally, the idea that we've ""never seen enough positive reports"" is exactly what the author was trying to assauge by using language that highlights the fundamental flaws of those reports, what you erroneously perceived as his self-assuredness.

Honestly I just came here to defend someone's presentation of a new way of looking at things, but as I've been re-reading what you've written, I now feel compelled to chastise for your hypocrisy also. Everything you said could be applied to... everything you said.

If people want to do something that they find beautiful, then they should be allowed to. When a lot of people feel the same way as you it turns ugly. Hate crimes against punks, transvestites etc. are very real. We're talking about people walking in groups searching for people who look different, jumping out of cars and beating them up. They are not asking to be beaten up even if it is a consequence of their choice of clothing. It is expected of people to be tolerant and the secondhand cause of an action does not necessarily make said action wrong. That's the fallacy people like you commit.

I ordered a beer, the bartender said it was $4. He made me pay him before he would get my drink.  That had never happened before.  He then counted the money, looked at me with disgust, and said ""What, no tip?"" I was amazed he had the balls to even ask. In shock, I said, ""well not now, you won't"".  He then threw the $4 back at my face, stormed off from behind the bar and grabbed two bouncers.  They end up throwing me out. What kind of ass hole does that?

I ""lost"" one of my best friends to AA about a little over a year ago.  She was the kind of best friend that you could call whenever, would always make time, and would always go out of her way for you.  She helped me through an extremely nasty breakup, introduced me to a lot of wonderful people, and enriched my life in many ways.  She was an amazing artist, designer, and even helped me pick out the colors for the walls in my home.

She had problems, though.  I'm genuinely happy that she got the help she needed, but I'm on the Other Side of the equation.  I'm on the ""not my cult"" side, and apparently, fairly far removed.

Her ex-boyfriend, who I introduced her to, got an apology.  Our mutual friends got apologies.  I, the one who got her home when she couldn't walk straight despite me trying to keep her from drinking too much, the one who did everything I could to make sure she was safe when she got out of hand, simply got cut out of her life.  I'm not a sober man, but I'm not like _that_.

I can't blame AA, though.  All I'm saying is that I can understand where the author is coming from.  Haters gonna hate, but cut the lady some slack.  People will always try to find something to blame.

I still have the picture of us my friend drew on my wall, and I probably always will.","1309481715"

"techsupport","t5_2qioo","if you figure it out let me know.  I have the same frustrations:  
  
Our company uses Google Apps Premier for our email.  One of our users went over quota, he also happens to be the boss.  Google Apps Premier has no way to increase storage per mailbox, he gets a lot of freakin emails &amp; attachments and I've had to create a mule account for him before.  I start to do this again and am logging in and out of the two accounts as well as my own (the administrator of the domain) to get everything set up when it locks out his main account due to ""suspicious activity.""  
  
No problem, I think... I call the Google Apps Support line, describe the problem, but I guess this doesn't actually get you to a technician, just some freakin secretary who takes down your info and tells me no one's immediately available but I'll get an answer in up to 1 business day.  So I'm expecting a call back within a few hours but actually get an email at 8:29AM, about an hour after I called, telling me the following:  
  
&gt;Thank you for your message. My name is Christine and I will be assisting you with your issue.  I understand     that the user ****@*****.com  has been locked out of the account for 24 hours after transferring      emails to free up space in their inbox.

I follow instructions 1-3 and don't get the results the email states I will.  I write her back as well as call Google Apps support back, and imagine... no one is still available.  At 4:02AM the next day I get this email back from Christine:

If you are referring to the douchebags, then obviously yes it's frustrating.  For example, the guys who say, ""Even if god existed I still wouldn't follow him cause he's a dick"".  Their hatred of religion is so blind that they lost sight of the rational nature of atheism.

If you are referring to the knowledgeable but smug people, then no.  In fact I'm frustrated that people call them names like ""smart ass"" for trying to point out why they believe they are right and the other side is wrong.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Being Asian in Hollywood isn't bad, but it's not great. I think the commercial world is great for ethnic people, and commercials are the primary source of income for non-celebrity working-class actors. Being Asian for TV/Film roles is a little tricky. You definitely have to deal with some stereotypical roles. For instance, last week, I auditioned for the role of a SF fortune cookie factory owner on a kids show. The sides were written in broken English. I decided to audition in normal English and RESPECTFULLY told them afterwards that I chose that because Chinese had been emigrating to SF since the 1800's and also because the show would be seen by kids in non-diverse neighborhood so I would want their idea of a Chinese person to be somebody who might look different from them but could still talk like them.

I think being Asian is very good for the small TV/Film roles (we call those ""co-stars"") like the waiter, receptionist, etc. Producers like having that bit of color in smaller roles. It's tougher to break through to the major roles though because I think they're traditionally seen as being Caucasian.

Not knowing your circumstances, my main advice is ""jump in."" there's a lot of hemming and hawing that takes place because people are scared to jump into acting. if you're interested, jump in and see. i recommend the books by [K Callan](http://kcallan.com) for learning about the business. Classes are helpful too. And do NOT pay somebody to represent you. There are a ton of scammers out there.

Unless a hoverboard in a street is a particularly rare scenario, which you'd think would need to be addressed at some point during the film, the appearance of a hoverboard is largely is looked over: which implies the product is common and has market saturation. For the product to reach a market saturation great enough by October 2015, it would need to be pretty close to the end of development by now, if not out already and the technology driving it should be a known one. Sure, things like game consoles rapidly penetrate markets these days - but proper saturation still takes time and, usually, a low price point. Game consoles aren't particularly expensive to make and those which are are usually loss leading - not an option for a standalone product. A low price point generally implies that the technology driving the product isn't cutting edge. Furthermore, there's nothing in the film to say that the product is new or particularly special.

I think the reason this portrayal of strong atheists exists is because it's meant to mirror the position of most theists who know beyond a shadow of a doubt, through faith, that God exists.

Basically, the theists want to say ""you are just as crazy and illogical as me and have to use faith"" and agnostics want to say ""you are just as crazy and illogical as theists and have to use faith."" I've heard this argument used many a time.

When in reality, it just take the application of logic, history, and science to prove with reasonable certainty that almost every version of any god is false.","1309481762"

If people were 'born' with a certain gender expression, they wouldn't go through different phases and the way they perform their gender wouldn't evolve as they got older.  But it does.  If sexual orientation was based on gender, people would be attracted to the gender presented rather than the anatomical sex of their partner, and while there are those for whom it doesn't matter, for most their sexual orientation dictates the *sex* of their partner far more specifically than it dictates their gender presentation.","1309481764"

That can reduce the cost of instruction, but the reality is there are very real costs attached to operating aircraft, so there's only so much that can be done there.

The root of the issue lies with unrestrained democracy (or dictatorship).  So long as certain fundamental rights are necessarily protected by the government (life, liberty, property) it doesn't really matter if a bunch of people have crappy opinions.  Like, in a free market of ideas, the best ideas will win out over a long enough period of time, so long as the market remains free and open.

For example, let's say that in Germany 85% of people hated Jews, but their government structure didn't allow them to restrict the rights of other human beings in any way whatsoever (including omitting the equal protection of laws from that group).  What's the harm?  A bunch of people walk around acting like idiots to other people?  Who cares, so long as that behavior doesn't border on harassment (a crime).","1309481784"

This we can both agree on. 

&gt;You label my choice as archaic, and accuse me of upholding a status quo that harms other women.

Not contributing to change != harm

&gt;&gt;Yet my decision has nothing to do with the ""belief structure and lifestyle"" that you refer to, never mind that it has no direct effect on anyone else.

So I guess you either hated your name or you just did it because it was convenient. Whatever, I don't really care. It doesn't actually effect me so it doesn't matter. However, that doesn't mean my opinion will change. And since I'm getting married in two months, it *is* a topic that is relevant to my interests. 

Thankfully, I have a wonderful man who suggested a more egalitarian option before I even hat the opportunity to suggest it myself. 

The thing is, this isn't really about you or the decisions you made. This is about the reactions my fiance and I, both grown adults capable of making our own decisions, receive when some people find out that not only will I not be taking his name, but he will be changing his own name as well. It's fucking ridiculous and it pisses me off. 

&gt;As a side note - you don't need to be an atheist to be liberal or embrace equality.

Nope. But there are a lot fewer conflicts of interest if you don't believe in any of the major religions- all of which are systematically sexist. Yes, even Buddhism has some sexist practices, though they pale in comparison to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.

For the cost of mining even one ton of minerals from space you could blow the top off 50 mountain ranges and get 100,000 times that amount right here on earth.

Terraforming does not work without a rock solid way to convert mass to energy.  Given that our nuclear power plants still blow up right here on earth I doubt we'll be ready, in any kind of reasonable timeframe, to put them on Mars.

The stepping stone argument is appealing in a sci-fi way.

None of these are actual *economic* reasons to explore space.  I assume a publication called *the Economist* is making the argument that, on balance, you can't make a case for space based purely on economics.

Kroot and hounds are great outflankers, but the hounds are too expensive to buy new in my opinion.

When buying tanks, the Sky Ray kit includes the bits for the Hammerhead, so you get more plastic for your money that way.

Modularize your Crisis suits, with magnets or pins or whatever, it will save you so much hassle if you ever change your loadouts.

So his destination is the wall and that gets interrupted.  Quite a bit later we see him at the Citadel.  To me that says his target at the Wall is no longer there.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","1. Comfort, relaxation, arousal, lubrication and foreplay are essential ingredients. Sometimes even with all these right, a woman can have sexual pain and that needs to be checked out by a doctor. There are [so many different causes of sexual pain](http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Dyspareunia.htm) and that's why it is quite common. But sexual pain is highly treatable, so there is no reason to just put up with it. It can also be a symptom of a serious condition too, which is why investigation is always wise. The reason you see sexual pain so frequently here is that people without problems don't post as much. People mainly come to sexxit for help and advice (or to provide it).

2. Take your time enjoying other acts over many sessions before trying intercourse. Get good at giving her pleasure and orgasms with your hands and mouth. Work her up slowly to penetration - by using one finger over some sessions, then two fingers. This lets you learn what the inside of her body is like too, and the angle of her vagina, so you have more of an idea about how best to angle your penis when you are both ready for intercourse. Most hymens are very stretchy and accommodating, and most won't cause pain if stretched slowly over time.

If at any time it hurts, stop. Having sexual pain over and over can cause worse physical problems and can cause an aversion to any sexual activities. 

Intercourse is physically impossible for my husband and I due to my muscle dysfunction. I have been to doctors, got a diagnosis and am going through treatment with a pelvic floor physiotherapist. I am doing an hour of physiotherapy homework a day to improve it and eventually we'll get there. In the mean time, we enjoy giving each other orgasms with our hands, mouths, sex toys and by rubbing other body parts together. There are so many ways to enjoy intimacy, so there is no rush for one specific act. Because we already knew how to pleasure each other, it wasn't a big deal when one sex act was off the table.","1309481871"

"guns","t5_2qhc8","I'm inclined to agree with you. Hollow point design always seems to be a matter of balancing expansion with penetration - the .455 Manstoppers seem to represent the far end on the expansion axis.

I'd love to see how these perform in gelatin. I've got a squashed MkII bullet (I hit a brick with it!) which flattened out to 1.25"" across. I wonder how far these would open up. The reports from colonial forces that used these spoke very favorably of their effectiveness - but any kind of expanding bullet would be more effective than a lead round nose. [Here's a photo](http://i.imgur.com/l4c2x.jpg) of a couple flattened .455's. On the left is a jacketed MkVI bullet, the right is a soft lead MkII bullet - bear in mind both of these struck bricks - just curiosity on my part.

I suspect we may have seen more hollow points of similar design to the old Manstoppers - but most of the self defense ammunition is development for automatics. Jacketed bullets and tapered profiles are certainly a boon to reliable feeding. Still, if there was something magical about these old designs I think similar bullets would be strong sellers today.","1309481896"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Oh no! Kansas is tightening up health and safety regulations on abortion clinics! This rare move has only been done to... every other medical facility in the entire freaking country.

Hospitals and clinics are under extreme health and safety regulations (for obvious reasons). Yet abortion clinics have been able to escape most of these regulation and inspection laws. Why? Because of the controversial nature of abortion. If any politician tries to add more health inspections or regulations to abortion clinics, well then, by golly, he's an ignorant pro-lifer on a crusade to end abortion!

There's a difference between properly regulating abortion clinics and trying to shut them down. Oftentimes, abortion clinics are unbelievably lax in their cleanliness standards (see [Kermit Gosnell's House of Horrors](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41154527/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/house-horrors-alleged-abortion-clinic/) scandal, for instance).

The fact that all but one abortion clinic isn't able to meet these state health inspection standards is a pretty good indication that the clinics have been getting away with a lot in the health and safety department for quite some time.

TL;DR: This isn't an anti-abortion crusade. This is government trying to ensure that abortion clinics meet the same types of health and safety standards that hospitals and other medical clinics meet, something that isn't often done for abortion clinics, but should be.","1309481899"

"photography","t5_2qh2a","I would skip it. One of the OM system's most outstanding features is its compactness and you will spoil this with a lens weighing almost one and a half pounds.

Mind you, the photos I've seen that were taken with this indicate that it's in fact a decent lens as one would indeed expect from a Zuiko OM lens. But it was a budget lens back then already so don't expect exceptional performance. The question is ultimately if you need a lens that goes all the way up to 200mm but which is quite slow. 

Just like Pentax cameras of those days, you really want to couple your OM-1n with a prime lens. Zuiko primes are compact (most of them come with a 49mm filter thread) and optically outstanding. I like the 100mm f/2.8 which is more expensive but also 2 2/3 stops faster, considerably less bulky and less than half the weight. 

If you need something longer, you can later add the 135mm f/3.5 or maybe the 200mm f/4. The 135mm can be had for around $50 or less and with a little bit of luck you can get its faster sister, the 135mm f/2.8 for under $100. There is no bad 135mm lens in any make, but the Zuiko 135mm f/2.8 is maybe the best of them all. Oddly enough, it's not all that sought after.","1309481906"

I still love her *now*, and I'd still love her if she weren't physically capable of having sex. I know *my* answer, and I think it could apply to OP as well. Here goes.

Sex and intimacy in a marriage are two different things, *usually* the need for both is met by what we can call ""lovemaking."" I have a physical need to have an orgasm every so often, and I have an *emotional* need to feel desired, to be intimate with my wife, to know that she is as physically turned on by me as I am by her.

I'm in the military and I'm deployed *right now.* I get horny at least once every day, and taking care of it can be...awkward, there's not a lot of privacy over here, and any...material I brought with me is getting stale, and I haven't been here that long. I'm horny a lot, but I *know* that my wife isn't here, so when I am horny and unable to release, I know she's not rejecting me. I know that I can't be intimate right now, so that need is sort of *suspended.* Kind of like when I was single. That *emotional* need is largely driven by my mental desires and knowledge. This is why a marriage where one partner *can't* have good sex is so different from one where one partner *won't* have good sex. That hypothetical situation would be terrible, no doubt. But to compare a biological ""vagina failure"" or something like that to a perpetual lack of willingness to put any effort into satisfying your partner is a terrible analogy.

The fact is, she is *able* to have sex, she's just not putting the effort into having a good sex life that he is.","1309481932"

One way I've dealt with this is having the small, otherworldly man act as a proctor, teaching him somewhat about how the book works. Little by little he's able to decipher a page, until he unlocks the incantation.

It sounds like they are trying to call you contractors instead of employees, which lots of California companies have tried to do, but usually they get stung because there are very specific rules from the IRS.

If yes, you should be paid as an employee and receive minimum wage and have taxes withheld (with your employer then paying those taxes to the state and feds).

If you complain, you'll probably be fired (which is also probably illegal, but they are already enganged in illegal activities), so you better have another job lined up.

As esmereldaskysurfer says, the lamictal/lithium combination is a very useful treatment tool as well.  She just can't expect it to be a miracle cure and patience is a must.

It is, in fact, extremely difficult to become legal. You followed that up by saying since you were born here, you don't give a damn about how hard it is.

This exposes the reasons you gave for disliking illegals as simply a vapid reason that you either don't actually believe, or just don't care about how ignorant you are. Given that you shouldn't maintain your view with new knowledge, but are instead holding onto your hate just because, it looks like the real reason is that you are racist. It looks like you've got some cognitive dissonance between your belief that you aren't racist, with your beliefs which are, in fact, racist.

That is to say, you know racism is ""wrong,"" so you are trying to justify your racism with some legitimate reason to dislike the illegal immigrants. The problem is, you haven't actually provides any valid reason to justify your dislike, and your attitude completely betrays your true feelings because even when you are wrong, you still say ""I don't give a damn,"" and continue hating.","1309481958"

The odds of drawing into a reanimator before you dredge 6, and the odds of drawing into it after (without knowing what was dredged) is exactly equal. i.e. there's no need to deal with it, it's virtually all upside, because cards are more useful in your graveyard vs. in your library, i.e. Dread Return.

If you must, add green to the mix for Regrowth, but I don't think that's a worthwhile addition to your deck. To get back to the point: The risk of dredge is 0. The odds that you flush a bunch of reanimation is exactly as likely that you flush a bunch of crappy land, i.e. the expected value of the 'draw distance' to the next reanimator spell is equal between dredging and not dredging, omitting the lost draw from the dredge itself. And with dredging a Dread Return effectively counting as drawing into a reanimator spell, the EV actually goes down (which is good).

I am sure that heroin is a terrible drug, and the addiction is very difficult to quit.  However, the fact is that it is much easier to *BECOME* addicted to smoking cigarettes than injecting heroin.  This says nothing about how hard either of them are to quit, or how intense the addiction is once started. 

Additional, the distinction between psychological and chemical addiction is completely beside the point, which if you actually *listened to the interview*, you would know by now.  Moreover, they also gave some strong supporting evidence that the mechanism for both heroin and nicotine addiction is *exactly the same* (based on studies and brain scans).

You complain that women don't see you as a person. I would argue that you spent this entire post generalizing the attributes of the female gender. 

I'm not shocked that you haven't found somebody who is interested in you. Your rant only serves to demonstrate that you are as narcissistic and self-important as any of the ""bastards"" you claim to lose women to.

As a woman who is the primary bread-winner in her family and is happily married, I invite you to take a deep hard look at yourself and the generalizations you are making about the female gender.

Nah, that's just comics. Comics are a huge part of Japanese culture, everyone reads them, kids and adults alike. It's just that there can be some sex scenes depending on the series, and girls in those comics tend to have huge boobs.


&gt;They seem to have a thing for all sorts of fetishes and even incest.

You can say that for the US too, or UK, or India, or any culture for that matter. I don't know how you determined that you've gathered enough data to make that judgement, but do you live in Japan? Have you ever lived in that culture? If not, how can you say everyone has fetishes? Should I ask my Japanese friends ""Hey, where's that DVD with the girl-uncle-dog threesome, I know you all have it""?

Plenty of incest/bestiality/rape etc porn exist outside Japan. Yes it's true that Japan produces mass amount of child porn, but that doesn't mean everyone is a pedophile. Don't make your judgement on solely what you've been exposed to. If people did that, Japanese people would say McDonalds, fat people, sexy strippers and loud obnoxious men are all there is to America.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There's no real precedent for it. People seem to join social networks because their friends are there, which is a bit of paradox since how do you get people to join when they join because people are already there? The answer is that successfully social networks seem to need to grow almost in a snowball fashion, one small group joins as early adopters (let's say, friends of a college student), then that's enough that larger group joins (Harvard students), then a larger group (Ivy students) and a larger group (4-year college students), etc. until your mom is on the network because half the people she knows are. This snowballing userbase describes MySpace, LJ and even Geocities (and their declines too)... it seems to be the way social networking communities work.

So, since people join not because of how good the site is but because how many of their friends are there, it's hard to grow one overnight. Everyone who's tried has failed. Good luck to Google but they've tried and failed before.","1309481991"

Fukushima is evidence of what centralized power schemes can destroy. We need decentralized, local, community-controlled energy sources, not big coal, nuclear, or petroleum power.

Most of all, we need to stop wasting energy and reverse our individual demand for more and more energy as the control of that energy becomes concentrated into ever fewer hands. It's time to reduce demand for energy and regain local control over the energy we  do use.","1309481998"

*Another uncle who was accused of sexually molesting his kids(which was uncovered as unfounded) during a custody dispute. His wife is certifiable but he only gets half custody.

*A friend who was also accused of sexually molesting his kids during a custody dispute (which was uncovered as unfounded). He only got the usual wednesdays nights and every other weekend. 

*A cousin whose ex-wife is violently abusive (her daughter broke her arm twice under 'suspicious circumstances'--falling off a three foot deck twice. Same daughter the mother titles a 'useless waste of space' in public) got a restraining order out on him for a period of time he wasn't in the country. 

*Several vague acquaintances who are facing financial ruin and never(or nearly never) seeing their kids due to divorce.

*Another friend who dated a woman who would abused him emotionally and pressured him into sexual stuff he didn't want to do.

*An acquaintance that was raped by a teacher. Another acquaintance that was raped by a woman while unconscious. Another who was raped by female relatives. Another who was raped because his rapist threatened him with 'you say no and I'll tell the cops you raped *me*.'

*And then there's my husband. One abusive ex who brandished a knife at him; one attempted gang rape by a bunch of women; sexual abuse by his (female) ex-boss.

*And as for myself? I could write a fucking book on all the nasty shit I've pulled (and gotten away with for being female--although I'd argue that I never really 'got away with it', getting your worst instincts rewarded never helped anyone.)

Anyway, I have more, but that's just off the top of my head. 

&gt;Now count up the number of ""human"" things females have done around you.

And, no, this aren't ""human"" things these women are doing (and I should include my former self in that as well), they are violent, directly or by proxy, monsterous, abusive things.

Other than the pure physical attraction to a young girl's body, I will never understand why older men go for such younger girls to have actual relationships with. It sounds like you're more of her sugar daddy than anything else (although I could obviously be mistaken). I'd really appreciate it if you could explain the non-physical attraction to me. If she didn't do well in school and wants to be a stripper and is all about money, I honestly don't see what non-physical/sexual traits she can have that really 'stimulate' you. I have a feeling this is coming off more judgmental than I mean, but this is simply an issue that I've never been able to understand. ","1309482092"
"Physics","t5_2qhi6","There are in fact ways to approach a problem though. That is given a complex problem, how to set constraints on the problem, breaking it down into identifiable simplified objects and then devising a solution.  These approaches can be applied to any problem.

For example, for my thesis I was asked to research a way to implement industrial ethernet into an already established Ethernet network. Previously, companies would roll out another network with IE protocols to provide Guarenteed QoS.

At the time I had no background in IE, so I first researched what IE was and what QoS features it provided. I then researched QoS in Ethernet environment to identify the delay,jitter, out of sync properties. I then researched the areas of an Ethernet network that affect these QoS aspects. I identified the layer and protocols in problem and then figured out a solution.

Its this figuring out the solution part or 'figuring out the math/physics/ part' that i was writing about before. I don't know of any fast way to achieve this. But there are better ways to approach it.

'How to prove it' and 'how to solve it' are good at explaining how to attempt this from more of a mathematical perspective. However, you are an engineer. You may be wanting to look at the bigger picture of a project. There is in fact areas of system/software engineering which teach you how to identify stakeholder, risks, objectives, scope of a project, then do requirement analysis, functional design, work packages, costing and timing of the project, EVMS etc  This may be beyond what you were hoping to achieve though.

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","**Overrated**: BJ Upton

I hate to say it; Upton has been having a great season, but he was advertised as a great 5-tool player, and his power has been lacking throughout last year and the beginning of this year (though he's had 4 this past two weeks, so that's good to see).  He's always been quite streaking with hits, and he's also known to lack effort defensively, allowing hits when he could have put in some extra hustle and made the catch.  However, he's been great to the organization, and not a lot of players have remained for such a long time; however, out of all the everyday starters (and there aren't a lot of them), he's the weakest.  

**Underrated**: Ben Zobrist

He's been quietly putting up great numbers throughout the years, but I dont think people realize how critical he is to the Rays gameplan.  The guy can play every position (except pitcher and maybe catcher, but I'm sure he could play this); this gives great flexibility when trying to formulate a lineup before the game, and changes to the lineup later on in games (ie. pinch-running or extra power if the Rays are behind in games).  Not many people can play so many positions and not sacrifice their great defense.  If the Rays hang onto one player as his salary increases, it'd be Zorilla; he is the player who personifies the Rays' philosophy the closest.","1309482098"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","It's in line with the parable of the unfaithful servant and other passages. We can't expect forgiveness from God if we don't forgive our brothers. This is also seen in the practices of the early Church, in which the sign of peace always preceded communion. This was done because you cannot fully come before God and commune with him without being right with your brothers and sisters. If we bring judgement on our brothers we too will be subject to judgment. Likewise if we forgive, we will be forgiven. It's not an easy policy, but God's forgiveness, while infinite, is not wasted on those who have no intention to truly reconcile with him; and to reconcile with your brother IS to reconcile with God (Matt 25:40). Reconciliation, both with man and with God, takes precedence even over worship. Jesus says (Matt 5):

&gt; But I say to you, that whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment. And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca [to spit upon], shall be in danger of the council. And whosoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. **If therefore you offer your gift at the altar, and there you remember that your brother has anything against you; leave there your offering before the altar, and go first to be reconciled to your brother, and then coming you shall offer your gift.** Be at agreement with your adversary betimes, whilst you are in the way with him: lest perhaps the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison. Amen I say to you, you shall not go out from thence till you repay the last farthing.","1309482133"

Beyond that, however, we'll have to agree to disagree.

There are some writers (ie. William Styron who wrote some of the most influential novels of the last century) who maintain there is no connection between ""journaling"" and ""creative fiction writing."" I make a living as a professional writer, but the writing I do isn't fiction and, while I use some of the same skills (typing? forming sentences?), I am hardly exercising the muscles that make great writers of fiction great.

I, on the other hand, have been suffering with physical and mental ailments for years without care. I'm not mad at you, I'm mad that you're aghast that some people think that health care is a RIGHT, not a privilege. Both issues are tremendously important, but I'm talking about things that are happening to millions of Americans EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY. People are fucking dying on our streets, dying because of political positioning. I find that to be ridiculously important. 

Now, if you want to say that I have no knowledge of the wars we are waging, I would refer you to the person that I was with on 9/11 who has served 2 tours in the Army, who now has permanent brain damage from bombs going off near him repeatedly or maybe one of the other several people, friends and family, in or directly affected by the wars. I have extensively discussed both subjects with many people well-versed on the subjects, and while all might not agree with me, they all see my point.

Your commentary has little merit and is, frankly, ridiculous. How dare you tell people what to care about? I watched my ex-father in law die before my very eyes of cancer and everything his widow had get taken in bits and pieces to pay for his ridiculous medical bills. He died in the space of 4 months and that's all it took to have his entire life, and that of his widow, wasted away in medical bills. How in the fuck is that not important? You answer me that and I might be able to see the tiniest bit of reason in your argument. As it stands, I see none.

This shouldn't be an A or B thing, bottom line. This all needs to end. America is a fucking mess and it's all our fault.

Of your squadmates, only 3 had any connection to interesting things in the Mass Effect universe; Tali, Mordin, and Legion.  Really, the entire game should have been about these three stories; and the Collectors significantly reduced or just eliminated; they serve the same function as the Geth, but were less interesting and completely unestablished.  If they wanted to do a smaller scale story about building the ME universe, the Reapers should not have been involved at all, just an ever-present looming threat (that everyone acknowledges and there's no dumb character backtracking).

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","I am going through this for a second time and I would say count on about $7,500 if you plan on having some legal help. Which I highly recommend. That is for a US patent. 


That being said, a lot of these costs don't have to be paid up-front. Meaning, you can start out by filing a provisional patent as a small business entity yourself. Which will give you decent protection as long as you file within a year for a full patent. During this year you can really start gauging whether your idea is worth sinking all this money into. It also gives you time to start have a patent search done. Do not skip this step, it can save you a lot of grief later. Then together with a patent attorney have a patent application drafted.
Assuming that your market's reaction to your idea is positive. If not, reconsider. Not every good idea is a marketable idea and it might not be worth your while patenting it. On the other hand, having your name on a patent is pretty cool. But still not cool enough just to sink in the money without a reasonable expectation of some decent roi of the time, money and heartache you will spend.","1309482142"

I don't recall that being said. In most developed and modern countries, a quick way is lower taxes and less crony legislation, yes, but there's more to it. As far as a market/planned economy goes, compare Russia and Hong Kong.

&gt;Read through externalities, imperfect markets, information inequalities, and the Coase theorem. 

None of this changes basic microeconomomic principles. Your issue seems to be with the perfect competition ideal and how costs of production are measured.

&gt;I disagree that by definition it is a bad idea.

Risk aversion makes for sounder investments and longterm savings that lead to more valuable future investments.

&gt;Part of the role of government is to mediate potential economic issues.

Economic issues that stem from government market manipulation. We don't even have to disagree on whether or not intervention is warranted, merely that we tried it and wound up doing the opposite, so better to wipe the slate clean of the additional government failures.

"masseffect","t5_2rc19","But when I think about it further, I'm not really sure what Bioware really could have done to improve the story.  It feels like they wanted to introduce certain characters, races, concepts, relationships, etc, but in that could not find a good central villain for the second act.  If you think about, what are your options for villains in ME2 anyway, that have already been introduced?

Reapers - Mass Effect 3 is the game with the invasion, while ME2 sets up for the invasion, introduces a lot of subplots that will become important in the following game.  In that context, the Reapers cannot arrive in the second game without dramatically changing the planned story line.  Remember, Sovereign's duty was to be the Reaper that monitored the galaxy, to signal the Keepers to open the Citadel.  This is a job only one Reaper should be needed for.  While most of what we know about Sovereign's duty comes from Prothean hypothesis via Vigil, they are sound assumptions.  There would be no reason to leave more than one Reaper behind, as only one is needed to activate the Citadel.  Having another Reaper (and only one Reaper and not all of them) be the main antagonist would feel silly.

Geth: It's an option, having the heretics essentially doing the same crap the Collectors were doing with the colonists.  However, Bioware is trying to set up the fact that ultimately, the Geth are not a villainous race.  Having them be the primary enemies two games in a row would undermine that.

The Shadow Broker: This is the only other viable option.  You could probably come up with some fun scenarios involving him working the Reapers.  It's established that Sovereign has probably been working on his plans for hundreds of years, it's entirely possible that the Shadow Broker(s) have been working behind the scenes with Sovereign on whatever.  You could probably still keep the colonist abduction plot if you really wanted to, replacing Collectors with Broker mercs, Reaper tech, and a central villain.  The issue I can see in this approach is making the Broker not seem like a Saren clone (agent of the Reapers, probably quite indoctrinated, probably thinks what he's doing is the only way, etc), and Liara's subplot's conclusion, if you still want to do that.","1309482147"

Activision as investors may have screwed the project over but again if the game gets post dated critical acclaim like Psychonauts or Beyond Good and Evil that still looks good to the individuals who decided to invest in these games. There is even the chance that Activision will see an increase in a somewhat expermental game and think hey wouldn't it be great if we could make a game that would have appeal lasting several years in a game and hire the same heads or similiar to create another game. In fairness I'm prepared to pay around 10 euro for the game and if it doesn't go under that I maydo without the game (other games to play) but a lot of work went into it and the better recognition the people who worked oin the game get, the better chance that people will be willing to take risks on the same people making another game.

They'll make you try on a dozen shoes, and go outSIDE the store to run for a bit to see how things feel for *you*. 

Often these stores have a 30 day return policy. No matter how many miles you put on the shoe, they'll do you right. They want your business, and they want the shoe to be right. If you don't know what you are looking for, go to a running shoe store.

Their prices might not be the best ever. They thrive on service. It's entirely possible to get fitted for a great shoe, then go online and find a thrift price for it. But go get fitted first... and consider paying a bit for the personal service. It'll be worth it in the long run.","1309482189"

"alaska","t5_2qhft","Moved up here from California in 2006 with my SO at the time. Moving costs were kinda okay, only because he had some shipping discount with FedEx. But what I would recommend? Get rid of all your shit. Sell it. Or at least, sell as much as you can of replaceable items. It's easier and less stressful, and it also poses a great opportunity for you to get rid of a lot of unnecessary crap. I think we spent $1400 shipping our shit up here. Five-and-a-half years later, I have gotten rid of a lot of the stuff I brought up. 

Housing -- depends. I would really, really, really, really recommend **not** renting from any Weidner-managed property. I would instead seek out short-term leases with another company, so that you can settle down, and then drive around town and find a more permanent place to live. I would look for duplexes or roomshares on Craigslist before doing any sort of apartment. Avoid Fairview and Mountain View, or pretty much anything in the NE quadrant of the city. Also think of where your job is -- if you have a really good deal for housing on the southside, consider what driving costs will entail.

Your SO will probably find a job easily. Maybe not right away, but we are not really hit hard recession-wise when it comes to jobs. There are a bunch of construction companies in Anchorage. He can also search at [UAK Jobs](http://www.uakjobs.com) for university-related jobs (which are pretty freakin' posh). [Here](http://www.muni.org/Departments/employee_relations/Pages/jol.aspx) is the municipality job site.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Actually, going to university is a pretty narrow view of what a professional should be. I realize you are just hung up on the terminology used, so check out this [wikipedia article on professionals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional).

I think the term is used much more loosely than you realize. There is no university class for becoming an organizer, but I have studied and trained in courses that are sanctioned by what is clearly becoming our governing body.

Anyhow, I don't think you realize that that the term ""Professional"" is part of the separation I am making between anyone who simply ""organizes"" and those who are members, who have taken the appropriate classes, who follow a moral and ethical code in the business, so on and so forth. It takes *time* to develop the proper education and certifications, to offer regulations and legitimize a new trade, but we are reaching that point. This trade is borne out of the (relatively) recent situation of first world problems like a glut of credit and rampant consumerism, and we're just now beginning to find ways to handle the over-saturation of stuff. I didn't create the term ""Professional Organizer"", but that is exactly what it is.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Congress already authorized the spending that is going on, so invoking the 14th Amendment does not trample Congress' power of the purse, it simply allows the Executive to continue implementing Congress' previously approved appropriations.

The 14th Amendment's wording also covers the issuance of new debt to cover liabilities, when it states ""including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion,"" which makes it clear that the amendment's writers accepted that future liabilities were included.

IMHO, if Obama is going to use this route, then he has to go all the way, and hammer the conservative myths that lower taxes = more jobs (empirically proven untrue), that austerity will improve the economy (look at the UK and Ireland), or that we can balance the budget solely by reforming our social services (wrong by two orders of magnitude or so).

"beijing","t5_2s0m4","Finding a place to live in Beijing can be much much mafan.
It all depends how and especially where you want to live. With 4000 RMB you can get a reasonable nice place. Can you give us some more details? How do you want to live (alone or shared? highrise? what other stuff do you need?) and where (or where your work is)?

A good place to start is the beijinger classified 
http://www.thebeijinger.com/classifieds
Pick housing on the left, you can set the price-range but the neighborhoods is more useful. If you are not sure which neighborhood is closest to yours slam the names into google maps to get a general idea. A lot of ads on the beijinger are done by agents/agencys. It is kind of hard to get into direct contact with landlords. This is a shame because you cannot trust Agents or an Agency. Really, you CANNOT. If you deal with them prepare to get ripped off and prepare to only be able to sign a year-long contract (which you can only get out by letting go of the deposit (usually a full month rent) - do not listen to what the agents tell you, even if you find somebody who will rent the place in 99% of the cases you won't be able to get out of the contract. Most agents/agencies tell that you can if you find somebody but I visited 3-4 places I was interested in a short while ago and the previous tenant wasn't able to get ouf the contract despite finding somebody who wants to overtake (me) - they tell you its possible so that you sign the contract but it isn't!). Don't think if you pay more (go to the bigger agencies) you get better service/more security - this is not the case.

Last time I had to deal with this (not so long ago but thank god its over) I booked a hotel near my work and lived there for some time to check out lots of flats/options on the Beijinger/other sites to see whats up. It is very annoying as you will constantly spend your little freetime to go visit total dumps (either due to stupid agents or due to weird foreigners).

With 4000 RMB you can get a nice place, but it gonna take some time (but this seems to be true for all places).","1309482211"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","You are welcome to your opinion, but I rather enjoy the universe of *Halo*. I find it to be fun ""popcorn"" military fiction that (while of lower quality) I can delve into after burning through Heinlein, Robert Scalzi, and Lois McMaster Bujold.

The games are, interestingly enough, the *weakest* part of the *Halo* mythology. They go too deeply into the inner politics of the Covenant (which should have remained more a arm's reach in terms of what we knew about them) and they don't really flesh out the human faction, with the gameplay seeming too simplistic to really make you feel like a multi-million dollar super-soldier. Additionally much of the *Halo* canon is contradictory and older fiction routinely gets over run by the new stuff.

That said: The books by Eric Nuland are fun. I like the bleak war it paints, and the infighting within military R&amp;D which produced the Spartan soldiers. 

And you can't tell me that these videos aren't cool:

They suddenly felt they ""had"" to tell me because my child needed to know his family history. One day, your daughter will need to know the same information and it will come back to haunt you if you make the responsible choice and tell her for the sake of HER children.

Honesty is the best policy. When I got the paternity test to have scientific proof, my dad never stopped being my dad. He simply stopped being my father.

1) They sound f***ing incredible.  Arguably even better than on record.  And by God, it's the LOUDEST thing I've ever heard.

2) They play for roughly an hour and a half.  They may play longer now for all I know but all three times I saw them it was about that long.

3) They do not talk or address the audience at all during the shows.  They all bow when they first come on stage and once again before they leave.  Otherwise there is not banter between songs at all.  It's a little weird, but also mesmerizing.

4) The last time I saw them was before ""Hymn to Immortal Wind"" came out and they took equally from ""Walking Red Cloud"" and ""You Are There"" as well as ""Com?"" from ""One Step More And You Die""

As such I would prefer to refrain from contributing to the basic pain that comes with consuming a perceptive organism because it is possible for me to do so, and to be healthy in the process.

Having said that, my girlfriend is an omnivore, and it doesn't bother me. In fact, she (like many people) suffers from a minor condition (in her case hypothyroidism) in which a vegan diet would probably be detrimental to her health. Additionally we just had a daughter, and I have no intention of raising her on a vegan diet. If she wants to pursue one of her own volition I may consider it as an option, after thoroughly discussing the matter (and monitoring its stages) with a pediatrician, otherwise we'll raise her as an omnivore and allow her to make choices for herself when she lives on her own. I imagine it would be difficult for her when visiting friends or going to dinner events anyhow, and that's not a social burden I wish to *force* on her (or anyone else, for that matter).","1309482271"

When we consider the current administrators of education, they were raised in a period without anything close to our levels of technology, and as such they do not see the value in it.  

There is a strong historical list of cases in the purely scientific community, which you would think to be more free from the bias of opinion, where ideas would only shift when the original proponent died.  Consider the argument of AC and DC power for example.

When looking at the education system then, children going through the university system now will be more inclined to see the value in technology, having grown up with, and being more familiar with it.  They are also in a better position to see the absurdities in the current education model as it directly affects them.  For example, as a professor, you may set a poor test, in which case the impact is strongest on your students, and not on yourself.
Here current students will be it easier to see the real in technology over their current mentors.

"skeptic","t5_2qj8f","that choice is the illusion, you think you can choose the left or right path, but you cant.  you went left, or you went right.  if you went left, you didnt go right -- and if a higher dimensional alien knew this (by seeing your whole life as an instantaneous ""worm"" like object with you as a zygote on one end and a rotting corps on the other) then you were always going to ""choose"" left, because to that alien you've ALREADY chosen left.  

think of it like this, imagine a choice you made yesterday and ask yourself if you'd of made a different choice in the same circumstances at the same time with the same information.. but you're you, of all the variables in your life that make you you, that you would ALWAYS make the same choice given the same circumstances and information, otherwise you wouldnt be you.. even if ""you"" is someone spontaneous and unpredictable, then you'll choose to be unpredictable -- but ""unpredictable"" is an illusion when someone's already seen your future.

anyway, this is a bit rambly, i was more succinct in my previous comment.  but trust me, if you live in a deterministic universe that an observer can see your timeline from start to finish, then you have no choice to go right, because you've already gone left.  your future is that aliens past/present/future simultaneously.  if you have a cousin that wrecked his car last week, he doesnt have the CHOICE to NOT have wrecked his car last week. so it follows that if this outside observer has already seen you go left, then there was never a situation with the necessary circumstance for you to ever ""choose"" right.  

ok , i think i've said the same thing in 8 different ways now. :)

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","TL;DR Teacher (in Catholic school, so it's cool) taught a section on being anti-death penalty.  I'm pro, and it cost me a borderline passing grade on a test I should have aced (Not bitching, but it's true for technical reasons).

Not me per se, but an opinion I had and expressed.

Went to Catholic school, and a teacher in Christian Lifestyles had a section on the death penalty.  I support the death penalty.  The two week section started with a debate, in which I spoke for the death penalty, using facts to support it.  The rest was her teaching an anti-death penalty course, and presenting anti-dp (sorry for the double entendre) facts.  I had no real problem with this, since it was Catholic school.

Test times rolls around.  I got it back with a 65 (minimal passing score).  I look closer at it, and realized I aced the objective part of the test.  However, the essay was ""Explain your position and how it has changed using facts presented in class"".  As she had presented no facts pro-dp, I used facts I had presented in the debate/class.  She gave me 0 for the essay, claiming I had presented no facts from class to support the argument.

I did argue with her about it.  Her justification for not changing was I had presented no facts.  When I told her I had, she said the facts I introduced didn't count.  When I told her I couldn't present facts she had taught (there were none),  she switched to ""well you should have said in spite of (anti-dp fact), I still think"".  I told her this was stupid (in more polite terms, the discussion was zealous, but very cordial).  She agreed, but said I should have brought this up during the exam.  On this point, I conceded.

Side note:  She held no personal grudge against me, and I hold none to her.  I think this was bs, but other than this she was fair (albeit crappy) teacher.  I also had a fair amount of knowledge having debated this in high school twice before.  ","1309482292"

The four accepted a ride from Freeman when they could not reach a cab company at closing time at the Red Dog Saloon on Colley Avenue in July, 2009. According to testimony, the four thought Freeman was sober, but a hospital blood test after the crash showed he was **among the most intoxicated.** A toxicologist said his blood-alcohol concentration was **at least 0.10**, over the state's legal limit of 0.08.""

That's DIRECTLY FROM THE FUCKING ARTICLE!  Get out of here with your shit, learn to fucking read before you try and douche your way through an argument.

BTW: Average response time to an accident scene is about 8 minutes, average time getting someone from the wreckage, into an ambulance, and away from the scene is upwards of 30 minutes.  Average time it takes to get to a hospital for an ambulance is upwards of 8 minutes.  Average time it takes to get into the ER from the ambulance and have an attendant get to things like a tox screen (which they do AFTER they make sure you're not in immediate danger and tend to more pressing wounds) is unknown, but when I was in an accident it took 25 minutes from the time I was admitted to the time I had blood drawn.  Average time your metabolism stops for all that? ZERO minutes. in fact in increases due to the amount of adrenaline. So, yes, douche, it is safe to assume he was above a .10 as I said.  It's not conjecture at all, it's solid fucking reasoning (you can look up the exact stats for wherever this accident was, the one I listed are california stats for San Bernardino county).  You lost all credibility at ""fake quotes"" and I see you went on to spout more retarded nonsense.

I suppose in the age of twitter that was a bit of a novel.  For us old fogies, that's just a bit more than a post card :)

[Introduction to Algorithms](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844/) is *the* book for learning everything about algorithms.  You'll learn all the standards; how to analyze them (space/time efficiency, Big-O, Big-Theta); and how to prove them; etc.

If you want to learn a great low-level language, the typical things to learn are assembly and C, but I would highly suggest learning Forth.  There's tons on the web about it, but the seminal book was [Starting Forth](http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Forth-Introduction-Professionals-Prentice-Hall/dp/0138430799).  You get all of the low-level detail of assembly, a bit of scaffolding, and you learn to build your higher level language structures as you need them.  Great fun, and it's turned out to be very useful through the years, even though I never get to use it in production/release.","1309482303"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;Frasier alone ran for 11 years of 24 episodes each year; that's probably as many as from every top-quality British comedy of the past 40 years combined, and Frasier is probably better than any of them.

I'm a big Frasier fan, massive in fact. Frasier is not better than The Thick of IT.

Anyway you are comparing very different types of comedy. Out of the list the British guy gave, only one is a sit-com. Everything you listed was a sitcom. They are not even comparable.

But as I said, in the loop/the thick of it has far more laugh out loud moments for me than frasier, and it's better written. Just my opinion though, and I love Frasier.

&gt;Are you saying that Britain over the past 15 years has made better comedies than Frasier? Friends? Seinfeld? The Simpsons? How I Met Your Mother? Community? 30 Rock? Modern Family? Freaks and Geeks?

I'm not British, and to be fair his list is better than everything you have listed. Community however still has a bit to go.

I consider The Thick Of IT and Brass Eye classics.

Apart from fraiser, I consider nothing you wrote above classic, although I enjoy them all. They are good fun, you watch them and smile. They however do not blow me away.

We worked in the home, providing care, helping them learn social skills, and so on. The kids were all a bit ""off"" socially (sometimes rude, weird, or just goofy) but great kids.

One day, we staff members, the kids, and the children's mother were at a Perkins-like restaurant. The waitress we got figured out that the kids weren't ""normal"", and gave them a look of disgust while standing behind/to the side of the mother. I literally mean contempt. She was extremely cold to everyone at our table, staff, kids, mother, you name it. She never checked up on us, didn't bother with refills unless we flagged her down, and would glance over at our table with a look of disgust on her face. 

I watched her wait on other tables. Friendly, laughing, smiling, all of the stuff you would expect from a server. She treated the disabled kids like garbage.

I tipped her.

But I love to play big team battle, and I don't know how many times the game starts 8 vs 6 because 2 people get booted or leave. Why can't the game automatically even it out to 7 vs 7??? And it's very frequent that partway through a game we're playing 8 vs 5. To me, it is simple and would make the game much more fun if someone automatically switched from red to blue to make it 7 vs 6. Anybody know why this isn't done?

Absolutely wrong. Gender identification is in the brain.

These girls will essentially become transsexual and experience all the pain of being one and spend the rest of their adult life trying to return to their birth gender. Many will be unable to pass as a female even though they are biologically female so they will become social outcasts.

Our new manager removed it from the blacklist, and to this day our female delivery drivers won't deliver there.

Illiquid Assets are not easily converted to actual money.  These include depreciating assets such as cars and computers.  Many consider artwork, rare coin collecting, etc to be an 'investment'.  However, the difficulty to convert these to cash mostly exclude them from a real investment.

'Savings' is a blanket term for money that you've.... well, saved.  Investing is a form of saving, colloquially meaning has a possibility to depreciate.

Really, any liquid assets like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc that can easily be bought or sold are all good forms of investment.  As long as it's money and it's yours, its savings.","1309482411"

The one thing I'd like to say is that various commenters seem to think that the cure for the higher libido is to more or less just to stop having a higher libido.  It seems hard for people to comprehend that if you like having an active sex life (sex once per day, BJ's, cuddle-time) that transitioning to having less sex (e.g. once per two weeks) is not really a compromise.  Yes, to some degree you can tone down your libido a little bit, but there's a very real corrosive hurt that comes from being constantly rejected for sex.  It's very hard not to take it as a rejection of yourself, and to start thinking maybe it's something you've done wrong.  I've actually fallen into bouts of depression from it.","1309482417"

"business","t5_2qgzg","Agreed.  One of the more attractive attributes of internet commerce is that it often allows the buyer to evade paying any sales tax.  Property tax is the most difficult to evade of any tax.  Also, the primary purpose of the sales tax is to generate revenues.  Sales taxes are regressive, they discourage consumption, they are subject to fraud.  Property taxes on the other hand encourage efficient use of land, and encourages local governments to do whatever they can to maximize property values, which benefits neighborhoods.","1309482431"

Regardless, my dogs are up-to-date on their vaccines, always have plenty of food (hell, I'd feed them before I fed myself if it came down to it). I guess I'm just not used to seeing rescue prices that high. Locally, they run from around $50 - $150.
As I said, I realize they have vet bills and the like, but the average person looking for a dog, who doesn't care where it comes from, is only going to look at the price tag.

Personally, I think I'd feel better rescuing a dog from a kill shelter, knowing that I was saving their life. My only thing is, I'd feel so bad seeing the others there, and I want to rescue all of them.","1309482450"

And he said it sounds worse with certain words than other words.  He said that before the war, 美しいです was used *specifically* in a derogatory way.  He likened it to saying ""That chick is fucking hot"", or at least that's how it might sound to the type of person that doesn't like い-adj + です.  However, in this particular case anyway, this nuance has faded, which is why perhaps old people are more likely to be put off by it than young or even middle-aged people.  ","1309482446"

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","This discussion has been quite interesting for me.  I have direct experience with discovering that my self-concept is simply a 'model' of something real and constantly in flux.  This model is necessarily inaccurate and 'not real', and I saw (quite directly) how my attachment to this model prevents my natural non-thing Self from blooming in its fullest capacity.  On reflection, which took many weeks and actually is still going on, I realized that I 'knew' dukkha (the dissonance between the model which I had believed was real, and the actual reality), and anicca (the real 'me' is a process, ever-changing, and not a static fundamental essence).  And anatta: the 'self' that was present 10 years ago is not the 'self' that was present an hour ago, and is not the 'self' that will die tomorrow or in 50 years.  ""There is no being independent of time; there is only being-time"".  A whole host of other insights and benefits came with this flash.  

So after the initial elation of my very insightful self-discovery wore off, I'm left with this deep disbelief in my 'self', my suffering is substantially reduced, and yet still old patterns of self-ishness and self-consciousness and separateness arise in my experience.  I spent many months forcefully shoving these aside, and it didn't stop them from coming up, it only drove them underground.  So I've taken it upon myself to develop a serious meditation practice, to challenge myself with uncomfortable volunteer work, to strive to be more compassionate to myself and others, and to know my mind and reality as fully as possible in the present moment.  I can see, quite directly, how these banal practices improve my day-to-day experience, and help to detach my oh-so-precious-and-hollow ego one stitch at a time.

Now you come along and demand that we *look*, just *once* that's all it takes man, and we'll be FREE forever.  And you demand, quite rudely I might add, a YES OR NO answer to a simplistic question that I've been considering for years in various forms.  Your question and exposition isn't fresh or insightful for me in any way.  But you got me anyway.  Guess what I'm thinking now?  YES, THERE IS A ME THINKING THOUGHTS.  I'm right here, typing at this keyboard.  You can say I'm wrong all you want, but I looked at it for myself, and from your simplistic point-of-view, if I have to give a yes or no answer, I say YES.  It's not unequivocal, I know that the boundary between myself and others is fuzzy, and I know that the concepts I have of myself are necessarily wrong.  Nevertheless, there does appear to be a watcher, an observer, an aspect of my body and brain that is aware of the elements of my experience, that is not directly aware of the elements of others' experience.

You can play semantic games with the concepts of 'you' and 'self' and every other phrase you insist on parroting from whatever cult website you subscribe to, under the guise of 'helping people', but you're definitely not helping me.  In fact, if there is some deeper form of anatta that I'm really truly missing out on, you've managed to convince me that I'm not going to find it with your method.  If it's as simple as you suggest, I haven't been able to see it, despite genuine prolonged introspection (a.k.a 'just look'ing); or I have already seen it, and know that I've still got a long way to go before acting obnoxious and absolutely cocksure that I've got the one and only answer to Life And Existence and Suffering and Shit.

Based on your attitude, I doubt that I have had any real effect on either you or the OP, so this diatribe is intended for the lurkers among us who might be so unfortunate as to take you seriously, and be taken in by your claims that anyone who 'looks' can 'see' the 'truth' in any single moment.  This may even be 'true' (although I doubt it), but it's irrelevant, since anyone who hasn't seen it doesn't know *how* to 'look' anyway.  So, to anyone who's feeling discouraged by their inability to just be enlightened already, or tempted to abandon their existing slog of a practice in favor of trying to get a quick fix from this 'looking' thing, take heart and go about your business.  There's not much to see here.

Bowden cave in West Virginia has ""the infinity crawl"". It's about a quarter mile long.

And it's not the most miserable cave I've been in. I once surveyed a cave that was maybe 300 feet long, with a no cross sectional dimension greater than 18"" at any point, and never less than 3"" of frigid running water. There was nowhere to turn around. We kept going until our lead tape couldn't fit his head through (His head fits through a 7"" crack. We checked). It took about an hour and a half to back out. 

Hmm. Not going to give the cave name, since googling it pops my name up. Unsurprisingly, not many people have visited this particular cave.

Make sure you are clear on these two concepts:

2. Router - Connect from Modem to multiple computers. If you can get internet from the Modem, but you cannot get internet when your computer is connected to the Router, you either need to reconfigure your router, or replace it. This typically is not done by the ISP unless you get your Router from them.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Huh?  This should be obvious.  A simple thought experiment: imagine you consume 80% carbohydrate, 10% protein, 10% fat and your goal is to gain muscle mass.  

Now, the increase in muscle mass has to do with expanding existing muscle fibers.  That requires energy.  Where does the energy come from?  Food.  And the substrates of what the food breaks down to can be used for increasing the size of our muscle fibers.  Chief among these substrates?  Amino acids.  But where do these come from?  Protein.  And protein is a macro nutrient.  Therefore, if we neglect the macro nutrient protein with the goal of increasing muscle mass we will never attain our goal if we cannot provide sufficient enough amino acids for muscle repair and protein synthesis.

Aiming for a low body fat relative to muscle mass ratio one typically follows a 40C/30P/30F diet or 40% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 30% fat.","1309482494"

"compsci","t5_2qhmr","There are varying views on the books, but I would personally recommend Donald Knuth's classic ""The Art of Computer Programming"" series.  They are very low level, and use an assembly language for a fictional processor for their explanations.  Not much of what you learn in the book will be practically applicable, but if you want to get a handle on how the low level core of higher level software components work, it is good for that.  The book is not as dense as a mathematics textbook, but it is close.  It may not be easy reading your first time through.  

I fully encourage you to learn all along the scale of complexity.  Having an idea of how a computer system is put together, how it accomplishes the things you are doing, is very useful.  And I imagine you will be glad you went for CS instead of software engineering.  Software engineering concentrates a great deal on process and documentation, things which are not difficult to pick up.  Knowing a great deal about software engineering but not much about the technical aspects of programming and the theories underlying it just seems like sucking all of the joy out of it to me.  

If there is a course with regard to user interface design, or the creation of interactive applications, even if it is outside your CS requirements I'd recommend you give it a shot, those sorts of things from the software engineering world do come in handy.  You won't get anything with regards to creating usable software from a CS course.","1309482498"

JUST sent off for both programs today (He was on vials, but was trying the pens, so he's on the exact same thing as you) but I can find out tonight when he gets home. 

My recommendation for you for right now, skip the endo, go to a casual income-based clinic, they can do everything an endo can at a fraction of the price. I'm talking a1c, everything. I informed my S.O. of this and he went in and was shocked. Plus, they hooked him up with a bunch of free insulin. Another tip, ALWAYS ask your doctor for samples. More often than not you can get 3-6 months of free insulin. My S.O. hasn't paid for insulin in a hot minute. I bust my ass to find programs for him so he doesn't have to shell out the hundreds.

I hope this helped. Truly. I understand, friend. We're all in this together.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So basically you point to PIIGS and America as your examples in the last 6 years?

I think this proves my point more than yours. Let's take the Eurozone. No argument that debt is the big factor here, but Keynesian economics really points to government intervention in the marketplace, not taking on huge levels of debt you can't handle. Debt is not bad, but the way Greece is situated, and I'm guessing other countries, they really are in no position to sustain such a high debt to GDP ratio. That is in no way stopping the government from intervening TODAY to correct the problem. A Keynesian solution to their problems is just as viable as any other strategy, even more so, since that's what they're DOING right now. If it were left to free market, what do you think the outcome would be?

The USA also. I don't think Bush was really a fiscal conservative, and neither is Obama ( but at least Obama is a bit smarter in this area, or at least it seems to be); however, it's hard to argue that any solutions by Obama have really been that detrimental. You can hem and haw about the bailouts and whatever, but honestly if you did, you're saying you know more about that situation then him AND his team of advisors? I think the government intervention that he has proposed has been spot on, and most indicators agree. Yeah, the economy still sucks, but this in no way disproves Keynesian theory. If it weren't for government intervention, how would we have gotten out of the liquidity crises we had? 


I have a feeling you are more in siding with monetarism or Hayek or hating on fiat currency? I don't know, but I'm not sure what is the problem that links Keynes with Greece, Eurozone, and America's problems....

We discussed that there wasn't anything serious going on, that we were just having fun, and we were both cool with that idea. However, there was a misunderstanding as to what that meant.

To me, it meant a monogamous sexual relationship until we got bored of each other or found something better. To her, it meant a polyamorous relationship with full disclosure. After she told me she slept with someone else, I was unhappy about it and decided to end it.

After reading this article, I wonder if my decision was rash and short-sighted. Some people just need more than one person at a time. I don't think I'm one of those people, but maybe I should be more accommodating to those that are.

(NKJV)
   &gt;  28 And we know that all things work together for good to those who   love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. 29 For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. 30 Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.


Romans 9:14-21 (NKJV) 

&gt;14 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? Certainly not! 15 For He says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.”[f] 16 So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy. 17 For the Scripture says to the Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I may show My power in you, and that My name may be declared in all the earth.”[g] 18 Therefore He has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills He hardens. 
&gt;19 You will say to me then, “Why does He still find fault? For who has resisted His will?” 20 But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed say to him who formed it, “Why have you made me like this?” 21 Does not the potter have power over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?

&gt; But mere subjective delusion within Joseph's mind cannot explain the material objects — the sword of Laban, the Liahona, the plates, the breastplate and the ""interpreters"" — described by the Three Witnesses and, in several cases, ""hefted"" or handled by others (e.g., the Eight Witnesses, various members of the Smith family, Mary Whitmer).

This is interesting. I wonder if he's choosing his words carefully, because while he affirms that the witnesses ""hefted"" the plates (which they did, but almost certainly with the plates covered up), he never goes so far as to say that they ""saw"" them. Presumably he's aware of those historical details?


&gt; But what of Joseph Smith himself? His honesty and sincerity shine in his personal writings, in documents never intended for publication. For instance, the very first entry in his diary reads as follows:

Oh yes, DCP. Our proof that JS was honest is that he asserts his piety in his personal writings. There is no error in your reasoning here!

Approximately half the colonists of European ancestry tried to avoid involvement in the struggle — some of them deliberate pacifists, others recent emigrants, and many more simple apolitical folk. The patriots received active support from perhaps 40 to 45 percent of the white populace, and at most no more than a bare majority.[1]

Guess what?! Your tormentors and those directly or indirectly responsible for the death of part of your family get to meet you again while you are on earth! What is the ideal response?! [Here is one response](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrie_ten_Boom#Religious_views) (I apologize for the Wikipedia link, it provides the information in a nice format though.) 
My point in all this is that as part of the ""welcome to heaven, you are now free from sin"" you would have the strength to ""forgive those who trespass against"" you. 

Or how about ""dear God, it has been &lt;a long time&gt; since the son you gave me died and went to hell. I see now how his separation from you fits into your plan. But why can't he be let out now? I'm sure he has seen the error of his ways!"" God replies, ""NO! If I were to break my promise it would go against my basic nature. If I were to release him from the punishment that he deserves even though he did not meet the requirements I outlined previously that would make me a liar.""

Anyway, this question is fantastically self centered. It doesn't make sense for a Christian who believes that their entire purpose in life is to follow the will of God to be worrying that ""oh, I might not have fun in heaven"". This is almost as bad as the prayer thread a few weeks ago.

Pine, especially wood that has not seasoned for at least 18 months, will be prone to burning very hot. The sap acts as an extra fuel. The problem is, that this fuel is trapped in little pockets inside the wood. Heating a sealed pocket of fuel makes it go pop. This can cause embers to come flying out of the fireplace and land on carpet/furniture.

Sap also causes a faster buildup of creosote. 

If you must use is, it CAN be used as a kindling. Since it does burn hotter and faster than hardwoods, it will certainly aid in getting the fire started. ","1309482567"

Not just studies with controlling people's diets and checking their stats, but also it makes sense in terms of what we know about evolution and the way different types of nutrients are processed by our bodies.

You do fine on your ramen now, but if you stick to eating a lot of empty carbs now, you will likely be worse off when you're middle-aged compared to someone sticking to whole foods.  At least take some vitamins if you're not getting any in your foods :)

Yes, many fruits and vegetables are much different since human intervention.  The Paleo people say to avoid corn, potatoes, and don't even eat tons of apples and oranges and other sweet fruits if you have insulin sensitivity.  Eat wild blueberries, or any other berries for that matter, broccoli, kale, root vegetables, etc.  Even with animals, buffalo and wild salmon are better for you than cooped up chickens and grain-fed cows.

I don't think it's really self-fulfilling for me... I only started digging into nutrition and diet experimentation 1-2 years ago.  Since then, and still today, I eat a mix of healthy foods I prepare myself, as well as junk foods like burgers and fries when I'm out with friends or being lazy or just having a craving.  After anything with a lot of wheat or deep fried stuff I tend to lack energy, have a worse time pooping etc.  I am a bit allergic to wheat/gluten, confirmed by my allergist... it's not too bad but reason enough for me to investigate alternatives.

Don't think I eat light ""air-filled"" stuff though.  I can eat things other people would think are unhealthy, like eggs fried in butter with bacon and a glass of whole milk, but I just skip the toast and hash browns.  And I feel great and have plenty of energy after a good breakfast like that.

I guess I mean ""naturalistic eating habits,"" rather than naturalism.","1309482568"

And add very expanded user profiles and pictures- come up with an innovative way to get people to add this info, promise not to mine it, and get people to think about the people behind the user names. Having a button which allowed you to show where you were to people on your contacts list for instance and having picasa integrate with google maps to show personal pictures over landmarks.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Meh. I consider myself a long time fan of the series. Started with FFIV and I've played every main series title except III (I keep hearing bad things about the DS remake), XI, and XIV.

Honestly, I think people like to waste way too much time comparing the games in the series or trying to add all the games up to evaluate the series as a whole. Me? I take each title and try to enjoy it for what it offers. FFV? Awesome job system, crappy story. But I still loved the job system. FFVIII? Terribly executed story (though I'll argue there were the materials for a good story... they were just put together horribly wrong), but fun battle system and, well, Triple Triad. FFXII? I hated it until I got enough Gambits to actually be able to do things. It's a shame the International version never came out as it has pretty much every Gambit available early in the game from early on. They really should have done that in the original version.

FFXIII? Yes, it was linear as hell. Yes, you were horribly limited in explanation. But man did I ever love that battle system. And the linearity combined with the insanely frequent save points made it perfect for me. I could get home from work, play for an hour or two, then put it down pretty much whenever I wanted. The way I saw it, FFXIII was a game for busy people. I loved being able to retry battles as much as I wanted, too. I played that game for the battles and pretty much nothing else, I won't lie.

That's how I pretty much look at the series. I don't pick a favorite. I don't try and evaluate the series as a whole and see where it ""went wrong."" I take each game and enjoy it for what it is because let's face it, every Final Fantasy game is fundamentally different. Even the NES titles are all pretty different from each other. The series has always been like that. To try and sum up the series as a whole seems as silly to me as to try and sum up the United States by its presidents. Each one was in office at a different time in a different historical context and was generally pretty different from the previous president. Weird metaphor, but I think it works :P","1309482580"

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","The “primitive” stateless societies that have actually existed were distinguished by their use of diffuse sanctions (gossip, name calling, arguing, fist fighting, killing and ostracism) and religious sanctions in the absence of legal sanctions.

Concerning “primitive” stateless societies, anthropologist Harold Barclay says:

&gt;“In many societies, fines and other punishments are meted out by an assembly. Radcliffe-Brown calls these ‘organized’ sanctions. Yet they are still not ‘legal’ but have the character of diffuse sanctions, of a more formalized type, if the assembly has no authority to use force in executing its decisions. In such instances the assembly members act as mediators rather than judges and are successful to the extent that they can convince two disputing parties to come to some compromise.”

Mark Cooney points out that:

&gt;""...the state's system of social control--law--is just one type of third-party settlement. Settlement can be much more informal, conducted by family members, friends, neighbors, or community leaders. Informal settlement usually takes the form of mediation in which the third party facilitates an agreement between the principals, or arbitration in which the third party devises a solution to the conflict but lacks the power to enforce it. Whatever form it assumes, informal settlement has much the same effect as law; reducing the likelihood of violence among the principals. Law has always attracted much more scholarly attention, but its peace-enhancing properties are not unique.""

Mark Cooney hypothesizes that the relationship between the state and lethal conflict is U-shaped. It's not negative as Hobbesian theory predicts. He says, ""A combination of materials from anthropology, criminology, and political science suggests that rates of lethal conflict tend to be high when state authority is absent and also when it is extremely strong or centralized."" In his paper ""From Warre To Tyranny: Lethal Conflict And The State"" Mark Cooney says, ""One implication of my argument is that the most common criticism of anarchism-that it would inevitably increase violence-appears to be true only under some conditions. In highly centralized nations that are experiencing a wave of political executions, lethal conflict would surely decrease in the absence of the state. But in democratic polities, the sudden disappearance of the state among people long accustomed to legal means of resolving disputes would create a void likely to be filled, at least in part, by violence. However, a gradual reduction in state authority might allow people to develop alternative nonviolent ways of handling conflict, such as negotiation, mediation, arbitration, avoidance, and toleration.""  These are the alternative diffuse social, as opposed to legal, channels of dealing with conflict that anarchists promote as ideal.  

Mark Cooney says, ""There are several examples of nonviolent stateless people...One well-documented case is the Semai, a group of about thirteen thousand people who live deep within the rain forest of the central Malay Peninsula in small bands rarely exceeding one hundred people...Each band has its own well-defined territory and a headman whose authority is based on persuasion, not coercion..A second example is the Cheyenne Indians of the Great Plains of North America. For most of the nineteenth century, the Cheyenne were equine hunters and gatherers. Although they counted among their numbers many hot-headed young warriors who regularly raided and battled other tribes, the Cheyenne succeeded in keeping intratribal homicide within reasonable boundaries. Over a forty-five-year period (1835-1879) they had some sixteen homicides, giving them an annual rate of approximately 10 per 100,000, about the same rate as the United States today...While this might initially seem quite high, remember that it comes from a society lacking the benefit of modern emergency medical care so that many wounds that today could be treated would then have proved fatal.""

We can look at our own lives and see that we engage in plenty of forms of diffuse social sanctions (ex. ignoring an annoying co-worker, yelling/swearing at a driver that cuts you off, etc.) that just about anyone can wield.  These don't amount to state-government.  When more than one person organize and engage in these social (not legalistic) diffuse sanctions (ex. lets say a group of friends get together and decide to shun someone, or a group of parents decide to go around yelling at parents they see spanking and scolding their children, etc.) this is all organization that still does not reach the hierarchical level of state-government.

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","I agree with you, and I think I represent a somewhat interesting case study:  while learning real guitar I lost a significant chunk of guitar hero skill.

I started with Guitar Hero 2, then Rock Band and Rock Band 2.  Prior to getting a real guitar I could play nearly all of the songs on Expert.  Rock Band 3's experiment with Pro Guitar fascinated me, so in December I picked up the $150 Mad Katz Mustang pro guitar -- 102-fret buttons and six loose rubber-band like ""strings"" -- and worked through easy and most of medium.

A couple months ago I got the Squier Stratocaster Guitar and Controller (a $100 budget Squier but with MIDI electronics added, so it costs $280), a Fender Mustang 1 amp, and the Mad Katz MIDI adapter for the Xbox 360, got my fingertips toughened up, and played through the rest of medium.

In preparation for inviting friends over for a Rock Band night, I got out one of my old legacy button guitars, which I hadn't touched in about five months, and discovered I'm terrible on anything above medium difficulty.  I'm too used to gems on different lanes representing different strings instead of different fret buttons, and it's too weird that the gems don't have fret numbers on them.

As an aside, if you haven't heard of it, Rock Band 3's ""pro guitar"" difficulty is roughly thus:
Each song has one of seven difficulty ratings:  zero dots, one through five dots, or five red dots with devil horns.  Also each song is charted four times:  easy, medium, hard, and expert.  Lower-difficulty songs tend to have fewer notes and more repetition;  higher-difficulty songs tend to have more unique sounds or patterns, repeat themselves less, and are otherwise trickier and more difficult to play.

* Easy difficulty is almost exclusively single notes and very few of them.  The notes are at least in harmony with the actual guitar stem, but notes are mostly whole and half notes, with long gaps any time you need to reposition your fretting hand.  When you see a change coming down the track you should have enough time to look down at your hand, reposition, and then look back up at the screen and pluck the note.  (It took me about three weeks to play through all of the pro guitar songs on Easy.)
*  Medium difficulty increases the speed and frequency of notes a bit, and begins to introduce simple chords.  Chords are mostly two-note fifth chords and open chords, although some of the more difficult songs (more dots) will introduce variations, minors and suspended chords, that aren't used much in other songs.  If you play a medium game track through an amp, it vaguely sounds like the song -- which is REALLY AWESOME if you're not used to making music.  ""Listen to that sound -- I'm making that!  I'm making music, holy cow!""  (It took me about three months to play through all of the on-disk pro guitar songs on medium.)
*  Hard difficulty is where I'm at right now.  Most of the song and most of the chord complexity seems to be present.  Occasionally notes will be dropped between changes to give time to reposition your hand.  Three note fifth chords, several new open chords, major and minor are both common, barre chords (OW MY INDEX FINGER!), arpeggios.  But when you get a song mostly right, it sounds AWESOME, almost exactly like the original song.
*  Expert is the original guitar tablature, unchanged except to compensate for the pro guitar hardware's inability to sense harmonics or bends.","1309482582"

"LawSchool","t5_2rb9g","You should strongly consider dropping out, or at least taking some time off. Save the tuition money, get your health and family situation squared away. Ask yourself realistically if you will be able to pay off your non-dischargeable loans (I'm assuming you have loans) doing the job you love.  Ask yourself if you can do the job you love as a paralegal.  But understand that the people you want to help *need* help from a competent attorney who can devote their full attention to the task at hand.  Please don't put someone else's disability payments, freedom, or life in jeopardy if you cannot give the law  the respect and attention it requires.

On the other hand, it is possible you did not understand what was being asked. Someone suggested reading ""Getting to Maybe.""  This book explains that getting points on a law exam is not about naming the ""right answer"" as much as it is discussing ""why the right answer is right"" and ""why the wrong answer is wrong.""

For example, in most college and high school courses, there is a ""score"" that each exam is worth. When you get something wrong, you lose points.

Law school exams do not work that way. Instead, you start with zero, and work your way up. Correctly naming the issue might be worth one point. Getting the rule right might be worth 4 or 5, depending on elements, balancing, etc. Applying the facts to the rule might be worth another 4. Correctly providing the result is worth another 1 point.  Then you name a potential defense and start the whole process over. Then you name the plaintiff's response to that defense. etc. etc.

If you don't understand that process, you are immediately at a disadvantage due to the hard curves.

If you have problems identifying the question being asked, you have another disadvantage.

Ask the professsor/dean if they can identify where you went wrong, and for advice on how to prevent that from occurring in the future.","1309482599"

It's sad because even with legitimate issues and grievances to discuss we are currently a fringe movement. When the legitimate misogynists and bigots control the conversation it becomes so easy for outsiders to write us off.

Even worse is that the nastiest people here don't seem to want to effect change, they just want camaraderie and a shoulder to cry on.

There is no point in bringing issues to light if we can't present the image of being concerned, well reasoned, rational people with facts to validate our arguments.

Simply put, any hateful language will give people an excuse to write us off. 

* Any poorly reasoned blaming of women or feminism will give people an excuse to write us off. 

* Any genuinely sexists ideas will give people and excuse to write us off. 

* Any homophobic language will give people an excuse to write us off.

There are strategically sound ways to address issues that fall under the feminism umbrella, and that is to use their own internal logic to point out their sexism (when present). That is to ask for facts &amp; point out the lack of, or flaws in methodology when classic canards are brought up.

* China has raised its target for renewable energy to 500 GW by 2020 - compared to 70GW for nuclear. http://www.martinot.info/china.htm#targets + http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2010/07/renewable-energy-policy-update-for-china + http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBJI00247420101124

&gt; Solar power has also been abandoned by India because of its HIGH COST. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_India + [India set to produce 700 MW solar power in 2011](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-06-15/news/29660527_1_solar-power-solar-energy-solar-sector). Also:

* India plans $37 billion investment to add 17,000 MW clean energy capacity by 2017. http://cleantechnica.com/2011/05/13/india-plans-37-billion-investment-to-add-17000-mw-clean-energy-capacity-by-2017/

You clearly don't have a clue what you're talking about. Or you're lying. It's very common amongst the nuke fan club.

Ultimately, it all comes down to cost - and that is what is killing nukes:

* Stunner: New Nuclear Costs as Much as German Solar Power Today — and Up to $0.34/kWh in 2018. http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/06/06/237150/stunner-new-nuclear-costs-as-much-as-german-solar-power-today-and-up-to-0-34kwh-in-2018/

* Does nuclear power have a negative learning curve? Real escalation in reactor investment costs while solar and wind plummets.

They are an organic progression of our strategy and implementation of warfare as we know it. I look at it as the military investing less money relatively in specialized forces and thus they can contract that work out for a lot less relative cost compared to implementing it themselves (redundant thought process going on there). It helps the military keep simple goals, albeit none of them are truly simple. I can't really even justify my response because I can't actually state the true intentions, but rather my opinions. It's just a niche market that companies have found. It could literally be as simple as that - some guy going 'hey if we just go out there with them and get a contract we could be making 150-400 percent profit'. That's probably a large factor as well, the need and availability. It's your tax dollars, government agencies have no problem giving it away because it's a constant stream of money.....which is what I hate.

What blackstar9000 is suggesting is that particular subreddits would participate. They'd have to be somewhat small subreddits, probably 40K readers or less because anything more would make it a huge job for the moderators. And of course there would be certain subreddits that couldn't participate, such as /r/F7U12, /r/Pics (duh), /r/Minecraft, /r/LoseIt, and others like those. Those are fairly pic-centered subreddits. 

The biggest subreddit I mod is about 15K and we get a decent amount of pics but I'm interested to see the results. I'm going to pitch the idea to my fellow mods and if we agree, I'll make a post about it tomorrow and gauge the community response.

Working with software for libraries as I do, it's an interesting ethical question as to whether you should link a person's different aliases together or respect that they wanted the identities to remain separate.

For example, a university professor who has written some romance novels under a different name.  Or an indie film director who once directed a couple of pornos under a pseudonym.  Do they deserve for the world to join their pseudonyms together?

So I got a test done when I was a teenager and I found out that I had a much lower range of vision than the average.  The average is around a 100, and I have around an 80.  I'm very cromagnon.  I'm very hunter based.  So as you can imagine, I don't play FPSes much, but when a title like Bioshock comes out, I'm a gamer, I'll play anything that is good, so here is my advice:

Play in 30 minute intervals, and then stare at something static after, for just 20 seconds.  I stared at my mousepad, which has a character for Peace.  So extra nice.

Hydration:  If her urine is yellow, tell her to drink more water.  It really helps alleviate symptoms of disorientation.

Bananas.  No, I'm not calling your girlfriend crazy, you silly lug.  Really, eat them.  They're fantastically stabilizing food, and they really do reduce nausea. 

On the issue of food: better to eat after than before and certainly not doing.  

Now if she keeps getting headaches, that may be something more serious, and I'd start assuming it was stress or anxiety based, especially if she dosesn't play a lot of co-op or PvP kind of stuff.  Doubly so if she mostly plays single player.   That is totally a shot in the dark, but even thought I experience nausea and disorientation during FPS games.

Most important thing is to step into and out of the game in peak physical condition.  So just as her beau (and you're so sweet for showing this concern over her) get her a glass of ice water.  Lure her away with some food if she's playing too long.

And as always: Enjoy.","1309482642"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","I used to do all sorts before the offspring. Swimming, running, diving, throwing and much more. I was brought up by my dad and with my brother. They were both into weight lifting and fitness and every now and then I would join them. It took me about a quarter of the time to get twice the size I was and I have had two long term boyfriends that when we went on fitness kicks also remarked on how quickly I bulked up even unintentionally just swimming to the point where it was discussed. It sounds like I'm being paranoid but I even went to the Drs about it and was told it was just the way my body worked and I carried allot of muscle anyway hence my heavy weight when I don't look that big. 

Edit: I have never just been weighed by a Dr and had it accepted. Every time I hop on twice or more at their request.","1309482654"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","It got bad reviews because it wasn't the game people thought it should be based on their own misconceptions, ignorance and lack of expertise in FPS games combined with the natural slating that any high profile game that takes too long to be released gets (e.g. Daikatana, which isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be).

If you go and watch some of the video reviews on youtube they pretty much all say something like ""This is supposed to be a Duke Nukem game and I have to do *puzzles* and *platforming*??????"".

Of course every single other Duke Nukem game, including 3D had lots of puzzles and platforming but that doesn't matter to the modern computer game critic, you don't even need to have played another FPS to review one, let alone an entire series of games.

The best is when the reviews simultaneously call DNF an ""old school shooter"" (it isn't) *and* a ""cookie cutter modern shooter"".  You couldn't make it up.

Another comment complaint is the jokes about other FPS games, which has taught me that every single reviewer has no sense of humour.  Apparently this jokes aren't just jokes they are verbal assaults criticising these modern mechanics.

The truth is DNF is a decent shooter with some excellent elements that lacks some modern polish and a few features that drag it down a bit.","1309482655"

The biggest problem you are likely to run into is an argument over which game should be your first.  I suggest doing enough reading about D&amp;D 3.5, D&amp;D 4 and possibly GURPS that you can say which game it is you want to try out.

"Gunners","t5_2qhqt","ARSENE WENGER began his Arsenal rebuilding job by snatching Gervinho from under Tottenham's noses.

And the Ivory Coast striker, 24, has vowed to help the Gunners end their six-year trophy drought.

Gervinho is on the verge of sealing an £11million move from Lille - as SunSport revealed on June 15.

And he said: ""I chose Arsenal because it's a young group within which I will be able to integrate easily. I could develop more over there. There's only a few details left to sort out.

""A risk? Not at all. I'm going to Arsenal to play. The best risk to take is to look to score goals and to play a lot.

""In football you have to take risks if you want to win. I'm going to Arsenal to win.""

Boss Wenger and the offer of Champions League football gave Arsenal the edge over Spurs for Gervinho.

It has been a protracted move as Lille have tried to get Arsenal to meet their asking price.

Wenger has already had a cheeky £7.2m bid thrown out but is set to clinch a deal with the French outfit.

It could happen as early as Monday when Gervinho, who has agreed a four-year deal worth £60,000-a-week, returns from holiday.

Talking to France Football, he added: ""I had no hesitation. None. But in a transfer there's always a period of analysis and negotiations.

""All sides had to be satisfied so that things could develop smoothly.

""I'm going there to play, not to be on the bench. Arsenal love the game. And I love teams that love the game.

""The Premier League is a notch above. It's maybe the best league in the world. I want to live that sensation.""","1309482663"

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","~Craigslist puppies are most likely puppy mill puppies. I say most likely because I dont like blanket statements but in my heart of hearts I know it is like 99.9% puppy mill puppies. 

Okay, with that said. $400 is too much IMHO. I deal with plenty of adoption groups and between $100-$250 TOPS and $250 is pushing it. 

I dealt with one group in AL, still in business, that pissed me off to absolutely no end. I fought a large battle with my corporate office and got them kicked out of our adoption center. The reason- It was a mother and daughter who ran it. Their only job was running this non profit organization- They qualified for a 501C3! So any money they lived off of came from this No dad/ husband in the picture. They both drove matching Lexus' with vanity mother daughter plates. I never thought too much about it, thinking they just had money- not that the money was coming from the dogs... Then a fellow employee adopted one of their dogs for $350! I couldnt believe it because, someone had brought us the dog 2 days earlier and we sent that person to this group with the dog. They made $350 off a dog they had for 2 days. But wait, it gets better. Two months later, the poor little guy was not getting along with my coworkers daughter and because of a contract she signed she had to bring the dog back to them. Literally 2 hours later they brought the dog into our store to meet new potential parents. The people loved this dog and adopted it. The mother charged these people $350. now my coworker didnt get her adoption fee back. So they made $700 tax free dollars off a dog they had for just over 2 days total! 

Thats the day I learned that even dog ""charitable organizations"" use their tax free donations to buy their CEO's lexus'...  ","1309482680"

Your best chance to getting a spoiler free family tree would be to get one meant for the show (as the show is only up to the end of the first book).  As a person who has watched the show and read all of the books obsessively multiple times, I can assure you will be perfectly fine and probably better of just finding one meant for the HBO show/made by HBO.

Edit: If your problem with using one of the many HBO family trees is simply that there are pictures of the characters, try [this one](http://hauteslides.com/2011/05/game-of-thrones-infographic-illustrated-guide-to-houses-and-character-relationships/).

Dammit, you made me sign up to post this.

First up, I’m a rabid intactivist, so I wholeheartedly approve the sentiment of this post.

However, I’ve got qualms about the approach taken to discussing it here. The OP suggests that the pro-circumcision advocates have their views censored and silenced out of discourse on the subject. This… seems highly counterproductive. It’s easy, after all, to ‘win’ (and this is a battle of ideas, after all, where the only victory is persuasion) by simply removing all sign of dissent.

However, outside of the crudest tracts and propaganda, this is not an effective technique for winning hearts and minds. All you do is leave people’s objections unaddressed, and unchallenged, coming across as dogmatic and unable to defend your position – and as such, blindly holding to indefensible assertions for the sake it.

Well, it’s not indefensible, dammit. An entirely bulletproof case can be made that routine infant circumcision is child abuse, and arguments to the contrary can be conclusively shown to be fallacious.

IMHO, doing so is far more effective and important than woodenly stating your position. It is, after all, the pro-circ crowd that need convincing in the first place, and in my experience, you can’t convince anyone while denying them their voice. People want to defend the practice? Bring them on, I’ll counter them on every single point.

Now granted it’s abuse and defense of abuse can be ‘triggering’. But I have two points to make in response:

First, I think we have to look for the least harm here. Yes, there’s a chance that debating the merits could set badly-affected people off. But again IMHO, the alternative is losing the battle by default (in the eyes of those we must convince) and in so doing allowing more children to be abused. I for one consider this outcome to be a lot more probable, and a lot more severe – and so I just can’t condone this approach to the topic.

Second… look, if you will, at waterwithoutfish’s objection – one extremely common in all discussion on the topic: that by allowing terms such as ‘mutilation’ into the discussion, we are making victims feel bad about themselves.

While I can do sympathize, I simply cannot agree. To my mind, this is an extremely counterproductive tactic, one that only serves to continue the cycle of abuse.

If we are forbidden to say that circumcised genitals are damaged genitals, then we must tacitly state that circumcision is not damaging, that being circumcised is just as good, no big deal – that circumcision is harmless and trivial.

And that is a position that I cannot and will not abide.

Again, yes, it’s bad to make people feel bad, if you can avoid it. Certainly, victims should not be further victimized by any kind of inferred denigration. (though I’d note that every time the issue has come up, denigrating victims was as far from the intent as humanly possible). But when the alternative is trivializing child sexual abuse, then I’m sorry, but wounded pride is going to have to take a bak seat to wounded genitals.

After all, many forms of abuse can impact the victim’s self-esteem. It would not do, after all, to trivialze the impact of FGM, emotional abuse or sexual molestation down to almost a matter of whim, in order to protect victims from feeling victimized. Not when the process of abuse that caused it is rife within the society, condoned and even celebrated ffs.

Sorry, no. That will not do. The need to trivialize the abuse quietly transforms into the need to perpetuate the abuse, in order to prove how harmless it really is – and that makes my blood boil.

Yes, confronting abuse and inequity head-on is uncomfortable and stressful for everyone concerned. It’s hard, harrowing work, and everyone gets their noses out of joint. I more than halfway destroyed my marriage saving my own son from MGM, and I grew to be hated by large sections of several parenting communities for my unrelenting stance on the issue. But in the process, I’ve personally saved over half a dozen children from the scalpel, and for me, that makes it all worth it.

The feminist community has never been shy of controversy, and in-your-face attitudes to unpleasant truths; I really don’t believe it should start now.

Please don’t try to control the discourse and thus win by default – let speech be free and win because you are right.

Please. It’s important.","1309482717"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;How do you feel about religion, do you resent (in any way) religion?

\- When I was a child I thought that religious people were basically ignorant fools. 

\- In late adolescence I decided that, in view of the fact that billions of people take religion seriously, I should learn something about it. 

I studied quite a lot about religious ideas and history (still do, actually), and decided that religion had accomplished quite a bit of moral, aesthetic, and intellectual good, in addition to cruelty and foolishness.

For some years I considered myself to be a ""moderate""  on the anti-religion scale, along the lines of Greta Christina's essay 

""What Do You Want, Anyway? An Atheist's Mission Statement"" 

&gt;In my perfect world, I would like to see religion gradually disappear from the human mindset. ""Gradually"" meaning over the next, say, one or two hundred years.

&gt;I would *not*, however, like to see this disappearance happen in any sort of coerced or enforced way. 

\- http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2008/05/what-do-you-want-anyway-an-atheists-mission-statement-1.html - 

(I recommend reading the whole essay. It's short.)

\- *However*, during the last year or so that I've been reading /r/atheism, exposure to the many evil and stupid things done in the name of religion has really damaged my respect for religion, and moved me more strongly toward ""militant anti-theism"". (I've been calling myself a ""moderate militant""  recently.)

I've always thought that belief in the supernatural was factually *wrong*, and I'm now reminded every day that it results in *evil* as well.  

Religion really does cause a lot of harm in the world, and we should all be working (with the minimum of ""coercion and force"")  to hasten its disappearance.

A story is written, storyboards are drawn out to figure out the framing and timing of a film, a script is written for the actors, and then the dialogue is recorded while assets for the animators are being built.  

The actors are filmed while giving their vocal performances to give animators visual reference for their nuances and actions, which is why you can generally recognize the mannerisms of a headliner voice in an animated character.

And amazingly, Mega Shar, did exactly that. It's tough on these types of movies though. I visited the set of another Asylum production, and one actor playing a  pilot was being told to go over the top with his facial expressions at seeing the carnage below him. He simply refused to do it, which was brave of him. It's very tough to defy direction, but I think he was aware that if he followed the direction, the movie would get a cheap laugh and he would be viewed as a bad actor. That said, I absolutely love our scene in the science lab where me, Deborah Gibson, and Sean Lawlor are all showing our disappointment and subsequent elation at the mixing of the bright chemicals...

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","There's Luke [16:16-18](http://niv.scripturetext.com/luke/16.htm)

&gt;*16* The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it. 
&gt;
&gt;*17* It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law. 
&gt;
&gt;*18* Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. 

I included Luke 16:18, wihch immediately follows the comment about the ""Law"", to show one of the Biblical edicts people ignore today.

Yet the Bible also contains [Colossians 2:14](http://bible.cc/colossians/2-14.htm).

&gt;Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;

What does that mean? According to [Barnes Notes on the Bible - Colossian 2:14 commentary](http://barnes.biblecommenter.com/colossians/2.htm):

&gt;Blotting out the handwriting - The word rendered handwriting means something written by the hand, a manuscript; and here, probably, the writings of the Mosaic law, or the law appointing many ordinances or observances in religion. The allusion is probably to a written contract, in which we bind ourselves to do any work, or to make a payment, and which remains in force against us until the bond is cancelled. That might be done, either by blotting out the names, or by drawing lines through it, or, as appears to have been practiced in the East, by driving a nail through it. The Jewish ceremonial law is here represented as such a contract, binding those under it to its observance, until it was nailed to the cross. The meaning here is, that the burdensome requirements of the Mosaic law are abolished, and that its necessity is superseded by the death of Christ. His death had the same effect, in reference to those ordinances, as if they had been blotted from the statute-book. This it did by fulfilling them, by introducing a more perfect system, and by rendering their observance no longer necessary, since all that they were designed to typify had been now accomplished in a better way; compare the notes at [Ephesians 2:15](http://bible.cc/ephesians/2-15.htm).

[Ephesians 2:15](http://bible.cc/ephesians/2-15.htm) states the following:

&gt;Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;

Barnes' Notes on the Bible says this about that passage:

&gt;Even the law of commandments - The law of positive commandments. This does not refer to the ""moral"" law, which was not the cause of the alienation, and which was not abolished by the death of Christ, but to the laws commanding sacrifices, festivals, fasts, etc., which constituted the uniqueness of the Jewish system. These were the occasion of the enmity between the Jews and the Gentiles, and these were abolished by the great sacrifice which the Redeemer made; and of course when that was made, the purpose for which these laws were instituted was accomplished, and they ceased to be of value and to be binding.

According to [Law, did Paul cancel the law or Jesus did?
](http://www.captelco.qc.ca/churchofjesus/_disc1/00000070.htm)  (the English in the article is less than perfect) [Paul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle)'s writings contradict Jesus' statements.","1309482784"

Calculating 1 rep max:

Determine the weight amount for the reps do a 1 rep max calculation, for fat burn you'll want to do 1 set of 10 to 12 reps at 80% of your 1 rep max. Since you are just starting, take this advice soundly: do this once a week for 3 weeks then add more.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","if your argument is basically that any human activity that begets more human activity is art, then fine, I just don't see the value in the term.

I say forget this whole obsession the gaming community has with defining it as art and focus on making good games. If games develop in the future to be these Braidesque things or whatnat that tell a unique story or make you use your brain to solve interesting puzzles then thats great and maybe someday it will be considered art, and if it develops to be these escapes from reality so that we can all avoid our shitty dead-end jobs then no it isn't art.

I suspect that the field as a whole will never be considered art because fundamentally it is geared towards entertaining people as a goal. I think it will be the case that there will be a smattering of games that do more than this and are some cool human achievement. 

I think art is a term over-used even among things like paintings and photography. These types of things are sometimes art and sometimes utilitarian, but because the body of work as a whole has tended towards being art we are comfortable with using the term more freely even when the particular example in front of us maybe shouldn't qualify.

I think the games body of work will always tend more heavily away from art and so we will always be uncomfortable with giving any particular work the benefit of the doubt.

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","I'm not entirely sure I understand your correlation between freedom of choice and the temptation of Christ. Perhaps you misunderstand the origins of Satan. He was an angel who turned against God, as he wished to equal and oppose God. As such, God the Father booted him and all of his followers out of Heaven and basically gave him his wish. It is made apparent that even Angels, immortal beings forever in the presence of God, have a choice. We now accept that he vies for the favor of humanity against God (although I'm definitely not one to say that when bad things happen it was 'The Devil'.) Within this context, it's easy to understand why he tempted Jesus during his short time in the flesh; what better way to get back at God then to tempt his son? 

I also don't see how what I am saying is similar to the ridiculous ""dinosaur bones"" argument. I thought I had done a pretty good job expressing my acceptance of evolution (or at least the idea of it) and my willingness to believe in prehistoric evidence, believing it to not be contrary to Christianity whatsoever, but I guess I have not. I see no evidence contrary to Christianity in your proposition. Furthermore, it is my belief that God has put nothing on Earth to directly undermine his credibility. What I mean when I talk of him not ""spelling it out"" is that he has not in the modern age physically made his presence known (ie, returned to human flesh, sent down pillars of fire, etc.) Once again, I wish to reinforce that I'm simply explaining myself.

"japan","t5_2qh2u","&gt; There's no onslaught. Japan, Korea, and Taiwan are all banking on China to help their own economies grow at an appreciable rate.

The impression I got from speaking to a quite well-known Japanese professor of economics is that the Japanese people are none too eager to be a Chinese ally - it is simply a relationship of necessity. They have no sense of familiarity or fraternity with the Chinese people, despite their deep historical/cultural ties. While that may not be the case in Taiwan (due to its relatively recent ethnolinguistic connections to the mainland, NTM the government still sees itself as the ""rightful"" ruler of China), I'm guessing a similar situation exists in South Korea. The US is a much more preferable ally, given the lack of American hostility towards either country (whereas PRC hostility, especially towards Japan, seems to be boundless) and America's proven track record in helping their economies modernize and grow after the fallout of WW2 and the Korean War.

In any case, my point is that by working together, Japan/SK/ROC can exert a combined politico-economic influence over the PRC that would be greater than the sum of its parts. There's no doubt that economic interaction with the PRC is vital to economic recovery/growth, but such a parternship would hopefully allow their economies to recover/grow even faster than otherwise.

China only has the edge in the more basic fields - when it comes to any sort of R&amp;D or creative output, Japan/SK/ROC have more power. Of course, this balance is shifting as well. But if they were to work together, it would be very easy to permanently draw those people away from China and get them to immigrate to other countries (the US could be included in this).

For example, I've found that the Taiwanese love Japan, and there are a ton of Taiwanese researchers here. OTOH, the Chinese would be much more comfortable moving to Taiwan than to Japan. So if the Taiwanese and Japanese governments were to work together, they could encourage Taiwanese researchers to go to Japan, while drawing Chinese researchers to Taiwan. This would allow both countries to maintain their research output while most effectively drawing researchers out of China.

A concerted effort at brain-draining China is the best hope for preventing it from becoming anything more than the world's factory. Take a look at what happened as a result of WW2/Operation Paperclip - Germany used to be the world's scientific powerhouse. But after WW2, it's been barely a blip on the radar.","1309482833"

&gt;I didn't run-away. I got karmajacked by you and there was no more room to have a discussion with people who weren't intellectually equipped to have it.
 
You did run away, and I am not allowed to comment in r/christianity without getting ghosted so I linked the thread in question in r/atheism because you [ghost deleted](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/hzvfm/question_to_the_openminded_rational_christians/c20iw5y) my responses. So yeah, no karmajacking occurred because I wasn't allowed to comment and I genuinely wanted to know how you could get away with such retarded logic.

&gt;Well I knew about it as did any of the boortz folks who you bragged about your Narniatoilet account to.
 
LOL, I take it back that you would do well in the mafia. You have no idea how to cover your tracks. I haven't talked to the pre-nicene folks in 6 months, and that was on their website. Honestsam was the only one who followed me over here to reddit and I havent talked to him with my tarrant007 account and then narniatoilet account in 5 months. He was the only one from boortz who knew as the pre-nicene folks had their own website. So you tell me. What's the motivation for him to finally on the same day as i link over to boortz make up an entirely new account over there just to link it back to reddit and try to troll me? Why would he choose that day to do it? He's had 5 months to say hello. Why now? Why would he make up the username ""tarrant007"" and not ""narniatoilet""??? &lt;--- the account btw, that defeated him enough to make him delete his reddit account? Hmm? LOL you fail so completely here outsider. 

What's so awesome about this is that you couldn't help yourself in this trolling venture you made.  You check my account every day outsider. Every day. Whats even more awesome is you are the one who is obsessed with this ""Karmajacking"" nonsense so of course you say in the boortz thread ""Looks like someone is trying to crash your party. You could crash theirs.""

I just don't like being swept up in a culture I'm not a part of, and having to prove to people over and over again that black people don't all fit in one category.

You are ashamed of your culture. You've said it. ""I hate  ghetto people"". If it isn't your culture, it just isn't. You don't need to prove anything to anyone. But you feel the need to. This is a classic case of what  gizzomizzo said: self-hate. Because guess what? There are plenty of blacks like you, including myself, and instead of trying so hard for the negative ( trying to disprove that you're not ""like them""), why don't you spend some time on the positive (improving who you actually are)? Because ""Black culture"" is misnamed; not all blacks are a part of it. ""Urban culture"" is the correct term, and why do you feel the need to disprove you are a part of it? I identify with the American culture, which is so diverse and amazing that I don't spend anytime feeling the need to prove to people how ""white"" I am. This is really very sad. :(","1309482870"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt;who gives a shit if ur half this half that? how you act while being hispanic as an individual is irrelevant. 

How is it irrelevant when you are saying that because I share hispanic blood that I am naturally ignorant and angry and lazy? How is my ""halfness"" not relevant to your comments? 

&gt;i already said hispanics from all regions aren't the same. the islanders and mexicans are particularly bad. how is what i said moronic when it's absolutely true?

""Absolutely true"" huh? You have the cold hard facts sitting in your lap as you type? Just because your experience has given you one point of view, how does that justify dismissing a whole group of people? How does this logic differ from white supremacists who assume that people of color (immigrant or not) aren't true Americans and are taking ""their"" jobs and women, or for that matter diluting the ""American"" consciousness. You're assuming that experience with individuals (because I am sure you've never met the nation of Mexico or the island of Puerto Rico as a whole) is transferable to all people. So if I met a group of Vietnamese guys who called me names or treated me badly, that justifies me saying that all Vietnamese-Americans are ignorant and rude or at least most? 

&gt;i think ur just angry that you are half hispanic.  

Whooooaaa.  Way to get personal, buddy.  Your assumptions are cute, but while I live in the inner city and have mostly encountered blatant racism from other hispanics and african-americans, I have the actual ability to judge people as individuals rather than indicators of a racial or cultural stereotype.  If, how you said, you're actively looking to spot the worst in people, that's what you're going to find. Unfortunately with that glass half empty outlook, you will miss, or worse exceptionalize, acts of kindness or positive interaction at all - which only works reinforce the stereotypes that you already subscribe to.  

&gt;it's ok as long as you are not hispanic with black mix you'll be fine. the ones with mulatto skin and brillo hair are usually hostile and stupid. like i said, i used to be the most tolerant and liberal person.

I would like to call you out as a troll here, but I don't think you're smart enough. This seems clear that you only like the title of liberal and tolerant without the self reflectiveness that goes into disrupting the racist social constructs society promotes. If your ""issue"" was with racial behavior, what does ""mulatto"" and ""brillo"" hair have to do with it? Watch out, your ignorance is showing. 

&gt;i believed all men were equal but life experiences have taught me otherwise. im not gonna sit here and be politically correct about it. i've been friends with all the races.

FYI Not being politically correct =/= Racist. If all men are equal, they deserved to be equally judged upon the merit of their actions, and not by the color of their skin. If the people you have encountered were assholes, then they were assholes - not everyone who looks like them. Being friends with all the races, no matter what sort of rainbow coalition you believe to be in, does not justify that type of language or prejudicial behavior. 

&gt;mostly only poor people are like this, but the question is, ""why are poor asian people hardworking and peaceful?""

Based on everything you have said thus far, you are so wrapped up in the american racist tropes it is scary. Why are poor asian people the only ""good ones""? Maybe because you are buying into the idea that they are the model minority and they work so hard and do so well, and all become doctors, or some other nonsense bullshit. And it is that thinking that keeps hardworking hispanic people and black people who also contribute to society from being seen as viable candidates. It is a cyclical thought that you are promoting.

I have no desire to continue this discussion with you.  I chose to preserve my faith in humanity instead of being weighed down by the incredible hatred you seem to lug around with you.

Whereas society blames the cheater, I think it's not always exclusively their fault. To rephrase, people can and often are driven to cheat.

Having read savage love, so many people get married/engaged/date and their partner lies about their sexual drive. Then later on, when the sex dries up, you have one person who still wants it and one person who doesn't.

It's hardly fair for the person who was misled to not get sex, so in this context I think cheating is more understandable and forgiveable compared to someone who has a good sex life in a comitted relationship. ","1309482886"

Similarly to how electrons in atoms are located in orbitals, the electrons that compose a bond are located in molecular orbitals. In a molecular bond we have HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital). When an electron in a bond receives enough energy it will jump from HOMO to LUMO and then it can release its energy (as light) and jump back down. The color of the emitted light is directly related to how large the gap between HOMO and LUMO is.

In an aromatic compound, the pi bonds just merge together and you have delocalized electrons (which act a little like one bond). These delocalized electrons are almost always going to be located in HOMO. So, now you have a bunch of electrons that can absorb energy and then release it as light. When you shine light on it, the electrons absorb the energy and if the light has enough energy, the electrons will jump from HOMO to LUMO and then release the energy as light of a specific color as they fall back down.

Like I said, it's been a while, so that could just be complete gibberish.","1309482906"

No.  There is one single measure of success - growth.  Something that grows is successful - something that does not grow is a failure.  Take the US as an example.  It is a very widely held view that the US is a country which is in decline.  This coincides with drops in most of the measures you are referring to (though for some inane reason you cite GDP per capita rather than GDP...probably because it's the key indicator and refutes your argument).

There's bevel mapping on the rocks/houses to make them look they're look like higher poly objects (rounds all the corners).  There's some subtle dirt mapping going on too.  The water is actually using a slight displacement map in by the short (to get the wavy water edge) and subsurface scattering.  The grass/trees/vegetation are scattered with maps using Forest Pack Pro.  The scene is lit with a sun object and a HDRI image for the background sky/GI.  

But yeah, that's about it... this was really just a quicky over a long lunch break (couple hours).  I could make this look a LOT better if I wanted to put some serious effort into it.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Like, unfortunately, Richard Dawkins.

He makes it sound like ""I 100% know beyond a shadow of any doubt that any type of god could ever possibly exist."" 

At least, that is how many will read it instead of ""I know, based on science, history, and logical thinking that there is very probably no god.""

Sure, it made him look a bit more reasonable, but at the expense of the concept in general.

I much prefer this more reasonable definition: ""Strong Atheism is the proposition that we should not suspend judgment about the non-existence of a god or gods. More extensively, it is a positive position against theistic values, semantics and anti-materialism, a rational inquiry in the nature of religious thought, a new way of thinking about religious and spiritual issues.""

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Thanks for the reply and the links to the research. I'll have a read through them when I get the chance. 

&gt; The rats we order come directly from breeding facilities which have not been exposed to the outside world in many generations (we are talking 5-10 years in the least) and would have no exposure to cats or various other predators we have had success with. This isn't it our lab either, I know of at least 10 labs around the world that order rats in the same fashion and they get a similar response.
Also these rats will have a strong reaction to the odor upon first exposure without any other stimuli which rules out a taste-aversion like effect.

Whilst I have no problem accepting that it is probably an innate response, this isn't a very good reason for thinking it is innate. The problem is that you're relying on a simplistic understanding of how learning works, which assumes that for something to be learned, it needs a stimulus to be directly presented with a response. 

The point being that it is possible for rats to learn a fear response to cats without ever being presented with a cat. One of the difficulties in identifying an innate response is that finding universality in a species is not enough to determine whether it is innate or not (unfortunately this is generally all evo psych does, and once it has found a cultural universal it stops there and calls it an adaptation without checking to see if it is learnt or not). This is because there are species-specific constraints which make some behaviors more likely to form, without any innate component necessary. For example, every single culture in the world eats soup from a bowl and not a plate. This isn't because we have an innate 'soup-bowl eating behavior', but rather a manifestation of the fact that we are all exposed to the effects of gravity.

Again, I'm not saying this is the case for the cat odour effect here, and I don't know enough about the issue to even throw out a hypothetical learning explanation, but I just think it's important not to jump to conclusions using slightly faulty logic (even if the general conclusion is, in fact, correct). It's a pet peeve of mine to read through research that attempts to establish that something is innate, only to see them presenting solely a basic stimulus-response caricature of learning as an opposing explanation.

&gt; Using c-fos immunohistochemistry my professor we even able to demonstrate a difference in brain activation for an aversive odor (fox feces) and cat odor.

Wouldn't we expect a difference in brain activation, regardless of whether it's innate or not?","1309482927"

Mostly I think that if we get so worried that what we say might offend someone, or somehow perpetuate a stereotype, that we'll lose the freedom to say what we feel, because we're so preoccupied with what other people think about what we say.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","When it was still ""new"" I found another restored MG that was just like it and they were asking $13,500 for it. Of course I would never sell my baby. :) It has started to show its age a little since then. We could probably spend another $3k and get everything new again that needs it and maybe get that much for it. It was a real rust bucket to begin with so we had to replace almost everything. I think you're right that it's a good investment... I can pretty much make it last as long as I want to and I plan to do just that. I've thought of experimenting with electric or biodiesel (apparently Mitsubishi makes a diesel engine for MG) cause it's just that kind of toy that's easy and fun to work on.","1309482952"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;For example in Detroit you can buy houses for $1!!!

Well that's because those houses are tear-downs that will cost whoever buys them a lot of money in fines and probably are beyond any hope of repair. The cost of ownership is dramatically more than $1.

&gt;Considering all of this how do you rationalize giving ""poor"" communities so many free handouts? I quote ""poor"" because our poor are richer than most the globe.

Well you've cherry picked some quasi-incorrect examples of things being cheap... it's true that food is cheap in America but housing is expensive (despite your examples - building and maintaining a house is quite an undertaking). Consider the cost of maintaining a car... thousands to purchase it, hundreds of dollars a month on gas, insurance, maintenance... and a lot of people *have* to drive to get to work. It's really not like America is a land of plenty where nothing really costs much.

But why give handouts? I think people sometimes overestimate the handouts that we give. There's disability, but you obviously need a disability for that. There's WIC and welfare and section 8, but that's all for families with children, and ultimately the idea is more to help the kids than the parents. There's food stamps but I believe able-bodied adults without dependents can get them for like all of 3 months before they run out. In the US it's not really like you can just not work and get paid a nice comfortable income in handouts... unless you're illegally gaming the system.","1309482954"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;I do believe some are evolved traits I would argue that others are picked up via a sort of mild conditioning in childhood

Of course parents try to teach their children what is right and wrong. We also 'condition' our children with the fundamentals of math. But that doesn't make math any less true because it is taught, nor does it imply this knowledge, passed from generation to generation, originally traces back to some person or group that just decided that 1 + 1 = 2, 3 + 4 = 7, etc. The theorems of calculus are just as true today as they were when some Asian was arranging beads on the first abacus. 

&gt;  I have also never claimed morals come from no where but our own minds.

It seems like you did when answering yes to my question that they are only opinions. It follows that if it is not solely a human invention, a moral code must exist outside of us in the same way that math does. This seems to be supported by the fact that cultures around the world have separately and consistently discovered some ""root"" morals, just like they all reasoned some fundamental math ideas like counting and  the concept of zero. And if that's true, the perceived disparities in peoples' morals are only differences in reasoning as it pertains to our morals. It's no evolutionary progression in morals that we don't stone people for witchcraft anymore. If you actually thought that there were people amongst us that finagled with evil sorcery to cause harm to your family and property, you would probably think it the /right/ thing to do to kill them. But now we have concluded that these witches do not exist, and therefore do not seek to punish them. This is not a change or advance in our morality, only an advance in our reasoning (pertaining to alleged supernatural people).

Look at Exodus 22:2 In this verse, God declares that if someone breaks into your house at night and you kill him, you are not guilty of murder. This verse makes clear that you have a God-given right to defend yourself and to defend your family.

Also, read Numbers 1 In His economy, God instituted an armed citizenry, not a standing army, in order to deal with the affairs of war regarding Israel. This is what the Founding Fathers of America envisioned for our nation. Even in Switzerland today, every home is furnished with a machine gun (one of the reasons Hitler chose not to invade Switzerland).

I've seen busboys playing on break with better control and tactical sensibility than some USMNT players I've seen (not all, of course, but *some*).  I truly believe that our best soccer player may well be making pizzas somewhere instead of training, simply because they never had the opportunity to be properly assessed by professional trainers.

The system to identify and train youth to progress to the professional level is rudimentary, at best, in the US.  The few successes we have did manage to get to an academy (Donovan to the IMG academy, Agudelo to New York, etc.), but our academy system is in its infancy.  If our academy system continues, it will provide more opportunities, since there will then be an identified path to professional play, rather than depending on dumb luck or recruiting from college players (who may well be too old by the time they graduate).","1309482980"

"apple","t5_2qh1f","The maximum speed of SATA II will become a problem with the newest breed of SSDs. When you hit the 250-260MB/s speeds you will want to go for the faster SATA III [source](http://www.sata-io.org/documents/SATA-6Gbs-Fast-Just-Got-Faster.pdf). And that's not to mention the power management improvements they've done in the new revision which will make your battery last a bit longer still.

Now you might be asking why the heck would SATA II choke with its 3Gbps transfer rate to a measly 250MB/s SSD. Notice the difference in the units of measurement. 1MB/s is actually 8Mbps - 1 byte is 8 bits. Ok so now you do the math and you come to the conclusion that 3Gbps/8 = 375MB/s. So where do we lose speed? First of all you lose 20% of the bandwidth because of the physical layer encoding, meaning for every 8 set of ones and zeroes of data you send the encoding adds two extra ones. The reason is somewhat technical but if you really want to know more go look it up on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8b/10b_encoding) or something. 

Ok so now we calculate 2.4Gbps/8 = 300MB/s, we are getting close now. You lose some speed to control information, flow control, headers etc. All of which are very much necessary for operation. So we end up around 260MB/s (a number verified by the sata organization) of sustained speed.

I have no practical experience with SATA III so it's hard for me to say anything about any issues that might be out there. I do however have an SSD running in my iMac (I replaced the optical drive with it) and found an ""old"" helpful [blog entry](http://blogs.nullvision.com/?p=275) about SSD tweaks you might want to employ.

What I actually came here to say is that I would highly recommend upgrading to SSD drives, be it SATA II or SATA III. The speed difference when compared to any HDD is gigantic. Especially now that TRIM is officially [somewhat supported](http://www.macrumors.com/2011/06/27/mac-os-x-10-6-8-brings-trim-support-for-apple-ssds-graphics-improvements/) on OS X.","1309482999"

2. Unpredictability is an epistemological problem, not a causal one. That is, all unpredictable actions (be they unpredictable in principle or in fact) may be caused, though they are not necessarily so.

3. Under a number of definitions of causation (including, I suspect, all those which most people would find reasonable), whether such a thing exists or not is impossible to determine empirically.

4. Again, due to epistemic concerns, I do not think it possible to determine whether true randomness exists in our universe.

5. Bonus: determinism can be true and causation false.

I'm not a fan of either, but I would still go with Qwest, even if what's available in your area is slower. They've been getting better to deal with lately and their Internet service has gotten better too, where Comcast has gotten much worse in both. Qwest's DSL connection has been much more stable for me than Comcast cable ever was, and the upload speed is quite a bit faster (standard is 896 kbps up; I have 5 mbps up, with the option for 20 mbps).

I find that the raw connection speed isn't what makes browsing feel fast so much as low latency is... Qwest was better in that category for me as well, although I did have a problem with their DNS servers lagging for a while. I manually switched my network to some of the faster public DNS servers (Google's are a good starting point) and everything became lightning fast.

To really get your head around all them requires a lot of study.  Like law school.  Then you have to learn the practical end of things at a law firm.  That takes a couple more years.  There's no way (yet) to have a computer program guide you through the possibilities.

And if that's not enough, the law *continually changes.*  The law isn't just statutes.  Caselaw literally changes every day.  So in addition to knowing the ropes you have to keep looking to make sure the rules haven't changed.  It's truly complex.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","Pure (synthetic) THC is *far* from as effective as the complete symphony of the 60+ cannabinoids present in natural cannabis. In other words, marinol is in most cases not as effective as natural cannabis (THC isn't the only cannabinoid with medicinal value, take a look at [cannabidiol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol). As for safety, I'll just put this here, from [Wikipedia's article on Marinol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinol):

""*However, the synthetic THC pill Marinol was cited by the FDA as being responsible for 4 of the 11,687 deaths from 17 different FDA approved drugs between January 1, 1997 to June 30, 2005*"" [source](http://www.oregon.gov/Pharmacy/Imports/Marijuana/Public/DeathsFromMarijuanaV17FDAdrugs.pdf)

As for natural THC:

""*There has never been a documented human fatality from overdosing on tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabis in its natural form.*"" [source](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725802002528)

Vaporized medical marijuana is more effective and safer than marinol. THC leans towards being slightly dangerous if Cannabidiol isn't there to counteract its negative psychotic effects. (inb4 uneducated, aggressive ents flame me for putting 'THC' in the same sentence as 'dangerous')

"reddit.com","t5_6","The act is directly implied, however.

What it breaks down to is this:

&gt;The April Fool's meme (that swallowing is good because of X) is an **excuse** for reddit's misogyny.  

What is the meme an excuse for?  Being misogynistic.  But where is the misogyny?  There's no other logical choice here than ""redditors wanting a woman to swallow"".

redditors want women to swallow, and the meme is an **excuse** to justify it.  So according to poetryinthewater, it's misogynistic to simply want a woman to swallow.

So when she sarcastically says ""it's nice to know that it still works as an excuse"", she's saying (sarcastically) ""it's nice to know that it still works as an excuse to justify wanting a woman to swallow""

That's a pretty blatant straw-man I've set up, however, because I'm taking a stab at what she most likely means by ""reddit's misogyny"".  So if she'd like to comment to clarify what she meant, she can certainly feel free to say I'm wrong.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Seriously, anal is the advice we give the guy? Lol, sexxit is obsessed with anal ;)

""Romantic"" to a woman can mean different things. Generally for all girls, though, it means they want to feel desired. For you, it could mean giving us quality time without distractions, paying us delicious sexual attention, or possibly giving gifts or making a grand gesture (gifts is a loose term, I lose it when my bf picks me a damn flower, for crying out loud. It just means he thinks of me when we're not physically together) 

I personally love it when my man surprises me with things. It can be a cooked dinner, a card, a movie, whatever, but it turns me on to the fact that he cares, and there's an element of him being in control that I think is really hot.

You should test these groups and see what she responds to best. On different nights, try a simple gift, cleaning something she normally cleans (a gesture), a couple of hours talking to her with no distractions, and a hot sweaty sex session just the way she likes it. Which one gets her the most melty, happy, and grateful? That's your answer to what she finds romantic.","1309483055"

If they really want to effect change, it might be a better move to ensure that informational pamphlets are available presenting other options for women who are pregnant and aren't ready to be mothers in abortion clinics-- which, to the best of my knowledge, they already are. 

Giving women who WANT it information is one thing, but physically confronting them when they're in a vulnerable situation is another, and in my view, it's unacceptable. It's one thing if anti-abortionists give out passive information-- talking to a class of young women about their post-pregnancy options, for example, or handing out brochures in a neutral area; but approaching a woman and telling her she is making a bad/immoral choice when she is vulnerable is, to me, harassment.

The academy system is much better in this regard: it doesn't matter what the result is on any given day -- what matters is how well each player fulfills their role.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","This guy has no idea how acid reflux works.

Acid reflux is caused by the build up of stomach acid. The build up is caused by your body trying to break down oils. When you eat something that has a lot of oil in it (meat, fast food, olives) your body has to produce a lot more acid than usual. Over time, some people damage their esophagus this way.

The acid irritates the esophagus and causes discomfort. Once your esophagus is damaged, any acidic foods (fruits, tomatoes, soda) will irritate your esophagus. The thing is, acidic foods themselves can't *cause* acid reflux, they can only irritate it.

I believe the reason that water-packed pineapple shows fewer carbs than juice or syrup-packed is because the carb count on canned fruit includes the carbs in whatever it's packed in as well. It's probably best to get the water packed anyway though, to avoid any residual yucky stuff that it might be floating in. 

I would also recommend making your own whipped cream with heavy whipping cream + sugarfree vanilla syrup or other sweetener... and then just use delicious chopped pecans. It will be okay. :]

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Alrighty, if you're looking for custom skins, the best site hands down is leaguecraft for it. On that website, you'll find tons of custom skins for just about every champ there is (tons more for the original ones). That being said, since the new patch it became a bit more confusing in terms of how to patch them in. 

My best recommendation is using [ItzyWarty's RAF manager](http://www.itzwarty.com/raf/) Click the link that says download, extract it. Put it in the riot games folder that contains the league of legends folder.

Now, let's say you're at leaguecraft looking at some morde skins, and then you see one you [really like.](http://leaguecraft.com/skins/1526-dullakaiser-gold.xhtml) Click on the download link at the upper right hand side, and save it. It'll be some random set of numbers and be a .rar file. Move it to another folder (one you'll store your skins in) and then extract it as well. 

Open up the RAF manager, make sure it's updated, and then take the file you extracted from leaguecraft, and drag it into the box that popped up when you opened the RAF manager. Name it the file name of the character (Ashe is bowmaster, mordekaiser is Mordekaiser in your case). Make sure you're also not using new particles because those haven't been fitted to work quite yet. 

A box will appear on the right hand side, with that character's name. Click the box on the right so that it says enabled, and then click file -&gt; pack. On the bottom, it'll say something about packing and so forth, just wait until it says it's finished.

Open up LoL and do a quick custom game to see if everything turned out alright. If you added in particles, your game will crash either at the loading screen or somewhere earlier. When LoL finally opens, you should be able to see your new skin (only you can see it).

Also, make sure you save your stuff and backup LoL just in case. Seriously, if you add in custom particles, you're going to basically have to reinstall LoL over again to get rid of it.","1309483083"

"exjw","t5_2qp5l","Here are my $0.02:

-  The easiest giveaway is to watch them during the meetings.  Do they avoid answering even if they're not shy?  Do you rarely see them preach?  When you talk to them, do they mostly talk about worldly (normal kid) things?  It's not very difficult to spot the ones leading a 'double life' when you start looking for it.  Compare them to kids at school.  Watch out for stupid, though, because that's the same in the regular world and in the kingdom hall and impossible to distinguish.  Sarcasm is also a dead giveaway, as is someone that spends as little time as possible in the kingdom hall after the meeting's done and tries not to socialize with the people that are really really into it.

-  Check out their personal library the next time you're at any of their places.  If they have their own books that are 'controversial' then that's a good sign.  By controversial, I mean science (not necessarily sci-fi) and literature.  Especially if they DON'T talk about the science around adults, because the ones that do that usually try to learn just enough pseudo-science to 'disprove' real science.  If they have any Hunter S. Thompson, then absolutely go for it, as they are a bad-ass.  Really 'girly' books don't count, 'cause some of the younger sisters will read that crap.

- Are they uncomfortable around you?  If so, it may be because they think you're daddy's perfect JW princess.  But it may be that they want to impress you or 'like' like you.  Are they uncomfortable around your parents?  This is promising, because the one's that are all-in actually seek the company of 'mature' adults, especially if they're elders.  Watch out for those freaks.  If they're uncomfortable around your parents, then they may feel they need to hide something from them.

- If you or they ever need to leave, r/atheisthavens is legit.  But, of course, use the appropriate caution.

If you have any questions or need clarification, let me know.  My experience was that I grew up (with my entire family) in the truth; knew it was BS early in high school; never caused any trouble so I wouldn't raise suspicions and have to talk with anyone that was 'concerned', but I showed just enough apathy that people didn't ask me to preach very often; applied myself in school to get into a good college; did just that against the concerned advice of nearly every adult that half knew my name (because of going to college, most people blame me for my brothers leavings as well); had a normal/kick-ass time in college (studied, learned everything I could, partied, had sex but no orgies, graduated as an engineer); now leading a normal life.  

Most of the kids I grew up with left the organization.  The ones that are still there are for the most part there because they let their brain atrophy at a young age, or because they could never sack-up against the family pressure.

More than anything I want you to know: **There is a world outside of the organization.  It can be amazing, and it can suck.  Part of it is based on your circumstances and chance events.  Another part is your decisions.  Just because you leave doesn't mean you have to end up in drugs.  But without a doubt the most important part of the life outside JW is your attitude and curiosity.  Never stop learning.  Always ask questions.  It's pretty wonderful.**","1309483091"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Girl, I totally feel for you - my boyfriend and I have had some major fights, broken up several times in six years, but we are together now and stronger than ever. I've said it before, but communication is key to a healthy relationship. Without it, each person can start jumping to conclusions, letting their minds take over instead of using the knowledge that the other person has given you of how they feel.

Taking a break can be good - it is not synonymous with breaking up. In my own relationship we have also had issues with bad/no sex, entirely from me (my own fault). My lack of sex drive has been partly from physical issues which make it painful, and at least for us the solution was communication (!) and lots of time, taking things slowly. You can try refraining from penetration, but still doing other things - oral and manual stimulation will still give you the feeling of intimacy but might take away from the pressure of penetrative sex.

Taking time to yourselves can help you solve your individual issues, and it's always important to have time to yourselves regardless of the state of the relationship. Why do you think that he is lacking romance towards you? Is it possible that because you are his first girlfriend, even after two years, he is lacking experience in courting you, being romantic and charming? You've obviously let him know that you are missing it, so whether or not he genuinely makes a change (takes you out on a date, makes romantic gestures, etc.) is up to him...sometimes, two people are just at two different places in their lives, and if it comes down to you two breaking up, you may find that in a few weeks, months, a year, you have both changed and are more compatible. If you are meant to be together, I think you will be able to work it out.","1309483097"

MacGregor Knox, Williamson Murray

Made up of long essays, each focusing on a specific period of time through the lens of the RMA theory (RMA stands for Revolution in Military Affairs). Essentially an argument that superior technology is not the sole decider in conflicts, it features detailed studies of: The English in the 14th century, 17th century France, The French Revolution, The American Civil War, The Prussian RMA, 1840-1871, The Battlefleet Revolution , The First World War, and The Blitzkrieg 1940. 

It's generic in the sense that it focuses more on theory than any specific period of time, and of course focuses heavily on the military. Only problem: it's expensive, so use a library. Hope this helps!","1309483158"

Add that to the rapid enrichment of Asian countries, where more people have access to money and you get this apparent lack of concern for others. As much as they would like to help, they are scared of getting involved. That said, you can find examples of this behavior in the West as well...","1309483162"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Good. Right now, take classes in accounting/finance. I'd suggest picking up a beginning culinary school book, because usually they'll have ideas on how to figure food/beverage costs. Keep in mind, you're not going to have hardly anytime to spend with your friends/family for around five years. Microbrews are really popular right now, so I think that the angle could work depending on your city (if you're opening right now, I have no idea how the market could change.)  Do you have enough money so that you can potentially go an entire year without turning a profit? When you do open, watch your labor like a hawk. It's really easy to bleed the restaurant dry. Push away any romanticized vision you have of the bar/restaurant because that's not how it works. And above all, my biggest suggestion is not to do it. It's roughly 150x harder than you can imagine. My typical day when I was an owner was 8 am til 10pm Monday through Saturday, and 2pm til 11pm on Sunday.","1309483165"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No. American exceptionalism to the rescue!

The dollar is the world reserve currency. We print that stuff. 

While Greece can't simply print Drachmas and expect others to buy their bullshit, the US *can* in fact do that, and other countries have much less say in the matter.

Why? Drachmas can be used to buy some Greek goods. 

US dollars can be used to buy much greater variety of goods. It's worth more to people.

So far, the dollar is unchallenged, but I guess I could see the Chinese RMB as an alternative reserve currency in the near future. They produce a lot of wanted products. Jokes about ""crappy Chinese products"" aside, most of us can't live comfortably without the assortment they offer to the rest of world.","1309483167"
