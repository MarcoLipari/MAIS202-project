"politics","t5_2cneq","I remember a little while ago there were some polls showing the political leanings of the older members of generation z. They were described as Socially Liberal and Physically Conservative with small government and low taxes being a priority and more religious than millennials. Conservatives were celebrating how millennials were apparently an off generation and that the next batch of voters would support a center-right America while the alt-right lunatics claimed that they were the ones who would see the truth and fight hard for nationalism. 

Well they shit the bed with that didn’t they? As a member of gen z, I can safely say that while my peers (particularly white guys) may lean to the right on certain economic issues, most people are very socially liberal. We are incredibly diverse and open and accepting to people of all backgrounds. We have grown up with mass shootings and want some common sense reforms now. Young people see trump and the rest of the gop for what they are. Maybe if the party had attempted to be more moderate, they would have won people over. Maybe if they had some meaningful conversation instead of constantly relying on lying and insults, people would have been more willing to hear what they have to say. Maybe if they gave a shit about the people they represent instead of giving into relentless greed and fanatical religious devotion, people would trust them.

Wat ik daarmee bedoel is dat de stress je nekt. Als jij als persoon er alles aan hebt gedaan, dan kan het alleen maar goed gaan. Mocht blijken dat dat echt niet lukt, ga dan bij jezelf na: Hoe komt dit?  

Bij vrijwel elke hogeschool heb je recht op een **gouden kans**. Dit is een derde kans, *tailored to your needs* om het tentamen toch te halen. Het belangrijkste hierin is dat je communicatief bent: Ken je de stof wel en nekt het tentamen je qua stress, vind je het framework van het tentamen moeilijk of snap je het gewoon echt niet? 

Communiceer hierover met je decaan. Geef aan dat je echt je best doet. Hoe ver ben je erin? Bij mij hebben ze het vormgegeven door een mondeling en dat betekende dat ik een 8 haalde in plaats van een 3.  

Er zijn altijd mogelijkheden, maar blijf positief. Wees communicatief, inventariseer voor jezelf waar het probleem ligt en bespreek dat. Wat denk je dat de issue is?

Boven alles is het altijd een optie om te praten met mensen uit het vakgebied. Ik heb een accountant benaderd die mij heeft geholpen om de stof in de praktijk te gieten, wat het heel makkelijk maakte. Daar ben ik de beste Redditor tot op de dag van vandaag dankbaar voor.",1522540805

1967 - not even close.  Begin and Rabin admitted that Egypt posed no realistic threat, and [Moshe Dayan admitted](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/11/world/general-s-words-shed-a-new-light-on-the-golan.html) that most of the conflict with Syria was the result of Israeli aggression in the DMZ.  After an Egyptian military buildup (that the CIA saw as defensive, and Begin and Rabin saw as ineffective, and that the Russians may have caused by saying that Israel was preparing to grab Golan) Israel grabbed the W.Bank, Golan Heights (Syria) and Sinai (Egypt).  Basically, a pseudo-defensive war of territorial acquisition.

Honestly, if you find the idea of having children repugnant, it's highly doubtful that sentiment will change.  (And the biological clock thing is bullshit.) 

With that in mind, you need to have a serious discussion with him and point-blank tell him that it'll never happen.  Even mention sterilization.  While you may not want the latter, it tends to make SOs show their true colors.  If he's as ""open"" as he says, he'll support you 100%.

Regarding the infusing. I am currently doing my 1F in a 5 gallon food grade bucket with cloth over the top.
Could I just keep it in that same bucket, throw in the flavors and add a lid to it like you mentioned?
Then filter it before putting into the keg?

This is what I was going to try out next, before I decided to post. Sounds a lot like what you just said.

Lastly, when you put it in the keg, do you just hook it up and let it sit for a few days to carbonate? Mine has been in the kegorator for about 4 days, and it is just now starting to get some C02 in the pour.

You may get a pixel here or there depending on which resolution you choose and how square or rectangular it happens to be.  But, those settings are exposed to all players.  The only point where your physical monitor size comes into play is how easy or difficult it is to pick out detail within the game.  If you have a massive monitor you will likely find it easier to see enemies where you are expecting them.

Go to places and events you're interested in and have genuine fun. Life is suffering homie. plain and simple, we bond over our mutual struggles and interests, what people seek out the most is someone who can make their life bearable and entertain them. The key is if you can make yourself happy you can make others happy, that's how you take control of your life, your circle and your social interactions. Make people rise to your level, don't grovel for their attention or seek it out if they're not seeking you. ""the best gift you can give to others is to make the most of yourself"" remember that and repeat it. let the fakes and haters stay where they are. 

love is not possible without personal growth and self respect, love actually develops naturally if those 2 things are a solid part of your personality and life.

Your words not mine.
If that is what you describe what is happening then I do not know what other possibility is happening other than you playing afk farmville.
There is generally a reason why people do shit like that, again, it is not some common phenomena that your laners take an entire jungle side from you. 

Lets go back to ""no ganks no camps"", if you are not ganking, or are ganking the wrong places at inopportune times, or you're not counter ganking, your laners (talking about bottom lane) will die/lose lane/lose pressure/lose vision. What will eventually happen is that it is too unsafe for them to venture too far out to even farm minions in their own lane, and their only alternative is to farm your jungle.

The other possibility is that one of your laners is extremely far ahead, and is looking to snowball the game, so you're going to let them take what camps they want and continue to try to snowball with their advantage.

Another possibility is that depending on where you are on the map, it is not logical for you to path over to a particular camp on the other side of the map depending on what objectives are up, so your laners will take those camps from you because you won't be or shouldn't be taking them any time soon.

The final possibility is that they're trolling, hence, report and hope Rito does something. Taking 2 of your camps is the equivalent of taking a whole side of your jungle when a Buff hasn't spawned yet. But this is not supposed to be some common phenomena. ",1522540813

"dangancitylights","t5_3oyx7","*Pushing a hand through his hair, Jonathan considers the question for a brief moment. His customary smile dances lazily on his lips and his eyes linger upon a certain someone for the briefest of moments. Then, the notepad he is holding snaps closed and he faces Kotone.*

""Pahaha, it would appear a great many people are interested. Very well then. But it would appear that my original scheme of allowing the blackened to commit their own mistake... is now forfeit.""

""Ah, I hope each person may lend me their ear. I do not wish to repeat myself.""

*A second or two of pause later, Jonathan commences his report.*

""Firstly, with regards to the state of the deceased subject, the process of rigor mortis was complete. A conservative guess for the **time of death** would be **prior to 3 or 4 hours upon discovery of the body**. Since Tooru was last seen at the party, the logical postulate which can be established is that he was murdered sometime between **5pm and 5am**.""

""Secondly, the **cause of death is blood loss**. When a certain amount of blood is lost, the body will enter a state of shock. This effectively hinders all systems within the human body and prevents them from functioning - leading to death.""

""Thirdly, the various cuts on the subject's body appear to be **unaimed and uncoordinated.** This would imply that, if a human were present, they were struck in a **hurry or panic**. However, this can also be interpreted several other ways, such as **dim lighting** or the use of a **trap**. I personally believe that the latter are less probable due to several reasons I'll elaborate upon later.""

""Fourthly, the **bandage** which had been wrapped around the subject's arm **covers a wound**. It does not appear to match the cuts over the subjects body. Unfortunately, I'm not a medical doctor so I cannot give details on possible weapons which can cause such wounds, but it's safe to say that the **wound under the bandage was inflicted using a different method compared to the gashes on the body.**""

""Finally, and I'm sure you've all noticed as well, but all the blood had completely dried. This is mere conjecture as many variables affect how fast it takes for blood to dry, but it should have taken **roughly overnight for something like that to occur.**""

*And with that, Jonathan gives everyone at a pedestal a professional smile.*

""And that is the extent of my autopsy. I hope it will contribute to our discussion.""",1522540813

In my dad's case, he mentioned his mother had mentioned a NA ancestor and also mentioned being part Cree. His family is Canadian and I don't think they have the same ""Cherokee princess"" lore that Americans do. 

I found a Canadian DNA cousin on that line with NA DNA, too, and wrote to him and, while he hadn't yet been able to authenticate a Native ancestor, he had also heard mention of Cree over the years, which I found to be an interesting coincidence, so it gives me some possible direction to look in. :) ",1522540813

"minimalism","t5_2r0z9","First: minimalism is as much about action as ownership. I started practicing minimalism in my daily carry items, slowly boiling it down to just a phone and my glasses. The other part of this is not picking anything up on the way; choosing smaller portions of food so you don't have leftovers, for example. My goal is only take my phone and clothes through any doorway, ideally by surrendering or recording anything I ""picked up."" You can't lose what you don't have.

Second: at home you can make finding things easier by minimizing visual clutter and containers. My closet is for storing seasonal items, with my clothes hanging from a rack in front of it so I don't have to look inside the closet for the jeans I was wearing yesterday. Any shelf space is exactly big enough for what it holds, no more, or else it will collect small items like my phone. By minimizing the places you can put your phone to begin with, and then the effort to check those places, it becomes much harder to lose anything. A lost item goes somewhere, just reduce the number of places it can go.

I'm super prone to losing things. I've heard every suggestion from routine, to ""put it where you found it,"" to mnemonic devices. While the above suggestions haven't kept me from leaving my phone in the fridge or on the table, they have kept me from losing all the other things I'd been dependant on before. Plus, when you only have one thing on your person at any time it becomes much more apparent when it's missing.",1522540813

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It's kind of fuzzy and not exact accounting, but I try and figure out how much joy and future joy I'd get out of it, accounting for direct (pleasure in the moment) and indirect (healthier than my other choice? I'd probably enjoy living longer or being more fit.). I usually buy more expensive groceries because I know that I am treating my body nicer by doing that. I also go to more expensive movie theaters because I enjoy the experience more compared to other theaters enough to justify spending the extra few bucks. It's qualitative, not necessarily always quantitative. Of course, when it can be quantified, it makes the decision much easier, like getting larger toilet paper roles of the same quality I usually get, for the same price per role or something.

As a recent in-between purchase example: I bought 2 patio recliners for $64 that were highly reviewed and looked durable. It was just a great deal, and I was going to buy 2 anyway as long as it was a reasonable price (i.e. not too much more than most of the other high-reviewed recliner sets).",1522540813

I don't need to be coddled or sold hype, I did my research, but some activity would be nice. My hold mantra through all of this has been that with Mobius's part in the IBM/Stellar ecosystem and the new merger with Maersk, they might be obligated to remain tight lipped. A lot of proprietary software, systems, and hardware is involved. I would imagine that trying to become the world's number one go to for shipping, logistics, and finance probably requires some discretion. They could also just be way too busy working. Either way that's the narrative I like and going with. The Mobius team doesn't owe myself and other investors anything thing  other than giving it the good old college try. But some community involvement would be nice. 
   Full disclosure, I did sell off some of my MOBI today at a loss to chase gains with another token. Hopefully my returns on that will be good enough to come back and reinvest with some more capital.

He was crucified on the Passover (the Passover began the evening of the institution of the Lord's Supper and continued through the next day for his trial and crucifixion). Christ claimed he would be in the ground three days like Jonah was in the belly of the whale- being crucified on Friday and being out by Sunday morning doesn't really meet that criteria. However, the day after Passover is the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and is a Sabbath no matter which day of the week it falls on (Leviticus 23:7). So Christ could have been crucified on Wednesday afternoon, spent Thursday, Friday, and Saturday in the ground, and been raised Sunday.",1522540815

I’m in the market for a midsize sedan and really want to like the Accord, but I find myself looking at the Camry.  It seems to be more car for the money even though I know the Accord would be more fun to drive.  If I do get a Honda, it’s likely to be a Civic SI.  The sedan market is down big time.

That is obviously not true. Economics study the distribution of scarce resources, if resources aren't scarce, there isn't any problem and everybody can have whatever they wish to have.

The Adele live show is expensive because there is only one Adele and it costs money to set up the infrastructure to a live show, you can't have the whole world watching Adele at the first row at the same time - you may stream it through the internet, record and make it available on spotify, etc. But only few people who decide to pay will be able to watch live in the first seats.

&gt; Because wealth is not oil and wealth is not food; wealth is, fundamentally, *satisfaction*. Oil and food can lead to wealth simply because those things satisfy someone's desires, but there are plenty of ways to create satisfaction that do not require raw materials.

Yes, it is. You can't sing for a handful of people and expect their hunger to cease. You can't sing to people in order to move them from home to work. If there is not enough food to feed everybody, some people will go hungry, there is no printing money that can change this reality.

Demand can be increased by printing money: you give people money and they buy stuff, creating incentives to a bigger production. But supply can't be increased by printing money. If you print too much money, supply won't be able to accompany and inflation will surge.",1522540818

 **Candy King Aurelion Sol Skin Model**

&gt;So in February I drew a Candy King design for Aurelion Sol and it got reposted in the boards here so I didn't bother to post it myself :'D  
&gt;But!!! I made a model for it,,,,, I'm really happy and I want people to see it,,,  
&gt;Aurelion Sol is my fave champ and I love him a lot,,  
&gt;A lot of people thought this skin concept was dumb and yeah I agree but I also think it fits with his personality as a grumpy sassy king,,,  a cupcake forger who created all candy (Or so he claims ;&gt; )  
&gt;idk it's 5am and I'm making no sense haha  
&gt;I hope people like it though!

Things would not have ended well for Russia if she invaded western Europe immediately  after the second world war ended. 

EDIT: I'm out of this. This is a dumb argument with dumb people. There is simply no way that Stalin is risking it for a biscuit.

I think teysa is viable as a fringe cEDH commander with a little luck. I would cut fatter stuff like necrotic sliver, liliana heretical healer, marsh flitter, tragic slip, sword of feast and famine, relentless dead, several lands, and damnation.

What's your gameplan? Seems like it is tutor up darkest hour, a free sac outlet, and an outlet for infinite sacs such as blood artist. The combo is a bit weak because its 3 pieces, but the plus side is that they are each pretty cheap mana wise and can provide multiple functions. For example, bitterblossom or bloodghast with contamination is a sweet softlock that provides you more turns to draw into your combo. Because you are going to be running a ton of free sac outlets, you may get more mileage out of hatebears, even ones that poorly interact with your board because you can sac them when you are ready to go off. I'd suggest both thalias, aven mindcensor, spirit of the labyrinth, eidolon of rhetoric, ethersworn canonist, and linvala keeper of silence to start. If you cut sun titan you can get mileage out of ad nauseum, the single more powerful draw spell in the format. 

On the flip side, the other way to get your combo online faster is to have more sources of draw. Your teysa shell sets you up to easily abuse skullclamp so I'd run more tutors for it such as steelshaper's gift. Run some spot draw like night's whisper and sign in blood is never a bad choice if your mana base can afford it. You also dont have a ton of ways to remove hate artifacts/enchantments, which can ruin your day (rest in peace, null rod, stony silence, grafdigger's cage to a degree) so you may benefit from a simple disenchant or fragmentize. Aura of silence is a niche card but can turn off some combos such as bomberman and ruin doomsday and storm lines. Similarly with blind obedience ",1522540819

Just to say, not ignoring this comment, started reworking my setup thought I'd test a bit before responding but project got a bit out of hand. I now own a bunch more power tools lol.

Might start a thread about bigger setups, as you say there aren't that many of us running 4 sensor and bigger areas so limited info out there.

Anyway, new Constellation setup will be 11'x13'. That is the the corners where the sensors are. A distinction I see almost everyone blurring is sensor locations vs playspace. It's understandable but overlooks the extremities and they can be either irrelevant or critical depending on the use.

Regarding Lighthouse, they are definitely IR optical and LOS. Did not mean to imply otherwise, sorry if I gave that impression. On the occlusion issue; as they say in the aerospace industry ""One test is worth a thousand theories"" 
 .Basically I don't even remember the last time I thought ""oh, occlusion"" (vs shit wigging out ie same as my Rift). I'm going to examine that more closely with the new setup but my gut response as to why it's not really an issue is;

1. Doofus Donuts

"privacy","t5_2qhlc","general rule of thumb: there *is no* secure email.

There are email extensions that nobody uses (GPG), and proprietary communication platforms carried over email (Proton, Tuta, etc.), but there is no generally interoperable and widely used secure email.

You *can* have fairly private email clients, these would be services that run plain old email but give you something from a privacy promise to technical measures to protect your messages, such as Kolab, the now-defunct Lavabit, Riseup, etc.

going one step down, you have just totally normal, not specifically privacy oriented, email services that just aren't google and don't actively mine your data.

however, even if you switched to one of them, [google will still have most of your emails anyway because they have all of your contacts' emails](https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/google-has-most-of-my-email-because-it-has-all-of-yours).

and then, there's the gigantic trade-off to moving away from google. not a single other mail client works as well as gmail. just to name some big ticket items: you will lose the superb spam filtering, you will lose conversation view, you will lose labels, you will lose extremely robust filters (although some services' filters are better at other things... like clear triggering hierarchy).

take my two deal-breakers: conversation view - the *only* other services i have seen that has this is Outlook.com and Fastmail. labels - not a single other client implements this, period. so when you're looking at a significantly degraded email client, for what? so that google can have half of all your emails instead of all of them, there's a real question of whether it's worth it.",1522540822

"StudentLoans","t5_2ror6",""" Only if you can show undue Hardship""

https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/bankruptcy

""What circumstances do I need to prove to have my loan discharged in bankruptcy?
You must declare Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy and demonstrate that repayment would impose undue hardship on you and your dependents. This must be decided in an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court. Your creditors may be present to challenge the request.

top
 

How do bankruptcy courts determine undue hardship?
The bankruptcy courts do not use a single test to determine undue hardship but may look at the following factors to determine whether requiring you to repay your loans would cause an undue hardship:

* If you are forced to repay the loan, you would not be able to maintain a minimal standard of living.
* There is evidence that this hardship will continue for a significant portion of the loan repayment period.
* You made good faith efforts to repay the loan before filing bankruptcy.

 

What happens to my loan if the bankruptcy court determines repayment would cause undue hardship?
It depends on the terms of the bankruptcy court’s determination. The terms may include the following:

* Your loan may be fully discharged, and you will not have to repay any portion of your loan. All collection activity will stop.
* Your loan may be partially discharged, and you will still be required to repay some portion of your loan.
* You may be required to repay your loan, but with different terms, such as a lower interest rate.

*this dude is homeless and mentally ill.  I'd say he can show
inability to even achieve a minimal standard of living and
that it's likely to persist.  The only sticking point is
good faith repayment....*",1522540822

"apple","t5_2qh1f","**Children's Online Privacy Protection Act**

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) is a United States federal law, located at 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501–6506 (Pub.L. 105–277, 112 Stat. 2681-728, enacted October 21, 1998)

The act, effective April 21, 2000, applies to the online collection of personal information by persons or entities under U.S. jurisdiction about children under 13 years of age. It details what a website operator must include in a privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent or guardian, and what responsibilities an operator has to protect children's privacy and safety online including restrictions on the marketing of those under 13.

While children under 13 can legally give out personal information with their parents' permission, many websites – particularly social media sites — disallow underage children from using their services altogether due to the cost and work involved in complying with the law.

"thenetherlands","t5_30hrx","&gt;Ik ben een beetje in de war, waarom is het kwalijk dat in een opinieartikel over de politiek een opinie is verkondigd?

Creatieve interpretatie. De oorzaak voor die verwarring ligt bij jezelf, nergens staat ook maar de suggestie dat meningen een kwalijk iets zouden zijn. Ik vind de eenzijdige belichting in dit opiniestuk een kwalijke zaak. 

&gt;Het artikel vecht duidelijk tegen het beeld dat geschept wordt van een “islamisering” die Nederlandse tradities om zeep helpt, waarom is het dan van belang dat Denk en Bij1 daarmee genoemd zouden moeten worden? Hebben zij voorstellen gemaakt op basis van de Islam om paaseieren te hernoemen? Zijn ze tegen Kerst omdat het onislamitisch is?

Migrantenpartijen komen op voor de belangen van hun achterban. Deze achterban is niet-westers en niet-Christelijk. Een politieke partij zal zijn standpunten als het even kan positief verwoorden, dus termen als 'afschaffing' of 'verbod' zul je niet snel lezen. Echter, als de discussie zich aandient dan zullen deze partijen een voorkeur hebben voor 'nieuwe' feestdagen die tegemoetkomen aan de data waarop de religieuze of culturele tradities van het electoraat plaatsvinden. 

Een SGP wilt evenwel een zondagrust waarbij elke ondernemer de deuren moet sluiten. Omgekeerd zie je een partij als NIDA die streeft naar 'nieuwe' feestdagen zoals tijdens het offerfeest. [Link](http://www.nidarotterdam.nl/onze-oproep/standpunten/).",1522540823

"ChapoTrapHouse","t5_3ezs3","That's my best guess too, but I cant help but think of it in terms of that old debate about whether representatives should go by their personal feelings or by what they think the voters want. Like maybe this is all part of some cold realpolitic calculation about what it takes to win a Democratic primary in her district. Or, perhaps, it is her own personal indulgence she feels is safe thanks to all her other positions which make her indispensable to that lobby. Is she cosplaying as a genius or sincerely being a nerd?

Or what if it's some entirely separate issue like maybe one of her most vital supporters or staffers drew a hard line on that one issue or something. It could be decided on the basis of something like that.

Either way, the enigma she represents is less important than the question of who ought to replace her, but I'd still like to know just what in the fuck is going on there.",1522540826

Another thing I've heard of is fundamentalist communities using government assistance programs. Where a sister-wife that isn't the legal first wife will claim herself as a single mother to [collect welfare.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-foots-bill-for-polygamist-communities/) Legally they are single mothers, but it is taxpayers who have to pay for children by a man with multiple families.

For me, Tools of Destruction was an amazing game. Sure, it had plot holes a plenty (for example, Tachyon refers to Ratchet as the last Lombax in the known universe when that is clearly bullshit considering Angela exists), the devices (barring the Groovitron and Mr. Zurkon) were pretty much useless, and weapon balancing was pretty bad (the Combuster and Fusion Grenade are useless halfway through the game and the Shard Reaper sucks ass, too, for example), but for the first game on a new generation, it's a really great game that still holds up more than a decade later.

Without the built-in sexual release valve provided by masturbation, it's doubtful that early humans would have ever mastered the secrets of fire or discovered the wheel. And you can bet that Galileo, Newton, and Einstein never would have made their discoveries if they hadn't first been able to clear their heads by slapping the salami (or ""knocking a few protons off the old hydrogen atom"").

&gt;I mean, shit man, look at me. In most people's eyes, I wouldn't even be 1/10 all around. I have very pale skin, I'm nearsighted, I'm really scrawny, I am suicidal, I am anxious. I haven't showered in several months, if you literally gently run your hand on my torso, you'll pull off a bunch of dirt flakes, there are literally layers of dirt that cover much of my torso, arms, legs, ankles, and even my neck. 


&gt;I have not brushed my teeth or flossed in literally years, my teeth are a pale yellow. By some miracle of god I have never gotten a cavity despite this, probably because I don't eat that much sugar and I drink nothing but tap water. I haven't gotten a haircut in years, and coupled with no showers, my head is constantly dandruff-y, messy, and greasy.


&gt;I have tons of emotional baggage, I was sexually abused by my two older sisters, my father, and a rabbi at Yeshiva. It's absolutely fucked up my sex life, not to mention my relations with my emotions and other people. I do not have access to a lot of money, I am not particularly intelligent about anything most people would consider useful, I lack quite a bit of street smarts at that. 


&gt;I am not sexually skilled in any conceivable way. I am quite lazy, I could easily spend a lot of time not wanting to get out of bed. Where I live is a total mess. My parents and community have disowned me. Very little of this is appealing to most women, but I literally had a girl pursue me knowing many of these things. I'm still with her a few months later. 


&gt;She's like a solid 8/10 in terms of sheer appearance. She literally was persistent in wanting me, not despite all this, but perhaps because of them. Apparently I'm her type, dare I say, her fetish. I have no problem with that by the way. I am desperately starved of genuine affection. 


&gt;She fucking loves my stench, she keeps two of my dirty socks in her purse in ziploc bag and huffs them every once in a while as she goes about her day, or is just sitting at home. She does things weirder than that, but I know at least some of you feel like you could vomit already, so I'll spare you.


&gt;That's not to say I'm not extremely attracted to her in every sense of the word, she's absolutely fucking insane, but in the hottest fucking way imaginable. I'm not a sex offender or anything, but just try to keep some perspective. ",1522540829

a separate pool for high rollers (as we call it) is a bit better or we limit the control with RANDBETWEEN, so that the generator will prefer to choose the bad numbers first before the actual prizes if you aint a high roller...but bottomline there's no cheat in it - it's just that you'll exhaust the bad number first with the cheap tokens, eventually go to the winning numbers if you have enough ""cheapos"" (our term for it)... ;)",1522540830

&gt; Brian Transeau (born Brian Wayne Transeau on October 4, 1971, in Rockville, Maryland) is an American musician who records under the stage name BT. Classically trained from the age of 13, he attended Berklee College of Music in Boston for one year before dropping out and moving to Los Angeles, California, and then back to Washington, D.C..

&gt; From an early age, BT demonstrated a remarkable aptitude for playing and understanding classical music. He was heavily influenced by avant-garde and romantic composers such as Stravinsky, Bartok, Debussy and Rachmaninov. His biggest influences, however, were from everyday sounds that most would take for granted, from noticing the meter of the grandfather clock in the foyer to the micro-rhythms of crickets and cicadas to the ambience of passing trains at night.

&gt; The drive to actualize the tools BT envisions has led to his evolution as one of the most cutting-edge programmers and technologists in music today. He has expanded this reach into a visionary software venture, Sonik Architects which launched its critically- and commercially-acclaimed iPhone application, Sonifi™.

&gt; Brian Transeau is the father of a young daughter, Kaia. He lives and composes his works in his Los Angeles home/studio in which he has a few Apple G5's and 8 AMD dual-core Opteron 64-bit desktops which he uses for his techno-wizardry.

&gt; BT has released 8 albums and has scored over a dozen films. His most critically acclaimed album, ""This Binary Universe"" (released August 29, 2006), was composed in 5.1 surround sound and contains animated videos for each song, presenting a new way of experiencing music.

&gt; BT works with multiple computers and the CSound programming language to help craft his work. He also owns a company, Sonik Architects, which develops both VST and VSTi programs which he uses in his own productions.  Read more on Last.fm.

"StarVStheForcesofEvil","t5_32uti","Tom has consistently shown support for Star's interests and efforts, even if he doesn't understand them or is not interested in them himself; with the SOLE exception of the photobooth.

Also, Star hasn't exactly been the most attentive GF to Tom either; just like with Marco in JarCo, Star's interests and projects always seem to take priority, and Tom (like Jackie) is always playing support.

And lets be totally fair here ... if your comparing Tom to just a general BF, then he's doing OK, and is making progress.  If you're comparing him to Marco on the other hand ... you should stop.  Marco's entire life right now revolves around Star (his job, his living arrangements, his friends, his responsibilities), he has nothing else going for him beyond that so his investment in her problems and interests to such an extent is a partial byproduct of this factor (also, notice Marco never actually states he himself is interested in what Star is doing either ... he's just more supportive out of the gate than Tom).

The Pioneer is from Campaign currency, much like the Pioneer gear from Mod 12, no idea the price. 

Primal &gt; all the other sets for a DPS. MW3 obv for a support but it's stupid expensive. Pilgrim is ok but on boss fights you can lose the weapon buff if you don't kill an enemy to refresh it depending on the length of the fight, but might be better for trash because you don't have to wait to be healed/take damage to get stacks of buffs like you do with Primal.

That's a wild speculation. Amazon doesn't use the affiliate tag to track clicks... They have other strings in the url for that.

I never said it was illegal and the FTC doesn't arrest people for breaking these rules. I would argue it's unethical not to disclose these kinds of affiliate links and the public should be made aware of it and decide on their own whether to support the practice.

The rumoured “legacy missions” for Origins should actually be a thing in the next one, at least when it comes to wrapping up the Connor/Arno/Shay story. William Miles being in the modern day could help with this, because, well, Connor’s his ancestor.

Gameplay wise, in general I want them to keep the formula they’ve had in Origins. I think if we got rid of the half-cutscenes we sometimes see, fleshed out eagle vision and the “detective” mode, combat could be refined and made slightly more unique and flow better. Reintroducing Unity’s stealth mechanics in a way that fits the time would be a good idea, it needs to work with Origins AI however. A few more parkour and assassination animations would be nice, and implementing a ship, like in the Origins missions, but make it a point for it only to be used for traversing the open world and for exclusive naval side missions. An Origins sized map would make me more than beyond happy, but for healthy growth a map as big as Origins and it’s DLC would be in order.

"IncelTears","t5_3kvtt","Most of that is true here as well (although I have literally heard the ""can't rape your wife"" one). It seems very schizophrenic when viewed from the outside because of how mix-and-match it can be (what seems like a positive ""protective instinct"" dynamic in one situation ends up being used to control the person being ""protected"" in another situation), but there is a weird sort of ""logic"" underlying it all, that is rooted in old-fashioned cultural norms. I tend to emphasize the negative more than the harmless or positive, simply because there are things which seem harmless on the surface but are used elsewhere to erode human rights - like the duty to provide for one's family is often based (at least in part) on the idea that women are ""meant"" to stay at home and raise children, so the man's duty is to work while the woman's duty is to stay at home ""barefoot and pregnant,"" so to speak. 

I used to talk to Christians a lot on the subjects of family and religion, and this was a thing they'd bring up when I express that I don't think it's inherently immoral for a woman to pursue a career even if she's married - they'd draw lines between that and the ""protective role"" of the man as the breadwinner, and explain that without this dynamic then ""the man has no duty to the woman to provide for her because she can provide for herself."" Which is not a 100% false statement from an egalitarian perspective (if both spouses work then both spouses would generally share financial duties, naturally, otherwise what's the point?), but then they'll still say it's the woman's job to take care of the kids and not the man's, which is how you get situations where the dad and mom both work but the mother is overworked because she's still expected to cook, clean and care for the children while the husband doesn't do any of those things because ""that's women's work.""

The problem is that Healthcare is a service with inelastic demand and supply. That means that even if good pricing information was available: it would not influence decisions much.

The reason the demand side is inelastic is that nobody chooses to get sick. All high prices do is cause people to defer a consultation with a doctor until complications develop.

The reason the supply side is inelastic is that it takes over 10 years to train a doctor. Maybe only 2 years for an EMT. Rising prices may encourage more people to enter the field: but the effect of price information is slow.

This is a science fiction novel.  Cool science is half the fun.  I'm not writing the next Star Wars, I'm more interested in stuff like the Martian, or Interstellar.  Just because I have some personal blindspots as a writer of science fiction (because one man can't know *everything*) doesn't mean it's a bad writing practice to do some basic research to try to get the science as accurate as possible, because much of the enjoyment of science fiction is the speculative part.  Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card owes alot of it's popularity thanks to it's political, scientific and sociological realism.  That is because it was a well researched and thought out novel, and subsequent entries into the series reflected even further research and thinking on the part of the author.  I don't see the point in shooting down a science fiction author for trying to put real science in their realistic science fiction book.",1522540838

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/c649d39cb98a4f4795c5bac0744848b2.png)  

&gt; Early career

&gt; Mark Morrison's first official recording was the 1993 vinyl release, Where Is Our Love, pressed on his own private Joe'Mel label.
Main career

&gt; In mid-1995, Morrison released his debut single, Crazy, which became a Top 20 hit in the UK. The follow-up single, Let's Get Down, also entered the Top 40. They were followed in the spring of 1996 by Return of the Mack which became a smash international hit spending two weeks at #1 on the UK charts. Morrison became the first black UK male solo artist to reach #1 in the 1990s.

&gt; His debut album, also titled Return of the Mack, followed and became a multi-platinum success. It reached number four in the UK chart, and sold 3 million albums worldwide. It spun off several more hit singles over the next year. Crazy (Remix), Trippin', Horny, and Moan &amp; Groan would all reach the UK Top 10 making him the first artist in British pop history to have five Top 10 hits from a debut album.

&gt; Although his career was going well, Morrison was constantly in trouble with the law. In 1997, he was imprisoned the same year he received four Brit Awards nominations, Mercury Prize nomination, an MTV Europe Music Awards nomination, and five Music of Black Origin Awards (MOBO) nominations as the single Return of the Mack began to climb its way to #2 on the American Billboard charts receiving platinum status en-route. It stayed on the Billboard charts for an incredible 25 weeks.

&gt; He also performed at the 1997 Brit Awards. The performance at the Brit's influenced WEA and Morrison to release Only God Can Judge Me, a 9-track EP which contained live performances, interviews, prayers, and three full-length songs including Who's The Mack! which reached #13 in the UK.

&gt; Morrison has faced various criminal charges during his career including a 1997 conviction for attempting to bring a firearm aboard an airliner for which he served three months just as his hit song, Return of the Mack, began rising up the US Billboard charts.[1][2] In 1998, he failed to appear in court on charges of possessing an offensive weapon, choosing to instead fly to the West Indies island of Barbados. He was arrested and remanded into custody upon his return to the United Kingdom.[3][4] He was later cleared of the offensive weapon charge.[5]

&gt; He was convicted of affray for his part in a brawl resulting in one fatality and sentenced to community service.[2] Morrison later was incarcerated in Wormwood Scrubs for a year for paying a lookalike to perform his court-appointed community service in his stead, while Morrison himself went on tour.[2][6] While in prison, Morrison reportedly converted to Islam and attempted to change his name to Abdul Rahman.[7] Also in 1998, Morrison was banned from driving for six months and fined £1,380 after twice being caught driving without a licence.[8]

&gt; In 2002, Morrison was arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and car theft.[9] He was released on bail but a policemen was later arrested on suspicion of taking a bribe from Morrison in return for his release.[9] Morrison failed to appear in court to face the charges and a warrant was issued for his arrest.[9]

&gt; In 2004, he was arrested and spent a night in custody after a fracas started when his medallion went missing.[10]

&gt; In 2009, Morrison was arrested for an assault in London.[11]
Return to music

&gt; Morrison appeared on the 1999 Brit Awards where he presented an award, introduced Whitney Houston and announced his return to music. In September 1999, a single titled Best Friend featuring Connor Reeves &amp; Gabrielle became Morrison's ninth Top 40 hit single, reaching #23 on the UK Singles Chart.[12] The following year, it was announced by Billboard that Morrison had signed a five-year worldwide deal with Death Row Records founder Marion ""Suge"" Knight, making him the first, and only British artist to be signed with Death Row Records.[13]

&gt; He later signed to soccer player Kevin Campbell's 2 Wikid label in 2003. His only release for the label, a single entitled Just a Man/Backstabbers, was a minor UK hit, reaching #48 in the UK Singles Chart in August 2004.[14]

&gt; In May 2006, Morrison released the limited edition CD/DVD album entitled Innocent Man in the United Kingdom on his private label, Mack Life Records/Mona Records. The title track, Innocent Man, featuring DMX was released in March 2006. It was well received and reached #46 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2007, he was featured on hip-hop artist Cassidy's single titled Innocent (Misunderstood) from the B.A.R.S. The Barry Adrian Reese Story album. The track sampled Morison's vocals from the song, Innocent Man, and charted on Billboard's Bubbling Under Singles chart.

&gt; In 2008, Morrison announced the release of a 'best of' compilation, King of British R&amp;B: The Best Of.. Mark Morrison, although it remains unreleased.[15]

&gt; In 2010, he announced the planned release of a new album entitled I Am What I Am which has a tentative release date of 2012. Plans for a world-wide tour to accompany the new release was also announced.

&gt; In 2012, Mark Morrison appeared as a guest feature on the Houston rapper Trae Tha Truth's ""I'm On 2.0"" which features notable rappers Big Krit, Jadakiss, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, B.O.B, Tyga, Gudda Gudda and Bun B. Read more on Last.fm.

"BlackClover","t5_36udu","&gt;     Listen there is no absolute definition of spoiler. It’s completely subjective what is or isn’t a spoiler

I can understand that, but if you believe that, then why did you call me out on 
asking for no spoilers in the first place. That's the reason all this happened, and now you're changing your mind.

&gt;  It’s fine if you don’t mind getting spoiled, but it definitely is a spoiler

Oh ok, so you just said that, and didn't actually mean it.

&gt; For me, I believe that a spoiler doesn’t just have to be a major plot point. But any plot point that would essentially “spoil the experience of finding that out on your own”

I can understand that.

&gt; Also you deleted the comment where you got all angry

Yeah. I don't see why you had to point that out. Good job for noticing, I guess? It was pointless and didn't add anything to the conversation, everyone who wants to read this for whatever reason can tell that I was being 

&gt; me: was angry and out of line

Like I already said I was.

&gt; Now your switching to being passive aggressive with me? “by your logic” “ it’s fine if you don’t know what a spoiler is”

I'm not being passive aggressive. Literally all I did in that comment was bring up your points, show you why I disagree with them, and then I flipped your point back on you to show how invalid it was. And if you do think that I was being passive aggressive (while literally using your words), then why were you being passive aggressive?

&gt; Like jeez dude, why are you like this?

That's just uncalled for.

&gt; I feel like you’ve argued with so many people that you just assume everyone is an asshole. So you talk down to them like you are with me.

Yeah. That's pretty true, I already apologized for that.

I just don't understand what the point of you continuing this is.

I asked a question.

**You** were passive aggressive about it.

I got angry.

You called me out.

I apologized.

In a perfect world we'd all get a plate of tendies for every meal (breakfast, second breakfast, elevenses, lunch, tea, dinner, and supper), but sometimes that's just not possible. Other options in such desperate times include:

* fried fish*
* fried shrimp
* fried oysters 
* hush puppies
* french fries 
* fried mushrooms (mushrooms are a fungus and therefore not a vegetal!) 
* chicken fried steak
* sweet and sour pork (bonus: comes with lots of sugar for mummy's good boy. just eat around the vegetals)
* Mozzarella sticks
* Cheese curds
* Beef Taquitos
* Pretty much anything on the Taco Bell menu
* Doughnuts
* Deep-fried butter
* Falafel (watch out for vegetals)
* Deep-fried Oreos, Mars bars, and Twinkies
* Crab Rangoon

If you should find yourself suffering from a chicken allergy or stuck in some shitty Chad restaurant that doesn't have tendies (I KNOW, it's HORRIBLE but they exist) all of these options will help you maintain your healthy boyish figure. 

*Watch out for fried seafood, though. Make sure you eat an extra big boy portion and include things like extra french fries, hush puppies, and deep-fried bread. Fish sometimes doesn't have enough calories to maintain your healthy figure.",1522540840
"dissidia","t5_2tq3o","Weighing in, I think Specialist makes sense for him. Locke had a niche in FFVI in that he was the only character that could use throwing weapons. (Aside from Setzer's gambling weapons which are classified differently.)

I'm thinking daggers, Wing Edge/Rising Sun, Mirage Dive, Phoenix attacks, and something reminiscent of infiltration will make for a unique character in the roster. ",1522540840

I think your bigger issue is as you started to say in that late game, and even as early as 15 minutes the game is decided because one team has gained such a big lead that it doesn't matter anymore, there is no coming back, and the game still may not end soon. So you are forced to sit there for sometimes half an hour while you wait for the enemy team to finish the damn game already. This is where riot needs to tweak scalings a bit or maybe even a lot.

as for your 1st point...thats why theres always an option to pay....the problem is when you take away the ability to also play...

I will say that MDA is the smartest coach the Rockets have ever had. He is probably a genius. Morey is obviously brilliant. Harden is, next to Hakeem, the best player ever for the Rockets. The rest of the team is full of incredible talent and athleticism.

However, this doesn't mean they are perfect. Even the best leaders, the smartest people, and the best talent can make mistakes. I believe they are making a mistake by assuming everything can go on like this. 

Harden is showing signs of fatigue. I get downvoted every time I say it. But the statistics show it. I think he could easily recover and be ready for the playoff, but he needs some serious time off, not just a little bit of reduced minutes for a few games.",1522540842

"IWantToLearn","t5_2rjo5","I know what the people who got me started would say. They would say don't. Don't invest until you already have money. Don't invest until you already have that education, going to a city college is infinitely better than no college. The return is crap but if you sock money away in a savings account, chances are very low you'll lose any and you will slowly gain money. If you're under 18, you can't invest anyway because you have to be able to sign a legal contract on your own behalf in order to legally invest.  They would answer you that the soonest you are viable to invest is after you have a college degree.

But I'll be 100% honest, my way of investing is to let smarter people do it for me. I never feel as stupid as I do when I go to my partnership meetings. I can sit there with detailed charts on internal rate of return on investment and I still barely understand what is going on. 

What I've got are a bunch of people that I have deep trust in. And they have people that they are constantly monitoring and have deep trust in. And it is that third group out who are actually choosing all the managed investments opportunities. The most I do is give an up or down vote, rarely I write an essay arguing that we shouldn't invest in a particular sector.

Most of the people that I deeply trust and who have been taking care of my money forever have accounting degrees. All the people who don't have accounting degrees have business degrees. My wife has just started accounting, she's literally in her first year, and she's gone from being like me and barely understanding things in meetings to suddenly getting half of what everyone is talking about. So prep for accounting or business.

If you are not yet in university/college, then the best thing you can do is to bone up. This means to work hard on your math skills.  Also work very hard on your logic skills. The part even I have to deal with is looking at pitches for what people want investments in. The less money you have, the less people will be talking to you but the prospectus should be available to any investor. But once you're looking at that, you have to remember that you are looking at an advertisement. They are trying to make the investment sound as great as possible so you'll put in the money. They shouldn't lie (that's illegal but remember some people out their are conmen doing illegal things) but they are going to spin it so it looks amazing and like you couldn't possibly pass it up. You will have to read between the lines and determine how good it really is and what risks are actually involved. The better you are at turning that into a realistic risk evaluation, the bettter you're going to be at making your money work. 

I'm afraid I don't have any specific educational resources. But easy internet resources like Khan academy for math should do perfectly fine. And I'm sure there are youtube courses in logic and argument around. 

The real secret is to remember that there is no secret. Nobody knows anything that you can't just go and learn at the library or in school. There's no magic.  

And there's no bar or test for investing. It's just if you feel comfortable risking throwing your money in, knowing it very well might just burn. If you are comfortable with that, you have enough knowledge to start. And it's pure trial by fire.

As an intermediate, though, what you can do is make a fake portfolio. How stocks do is constantly reported. Pick a handful and assign the sort of numbers that you could realistically invest in them. Then track them once a day. See how your fake portfolio does. Actually go through the calculations in a spreadsheet. See how much you earn. See how much you lose. When you are sure you are tracking correctly, change your fake portfolio and see what happens to the money. Do you make any? Do you lose any? Pretty soon you should be pretty comfortable with how the money will fluctuate. 

The other, more predatory thing you can do is make the right friends. Find the other people who are really interested in going into investment, banking, business, what have you. Make friends with people who you are willing to trust to do your due dilligence for you. Even if they are just eager and nothing else, you can study together and try to challenge and test each other over what you are trying to learn.

Hell, my brokerage had a pop up when you signed in saying ""We do not offer bitcoin products or other crypto currency products please do not call us to inquire"" because thousands of people were flooding their call lines asking about bitcoin/crypto shit. That's when you go ahead and buy some put leaps (if they were offered). Sure it might still go up 40% in the short term, but long term?

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","An old tradition from times when we had different seasonal patterns.


So winters used to be more brutal, say, 200 years ago.


Feet of snow, no electricity or gas engines, no running water.


So people would have to be in enclosed spaces for extended periods of time to stay alive and warmish.


In some countries this would mean bringing the livestock in for a month or so to share the warmth and cut down on the number of cowsicles in the barn.


Add smoke and ash and bits from burning wood and coal.


So by the time spring rolls around you have a building that's been occupied by a bunch of people who haven't been able to bathe regularly in months plus maybe livestock.


Take a second and imagine that smell.


So when it finally gets warm enough to bathe without dying of pneumonia and open windows, when the sun is shining, you clean house. 


You scrub away a winter's worth of grit and stench and dust and dirt, toss out what you have to, and celebrate having survived another winter.

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","Its debatable.  

Worf, Geordi and Picard both are recipients of highest end Federation medical technology and we see what the limits of it are from there.    

Picard and Geordi both have artificial organs to replace natural ones .  Geordi having artificial eyes and Picard having an artificial heart.  While Geordi may have some sort of neurological impairment that required an end run around missing nerves, Picard's heart was both mechanical and failed after a certain period of time.  

Worf did have a spine regrown and implanted, however this was an experimental procedure.  The replacement did not go off without a hitch and nearly killed him.  

Data as a third point of reference is human enough that it is well within the Federation's capacities to make human looking synthetics.  

Based on this, I'm going to say No generally, but with the possible exception of yes if experimental processes are used.  Nominally, the replacement organs would be synthetic and would not be functional in the reproductive sense.  They may be aesthetic and sexually identical to normal human organs.  

It is however possible that an 'experimental' process could be adopted to generate those organs and they may be fully functional as generating reproductive organs AND SURGICALLY IMPLANTING THEM would be easier than generating a spinal column.  Note, it seems the surgical installation is the issue and not the actual creation of the organ, implying that there are some issues in the 24th century we cannot predict.

All that said, IRL I fully expect most of the issues with artificial organs and their installation to be resolved by the end of THIS century.  However a group of nearly immortal humans who can heal any wound makes for terrible television.  ",1522540844

"nba","t5_2qo4s","I may be confused as to what you're saying. The Spurs have very few media ties. I would say their strongest ties are to their local guys (Jeff McDonald especially)

Skip shouldn't be regarded in anyway. The guy makes his living off of saying inflammatory things and he has been a Spurs ""fan"" for supposedly decades. He has called Kawhi the best player in the NBA and also throws tantrums when Kawhi can't play, it seems.

Why would the Spurs leak ""frayed tensions"" when they JUST got over this same shit with LMA last year? The Spurs have never used the media to speak to a player and they sure as hell wouldn't want to ostracize their present and future foundation - which is what Kawhi represents to them.

The reason why the media has ran wild with this story is because of the nature of the Spurs and Kawhi. Both are very quiet and don't generally use the media to get what they want.

From Woj, to Lowe, to Bill Simmons and others, MANY people have said this is one of the strangest situations they have ever covered in the NBA. 

The whole reason this story is as ""juicy"" as it is, is because of who it involves. If this was happening to the Knicks and Derrick Rose (like last season) yeah, it's a story, but it's not a massive story. It's a ""lol those Knicks can't get it together"" story.

The Spurs have been generally drama-free for ~25 years. Rodman was the last drama that I can remember even comparable to this. There's been little things, like LMA last year and a few other instances, but overall they are a really tightly run ship. 

Meanwhile, Kawhi has been the consummate professional. He's quiet, he gets better, he's clutch, he does stuff in the community, he's never been in trouble with the law, there's no photos of him partying, no locker room drama, etc. He's a perfect franchise superstar.

Put it together and it's extremely juicy to the media. The Spurs have gotten more coverage over this Kawhi situation than they did when they were winning 60 games a season and winning 3/5 championships in the mid 2000s. It's hilarious, really.",1522540848

"NVC","t5_2vleo","I definitely hear what you are saying. If used internally your second version is good observation/ mindfulness (in Buddhism what you re doing here is called a 'noting' or 'noticing' practice), but could be extended to full NVC by being more clear about what your feelings and needs are. 

If used externally the approach you're coming to is rather similar to Brad Blanton's 'Radical Honesty' method, which in my opinion makes a good counterpoise to NVC for situations where focusing very much on the wording is blocking authentic expression / connection. It's an approach that requires the active participation of the other party in not taking things personally though, so that's the flip side. It's very good in intimate relationships as long as you've both agreed to block out some time to actively listen to each other.  Taking ownership of ones thoughts and feelings is the underlying theme of both techniques, so as long as you are doing that things have a good chance of turning out alright.

Nonetheless, I think there is another angle on your difficulty. You seem to be getting stuck mainly because there are lots of different feelings and needs associated with this issue, and you're having difficulty breaking things up into manageable chunks. In your first version you don't feel that you've fully expressed yourself, in the second version you've expressed yourself more fully but mixed together several separate issues. I'll see if I can tease things apart for you:

Remember the four ways of reacting? 1) Blame yourself 2) Blame others 3) Feel Yourself 4) Feel Others

So a good place to start a conversation with your boss (whether in person or in your head) would be to 4) connect with her feelings and needs: It sounds like at that moment she was feeling 'overwhelmed' as well as feeling the weight of responsibility to ensure the 'right' action is taken so is probably experiencing some self-judgement or self-criticism. Start the conversation on that note and there's a fair chance she'd open up to you about what was actually bothering her at the time, which probably had very little to do with you personally.

Then looking at 3) your feelings and needs -- this is mainly what you've expressed in your bullet points above. I'll extend your observations of your mental actions to include my guesses about the associated feelings and needs:


---
&gt;When you had the door to your office opened, I was thinking that this meant it was an appropriate time to ask you a question

Going backwards into strict OFNR this becomes. 

O:When you had the door to your office opened, I was thinking that this meant it was an appropriate time to ask you a question, but it turned out not really to be the case.

F: I felt guilty for interrupting you AND frustrated because I was hoping to get an issue resolved AND disappointed because I like working with you and hoped for a connection with you. It's these multiple conflicting feelings that's causing you to become emotionally overwhelmed (a.k.a 'angry')

N: To be polite, to work effectively, to matter, to be part of a team

R: Could you clarify whether your door being open is meant as a sign that you're available? How can I best work with you without disrupting you? What is your preferred means of communication?

&gt;When you said, ""I am terribly busy I wish people would just do things correctly the first time"" I was thinking you were speaking about me. Then I was thinking, it is unfair of you to say that because I don't make mistakes very often, and I was coming to you for advice

O: I heard, ""I am terribly busy I wish people would just do things correctly the first time"" and identified with the thought ""She is criticising me""

F: I felt defensive, embarrassed, surprised. Again, this overwhelm is triggering anger in you, expressed as 'annoyed'.

N: Acknowledgement of your contributions to the team, gratitude for raising issues in a timely manner, equality, respect.

R: Really the request here it to yourself to 'slow down a bit and try to notice when you're taking things personally' but if you were going to ask your boss to respond to the needs that have been uncovered by this interaction it might be along the lines of ""Could you remind me of work that I've done for you that you've particularly appreciated or felt that I've worked well with you?""",1522540850

Thanks for sticking it out, I see you have peaked a bit and the rewards have not been pouring in. I figured out that the P2Pool global hashrate has been reduced by 40% for some reasons out of my control. I am not giving up on it , I still have some testing to do. I have moved most of my miners into a solo pool. It is a long game, and I am offering the opportunity to join it, it is hosted by the developer and your extra hashpower would help the block time. it is a commit of 3 weeks plus to block, but the 25 LTC is split only amongst the pool contributors. If you leave 1 miner in my pool like I did the max payout is retained for a while. but the majority of hashpower would be in the solo pool. If you are committed to 20 days+, as I have, please join. anything less is a waste of time. In my opinion, this is a step above solo mining. its a solo pool.  pool.ikolu.ca:9327

All of which is to say the comment that you were responding to again - Malthus hasn't been proven right. ",1522540854

&gt; “In our conversation with African Canadians, we found that Canada’s history of enslavement, racial segregation, and marginalization, has had a deleterious impact on people of African descent which must be addressed in partnership with African Canadian communities,” Mr. Sunga stressed.

Canada's history of enslavement of blacks ? ""In our discussion with African Canadians"" ?  Self reporting ?  

That article is about how ""profiling affects black more"" without going into why that could be.  They automatically assumed racism.

If the motherfucker hadn't been here it wouldn't have happened, correct. That's the difference.  
  
Then you go into some strange nonsense about what-ifs which is frankly ridiculous - we are a nation of laws. If we fail to enforce those laws and people die we have failed our citizens. Period. If you think we should start locking up HS drop outs then petition your reps to sponsor a bill which does so. In the absence of such a law, your what-ifs are pseudo-academic nonsense.   
  
&gt;Please don't try to hop on the Kate Steinle propaganda machine -- you've been lied to about that case.  
  
I do my own research and suggest you do the same so that neither of us are ""lied to.' While he's not walking out a free man, he's only being charge with 'felon in possession of a firearm"" which is a travesty. Kate Steinle is dead because Jose Ines Garcia Zarate negligently pulled the trigger of a gun he was legally barred from having which should have brought manslaughter charges at a bare minimum.
  
&gt;Where are you getting that quote about how much illegal immigrants cost the state of California? Because the US Today article doesn't mention that at all  
  
Hard numbers are difficult given the nature of this but several studies have been done and I'm sure you've used Google before.  
  
&gt;In 2013, Robert Rector and Jason Richwine of The Heritage Foundation released a study concluding that as of 2010, the ""average unlawful immigrant household"" had a net deficit (benefits received minus taxes paid) of $14,387 per household. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_illegal_immigrants_in_the_United_States#Heritage_Foundation_Study)  
  
&gt;The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy released a report in February 2016, stating that 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States are paying annually an estimated amount of $11.64 billion in state and local taxes, ""on average an estimated 8 percent of their incomes."" [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_illegal_immigrants_in_the_United_States#Heritage_Foundation_Study)  
  
The rosier of the two studies above has illegals paying ~8% tax. I pay ~4X as much as I'm sure you do.  
  
And then there is the ~$24 billion illegals remove from the US economy every year in remittances back to Mexico. I just posted a source for this elsewhere and these number are easily found with a quick search.  
  
Your assumptions about the impact of illegal immigration are demonstrably incorrect and the closest you come to making a cogent argument is a kind of ""why pick on illegal immigrants when there are other bad actors here in the US.""  
  
The answer is simple: because we're a nation of laws and they are here illegally. Which other laws do you suggest we just stop enforcing without having a debate as a society?",1522540855

I provide previous historical examples of April Fools events by the Reddit staff and ask a few questions for discussion. There's actually a lot to unpack about the April Fools events and how they've changed in scope over time. If you want me to write a more comprehensive effort post, I won't be able to today since I'm traveling. I didn't want to wait until tomorrow because they would have revealed it by then.

Some points:

* April Fools events have gotten more community focused. It's clear by the sort of analysis and blogs written post-mortem by Reddit staff that this is something their product managers are steering towards. These sort of community projects require a lot more effort to implement, and you might even argue that something like Robin was a product pilot for the new Reddit chat system.

* Before this, the events were mostly cosmetic with simple UI changes. They were funny, but not inherently community driven events. They took jabs at things like Digg, Facebook, and Reddit in a meta sense with Reddit mold. I don't think they'll do something like that this year. I considered that they might do a jab at the Facebook privacy debacle, but that's too recent and I think they'll try something at least as complex as /r/place this year.

* I think they'll try something that will raise online headlines like /r/place, not just to attract users but also to attract employees. You can see this briefly written about in [""Holding the Door Open""](https://redditblog.com/2017/07/25/holding-the-door-open/) and [""How We Built /r/place"".](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/13/how-we-built-rplace/)

Finally, while I kinda see your point about rule 3, just simply typing ""Rule 3"" is not just low effort but really frustrating to see. I actually think this stuff is pretty cool :/",1522540857

"Competitiveoverwatch","t5_34fcy","I could be very wrong, but this is my generalized interpretation of what I’ve witnessed over my life of people’s relationships with their faith.


I think there is a notable difference in being a “cradle Christian” or of a certain denomination from birth, and one who is introduced to it later in life or of their own will as a solution to a problem. The problem with being born into a religion is that much of the teachings are imposed on you whether you understand them or not. Also, much of the real benefit of religion—love of yourself and your neighbor regardless of who they are—is put on the back burner. This is truly disapppainting, because nearly every religion talks about equal love toward everyone. A lot of the focus is instead put on why you shouldn’t love some one or something because of what they are or what they do. Essentially, it’s more focused on hate instead of love. Many people then question why they listen to any part of their religion if so many of the constituents are focused on the hateful parts, and will choose to abandon their faith.


On the other hand, if you find faith on your own or are introduced to it later on in life, you’re looking to you already have somewhat of a moral basis to compare against when you are being told what you should or shouldn’t do. When you’re looking for solutions in faith, I believe you’re more easily able to see the good in the scripture and teachings and are able to look past what some of the congregation thinks of other non-members. If your focus is on the love of others and yourself and acceptance, then faith can go a long way. ",1522540857

"UCSantaBarbara","t5_2shs9","To party? Nowhere on campus. Be very very very fucking careful to party on campus. 

If you’re a freshman, stick to the dorms. Drink with your friends in your rooms and the worst thing that’ll happen if you get caught is a slap on your wrist by the RA. Maybe they won’t care, maybe they’ll make you do CASE (which is a month long program/class about drugs and alcohol.)

IV is also pretty risk free to party in, in terms of getting caught. Apartment and house parties are fun and fine. 

The reason you need to be wary of partying on campus is because there are cops that patrol 24/7 looking for people partying. 4 weeks into my freshman year, I was smoking with some friends by the lagoon around midnight and got pulled up on by cops. We all got legitimate police citations for possession of weed. I had to go to fucking court in downtown Santa Barbara and pay a $300 fine. Worst decision of my life.

Him understanding that he had to make some sacrifices sometimes and give me the full commitment that I needed emotionally meant a lot to ME. So, we’ve learned how to balance our needs. Both of us sacrifice a bit of what we want, but ultimately I learned to like missing him, and he learned to love being in a relationship. No regrets!

Nobody is coming into the movie expecting it purely to be a murder mystery. There's one narrative twist with Jesse Plemons and maybe a few gags referencing the conceit of the movie. 

I don't think there was much to support Horgan's character being a villain when her role seems to clearly be about being the opposite of the dates Ryan usually brings and undercuts him because of that. I don't think her not being a villain was a subverted expectation. 

Trying to get a step ahead of a narrative is definitely some people derive pleasure from - just look at the conversation around Westworld - but its perfectly possible to enjoy the show on a purely narrative level as the show progresses without trying to figure out where it's headed. 

The credits of Game Night are literally a gag showing how Plemmons' character came up with his plan. I think the movie is exactly as clever as it wants to be and is best enjoyed in the moment instead of trying to predict where it'll go. The comedy is in the characters interaction with each other and responses to the situation.

It's not trying to be a Get Out or The Last Jedi with nesting information that pays off on subsequent watches. Which is perfectly fine! ",1522540863

He thought the diplomats were part of a Mongolian conspiracy and had them executed. He killed the next group they sent, too. Genghis Khan was furious. He had tried to be nice, and he’d been repaid with dead diplomats. He set up an army of 200,000 soldiers, attacked, and completely destroyed Khwarezmia.Even after he’d won, Khan sent two armies to burn down every castle, town, and farm they found to make sure that no hint of Khwarezmia survived.

[Probably should tell /r/metalcore that](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/wiki/metalcore_history)

&gt;And you also can't post shit loads of the most famous metal bands in the world on r/metal, 

I'm baffled, what does this jabe to do with nu metal? The blacklist is for over posted bands and is always pointed to when people say ""where do I start?"". It honestly looks like you don't even understand what the list is.

&gt;If AllMusic and Wikipedia consider you a metal genre, you're probably a metal genre.

Wikipedia also thinks medievil metal is a genre and that any metal band with lyrics about Vikings is the same genre. There's a reason why metal archives gets used.

&gt;Your argument is ""Well no they're not metal even though the literal definition of the subgenre is metal

If a metal band one day starts getting called heavy funk by magazines and it catches on it's still not accurate. 

&gt;because I and other people said so because uhhh let me describe five different influences, one of which is fucking metal

Because it's clearly downtuned rock. Yes metal is one of the influences, but as you said one of a load. Madonna learned to play guitar through playing Pantera and that influenced her, she's still not metal.

&gt;I'd like you to seriously explain to me how ""Blind"" by Korn or ""Counterfeit"" by Limp Bizkit or literally any Deftones album aren't metal songs.

Blind doesn't have a metal style riff, it's rhythmic chugging akin to hardcore or rock. No metal subgenre employs that kind of riff to carry it. The entire song is based around the bass line and the rhythm, not a riff. That's instantly a big contrast to metal. Korn mostly relies on that and often basically makes a beat for Davies to sort of rap over (Here To Stay, for example). The structure is hip-hop esq.

Counterfeit literally goes into Durst rapping over a static instrumental with no guitar riff like 10 seconds in, has hardcore shouting vocals on the chorus and again uses rhythm over riffs. Like how is it not clearly drawing way more from rap than metal when the core of the song is just rap?

You've yet to actually say why any of these bands are metal asides from ""the nameeee"". It's hard for me to say why they're not something when i don't even know why you think they are. Like musically they clearly have way more in common with rock, punk and hip-hop than metal, so why does it bother you so much? It's not a statement of quality.",1522540864

Probably enhancement, windwalker, or fury. Affliction too if multi target.

Not really, other than stuff dying faster. A good tank will have good positioning and do good damage himself which helps the raid. 

&gt; Could a perfectly played holy priest solo heal a raid, allowing the DPS and tanks to play riskier, allowing for better clear speed

&gt;That looks to me not just a violation of due process, but based on the texts of the 1965 Consular Convention between Britain and the USSR and the 1963 Vienna Convention which I have seen also a violation of both British and international law.

&gt;Given the increasingly strange look the facts of the case are taking (see above), it is however perhaps not so surprising that the British are reluctant to share with the Russians the full facts of the case.

Glad to hear that. (See also the addendum to my earlier comment)

&gt; I wonder if you have looked into English Common Law as a basis for constitutional review.

Briefly, but I can find no reference to ""common law"" in the main body of the Constitution, and only one in reference in the Amendments:

**Bill of Rights - Amendment VII**

* ""**In Suits at common law**, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.

I have found no specific reference to ""Judicial Review"" or to ""precedent"" in the Body of the Constitution or in the Amendments.

While the framers were certainly influenced to *some* degree by English (and other) legal systems in the crafting the Constitution, there also is ample evidence showing that they eschewed many aspects of those systems. 

Had they intended to incorporate ""Judicial Review"" or other aspects of Common Law, they would, I think, have provided reference alluding to those aspects, or added instructive verbiage, especially in Article III, where the Powers of the Judicial Branch are enumerated.

World Class fine dining. Great and my favorite, but not really exceptional when compared to similar styles closer to you. London has the same class of experience, so it might not be important to do in New York. Also consider bar rooms and lounges at the various high end restaurants if you want a similar experience. The modern bar room, for instance, is cheaper than the modern, doesn’t require reservations, and you could walk in from the street dressed not great. It isn’t as fun as a full meal at the modern, but way easier. Most high end restaurants have things like this. 

Lots of ethnic food. I can’t elaborate. Not my thing. But certainly a lot of good stuff. 

Food halls/smorgasburg/patisserie style stuff. Tons and tons and tons of food in small portions around the city if you want to try a bunch of stuff. Chelsea has the most famous and it goes well with the high line, but there is the plaza food hall at the bottom of central park, Gotham west which is by the intrepid (decommissioned aircraft carrier turned into a museum that also has one of the best views of midtown), vandy food hall by grand central and Bryant Park, turnstyle at Columbus circle, and more around Manhattan and Brooklyn. Or just go around Chelsea or the villages getting bites here and there. Lots of great doughnuts and lots of great ice cream. I’d strongly encourage you to make a list of a few places to check out like these in whatever neighborhoods you’ll otherwise find yourself in. ",1522540867

He figures out that it's important to talk about protecting democracy, that anti-Semitic remarks and jokes are not acceptable, and more, to the point where he's doing pretty well.

No laboratory experiments can be performed with regard to human action ... Its statements and propositions are not derived from experience.

It's basically an economics religion; a bunch of theories (which they call praxeology) which boil down to ""unquestionable,"" unverifiable axioms that are held as fundamental truths. We can empirically demonstrate the existence of market failures, but [the Mises Institute actively denies their existence.](https://mises.org/library/market-failure-myth) The logic goes along the lines that bad things are bad, so the market won't let them happen because no one wants bad things to happen. Stuff like monopolies can't happen without government intervention, supposedly, because the market can solve that -- ignoring that information isn't perfect and that a monopoly can act unfaithfully and do things like selling at a loss to drive competitors out of the market, or buying up competitors, or any of a dozen other things.

"AskTrumpSupporters","t5_3cr3o","This statement is so funny considering America was founded by a band of murderers from the Old World that wiped out millions of Native Americans and later kept millions of Africans as slaves on plantations committing gross human rights violations.

These auto theft/ kidnapping/ drug possession crimes (especially considering they have served prison sentences and not committed any other crimes since then) are pretty minor in comparison, no? Hell, marijuana possession is not really a big deal anymore and quite legal now in several states.

You yourself are probably a descendant of someone who killed Native Americans or kept African slaves having indirectly benefitted from the crimes of the past. Yet your family got multiple chances to try and correct the sins of the past and contribute to society in a positive manner, and -as a result- here you are born as a patriotic American wanting to make their country better.

Why should these ""illegal"" people also not get a second chance at life (considering they have not repeated their offences, served prison time, and -in half the cases- are actually legal permanent residents). 


Life is NOT black and white- unfortunately a lot of Americans conveniently choose to ignore the second chances their families have gotten over the past decades and centuries, and are too quick to call for the guillotine for people who weren't born in the USA (through no fault of their own) and have done enough to show they can be contributing members of society.


By your brand of ""no second chances"" justice your ancestors should have been hung for their atrocities (meaning you would never have been born).

"patientgamers","t5_2t3ad","I mean you can tell just walking in the door to Demon Ruins. No new enemies, just randomly reused bosses now with less HP. There’s also the worm enemies who don’t do anything other than destroy your gear, making it pointless to fight them. 

First you’ve got a great battle with Ceaseless Discharge, a boss I actually forgot because you can kill him in under thirty seconds and because of that there’s no real point in actually fighting him. Moving on. So you go on and duke it out with Demon Firesage, which is a reskin of the Stray Demon which is a reskin of Asylum Demon. Firesage I believe has exactly one new move, and fighting the third Demon is already an awful sign. 

You move on to Centipede Demon almost immediately - notice how little space is between a bunch of forgettable bosses. Centipede literally is one of the most boring bosses in the game. He jumps around, attacks a little bit, and then jumps again. If you run in the lava you die, if you don’t you’ll be fine because this dude can’t get through a basic kite shield. 

The whole gimmick of Lost Izalith is that it’s covered in lava because of the result of the witches turning into the Bed of Chaos. Home of demons, source of like 90% of the enemies in the game, this place should rival Anor Londo given its lore implications. That’s the lore. The reality is that it’s an eye-bleeding red floor area with one shit temple building, one pyramid thing leading to Bed, and a bunch of stupid low res dragon asses with zero lore implications that waddle around. Also you lose a ring slot to put on the lava ring that has some stupid lore behind it related to Discharge being an idiot. Also there’s only one bonfire and it’s in the shit temple that’s a solid two minute run. 

To top off this area that disappoints the lore and gameplay expectations of most players is a boss fight that looks at the skill and thought required to beat many other bosses and says “nah let’s have a PLATFORMING section”. It is the only boss where progress is saved between deaths, as if the devs knew that sweeping you to your death over and over wasn’t fun. 

So to give a short rundown of why it feels rushed: uninspired, generic, and unforgettable bosses rushed in a very short period of time; ugly areas; platforming in a game that does not support that; enemies that are rehashed old bosses; really shitty lore implications; and a complete butchering of one of the most important characters in the history of Soulsborne (Witches of Izalith).

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Consent before sex should apply equally to both people involved. Most colleges that require students to attend some kind of seminar about consent and safe sex also talk about how the girl needs to get consent from the guy too. If someone treats consent as a less serious requirement from men than from women, then that is absolutely a double standard. 

If you were curious about the sociological causes of this difference in perception, it can be chalked up to what's often called ""toxic masculinity."" A lot of people hear that term and think it means that masculinity is toxic, but it actually refers to unhealthy behaviors and notions that are considered masculine, even though they're harmful. 

In this example, the idea that any ""real man"" would want to have sex with any girl that showed interest and that it would be ""unmanly"" to not want to have sex with a girl is an example of toxic masculinity.

In places like the Philippines, China, India, and so on, people with money do X and people without do Y. Here if you’re making a living and getting ahead, then you could be worth a million dollars or nothing at all and it wouldn’t matter. 

I think when people make those kinds of comments, they’re just really insecure. It’s like in China, rich people want to flaunt their wealth with luxury cars and clothes. I’m America most millionaires wear blue jeans and shops in bulk at Costco and could care less.

Not really. All you ""know"" is that you don't **currently** have any understanding about how things could be the way they are now without some being having those qualities. But you can only get there by special pleading, by saying that this being is different from all other beings (because something has to be, if you want to avoid an infinite regress). To me, though, saying a being has no potential and is non-temporal is no more believable than saying that there is an infinite regress, and yet we're still here at the present (finite) time. *Both* of those models seem impossible to me, so your argument really just sounds to me like, ""X seems impossible within the framework of human understanding, therefore Y (which also seems impossible within the framework of human understanding, but aligns more closely with my worldview) must be true.""

"anime","t5_2qh22","Rewatcher here:

During the mid-series discussion I mentioned how the pacing of the show felt slow for me. But the second half of the show just made it worse. Overall, my main comments about the show remain pretty much the same. We did get some focus on Windermere, which was one of the aspects that was sorely lacking during the first half of the show. But my impression of them only worsened, and not even Kassim could salvage their role as villains.

Episode 18 remains the best part of the second half with how it all went crazy awesome. Unfortunately, the show can't seem to take advantage of the momentum it builds, best exemplified by episode 19 - I have said before that it was quite a treat -   which was ultimately a long exposition that didn't really do much in moving the plot and only gave a bit of the background setting.

And I really feel like they squandered a lot of opportunities here, with Mirage the primary casualty, as she's pretty much relegated to being a supporting character despite having top billing. Her personal conflict is already a subplot in itself. I also wished Kaname was given more screentime especially at the final episode after her little talk with Arad. But in the end these were pretty much set aside in favor of events that did not feel like it needed a full episode even though they were still somewhat essential (i.e. the concert episode). And that's a pity, because I really do think the show had potential.

In some ways it felt like an odd marriage between the fantastical aspects of Macross 7 and Frontier's brand of scifi. The setting expanded the idea of the Protoculture further, and some of the personal developments were engaging. I really liked Hayate's Var-like reaction and it's effect on his relationship with Freyja, and Mikumo's little arc which felt like it could have been a little bit longer. The presentation could have been better, but there's not much we can do here. Despite all that, I found the ending quite poignant if only because of Freyja.

I wasn't quite happy with my painting of the head visor so that's still missing from the build. I'm still dreading putting on the decals, but the rest of the body is already there - minus the pilot, and the accessories that would only be of use during transformations. Speaking of the transformations, the gerwalk mode is pretty much intuitive. But for some reason I just can't seem to get it right working on the torso for the battroid form. But the fighter mode is really sleek and had more character than the Messiah without it's armor parts.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","True, but my point was that ""Skandinavia"", in the Nordic countries, is used as a term for Norway, Sweden, and Denmark only. The term defines the region of countries in which the citizens share a ***mutually intelligible*** North Germanic language as well the shared North Germanic heritage. Finnish doesn't even share the same roots as the other languages, and Icelandic isn't mutually intelligible with the Scandinavian languages.

I fully understand that in the English speaking world, Scandinavia has come to mean the same thing as the Nordic countries, but that still came about because of misinformation. Besides, what's the point of having two terms for the same thing.

A few quick Wikipedias:

English:  
Scandinavia is a region in Northern Europe, characterized by common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and ***mutually intelligible*** North Germanic languages.

Norsk:  
Skandinavia er en geografisk, historisk, kulturell og språklig region som består av Danmark, Norge og Sverige. Skandinavia er kjennetegnet av det skandinaviske ***dialektkontinuumet***, som utgjør ***gjensidig forståelige*** nordiske språk.

Svenska:  
Skandinavien är ett geografiskt område i norra Europa som omfattar Danmark och den Skandinaviska halvøn med Norge och Sverige, där man talar ***skandinaviska språk***.

I omvärlden inbegrips ibland hela Norden i namn som engelskans något diffusa *Scandinavia* eller motsvarande på andra språk. På engelska har begreppet *the Nordic Countries* inte fått något större genomslag, och engelskspråkiga historiker, statsvetare och andra forskare har inkluderat Finland i *Scandinavia* eftersom Finland har en mycket lång gemensam historia med Sverige.

Dansk:  
På dansk omfatter Skandinavien i dag Danmark, Norge og Sverige, mens Den Skandinaviske halvø, kun er betegnelsen for Norge og Sverige, denne fortolkning bruges hovedsageligt når man tale rent grafisk. Det engelske “Scandinavia” inkluderer også Finland og Island. Dette område kaldes sammen med Grønland og Færøerne for “***Norden***” på dansk. Undertiden bruges udtrykket *de nordiske* lande ***fejlagtigt*** om Skandinavien, og omvendt.

Íslenska:  
Greina má milli þriggja nota:   sem landafræði- og jarðfræðilegthugtak yfir löndin Noreg, Svíþjóð og þann hluta Finnlands sem er á ***Skandinavíuskaga***.

Skandinavía sem pólitískt og menningarlegt hugtak yfir þau samfélög sem hafa ***skandinavísk mál*** að móðurmáli, það er dönsku, norsku eða sænsku.

Á mörgum tungumálum er Skandinavía notað sem samheiti yfir Norðurlönd. Það er að auk Danmerkur, Noregs og Svíþjóðar, eru einnig Ísland, Færeyjar, Finnland, Áland og Grænland talin til Skandinavíu.

"dragonballfighterz","t5_3ltwg","&gt;They couldn‘t have risen that high if there neutral game wasn‘t good.

Demon rank isn't high at all. I've had folk admit that they've mashed jab with jab friendly characters all the way to demon rank. Plenty of folk that thrive on 10f lag with literally no neutral game too. It's staggering how many people don't have true meaty follow ups and bad block strings that get jabbed out of for free.

 Demon rank is indicative of knowing core concepts of the game like 2H'ing aerials and properly teching to avoid block string loops. Granted, if you can't hit confirm from a 3 jab auto combo into a little more damage, you don't deserve demon, but that's elementary. 

 The ranking system in this game before SS3 rank is heterogenous in design. As long as you have the slightest concept of how the rock paper scissor functions of this game works, you will rise in rank the more you play unless you're not absorbing any knowledge whatsoever. The better players will obviously advance further in rank past SS3, and the weaker ones will be one step below. On top of this fact, the game rewards low ranks for losing, while high ranks lose 3kbp per loss and gain only 1k unless they fight the same rank. ",1522540879

Yes, if you haven't noticed, when a coin - or the market in this case - is pumping, it is because the hype is proportionally increasing. The longer we can keep the hype up, the more we will continue to pump; but as soon as the hype reaches its peak, then the opposite happens. As the hype dies down, so does the market. This is exactly what that 'wall street cheat sheet' summarizes. Also, just like you saw 5x+ gains in a month, seeing a 60% loss is not as crazy as you're trying to make it sound. 

And from the looks of it, you seem to be someone who is very emotionally hurt from this market 'crash'. And I'm genuinely curious as to what you define a shitcoin - because I bet it is an incredibly loose one.",1522540879

Obviously she has mental health issues but nothing that seems extreme or indicates that she can't grow into a functioning adult.

"singapore","t5_2qh8c","I'm not admitting anything, I just did not take your original intend on your thread seriously because as I said, you don't seem to be fully aware of the issues that preceded yours and you don't seem to address the key points that I and several others have made.  You cherry pick comments that agrees with you and counter some points with baseless comparisons (""yeah but in Asia/China people are also doing the same things so that counters all the bad things that foreigners do).  

&gt;&gt; Half of it I can't find justification for (like the rape of Asian women being statistically greater than any other race), and anyway it doesn't add much to the conversation. It seems the point **you keep trying to make is that there is white on Asian racism**. 

Um...but isn't that the whole point of your initial question?  People don't talk to you because they don't trust you.  It's that simple.  ""Whites"" have created a bad rep for themselves in Asia for as long as people can remember, that's why people don't trust/like them, and that's why foreigners only want to seek out those who are unaffected them to pretend that such problems didn't exist (or shove the real issue under the rug).

&gt;&gt;  I've said I accept that and that your anger is justified, but you're never going to get me to say that this justifies more racist behaviour. What are you expecting me to do? Apologize on behalf of every white person who ever did anything wrong? I'm well aware of my people's history and it's not something I'm proud of, but it doesn't define me as an individual. 

I'm not angry at all, cool as a cucumber actually.  But it's interesting how passive you are when you are presented with facts and you don't do anything about them.  Instead, you become blameless.  I'm sorry, but it is your responsibility to be aware of how much racism has affected minorities back home.  Asians are very non-threatening people, they don't have a grudge to bear or insecurity issues.  As immigrants in UK, they had to adapt, they had to shut up when something was wrong, nobody gave them a seat on the bus or train when they needed one.  It puzzles me that you didn't know any of these things and that you lack this much empathy.  Really really strange that.

&gt;&gt; I've given up responding to you because all you do is say my experiences are incorrect with absolutely no justification. You even tried calling me out on my love life in a ridiculous way that makes no sense at all. You asked about marriage and I said I was open to meeting a life partner. A lady I've seen 3 times is not a life partner. You're just being aggressive and a bit pathetic. 

No.  You either gave incomplete or different answers.  ""Open to dating"" does not mean ""currently dating"".  If you want to establish a platform of trust then you need to provide accurate answers, otherwise no one can trust you or take you seriously. 

&gt;&gt; Don't pretend you were trying to have a positive discussion. It's obvious you're just here to take out your anger on me. I think I'm an odd target though. I'm sure there are plenty of racists on Reddit you could have a really satisfying argument with to affirm your depressing world view. 

But I'm not angry at you, in fact I'm willing to continue this discussion as long as you are, as long as you can answer the points that I took the time to write for you.  But your unwillingness to talk about this (in fact you started this thread because that was what you wanted to do) makes me wonder if you were in fact serious?

&gt;&gt; You're not doing anything to improve relations between our cultures here. At least I'm trying.

I've worked in Asia for over 10 years with both Asian and international students all over, currently living in China and I'm actually improving relations here significantly.  But the difference between you and me is that I'm actually pro-active in building cross-cultural relations, I don't think my culture is superior in any way and I put theirs before mine.  Oh, and learning multiple languages is the least I can do to respect our Asian friends.",1522540880

Supports are definitely important, but the fact that they didn't get enough chapters to themselves enough to develop better, that is still a problem, and again, Part 2 is filler.

One example here that is annoying is Rising Sun - I wouldn't want a non-minis version, because it adds to the theme of the game. But the KS edition at least has waaay too much plastic. Minis are too big, take up too much space. I'd *prefer* buying a version where the minis are literally half the size, which would surely be more cost effective as many more minis per mould etc.

""Alright then. If you do not believe me, why do you think I was here? Please, give me what you believe to be your warped truth in this situation.

Angry at this whole damned mission, that will end up getting her killed, and yet if she left, she would continue to follow it, even though she has fallen so close to death.

""I am surprised you haven't figured out the answer yet. You call me a thief, and yet you wonder why I am skulking about in a place where even your damned *plates* would be considered extremely valuable. You wouldn't even notice them missing the vast wealth you hold, you'd just get some servant girl to replace them within the hour!""

She had said too much and in her rage and let her tongue slip, thankfully not too much though, now having to change the game plan as she stared down death.

""You wish to toss me aside like some dog, fine. But you should know that I have skills that no other person in the known world has, I can say that with confidence. Just know what value was held within this cell. I managed to get inside the Red Keep with nobody even *knowing* who I was, and I had stepped foot within the Red Keep unknown until I took that second step. How many could say the same?

I have friends in Essos, spying on various events should they happen, namely in Braavos and Tyrosh, whom would be out of a job with me gone, a waste to everyone involved.""

""So how much am I potentially valued at? Am I as worthless as the other smallfolk that died the plague? Or could I be of use to the goddamned King himself?""

This flushes away the minerals and returns the desired ionic charge. After a period of brine, regular potable water is used to flush away the brine. During regeneration the softener is in a bypass mode so that this nasty brine and rinse water goes down the drain and the household gets unsoftened water.  Fancier systems might have two units to take turns so that output is always softened. Regeneration can be triggered by a simple timer or something that actually measures the amount of water delivered. ",1522540885

"gopro","t5_2rvat","an update regarding Quicksync support for VLC.
I was able, once quicksync was enabled, to get 60FPS HEVC at 100% speed.  
  
To determine if quicksync is enabled:  run “dxdiag” and save it as a text file.  Look in the text file and look for “quick sync” under the “Video Encoders:” section.  Mine showed up as  “Hardware H265 Encoder MFT” “mfx_mfx_h265ve_64.dll”

If it is there, you are in good shape.  (look to the next step)

If it is not there, check your bios, there should be an option about local Video card force enable, or similar.   (There was one on my Asus motherboard).    Reboot your machine and run “dxdiag” and it should appear.  
  
My alternate if this did not work, was to get a $8 HDMI Null adapter from amazon.  I did not test this, but it looks like a viable choice, if all else fails.

Step 2:  
You will then want to make a custom VLC shortcut, or update your earlier one,  so that it has the following options:  
  
-—avcodec-threads=X —-avcodec-hw=none —-rate=1.0 —sout-transcode-venc=qsv,x265  
  
Remember - “X” is the number of logical threads you have.  
  
I can confirm that this works on a 12 core 8700K at full speed.

"slatestarcodex","t5_30m6u","&gt;No self-proclaimed ""Marxist"" government has ever even claimed they were basing their policies on the 10 points in the Manifesto 

And yet the Marxist governments did indeed carry out the said 10 points - with the exception of that point 9 about abolishing the distinction between the town and country. Including, to give them their due, public education. Oh, and the Soviets did try to improve soil quality (point 7) but in practice worsened it. And the Soviets did reverse their abolition of inheritance (point 3) after a few years.

This is how I got started using those 10 points from chapter 2: it short circuits all those people claiming ""they weren't Marxist"". 

&gt;can you explain why you think they'd be illiberal even in the best-case scenario? 

Yes, I thought that was indeed what I was explaining all the way along. Under democratic central control (I assume we agree that democracy is the best-case, or at least the least-worst) minorities can't pursue their interests unless they can persuade the majority to agree. Thus my examples of 1960s hippies, Jehovah Witnesses, and BDSM geeks in a world of 1960s hippies. 

&gt;For example public control of ""means of communication"" doesn't imply censorship, 

Indeed, it implies far worse than that. A central authority deciding what is communicated. Scary stuff. 

&gt;If ""rebels"" are defined as those who break certain laws, then whether this is illiberal should really depend on the laws in question, it's already true in the US that there are crimes that can lead to a person's assets being seized

Yes, the US government does act in a number of illiberal ways. When I mentioned said government's treatment of Native Americans, I used that because it was a particularly strong example of the limitations of democracy. It's certainly not the only one. 

Note: I'm not American myself, and I often worry that the reason the US government strikes me as rather illiberal is not that the NZ government is better but that the US government has a lot more English-speaking people monitoring and reporting on it.

&gt;And if ""abolition of property in land"" does refer only to large money-making farms, is it your opinion that putting any specific sector of the economy under government control (whether health care or rail lines or road-building) is inherently illiberal

Yes. Under some circumstances government control may be unavoidable  (e.g. defence forces, road-building), and there are ways of mitigating the risks, but central control is always dangerous. And the more of the economy is put under central control the more illiberal it is. Voting is a blunt instrument of feedback, the more a vote affects (e.g. laws + defence + roads + education + public housing +++), the harder it is to vote your preferences. 

In the case of healthcare, I will add that public-funding is not the same as public control; the UK for example has a private healthcare system along with the NHS. 

&gt;I don't think there is any ""authoritative"" definition any more than there's an authoritative definition of what it means to be a Hegelian or a Nietzchean

Sure. But there are more and less authoritative descriptions. E.g. I am an opponent of Marxism - any description by me is clearly unauthoritative. A description by a self-proclaimed Marxist would be a bit more authoritative than mine, a description by Karl Marx himself is even more authoritative. Particularly if it was put into practice by self-proclaimed Marxists.

The Communist Manifesto's 10 points are not ""the authoritative definition"" but they're the *most* authoritative description I know of which is why I use them. ",1522540887

"ShinyPokemon","t5_2se9w","I think my most valuable shinies have to be my Unown, my Primarina, my Zorua, and my Celebi. 

1) I consider Unown to be my first shiny. After a pretty bad breakup with an ex a few years ago (he cheated/was emotionally abusive) I was pretty depressed. My friend convinced me to complete a Living Dex, to try to get me out of my funk. After I completed it, I opted to go to Diamond to catch all of the Unown forms. I finally got all of the letters and moved on to the special room off Route 214, and the first Pokémon I encountered was my Shiny Question Mark Unown. I just laughed, and decided to start up another Living Dex, but all shiny forms

2) For Primarina, I decided to Soft Reset for Popplio in Ultra Moon when it first came out. The cutscene was ~2 minutes long, and it took me around three weeks before I finally got it. 1796 SRs in total

3) Zorua was one of my first hunted shinies. I'm pretty sure it was my first hunted shiny, but I'm honestly not sure. I DexNaved for the little dude in Omega Ruby before I reset the game to SR for legendaries.

4) I just got Celebi the other day - Celebi was my first FULL full odds hunt (other than HGSS starter resets, but I don't count them since they're three at a time) so it already has a special place in my heart, but this guy means a bit more - My father was paralyzed on March 8th, and I've been a wreck for a while.

"grandorder","t5_39d7x","&gt; There is, Nasu himself saying ""Old fate"" in his commentary

No, there isn't. The original novel and everything else are all still canon.

&gt; You didnt even read Chapter, do you? 1. Rama said thats Cu strongest hero here and he might be strongest Lancer (knowing Karna's power). Also he said hes too powerfull for them. 2. Medb said that Cu is strongest of all that she saw (Arjuna and Karna she also already saw). 3. In the final moments Scathach said that Cu was the strongest. Deal with it

No, he didn't.

Medb is delusional and also said he couldn't lose to Guda right before Guda obliterates him four times in a row.

Scathach also says she could have destroyed him if she wanted to, but didn't since that would also destroy the singluarity.

&gt; YES, it has nothing do with FGO while FGO is new headcanon in Fate with new stories about Gil's powers for example

No, you ignoramus, Top Servants are literally a Moon Cell mechanic and aren't a thing outside of it.

&gt; I thought you didnt read FGO chapters but it seems not only it. Nasu: ""We didn't elaborate on this in the game, but Lancer was actually battling against Gil for half a day before he lost, so I think it's safe to say that Gil sustained some serious injuries in that encounter."" And you are saying that Cu didnt even hurt him. Another point that you dont even know about facts in the lore

""Serious injuries"".

Is completely fine within a few hours. Despite having a more or less human body at that point.

Yeah, that's totally relevant.

&gt; It is about it, in the Solomon Chapter everyone sevants that were summoned were able to kill Demon Pillars And thats funny to see how Cu would be shoot by arrow with his high Agility and with Protection from Arrows

The Servants summoned there are all getting giant buffs because of the way they get summoned.

Pashupata isn't an arrow, dude. It's a giant nuke that he teleports to the enemy.

&gt; Another point where you dont even know shit ""It seems like Scathach's Saint Graph is on another level compared to other Servants. It might be because of her connection with Norse Skadi, wich means she is not with her full powers right now""

And you think that says what, exactly? Her graph is different because of the weird circumstances around her summoning. Also her being weakened the whole time is not exactly good for your argument since even like this she says she could have killed Cu whenever she wanted.

In the first place, the part of her profile that says this in the complete/materials just says she has another stronger version besides this one.

&gt; She didnt say it. Proove it or its another point where you totaly wrong

What is reading comprehension. They literally talk about him regenerating from damage in the first few lines.

Incidentally, Cu explicitly refers to her trying to drag him into the land of Shadows as her being considerate towards him, implying she just didn't want to kill him.

And he says that his transformation is the only thing that he has that can hurt her, and it only works because it surprises her so much she flat out stops moving.

&gt; Yes he was, it was from the beginning she said about him

No, he wasn't. The dude literally walks off because he doesn't want to fight anymore, she had no control over him.

&gt; It is about power ranking, because it was in context where it was said that fame makes servant stronger

No, it bloody isn't. Top Servants are Servants summoned by the Moon Cell directly to deal with a threat, as opposed to the other normal Servants.

&gt; He did it. Not just injured, it also ""serious injures"". I proved with Nasu's words, while you didnt prove anything

Yeah, sure. Like you ""proved"" there weren't Gil-tier Servants (nasu says there were), ""proved"" Scathach has a super Saint Graph (the thing you referenced only says she has a stronger version), ""proved"" you had any idea at all what Top Servants are (lol no), and ""proved"" a bunch of statements immediately shown to be wrong somehow overwrite anything in canon at all (ya didn't. The joke is that you didn't do any of that)

&gt; Yes and also Cu can kill Arcuied wich is strongest creature on Earth, also Fate is about conceptual fights not your booms

First, Arcuied explicitly gets smeared by Gil, so not a good comparison, and second, she would completely obliterate Cu Alter.

&gt; It also stated

No it isn't. You just can't read.

&gt; That guy said that Cu didnt even hit Gil and now talking about how less I know about Nasuverse. You are actually delusional

If not Splat (also hair dye) has their own version and I think they're in more places. Again, they might not interact nicely with the chemicals in the gloss so DIY at your own peril. 

Alternatively sulfates (sodium laureth sulfate? I think specifically) you're supposed to avoid post dying because they eat the color faster than not sulfated shampoos and conditioners. IF you want the color to come out a little faster, that might help. Dish soap in my opinion is not worth the damage and the drying it does to hair. 

Sucks about the crappy dye job, it is SO HARD to find a good salon since sometimes the one star review is ""My brown is the wrong shade of brown, I wanted Tawny and I got Tauny!"" and sometimes it's ""My hair is literally sea foam green and has the consistency of Easter grass after this stylist butchered my hair"".

In this week's review I thought I would review the Re.2000 serie 1 (Tier I; Battle Rating 2.0 Italian Fighter) which was introduced as part of Update 1.77.

If you are interested in knowing more about the history behind the Reggiane Re.2000 (including the serie 1 variant); or how the Re.2000 serie 1 handles (in my opinion) in Arcade; this video may be of use to you.

"inkarnate","t5_39krf","That works in literally every single area. Its not about putting a different color in focus, its more about giving the area a little variety, which would occur naturally. 

How I usually do that (same ""how-to"" i posted under VitriolicRugs Map):

1) Find the area you want to work on and mark the brush you used, you'll need it later (brush A).

2) Select one or more brushpatterns (brush B, C, and so on) that you want to add to the mix with a very small brush size and the softness 1.

3) Scatter small patches of that brush across the area you want to work on.

4) Select the brush A with pixlesize 1 and softness 1. Now blend out the patches you scattered across the area. You'll notice that brush B will shine through in some places, creating a different ""feeling"" when looking at it.

5) recommendations:

a) For more depth I recommend using darker shades of green- or browntones, depending on the base colour.

b) For a warmer feeling i use either yellow or orange brush patterns. c) For a colder feeling i use blue tones.

"samharris","t5_2thqg","I think there is a dimension to showering which is to be more sexually attractive. Would you disagree? Do you think that showering is entirely a non-sexual display?

&gt;The point is that in order to warrant being called a sexual display, a behaviour probably has to be done with the primary purpose of attracting someone sexually.

We're in agreement, for the most part. Obviously there is a spectrum. Showering is on the spectrum - a part of showering is to be more sexually attractive. I doubt anyone would disagree with that. Although, a large part of showering is to fit in socially. It is expected of one another to shower - or at least to not smell bad and to be presentable.

Insofar as wearing make-up is EXPECTED of you, simply to be presentable, then wearing make-up may not be mostly for sexual display. And, therefore it may not be hypocritical to wear make-up and complain about sexual harassment.

However, insofar as wearing make-up is primarily a sexual display (as you have noted) then it may be hypocritical to wear and then complain about sexual harassment. SINCE, you are taking advantage of the benefits of wearing make-up and then complaining about the consequences.

Jordan Peterson lays out a fairly simply case that the primary purpose of make-up is to become more sexually attractive. I think this is a fair point. However, while this may have been the original purpose of make-up (and still probably is a main purpose of make-up) it has become so engrained in our culture that it seems to be expected of women - such that, TO NOT wear make-up is to fail to live up to a standard; in the same way that TO NOT shower is to fail to live up to a standard. Therefore, if one accepts this line of argumentation then EVEN THOUGH make-up has a primarily purpose of making one more sexually attractive, it may not be hypocritical to wear make-up and complain about sexual harassment.

Anyways, thats one way I would argue against Jordan Peterson. ",1522540897

There had been several foreign guests at the capital as of late, to be sure, but none had raised quite the stir that this one did and it seemed that he was here to stay. Laenor did not mind, brother would no longer slay brother in a meaningless war started by a long-dead king who favoured one son over another and mayhaps the Seven would approve and bless the realm. 

However, it seemed that not everyone in the capital shared his attitude, as the Red Dragon had been put through quite the ordeal. Laenor could not blame the man's persecuters, not truly, for the wars with the Targaryens had lasted for a hundred years and claimed many lives, though this Jaehaerys held little and less blame for the ugly affair. The young Septon had put off talking with the man for a while, but as often is the case, his curiosity got the better of him and the librarian forced himself from his table, took his cane and set himself on his way to the castle gardens. 

Upon locating the man he was looking for, Laenor would brush the long silver hair from his face and smile.

I have always had morals and am kind to people but he always told me I was just a mean person that would never find anyone to love me.

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","Oily skin is often genetic, and influenced by hormones. Sometimes you can hydrate a ton, but your skin will still produce a lot of oil. What kind of climate do you live in? If you live in a humid climate, this can impact oil production, and just focusing on hydration may not be the best option. Check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/627svl/research_overhydration_can_cause_acne_a_psa_for/). Of course a lot of products aimed for oily skin can be stripping, and it's important to not dehydrate your skin. If you use retinoids or salicylic acid then regular moisturizing is important.  

In studies, niacinamide has been found to reduce sebum production. This is still highly individual, it won't reduce sebum production for everyone, but using products with niacinamide is still a good option and worth a try. Niacinamide is also a great moisturizer, so you won't be drying out your skin. I really love Skinlex 10% niacinamide, but The Ordinary's 10% niacinamide is an hg for a lot of people! If The Ordinary ends up breaking you out (it broke me out) I do suggest giving Skinlex a try. There are a ton of different niacinamide products, [the hg anti aging thread lists a lot of options](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/83s8x4/skin_concerns_the_antiaging_hg_thread_share_your/) in the comment section. 

What does your routine look like right now? I think cleansing every night is important for oily skin, it prevents acne...but it's important to not over cleanse. Twice a day should be the max amount of times you cleanse your face. 

[This research article discusses more treatment options for oily skin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605215/).

Magus endangered others in order to get out of isolation. both were not exactly having the best time when these things happened, but the difference in how they handled it was clear. also, keep in mind that this was Ellen trying to be evil, and Magus trying to be good",1522540901

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My ex actually had this happen a few times, where someone (guy or girl) came to her rescue. And once, my dog barked at a guy who made her uncomfortable, though I guess that's not the same thing... He pulled the tired ""Smile, gorgeous"" bullshit. She told him to smile, his friends laughed at him, then he said, ""I just wanted to see a smile on that beautiful face, bitch."" Then my dog started barking at him. She said she seemed almost vicious. GF then said ""What she said,"" and walked away.

I'm curious about something, though. I'm not an intimidating guy, and if I see a girl uncomfortable with guys she doesn't know and they're intimidating, I'd rather avoid getting my ass kicked. Would a better intervention be something like pretending I knew you and walking over and saying, ""Hey, sorry I'm late"" so they think you're with someone?",1522540901

"autism","t5_2qhs6","&gt; No 2 autistic people are the same

This is the key takeaway though. There is a world of difference between myself, a late diagnosed ASD person, who was able to marry and have a fulfilling life, despite being an outsider and looked at as 'weird' while growing up. I was also a high performing student and excelled in school, while being a complete failure most at social situations. I wouldn't want to be any different than I am, I love my life, and I would resent any atempt to 'cure' me.

Contrast that with both of my sons, who are speech delayed, have extreme difficulties with learning and mastering skills for their ages, and are far less able to function in the world. I worry about their ability to have fulfilling lives and would not wish the burden their mother and I have endured on any other parents. Yes I see them as beautiful and unique, but I also feel they will likely miss out on many opportunities and will have a much harder time in life than I did. Wanting a better life for them, wanting to know more about their conditions and the causes of Autism, is not 'Eugenics'. It's the proper place of a loving parent.",1522540901

The only major things to keep in mind are that he can cross the screen almost instantly with Rebellion Spear (so don't let your guard down even if you're far away), Raging Meteor (the spin) is an overhead on the last hit kinda like Cell's Rolling Crush, and Saiyan Spirit is a reversal (so you need to respect him a bit more if he has 1 bar, the same way you'd treat other characters with 3 bars).

The cap at Lyndale/Hennepin preserves a pedestrian atmosphere in one of the most historic areas of the cities (though far from ideal in that regard). I-94 through St. Paul is lacking in pedestrian atmosphere, unnecessarily dividing parts of the city that were once contiguous.

The vast majority of public land in U.S. cities is devoted to motor vehicle travel. Here we have a chance to create new, public land that can buck that trend.

"FluidMechanics","t5_37yxy","&gt; Simplicity for smaller outfits (both equipment-wise and operationally) is part of the reasoning we were given, and this tunnel is used for teaching a lab course among other things.

It's interesting to me that HFSBs are considered to be operationally simpler than oil fog. I've worked in a lab where they used oil fog to do PIV in their wind tunnel, and toured labs where they use HFSBs for particle tracking, and the oil fog did not seem particularly complicated, expensive, or space-consuming relative to HFSB. You have issues with the oil getting everywhere and leaving a gross film on surfacs but the same is true for HFSBs getting soap everywhere unless you have a pump pulling them out of the air. The only real advantage I've heard people give in favour of HSFBs as I said was for large-scale flows where the oil particles would be smaller than a pixel, leading to peak locking errors.

&gt; In any case the discrepancy may be either negligible or well-defined, in which case it's a non-issue

Just because you can quantify your errors does not automatically make them a non-issue. Depending on what kind of calculations you need to make for your post-processing, small increases in velocity field uncertainty can completely blow up the uncertainty of your derived quantities, for example if you're studying vortex dynamics and you want to calculate the vortex stretching term.",1522540905

I see that you've been having a hard time either recruiting quality workers and/or training them.  I don't have a fix-all answer for those two problems, but I might be able to help you out.  Fist a little background:

My friend and I graduated from the University of Hawaii 2 years ago both with B.S. degrees in Geology.  In college we had the dream of someday starting a well drilling business.  Not having many resources or experience in which to do so, we both have ended up in different fields- myself as a Fireman and my buddy working for a construction company.  Recently, we were talking about revisiting our original dream and figured it might be good to start looking into how we could gain experience to learn the business.

As I stated above, the both of us don't have any experience in drilling but what we do have is experience in learning and laboring.  I know this doesn't solve your problems but if you're still in need of hard work and people who are genuinely interested in learning the business, or have any advice as far as getting into the field we would love to talk with you some more.",1522540906

My standard basic recommendations for newbies are:

Download [Enhanced User Interface](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/enhanced-user-interface.512263/), which places information more intuitively and makes things easier to understand. Thoroughly read the Civilopedia's (the in-game help) Game Concepts, Terrain and Features, Resources, and Improvements sections. 

There's a lot of quality material on Youtube. I recommend watching any 2 of FilthyRobot's Overexplain games (these are played with the r/nqmod, but the logic and decision-making processes are relevant to unmodded BNW):

"syriancivilwar","t5_2x5s1","""In the Nineveh town of Bartella, where 1,200 Christian families have returned and small businesses again are thriving, Shiites are completing a residential project on 25 acres outside town, according to Nicodemus Daoud Sharaf, the Syriac Orthodox archbishop of Mosul. In an interview with Aid to the Church in Need in March, he said the project suggests “a plan to bring in people from outside the region” and called that “a threat to the security of the region.”""


There's a large Shia town near Bartella, Khazna. I like that the article never mentions that or that Shia have existed in Nineveh for hundreds of years, have shrines that are hundreds of years old there (since blown up by ISIS). This concept that Shia some how are foreign to Nineveh is just not going to fly in the modern day. 

Shia building Shia schools and homes in their own town that has been their for hundreds of years is of no concern or threat to Bartella. ",1522540907

Your idea of what nature is like seems quite anthropomorphic.

&gt; I think it is much more of a natural order than anything else.

And i doubt that. The stereotype of the male without emotion could only perpetuate itself after we left nature and became cultured. Otherwise, men would likely be unable to feel emotion, if it provided that much of a disadvantage out there.

"WorldofTanks","t5_2s113","When I was grinding it, I found the O-Ho a lot more enjoyable than the O-Ni.  In fact, I think the O-Ni is the only tank in the line I didn't like (and this was pre-buff to the Type 4/Type 5).  


The derp gun + vert stabs = you never need to aim a snap shot anymore.  Insta 300+ damage to every tank you hit.  Add in gun rammer, vents, BIA, and make sure you also have the Snap Shot skill on your gunner (helps reduce bloom a bit on turret rotation, which in turn also helps with the vert stabs) and you have this monstrosity:

3,889 DPM  (yes, probably closer to 1,944 due to non-pens, but trust me, you will get pens on thin skinned targets to help with this)

14.04 second reload.  


If you are one of the people who doesn't mind the credit hit for adding food, then that gets you to the following stats:

4,058 DPM (slightly over 2k with non-pens of the HE, but again, you will get some pens on thin skinned targets)

13.45 second reload.


All on a 152mm howitzer.


Oh, did I forget to mention that if you learn which tanks you can easily overmatch turret roofs on, then you can easily pen many of the heavies you will face in their turret roofs with AP rounds.   It makes IS-3's sad when they lose 700HP every 14 seconds to an AP round through the roof.",1522540908

My PS4 controller never lasted more than a year for me.. so if Nintendo able to provide me with joycon that lasts for a year, I can deal with it. 

If you are worried, I suggest use the console as a single piece, don’t remove the joycon that often... or just use it exclusively with handheld grip.. basically use switch like any other console... the joycon will last you just as much as your ps4 or xbox one controller.

He's still drawing a conclusion that is essentially ""found in X, found in Y, therefore the same.""

He's still comparing two completely different systems - ones that are examples of convergence, at best.

He's still suggesting similarities are conserved over time based on a neurochemical that is so ubiquitous it's found in non-animals and is involved in a host of biochemical processes.

None of the evidence he presents logically supports those conclusions. 

It's fine if he wants to wax poetic about dominance hierarchies - I don't have an issue with that *at all.* The evidence he uses to support his claims is erroneous. I feel that's pretty much indisputable.

"EngineeringStudents","t5_2sh0b","I had to learn to solder on my own in HS thanks to drones. At first I was really, really bad... 

My first advice is, don't use lead-free solder. You might think it's good for your health but what you really want to avoid is the smoke of the flux which is inside of the solder, no matter what type it is. It might cause irritation on your eyes, and obviously don't inhale it lmao. Both lead-free and 60/40 have it so why don't you just go with the 60/40 one.

Maybe your school only allows lead-free solder, if that's the case then there's nothing to do. But if you're allowed to use whatever you want then definitely get the other. Your solder job will look superb once you get used to it. It'll be shiny and you'll be proud of yourself when you see your reflection on the blob of solder. 

Jokes aside, it's a lot easier to learn to solder with a lead based solder. I don't know why exactly and I can't really explain the difference, try both and see for yourself I guess.

Also, most people don't pay attention to this but lead-free solder has a shelf life due to oxidization. However you can use lead based solder that your grandpa used a couple of decades ago.

Finally, this depends on your soldering iron but if you bought a cheap plastic one then the tip is probably a very soft metal. If you use excessive heat you might oxidize it and it'll never be the same. What I use is a digital DC powered TS100 soldering iron, you can go crazy with it. It wouldn't make a big difference but you can set your own heating curve, max temp, set a timer that takes it into a standby mode so when you leave it on the table the tip won't be damaged from the heat, thanks to an accelerometer integrated into it. You can also play tetris...

Also, I wouldn't recommend using a steel/brass wool as it might damage the tip of the soldering iron, especially if you're using the aforementioned cheap irons. Just get a kitchen sponge soak it into water and use that instead. 

For practising, I'd just go to an old computer shop and ask them if they have a broken board. A CRT TV board would work better as those have all kinds of different soldering points such as holes, pads and etc.

The key difference in cultural appropriation is that the appropriator is ignorant; that they are able to use elements of the culture they appropriate in a safe way or a way that garners praise, while the actual people from that culture cannot do that; or additionally that the cultural appropriator/s picks and chooses parts of the culture they like and otherwise denigrates others.

I'm Muslim, and it hurts, as a Muslim, to have people quote Rumi when they don't know the religious history behind him or purposefully ignore it, and bring his poetry into secular, ""new age"" settings without learning who he was and why he wrote his work. Half of my family is South Asian, and it hurts to watch the girls I went to school with, who called me racial slurs or told me that I smelled like curry, wear saris and lenghas because they think it is fashionable. It hurts to generally be in a society that thinks you are terrorists or wants to ban you from entering the country or mixes your religion up with a totally different one or can't tell the difference between Arabs and Indians, to have people use the parts of the culture they think is cool. There is a power dynamic inherent in it, too. Western artists, designers, etc always have the upperhand and the legitimacy and the voice and the platform -- when they take things from other cultures or people of colour and adopt it as their own, they often remove it from its context and also appropriate someone else's voice or experience. Even education sometimes isn't enough - when a Western chef goes on a ""spiritual journey"" (eye roll) through India or Thailand, and comes back and opens a Michelin star restaurant with the recipes and ingredients he learned in those places, and gets tons of praise for it, but immigrants are expected to open cheap and cheerful restaurants where the food couldn't possibly be fine dining or gourmet because it is ""ethnic"", that is frustrating.

We're not telling people they can't have access to our cultures. We're just asking that it be done respectfully. We're asking that you educate yourself before you grab things from it. That you ask yourself, am I the best person to represent this? Is it my right to own this voice or experience or history? When it's done thoughtfully, carefully and respectfully, it's cool and great and we can all learn from each other. When it's not, it's both dismissive of the inherent value in another culture, and it reinforces existing power dynamics surrounding race and culture that leave minority groups out in the cold and unable to have agency over their own cultures and histories.

Right now I think we are going through a period of calling people out for appropriation and like all ""awakenings"" sometimes people will be too eager and call things appropriation that are arguably not. I don't think that's always the case, though, and healthy discussions have happened and do happen (see the Bruno Mars discussion). But it's better to have a vigorous open debate about it, so that the idea is firmly lodged and things are improved.",1522540917

According to her backstory, she is a perpetual 3rd grade student who lives outside London. Though she appears to be anthropomorphic, according to her creators she is not a cat: she is simply a cartoon character, with a red bow and, notably, no mouth. Sanrio has announced in 2018, that Hello Kitty's birthday is November 1.

"AskThe_Donald","t5_3fuwj","I think the President is wrong on this matter.

First of all, **the deal between USPS and Amazon are business deal.** There is no coercion, there is no forceful actions, just business deal. There is no way the government (and Trump, as an extension of government) should meddle with business affairs of people. If I want to sell my product at $1 or at $1,000 that is my business, not the government.

Secondly, **Amazon did pay USPS.** USPS is not the delivery boy of Amazon, USPS is the courier service paid by Amazon. If Trump felt that the price is unfair, he should talk with USPS, not Amazon. No government should force companies to set their price at a level. USPS are free to set their price, as Amazon are free to set their own courier service.

Third, **Amazon did pay tax.** Maybe not fair, but that is the same loophole that the President and countless other companies are using anyway. There is no drive yet to fix these loopholes, thus Amazon and others will continue to use it, legally. And no, you can't force Amazon to pay ""back taxes"" because that is not how taxes work. Amazon, along with big companies, have army of accountants and auditors to make sure they are paying tax as low as possible while still legal.

"DebateAltRight","t5_3gwfd","The gist of all of this is that these sorts of semantic economic arguments are a distraction meant to create fake divides and fake identities among whites, just like every other part of the popular culture. 

We can and have thrived under every economic system there is. Economies are an expression of the people that create them. While differences between African socialism and African capitalism do exist, they are completely negligible if you desire a country with a European soul.

Jusuf (convert or Bosnian possibly?) seems like a BernieBro/Chapo-ista, so I don’t know if “nationalist socialist” is appropriate (care deeply for your fellow passporthavers, goy).

The type of argumentation he starts out using doesn't have anything to do with what he actually believes in, it's an attempt to entrap his opponent into looking silly.

[The soyim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikDOM2k1jkw) commentariat used the same tactic against the wall in the election, saying: ""Woah dude that wall would be pretty great, too bad enigneering still hasn't come up with liek a a way to build around rivers 'n stuff and it's 20 billion and that's just totally out of reach"", without realizing how stupid they've just made themselves sound in making a great case for the efficacy and affordability of the wall in relation to the total national economy.

A minimum wage does nothing to prevent third world parasites from coming in. If there's even the tiniest welfare loophole they can use, they will. For many of them, living as an illegal immigrant beggar on the street can be an improvement over the conditions in the shithole they were born in. They have to be consciously and deliberately physically removed from our countries - that is the only realistic way of seriously doing anything about third world immigration. Everything else is just hollow pandering and vote-grabbing.

Immigration is first and foremost an issue of culture and mindset, wanting to live among your own and throwing off fake guilt put on you by a certain group of unchecked internationalists - not economics. 

There's nothing wrong with a mixed economy with some collectivised public services in an above 90 % white country, but the issue with that system today is that this has grown so large that it destroys human ingenuity and will to better oneself, while also force-subsidizing the third-worlders that are in Scandinavia.

Isn’t it funny how some sort of ""mysterious force"" has made us more receptive to classically-liberal arguments against excessive taxation recently, despite the tax-rates having peaked in the 70's and 80's (where support for the public sector was also mysteriously high)?

Expect the trend of economic liberalisation and less support for orthodox social democracy in Scandinavia to continue as the amount of non-whites increases.
The problem with social democracy is not primarily a practical or pragmatic problem, but a moral one.

Where Crowder gets it wrong is when he thinks it’s the redistribution of wealth that is immoral – cooperation and self-sacrifice is the essence of tribal morality, giving back to your community is not theft.
No, the immoral and cancerous part is wanting to equalize all difference and thinking there’s a way to avoid having any kind of elite.

A part of any proper human development is having obstacles thrown in your way, figuring out how to overcome them and then growing from that. If you're always given the soft-landing you become nihilistic, hedonistic and indifferent. The state should set demands, uplift and inspire, but stay out of the personal-contentment business.

I think that there was a point at the start of the social democratic implementation in Scandinavia (around the late 1920’s) where an optimal balance was reached: 
Cripples, the sick, pregnant women and the elderly get helped to some extent - but there's still homes for the poor, insane asylums, sterilization programs other institutions that perform eugenic functions and which view these things as personal deficiencies to be solved, rather than random circumstance causing noble victimhood. Only those who are truly helpless should get personal ""free stuff"".

Stephen ""Autism""-offends-me-deeply Shapiro, on the other hand, is correctly exposed for his inconsistent and weak not-really-libertarian ideas, while also making it clear that he doesn't want to conserve anything other than ""free enterprise"" either. 

Adam Kokesh is a libertarian that actually takes the socialism-is-always-evil stance to its natural conclusion and he's even more of a joke, though not less kosher obviously.

It’s also interesting that SC takes off the mask for a second and says Scandinavian countries are “a people” (something most “respectable” conservatives wouldn’t even say over here) while the US is just a place of ideas, basically because of a piece of paper said so. 
Pieces of paper do not a society make – people do. All people belong to an ethnicity and a tribe. That’s true everywhere even if you pretend it isn’t.",1522540919

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","if you are cutting, which means you **are** losing weight, you will see *some* strength gains if you are new to lifting. however the more advanced you get, the less strength you will see, and you may even lose strength. you will probably add minimal amounts of muscle mass, especially at the beginning, but this will eventually stop as well. if you do start adding muscle mass, you are gaining weight, and therefore not cutting but bulking. 

if you decide to bulk, you will notice more gains than you made while cutting. you may be seeing gains on your cut now, but you will probably stop seeing them at some point. at that point, you can bet that eating a little more will push you through that plateau. 

if you dont care about making consistent gains, then you can just cut until you are happy and then stay at maintenance. if you really want to make some consistent gains and make a big jump in progress, you will have to bulk. ",1522540919

"Comcast_Xfinity","t5_3d8fi","The Gigabit pro (fiber) service comes with a (total of) $1000 install + setup fee, and is in the neighborhood of $250 per month. That also requires your premises to be no farther than 1/3 mile from a fiber node.

The regular Gigabit (DOCSIS 3.1) does not include that hefty install fee. You can be anywhere in their footprint, provided the 3.1 service is turned on  for that area. The monthly price, that varies between markets and deals. I've seen it so far between $89 and $109, depending on plan.  This service is where you'll need the modem.  Now while I do not have gigabit service yet, I did get the MB8600 when they came out, and so far I have not had a single issue with it.  Tbh, the only reason I went with the Motorola (Zoom) was because it was _not_ an Arris modem (plus Zoom does make good modems.)

Going to round 30 was insane etc. You should realize that the community earned a lot of skill , we now know everything about the zombies mechanic etc. Just go back to bo1 and you will see that its not hard , not like it was for us in the days. Those  peoples that coudnt get past round 20 in bo1 days, ask them to go back to bo1 , they will do round 50 without any issue. Community is WAY more skilled now than in bo1 days, this is something peoples don't seem to realize, its not obviously the games that get easier but also the community that is now way better at zombies. 

That said , i agree PV nde make the game easy , but no one force anyone to use it and it's banned from ZR so im fine , beside the fact that somes gums are ridiculously OP , they are also fun and can be used to just chill , have fun trying OP speedrun etc.. After all , back in bo1 it was all about the fun ,and not bitching about the fact that this or this is OP. We just wanted to kill zombies , no matter the way as long as its fun.",1522540922

Never tried any of the online RPG games, I prefer face-to-face interaction and pencil &amp;amp; paper.  For D&amp;amp;D we always used the old AD&amp;amp;D rules with a few games using the 2nd Edition rules.

In the 80s and 90s I had an enormous collection of RPGs, some excellent, some pretty much unplayable.  *Mage: the ascension* was an interesting system, played a bit of that in undergrad when it came out in the in the early 90s.

*Paranoia*, pretty much anything by Iron Crown (especially *Rolemaster* and the *MERP* spin-off as well as *Cyberspace*, not so much their large scale sci-fi game *Spacemaster*), *Traveller*, *Teenagers from Outer Space*, various *Gurps* system, everything Palladium games put out (from *The Mechanoid Invasion* through their fantasy game to the *Robotech* games to *TMNT*, *Beyond the Supernatural*, *Ninjas and Superspies*, *Heroes Unlimited*, etc. we were crossing the genres long before *Rifts* came out and the Palladium franchise took a dive in quality after *Rifts*), *Alma Mater*, *Warhammer Fantasy*, *Amber*, *Chivalry &amp;amp; Sorcery*, *Star Wars*, and more that I can't recall now as well as several home-brew systems, including an excellent one one of my friends had based on the *Alien Legion* comics, were all games we played semi-regularly.",1522540922

Midwives are incredibly experienced, have amazing educations, and would not have hesitated for an instant to send a mother somewhere if something seemed wrong with the birth.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","&gt; but it comes from some need to feel wronged, like they were lied to. Righteous indignation's a hell of a drug.

I adore armchair shrinking people so I don't have your POV on that, but I agree and I think this is especially telling in the case of one Glen Greenwald.  He was pro-Iraq war until 2005 when the standard narrative became ""There were no WMDs"" and it seems to me that he was so mad at being duped he had to decide that the dupers were in fact the worst people ever, not that he held an incorrect opinion despite evidence to the contrary. And now he's pretty much the posterboy of left-libertarian whataboutism because whatever a bad country has done, America has done worse!

It's funny because I kinda lucked into being ""right"" about Iraq as I was a far lefty anti-war for the sake of being anti-war type, so there's a very good chance I might have opposed a very necessary humanitarian intervention despite its merits, so I'm not saying that Greenwald was dumb and I was smart.  But his reaction to being wrong seems to be to lash out as opposed to question why he was so mislead.  I mean, most of the country bought into the bullshit, including the people who were the architects of the bullshit, so I'm now pretty sympathetic to people who supported the war at the time, but not when you learn entirely the wrong lessons from that.",1522540924

Skill 1: **Shining Wave** - Group BRV Attack, Turns skill into ""Radiant Sword"". Shining Wave circles around the enemies and attacks down the line.

Skill 1+: **Radiant Sword** - 3 Hit BRV to HP Combo, Enemy Defense Down for 3 Turns. 3 aetherial swords float above WoL's head and he sends them to the opponent, 2 swords deal BRV damage and the third does HP Damage.

Skill 2: **Shield Toss**: 3 Hit BRV Attack, Taunts enemy for 2 Turns, Turns skill into ""Shield Bash"". Mostly acts the same, but the shield hits like a boomerang for 2 hits and the Sword stab is the last hit.

Skill 2+: **Shield Bash**: 1 Hit BRV attack, guaranteed Stun to enemy. WoL runs up and swipes the enemy with his shield. Further Crowd Control for added security.

EX Skill: **Ultimate Shield** - 8 Hit BRV to HP Combo, Taunts enemy for 8 Turns and Increases DEF for 8 Turns, Defense Buff cannot be Dispel'd. If you've played Dissidia NT, this move is a deadly HP attack and would fit amazingly in DFFOO.",1522540924

If you touched her without her consent then there would be, and if she told you to leave and you didn't then there would be, but the ""play"" as described, taking place in a private residence without physical contact, is neither assault nor indecent exposure nor trespassing (she invited you up).

The closest legal problem to it is harassment for states that have statutes like that. In New York, where the show takes place, harassment in the second degree can be charged if you engage in a repeated course of conduct that seriously annoys or alarms another person and serves no legitimate purpose.

What you're saying is fucking irresponsible. What if somebody with nothing to live for reads your comment? You're telling somebody to just drop the ONE THING that they may be able to muster enough energy to do (gaming), all because you don't understand depression (or autism!!!).

People play games for a lot of reasons, and you don't get to tell somebody *you don't know* when they can play, how they can play, or how they're ""allowed"" to deal with mental illness. Somebody else's self care ain't your fucking business.

I have over 1200+ hours clocked into this game, because it was the sole thing keeping me *alive* the past six years.

Depression isn't sadness, or feeling bad about your life. It's a vast, black beast that if you actually have it, you aren't going to tell other people to just quit what they love. You don't encourage people to give up, what is for a lot of folks, one of the only things they have left to enjoy.

In a hallway, surrounded by four doors there was a massive hole in the floor, like a giant had take a big bite out of the floorboards. We couldn’t see what was down there; it was too dark. On the walls above the hole, things like “THERE IS NO ESCAPE” and “WE’RE GOING TO KILL YOU HERE” were painted.

That's one answer to your question.

Maybe an angry 18 year old shouldn't have easy access to a semi-automatic weapon of any kind. We haven't been able to intelligently discuss this because our government wasn’t allowed to fund a study of the question you asked. I believe that is of significant interest to us if we are going to seriously have this discussion. The  very reason we are justified is that the people with money in the game were paying those making those decisions. It's always about the money.

Instead this posting will be bombarded by platitudes from both sides. Is there justification? Kids are getting killed with a greater frequency than I am comfortable with. I've heard various stats...

“We were informed, for example, that since 2013 there has been an average of one school shooting a week in the U.S., and 18 since the beginning of this year. While these statistics were not exactly lies or fake news, they involved stretching the definition of a school shooting well beyond the limits of most people’s imagination.”


https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/02/19/parkland-school-shootings-not-new-normal-despite-statistics-stretching-truth-fox-column/349380002/

How many attacks does it take to justify an independent investigation? We know we can’t have congress do that - absolutely no one will believe their side lost fairly. The corporations will volunteer but blue states wouldn't like that just as much as if we wanted the deep state to do that. You might recall that is what they were set up to do. Our own government is no longer trusted to produce an analysis of the issue. Who would you trust to decide if semi-automatic weapons should be sold to 18 year olds?",1522540928

Free to air media broadcast in particular makes an interesting case study for market economics. Unlike other industries, broadcasters dont make their money directly from the viewers. Access to viewership is the product they sell to advertisers.

Free media is a very important aspect of liberal democracy - freedom of the press is the most important mechanism by which government is accountable. The suggestion that a government should have discretion over the reach of media breaks down accountability. I submit that it would actually be a step toward the Orwellian dystopia.

Would it be fair to assume your objection to this particular company stems from their message being contrary to your political view point? If you were to turn the tables, and consider a broadcaster who uses their influence to push a more p1-o2 friendly agenda, would you still trust a government (whom you may not agree with) to regulate it?",1522540929

"Rift","t5_2s4an","&gt;im not a huge fan of leveling in mmorpgs, how long does it take a new rift player but advanced mmorpg player to reach max level.

This will depend on whether or not you're playing prime (accelerated progression server going through 7 years worth of content in a year). Part of it's draw is that it's starting over from vanilla, but not the original vanilla. It's just a copy of live with systems turned off and a reduced store + a sub fee.

On live, leveling is relatively fast and you can use exp boosts or buy instant level 65s (similar to what WoW does). You can also be power leveled if you can find someone to do it for you. Patron (sub) also gives you extra benefits on live like extra exp bonuses that stack with other boosts. It really just depends on how you go about getting there.

&gt;is there a lot of endgame content ? If so, what is the content like ? Huge raids with 20+ people or dungeon types with about 5 party members? (i preffer the last one)

Not in this current expansion. It's been pretty bad in that regard and mostly agreed upon as the worst one to date. It's 10 man raids only as the team isn't big enough to do enormous 20 man raids like they did last expansion. Until they say otherwise, 10 will be the focus. Dungeons and raids also get recycled a little too often. This expansion only has 4 dungeons and 2 of them are recycled from last expansion/vanilla. One of our raids, soon to be 2 is also being recycled soon. If you haven't played before then they'll all be new to you either way. It's a pretty big point of contention though.

&gt;does the creators keep the game up to date with new content often ?

Again, this expansion has been really bad in that regard for the reasons I already stated. It's been an entire year since we've had any class balancing and some classes are hurting really bad because of it. Because prime is a copy of live, those changes or lack there of also affect that server even though it's restricted to level 50 at the moment.

&gt;i also like to mess around solo in mmorpgs at times. Is it possible to progress your character alone ?

Not in terms of end game, but there's plenty of other things to do alone. Artifacts, achievements, puzzles, dimensions and wardrobe collecting which are probably the 2 best systems i've seen in any game. Dimension are rifts player housing.

&gt;Does rift have group finder to do dungeons ? because im jumping in alone and dont want to join a guild right away till i know the game a little.

It has looking for group unless you're referring to the thing in WoW that lets you create premade groups. There's nothing like that unless you form a group through chat.

&gt;What of pvp does rift have and is it balanced?

PvP is on the backburner for the most part and has been for years. It was okay for a while, but the game has always been heavily PvE focused much like WoW is, but WoW still has a lot more time and resources to put extra effort into their PvP. I can't really speak much on it specifically though as I don't care to do it myself. Not since vanilla. I already referenced balance above.

&gt;is there a lot of class variaty ? Or is it 1 build rules all ?

Use and build whatever you want for open world, but when it comes to raiding, there are people who find the best build combinations for raids and those are generally what's used just like any other mmo with end game raiding. The goal was to always have each soul be a certain % behind the others with some souls being on top while keeping them all raid viable, but that's been easier said than done. there are some major issues with 2 systems introduced in this current expansion that have heavily affect class balancing. Eternal Weapons and Legendary Abilities. You can research those yourself.

**Class Balancing** - http://forums.riftgame.com/rift-prime-vigil-discussion-reading-anyone-posting-patron-only/prime-vigil-gameplay-guides-strategies/502503-rift-prime-server-closure-merger-live-after-1-year.html 

The game can still be enjoyable, but there's a lot that needs to be fixed. Prime just recently launched and while their goal was to have that run on its own and turn attention back to live, it has had its own set of issues arise which has taken time away from the main servers. Lots of people waiting to see what happens.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I liked this film a lot. To me it follows the book well enough. I thought changing the challenges was done in a good way, yes less cerebral but allowed for more good action sequences. I would have liked Oggy to have been in more of the story. It honestly felt like he was cut out a bit. I really liked Ech in this they did a good job with her and I liked that actress for that part. 

I'll also say this for all of the book diehard fans that are complaining about this film for being different. The actual author wrote the script for this. It is evident to me with the changes he was trying to craft this more as a film, and also to give people a different experience than the book. IMO it works well because I think you could still read the book and be interested in it. I dunno I guess I different from a lot of people in not minding changes like this that allow for *both* mediums to be appreciated. Would I really want the challenges to just be Parsival playing an Atari game? Not really. I think they did Haliday right as well. 

One scene I really genuinely loved and had the Spielberg effect to it was when he actually gets the Egg. There was something kind of religious in the way it was presented. His hands shining and him kneeling down like it. It reminded me of something from Indiana Jones really. It was a cool ending IMO. 

Overall this movie is a celebration of nerd culture like the book. It is a celebration of these things that bring us together and we find fun and inspiration in. Spielberg really got that with this film and that was really what was at the heart of the novel IMO. 

To me this movie was a solid 8/10. Not because there was anything wrong with it, but just because the story itself is never reaching for that much. It's a fun movie and it appeals to nerds so it sucks that they are trying to tear it apart like they like to do. But it's just meant to be fun, which it is. ",1522540936

Anubias are susceptible to algae as slow growers. Make sure your photo period is separated by an hour. I do 4 hours on, 1 off, 4 on. Do not put the rhizome (the thick stem) into the substrate or it will eventually rot. These will grow slow in perfect conditions. Low tech conditions with low light they’ll practically not grow. 

Amazon swords are FAST growers once they take off. You may get massive melts because they’re often grown out of water. This is normal and your plant isn’t dead. Give it root tabs and time and it’ll be good. They need a nutrient rich soil though. I suggest dirt capped with gravel. Works great!

"keto","t5_2rske","Keto for almost 3 months now. My view is that while I am striving towards a goal, family and special events don't happen very often. My grandparents cook really good Italian food twice a year (Xmas and Easter) and I am taking a one day break to enjoy the time with them. I'm not too worried about getting back into ketosis and already have my meals prepped for next week. Once a month I usually have a special event (weddings, holiday, vacation) and those days I don't worry about keto. That being said I have also brought my own food to certain events as well so I think it goes down to personal preference and how you handle situations. I know I can jump right back on the keto train the next day but if one day off is going to derail probably just KCKO. Good luck!",1522540939
"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","This is not how feminists portray it at all. They have no sympathy for mass shooters considering the theory is that men are victims of toxic masculinity and thus need help. There were no feminists saying 'damn, that poor, Elliott Roger. That boy needed help and we failed him.' They were more concerned with pointing out that these guys were entitled assholes:

https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a18207600/mass-shootings-male-entitlement-toxic-masculinity/

In some cases they claimed there was little or no connection to mental illness, though I cannot call someone mentally healthy if they want to shoot a bunch of people in public. Still, it didn't prevent them from taking action elsewhere. Toxic masculinity is at it again but he cannot use that as a defence and claim he was a victim of a system of oppression.

A bigger problem with toxic masculinity is that all those single moms should have raised better boys (no toxic male influence, right?) Yet so many end up in prison or suffering developmental problems. The theory just doesn't work the way feminists want it to nor do they actually care about it until women are affected negatively. It's great when she can cash in from dating a drug lord, but when the house gets shot up then she is a victim.",1522540939

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Well I'm not overly fond of the US government through the times, hate is a strong word though. I've been to the US a bunch of times mostly all the people I've met with were genuinely nice people. The government have a lot to answer to in terms of meddling in South American countries and around the world in general. I think a lot of US policies are pretty inhumane, especially the judicial system, public healthcare, mental healthcare etc but a lot of that can be blamed on the two party system where you end up voting for either an orange reality star or a professional liar. Maybe next time you get to throw a talk show host into the mix as well.

As for the French revolution, yes I find that tyrannical as well but the world was a pretty tyrannical place back then. You could say it was justified, maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. A lot of innocent people probably got killed as well. 

You say revolution i.e. killing. It said executions for having the wrong political beliefs and that's a way to terrorize people similar to putting people's heads on stakes. Conform or else. It is about sending a message which in my opinion is tyrannical.

And I know revolutions have to involve killing people, I wrote that in a previous post, to have a revolution and install an anarchist or communist regime you have to genocide enough people so the general population is so afraid that you have absolute power. And after killing thousands maybe millions of people, do you think you would be sane enough to continue with the plan of a post scarcity society?

I think we are heading towards that anyway without the need of a bloody revolution and when automation takes over a significant portion of the jobs we will probably end up implementing a lot of Marx's ideas as he was very ahead of his time but I don't think we can or should try to force it. As for the near future I think you should consider social democracy instead of communism. And get rid of the two party system.",1522540939
"whichbike","t5_2s37j","The Corratec is much better it looks like a great deal, it has parts like a 750 euro bike and a reasonable component selection at that budget too, the discount is legitimate. 

The Specialized has significantly lower specications over pretty much the entire bike. At 193cm with the kind of riding you're looking to do the Corractec's 29er wheels would be more suitable than the Pitch's 650b too.

Corratec are a smaller German brand that are known for their distinctive high-end 'X-Bow' bikes, e.g. [this](https://www.corratec.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Products/Bikerange/2017/BK22070.png) (modern) or [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/50/12/f1/5012f13ff7ddd5be5f09552c1042c865.jpg) (vintage from the 90s).

"Warframe","t5_2urg0","This is an awesome concept! If you don't mind my own critique I'll start from the top.

Stats are solid. She's going to be squishy, but spiders aren't super tough to squash. It's their mobility that makes them hard to pin and kill.

The passives are aight. Could be better, but they should be combined.

The first one is odd. By ""execute a special attack"" do you mean something like how an Arson Eximus telegraphs their Fire Blast? If so, that's not particularly good as enemy telegraphs in this game are short and normally one can't react fast enough to stop it if they aren't already actively shooting them beforehand. I recommend changing it to something like ""Enemies aware of, seeking and targeting Neith will glow or be highlighted (think Argonak) with Neith's current energy color and are visible through walls within X meters.""

Regarding the finisher passive I'd increase the amount of energy it gives or make it a temporary but potent stackable energy regen that remains active during situations such as channeled abilities and parasitic auras. A 225 pool at rank 30 would become a 563 pool w/ Flow and an 844 pool w/ Primed Flow. 25 energy per finisher is meager and only pays off the cost of Silk Shot, but something like a stackable energy regen value of, say, 5 e/s for 10 seconds would allow Neith to profit from ""feeding"" much like how Inaros does when he ""feeds"" on enemies and he gets 20% of his health back.

Silk Shot is incredibly interesting. I love the idea of being able to pick up cocooned enemies, and I'd love it even more if we could be able to throw them across a long distance. Another neat augment idea for Silk Shot could be **Acidic Strands: Cocooned enemies suffer minor Corrosive damage and procs. Casting on allies imbues their attacks w/ +100% Corrosive damage.** We could use another elemental augment, and since we already have Radiation let's add Corrosive to the mix.

Weaver's a good concept on paper. However, issues present themselves with this. The player interaction would be useless and possibly detrimental if placed in close quarters or at the end of a hallways; it would be best if they don't have any collision. There is also no incentive in combat to cocooning in or placing cocooned enemies in Weaver when general player behavior acts on eliminating any enemy in sight, similarly to Limbo's Banish. At best it would be reserved for mild CC or to pocket enemies out of the way of other players for energy gain. The flow between placing Weavers as well as cocooning enemies and moving/throwing them into Weavers would have to be intuitive and fast to be useful and relevant. Most tilesets have too low a ceiling to visually support 10 cocoons on them so a good approach to that would be to have cocooned enemies be absorbed into the column of silk and visually represent their integrity and cocoon count by glowing lumps and broken strands and wutnot scaled to the size of the column. Shooting the Weaver or casting External Digestion on it could deal the damage to all cocooned enemies similarly to Zephyr's Tornado.

I love the thematic approach of External Digestion, as well as the proposed utility of it. I recommend having the damage dealt be able to bypass armor and shields as well as have casting the ability be fast enough to go between targets swiftly and with little downtime, if not in normal mode at least in Wallcrawler mode. The former is both for the purpose of enhancing his damage as well as enforce that Neith is literally injecting digestive enzymes directly into the enemy's body which armor and shields in which case they should not be able to mitigate the internal damage. The augment is also an interesting idea, but for it to be effective the bonuses would have to be flat and last long enough to make effective use from.

I absolutely love the idea for Wallcrawler. The augment is also awesome and a fantastic tradeoff. Her movement system would definitely require some work though, if we're going to get a good wall and ceiling movement system. Bullet Jumping into a ceiling or wall could allow Neith to latch onto said surfaces while Bullet Jumping again while latched would have her Bullet Jump off the surface in the direction of the crosshair. Pressing the Jump key while on a wall or ceiling would have her immediately detach from the surface like how Wall Latching currently works.

Overall, awesome concept. I'd love to see this in game. Good job!",1522540940

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","Round 1: Heavily depends. One of the big problems here is that Stannis is a normal human and not a magus. Which means that he would be absurdly weak, maybe even weaker than Shirou and even more useless in combat due to his inabilty to project or...Do any kind of magecraft in general. Assuming, by some miracle that is, that he DOESN'T nerf Saber to oblivion and actually maintains her to level's comparable to Shirou's Saber. Well, he may stand a chance. He is a good strategist, he would soon know that he can't fight and must leave everything to his Servant, he won't try to meddle in fights like Shirou did and without having Melissandre whispering at his hear he may actually stand a chance. He would probably go down in a really, really gritty Fate route where Saber ends up convinced he is the one True King of Westeros and remains faithful to him. The real problem is whatever he survives to Kotomine and Gilgamesh last stand against him and Saber. But eh, he may not even come to that if he does it nicely and plans something against Gilgamesh. 7/10 of surviving and saving Westeros with the Grail (And fucking it in the process because Grail.)

Round 2: Depends on the Shirou. All Shirous will probably just go out of the castle and try to kill the entire army like the idiot they are. Fate Shirou isn't simply strong enough and dies. Unlimited Blade Works Shirou clears it and Heaven's Feel Shirou maybe able to clear it, if his circuits don't, you know, explode.

If he tries to plan his way out of this. Storm's End doesn't last a night.

Round 3: Honestly. The burning of Shireen in the show was completely ilogical and out of character. But Stannis seemed pretty convinced of it and I doubt he'll hear Shirou specially. So no. Shireen burns still and Shirou probably kills him for that. ",1522540945

($25 p/h, if note takes around 20 minutes to make/print/stick on clock).

"Scotch","t5_2qq65","First Review: 

Preference: More of a Smokier scotch guy who leans towards earthier/smooth taste. Example: laphroig quarter cask, highland park dark origins, highland park 12 year.

Surroundings: 50 degree weather, outside, sun setting, whiskey in a crystal glass.

Poured: Straight

Notes: Maple, Carmel, Vanilla, bourbon, light fruit.

Taste: sherry/bourbon notes come out,  Carmel, oak, no earth tones, smooth with only a 3 second burn. Can still taste the underlying  age old glennfiddich taste. Slightly different then their standard bottle. Was impressed with the smoothness. 

Rating: 60/100

Didn’t really taste anything unique from there standard bottle except for the taste from the sherry casks.

Scale:
 10-30- Utter piss
 
 30-40 - hairspray 

40-50- bring out at parties to get rid of

50-60 - could buy again

60-70 - would buy again

70-80 - Unique but nothing exceptional

80-90 - Great whiskey with unique taste

90 - 99 - Whiskey that I would go bankrupt for ",1522540945

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Well, there _shouldn't_ be both billionaires and homeless people. A better way to state it is that there _should_ be billionaires, and it's _inevitable_ that there will be homeless/poor people. Here's why I think that is so:

Why billionaires are good:

* Realize that wealth is not zero-sum. This is key. Most billionaires have not stolen the money from other people (and if they did they should indeed be punished). Rather, they were willingly given the money because they provide value. That is, there is more total wealth to go around to everyone when someone innovates and becomes wealthy. Poor people in the US have tremendous buying power because the innovations of the wealthy have made quality goods so cheap.

* Very wealthy people invest money in things that others won't. Elon Musk, Bill Gates, tons of angel investors around the world. These people, who are willing to put money in high-risk or humanitarian ventures, can spur innovation. Silicon Valley became so innovative in part because the early millionaires turned around and invested in the next group.

* The wealthy consume goods that may lead to innovations. In some fields, it's typical for technologies developed for high-end products to trickle down. Technologies in Ferraris find their way into Hyundais, eventually.

* The wealthy inspire many of us to do more with our lives, because we want to be them.

Why poor folks are inevitable:

* Some poor people are poor because they repeatedly make bad decisions with their lives. They have a very hard time delaying gratification, which means they don't plan for the future. Monetary handouts aren't always a solution here -- witness the many athletes and lottery winners than go broke. I believe some countries are experimenting with a basic income -- I'm curious to see how that turns out. A steady stream of a modest amount of money could work a bit better, perhaps.

* Related to the above point -- a country can afford to boost the lives of bad decision makers, but only if the percentage of them is low enough. As the number of bad decision makers increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to afford. Note that there is evidence that decision-making is at least partly genetic, and therefore it is hard to simply teach people.

* Finally, there will always be a small percentage that are borderline insane or mentally deficient. You have a choice to make: Restrict their freedoms, or accept that they may live a life that some will call horrifying. I'm not sure the best solution here.",1522540950

"politics","t5_2cneq","The sheer hatred a lot of conservatives have for these parkland kids is fucking appalling. For the past few weeks it has just been non-stop rants about how they’re puppets for the mainstream media and “corrupt” public education system (without any evidence of course), smug comments about how they’re just stupid kids who need to shut up because they don’t understand anything, and just flat-out bullying. What kind of twisted person looks at children who have just seen their friends get shot, and then decides to make fun of their grades and social lives or call them cowards?

This is what Conservatism in America has become, an absolute cesspool with absolutely no standards. The party of “morals” and “family values” and “personal responsibility” are going out of their way to smear the survivors of a tragedy and verbally abuse traumatized minors just so they can keep their precious NRA happy. 

And the truth is they’re scared. They know that gun-control is popular, they know that a large portion of America (particularly those under 40) despise them. That’s why they are bullying these kids, to keep their own base foaming at the mouth and to intimidate young people so that they will continue the historical trend of not being involved. Young people being politically active will be the death of the current far-right, reactionary version of the GOP. They’ve been clinging on with help from gerrymandering and the electoral college, but they can’t rely on baby-boomers and isolated rural areas forever. They have proven that they will do whatever it takes to silence these kids. Anyone who continues to support the current Republican Party doesn’t have a shred of humanity. ",1522540950

embryolisse moisturizer

Also I used to use acne.org 2.5% benzoyl peroxide(which is like medical grade, triple milled) to spot treat on the area— before(sometimes after if skin was irritated) i moisturize i would take a small amount and spread a thin layer over the entire breakout prone area every night. This worked so well in combination with the stridex that I now use a super cheap drugstore generic version. The key for me was using a VERY moisturizing silicone free moisturizer and not letting my skin dry out. 

Using an bha would fade scars eventually but an aha would concentrate on topical redness— Id recommend acne.org AHA+ or pixie glow tonic. Make sure to only use one type of chemical exfoliant per day at the beginning

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","A sickly man lay convulsing on a bed in a hospice. The white lights gave a sickly glow to the white walls, as if the hospice itself was a sick organism, breeding a cesspool of diseases. Suddenly, a shrouded figure emerged out of thin air. It appeared to bear no skin or muscles and held a sinister scythe in one of its hands. The apparition made its way ominously towards the sick man. Pausing for a moment, it leaned its head in, preparing to give the final kiss. 

""Oh for fuck's sake!"" Death yelled out. The man had taken the cure. Even though he was suffering from an agonizing affliction, the man had decided to live indefinitely, bearing the excruciating pain that came with the disease. Death flung his scythe on the wall in frustration, where it embedded itself with a force that should have shaken the entire hospice. ""This is getting ridiculous."" Death thought to itself. ""How am I supposed to meet the daily quota, when everyone deems it necessary to live forever? Can't people just die?"" He thought exasperated. ""Its not like I make millions. Sometimes its hard to even get the minimum wage."" 

Indeed, it had become quite difficult for our poor harbinger of doom to make a living. It had all started when a young man named Stephen had found an anomaly in one of the distant galaxy's state. It appeared to have been frozen in time. Each molecule completely affixed to its position. It only took a few decades from there to find a way to cheat death. Any disease, however deadly could now be frozen in its state. All the cells of the human body could be frozen in their state. No aging, no death and perpetual life. The advent of the cure was so quick that it had left death completely off-guard. One moment, he was prowling in every house, reaping the fruits of the bubonic plague and the next moment, nothing. People just refused to die. 

The hospices were the only places left that provided some solace. They cared after individuals who had been too late in freezing their afflictions. For whom death was a better option than suffering unbearable agony. But now, even they appeared to be dwindling in number. The hospice Death was currently visiting was one of the few that remained. The situation was certainly grim for our Grim. He sighed. He knew now that the time had come. The allure of the reaping had long faded away. The thrill that had inspired him to take up the job in the first place, no longer remained. With a heavy heart, he put up his scythe on his wall and decided to take up accounting in Satan's workshop. The place where he would spend eternity, boring himself to death.",1522540950

The annoying thing is we seem to have a dwight quota of post loos no matter how well he’s playing. When he plays well we should feed him excessively because Dwight can still get good post position Vs a lot of Cs.

He’s nearly dropped a 20/20 on Capela, dropped 30 on Embiid, 25/20 on KAT, cleaned up Davis too.

All these young bucks aren’t fully developed yet but with the current direction of small ball, they may never develop their core to the point where they can stop a guy like Howard. Which means Howard will always have a spot in the league.

Objectively I can’t see how Howard is lower than Capela, Whiteside, Deandre, Drummond. At worst he gets you a double double, but at his best he’s far better than that quartet, at his best he can still take over an NBA game at both ends of the floor.

I can understand Horford, Aldridge, Davis, Boogie Embiid, Gobert, Adams as clearly above Dwight, and then Jokic, KAT are such trsnsgressive Offensive player that I’d have bth ahead of Dwight. But after that the list really shouldn’t be clear cut Dwight 15th. A few Hornets fans like to shit on Dwight but they don’t consider how Capela has a quite marginal role, How Whiteside has been so mediocre this season. How Deandre doesn’t try. 

I’d say the above 9 and Drummond are the objective top 10 Cs, but against like 5 of them Dwight can do what he wants. So it’s not like there’s a clear gap. ",1522540951

You could try to play 100% safe and never go near an enemy plane if they have even slightly more energy than you, but being good at defensive maneuvers can allow you to be more versatile and have a much bigger impact on a match.

The Damascus Titan missile explosion (also known as the Damascus accident) was a 1980 U.S. Broken Arrow incident involving a Titan II Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). The incident occurred on September 18–19, 1980, at Missile Complex 374-7 in rural Arkansas when a U.S. Air Force LGM-25C Titan II ICBM loaded with a 9 megaton W-53 Nuclear Warhead had a liquid fuel explosion inside its silo at a missile launch facility. Launch Complex 374-7 was located in Van Buren County farmland just 3.3 miles (5.3 km) NNE of Damascus, and approximately fifty miles (80 km) north of Little Rock. (Coordinates: 35°24′50″N 092°23′50″W.) 

The incident began with a fuel leak at 6:30 p.m.

We were (naturally) hated by everyone but the content providers; the posters of the binary files everyone wanted.

Part of what he and I did was to try to keep the heat off the actual posters, and try to explain spooling and retention to noobs. We purposely drew attention from some of the worse malicious trolls (Roy Batty was among those) that would trash the groups with what we called 'sporges', (mass trash posting events, to hide the real posts). Became quite a problem for a bit, right before NZB files were invented by NewzBin(?, been a while).

At one point I found myself in a 4 year relationship with a chick that danced when she was way younger (she was in her 30’s when I met her). 

She was addicted to painkillers, and a liar of the highest order. Like one time I broke up with her and she emails me telling me her grandmother died trying to tweak my sympathy. Some time later she was on Facebook chatting back and forth with her. 

It was a very dysfunctional relationship to say the least. 

I can’t go near strip clubs anymore. I’ve sorta turned into the “stripper whisperer”. It turns out a lot of those girls are really into older guys since they get tired of all dudes in their 20s that act like asses. I’m in my early 40s and it’s become way too easy to pick those chicks up. The majority of them are addicted to something and have major baggage. DUIs, shit credit, multiple kids from multiple dudes, etc. they’re all above average looking fixer uppers.

Direction is something you'll only really learn after a billion fails, though on some maps (Hanamura 2nd) you'll figure out that the best path is also a path that fails over and over because there isn't a good path (Top right stairway area).

When it comes to figuring out the ult thing, look for combos, and look for times when you need to ""dry push"".

When to go in is a matter of ""are we grouped up"" and ""do we have our cooldowns up"".

I will just comment on another argument for less or no meat/dairy diets is the environmental impact in which no matter where the animal is raised or in what conditions, animal farming has a high carbon footprint. There are also arguments on meat (I'm sure this has to do with red meat/pork but again, I don't necessarily agree with this argument in the first place so I'm not 100% educated on it) being bad for health which from the evidence I've seen, this has more to do with general dietary habits related to people who have high meat diets which again has more to do with the other parts of their diet than just the meat consumption in my opinion but take that how you will.

"degoogle","t5_4bph8","&gt;So you're saying that sex is determinant on your hormone level, and the neurological state that comes from that.

No. Neurological sex come from hormonal development in the womb. Post-birth hormones won't change the development that already occurred. Which is why they don't undo facial hair, vocal development, or genitals. They also don't undo neurology.

Sex itself is based on a variety of things. But yes, the bulk of it comes from hormones (which drive sexual development).

&gt; The problem here is that there are physical conditions where men can lack huge amounts of testosterone, and women can lack huge amounts of estrogen, and they still don't identify as another sex.

That's because hormones post-birth don't effect neurology. So women who have hormone conditions and lack estrogen will develop male, and then get dysphoria. Very similar to a transsexual woman who is also neurologically female but develops male.

&gt;Not only that, but hormone levels drastically change throughout someone's life. How can you really determine what hormone level makes you a man, or a woman?

They actually don't. Prior to puberty, kids are mostly androgynous. And as such don't have as much sexual differentiation other than genitals, chromosomes, and neurology. Puberty is what causes most of the differences. And puberty can be stopped and switched to the other sex. Likewise a 'second' puberty can be caused by HRT.

After that, hormone remain steady throughout the person's life. With women having an exception for menopause, in which some stuff changes but they still are within female levels.

&gt;What if you have unnaturally low levels of testosterone, your body is still mostly male, and you identify as male? 

If you have unnaturally low testosterone, your body wouldn't be male. Testosterone and estrogen drive sexual development. We'd say they have a testosterone deficiency, and they'd start taking testosterone. It's very likely they'd have female sex traits like breasts (we call it gynecomastia in men), and lack of facial or body hair.

&gt;What's the difference between that and someone that has unnaturally low levels of testosterone, their body is still mostly male, but they identify as female?

Physically? Nothing. Their body is clearly the same. They have the same mix of sexed traits. Neurological sex is what would differ. Provided that by ""identify as"" you're referring to neurological sex. Again, I've made it clear *MANY* times to drop that usage and use neurological sex instead.

Just ""identifying as"" something is irrelevant. It has no basis on sex. However, most people use the term to refer to neurological sex.

Well, you know from your experience with your mother that all of that is COMPLETE SHIT.

The lifescript is bogus invention of those in power who needed their workers, slaves, believers and soldiers to produce more kids for them because guess what? It's cheap as fuck to have your current workers, slaves, followers and soldiers breed you more workers, slaves, followers and soldiers. 

If you don't force or dupe them into it -- you have to go out and conquer and convert new cannon fodder. That's expensive and inefficient. Breeding your already captive population is dead easy.

You just tell them that ""it's the way to salvation, your life may suck as my slave or believer or soldier but... if you have kids their life will be better, so focus on that and not on the fact that you're my slave!"" 

Meanwhile, guess what, your miserable abusive mother had kids and that only made her life more miserable and fucked you up for life. 

So yeah, fuck the lifescript, you know it doesn't work. 

The only way to be a happy and fulfilled person is to find that happiness in the one and only one place it can be found: Inside of yourself.

No adult, and certainly no child is responsible for your happiness or success in life. It's 100% your responsibility.

As for your current partner, it doesn't really matter. Having kids or not is NOT a ""couples decision"" -- it is a decision you each have to make for yourselves, regardless of the relationship you're in at the moment. Which, odds are, would never survive having a kid anyway... most don't.

As for deciding if you want kids truly for yourself, we have a few aids.

There is a ""quiz"" of sorts you can do. We also have a ""parent lifestyle"" mini simulation that you can try for a year and see if you come out of it thrilled about having a kid and wanting to take on that new lifestyle, or you quit it after the first night with an ""ok, yeah, no fuck this, i'm getting my tubes tied.""

You should also check out the screening starter kit, because it will first help you answer some questions for yourself, and then help you figure out where your SO stands. It also screens for some of the more fundamental relationship requirements, such as a profound and unshakable level of respect for your partner in life, how they handle life and death decisions (do you want someone who can't deciding your cancer treatment when you are unable?), how they manage the people in their life, etc. etc.

Go through all of that and see where you net out for a start.

It's better to be an Active decision maker vs. that whole bullshit of ""oh, i'll just wait for the lightening bolt"" to tell me... that's crap. 

There is this myth that ""oh, without the lightening bolt I can't possibly make a decision so i have to wait for the magic 8 ball because that's the only way this decision can possibly be maid"" -- COMPLETE BULLSHIT.

Most people, if they put effort into the issue can usually decide in a matter of days what they want their life to be. Waiting around for years doesn't make any sense.

And anyway, when you're talking about the same 'CDC' who are prohibited from researching gun control by [the Dickey Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey_Amendment), I'm not so sure your statistics can really be trusted.

The 'second amendment' is, in my opinion, outdated and probably (hopefully) on its way out. The only reason guns might still be 'necessary' is because they are unfortunately already out in the environment, but as authorities and local governments begin to crack down, they'll hopefully dry up. Don't you wish you didn't have to worry about gun violence? Or carry a weapon to the bank or church or Chuck E. Cheese?!

Where I live (the UK), 'bad people' don't have guns. Yeah sure, criminals still find ways to hurt and even kill people, but they have to get up close to do it. The can't 'mow down' swathes of people like Americans can (not sure where you're getting that info from? Fox News perhaps???).

Look, the founding ideas of the USA don't sound that cheesy to me. I can respect most of them. I actually love America. I'm married to an American. But you have to see that they were written a long time ago when things were different, and they're not something that should be blindly followed like some kind of religious fundamentalist nutjob. They should be questioned and challenged and, when they're not working any more, they should be thrown out. And, when you live in a country that's had on average 1.4 school shootings PER WEEK since the start of 2018, you have to question whether easy access to mass killing weapons should really be a 'right' any more.

"LetsTalkMusic","t5_2t4it","The Pixies and Dinosaur Jr had a mythical quality due to their infamous infighting and break-ups. For several years, it was ""will they ever get the band back together,"" and then they did.

(While it was just a cash grab for the Pixies, Dinosaur Jr has actually made some phenomenal records in their reunited form. So has Mission of Burma.)

R.E.M. might've been the least interesting rock group of its era in terms of drama and controversy. They were playfully evasive with the media; they let the music do the talking. From the get-go they shared songwriting responsibilities and credit (always ""Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe""). This tends to be a source of friction with a lot of bands — not so with R.E.M. I absolutely love this band, but even I'll admit their ""Behind the Music"" was dull. 

Just as some of these '80s bands were burying hatchets for a second go round (i.e. Pixies, MBV, Mission of Burma, Dinosaur Jr, the Replacements), R.E.M. was in its twilight. It didn't help that they were also in identity crisis after the departure of Bill Berry. I still think they called it quits on a good note. Timing is everything, and they bowed out at the right time. Most bands aren't so lucky.

And I doubt they'll ever reunite. At least not for more than a one-off.",1522540960

"Stormlight_Archive","t5_2sq9v","Forewarning that I'm mostly playing devil advocate. 

&gt;Brandon makes it clear that both her mother and father tried to murder her.

Her mother yes, her father **definitively not**. Shallan murdered her father because she was worried that he was going to kill her brothers. Her father would never touch her. That's why that part was harder for her to accept than killing her mother. 

&gt;And no, Kaladin would not be Moash without Syl. 

The closest Kaladin comes to letting Elhokar die is precisely *when he didn't have Syl around*. And lets look at this scene right here: 

&gt;“I could end him,” Kaladin said. “Enter his window in a flash of Stormlight, kill him, and be off before anyone has time to react. So easy. Everyone would blame it on the Assassin in White.”

&gt;“Kaladin . . .”

&gt;“It’s justice, Syl,” he said, suddenly angry, turning toward her. “You tell me that I need to protect. If I kill him, that’s what I’m doing! Protecting people, keeping him from ruining them. Like he ruined me.”

&gt;“I don’t like how you get,” she said, seeming small, “when you think about him. You stop being you. You stop thinking. Please.”

&gt;“He killed Tien,” Kaladin said. “I will end him, Syl.”

&gt;“But tonight?” Syl asked. “After what you just discovered, after what you just did?”
He took a deep breath, remembering the thrill of the chasms and the freedom of flight. He’d felt true joy for the first time in what seemed like ages.

&gt;Did he want to taint that memory with Amaram? No. Not even with the man’s demise, which would surely be a wonderful day.

&gt;“All right,” he said, turning back toward Dalinar’s camp. “Not tonight.”

Hmmm, too bad Moash didn't have a mystical embodiment of Honor itself telling him not to get revenge.  If it wasn't for Syl stopping Kaladin right then, he would have tried to kill Amaram. 









&gt;As for Moash, the main issue is this: people love to say 'Maybe Odium is mind-fucking him!' But ... we don't see it. When he's thinking, his mind is clear, not being manipulated by the Thrill or other signs. ""But Kaladin was bad too!"" Yep, and he /accepted responsibility/ for his actions. Moash just keeps pushing the guilt onto other people, it's never his fault.

Oh yeah, I definitely don't think he was influenced by Odium. But umm, remind me, what exactly is *his fault*? He is not responsible for the death of his parents/grandparents, he is not responsible for the centuries of discrimination, his crappier upbringing compared to Kaladin, the awful treatment of the parshmen, etc.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I definitely agree, the difficulty really spikes and it’s only through a lot of experience that you pick certain things up.  I disagree with my friends about a lot of rules here and there.  Like if you wear a chameleon robe against wiegraf he won’t use holy sword abilities on you which makes the fight so doable.  Or on the riovanes rooftop I make a few characters naked so it aggros the assassins which is otherwise luck based without ninjas.

The game is incredibly frustrating sometimes, the last fight against Balk and the gafgarion fights are always a crapshoot for me, but last time I played I only had to reset once and that was a total misstep on my part.

The good times have outweighed the bad, like the time my two supports got stoned early in the first mustadio battle but I pulled it out, or the fort zeakden fight I almost lost but my moved my last guy next to algus and ranked so the enemy spell splash would kill him

In United States politics, the Dickey Amendment is a provision first inserted as a rider into the 1996 federal government omnibus spending bill which mandated that ""none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be used to advocate or promote gun control."" In the same spending bill, Congress earmarked $2.6 million from the CDC's budget, the exact amount that had previously been allocated to the agency for firearms research the previous year, for traumatic brain injury-related research.

The amendment was lobbied for by the NRA. The amendment is named after its author Jay Dickey, a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from Arkansas.

He used Italy. As a poor country torn by war and left behind because of the Ottomans it’s a miracle he was able to form a state with what was left. There were some rich Beys and traders, but the rest of the population had shit. With no money you cannot create a state. He took money from Italy, used it as good as he could and he could not have done anything better according to me. I have studied what he did and he did quite a good job. 


About the stolen gold. That’s a communist lie. He came from a very rich family and had no need to steal. 

And yeah, he ran, but what defense could he organize? We had a small number of trained soldiers, not many weapons and we were against with a state who’s army is 10 times bigger the ours. How can a light weight boxer fight a heavy weight one?",1522540968

A better approach, perhaps, would have been to make general 40krpg creature guides, subdivided into low, mid, and high level threats, the difficulty level roughly calculated off of player experience point levels.

Okay. But most, if not all, of us are Fun Haus fans. If everyone stops watching, Fun Haus stops existing. We want the content to get better. That includes providing (hopefully constructive) criticism

It’s probably the closest thing to the OASIS in terms of its scale, being whoever you want to be, creating the world you live in, in-game economy etc. When you search RP1 on Google there’s even an ad for Secondlife! 

In terms of copyright in SL, I’m sure there is a cease and desist procedure in place but lots of real world brands are on board and make a profit in game already, if a user number of say 500K was to jump to billions I’m sure they’d soon realise it’s the best place to sell your product. Much like the jump to online shopping and the advertising that came with this, companies are now spending more money on social media ads than real life ads. 

The founders (Linden Labs) have also recently released a VR version called Project Sansar which pretty much moves Secondlife into the world of VR, looks like a really interesting place.

In terms of people living inside an online virtual world, I guess we’re already doing that stuck to our phones constantly...wearing the device on our faces everyday (excl Tues and Thurs) ;) probably isn’t that far away. 

I guess there’s also the problem of people actually being on board with VR. 3D TVs were groundbreaking at the time and yet now they seem like a gimmick. The sheer about of people logged into the OASIS makes sense because they had to, as a means of survival - but getting the general population on board without a reason would take many years and I’m sure there would be some insane data breach revelation before that time came anyway haha.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt; Unless the game has no matchmaking I can't really find the use of a handicap system outside of rare instances were really lopsided matchmaking occurs because somebody isn't playing at peak hours.


Every game with a matchmaking system will always have a problem with skill disparity and queue time. Instead of having a 30minutes queue time the high level player gets the option to play a game against lower skilled player with a handicap. Judging by the amount of smurfs, that all pro players and high level players in different games (dota2, lol, battlerite) use a lower queue time is more important, than an even matchup.",1522540971

With the couple times I’ve come in contact with it and the many clips I’ve seen. I think there are two problems with it. 

1. It’s too maneuverable. The first time I ran into someone with it they were able to turn it on a dime around a wall I placed to block it. Rocket was coming straight on so just before it would have hit me I placed a wall. He quick changed to go around it and I placed another wall creating an L . They were again able to quick change direction again. Before I could react to placing a 3rd wall making a C. The rocket was able to be maneuvered around my last wall in an extremely tight turn around my wall and blow my face up. 

2. People say just shoot it! Well. Again it’s too maneuverable and with the shit gun mechanics in this game. How are we suppose to shoot something that moves faster than a player and can easily juke this stupid bloom/spread shit!? 

Making rpgs like this, one time use, would make them not worth picking up imo. I think point number 1 though is the biggest issue that I see with it. ",1522540972

&gt; Water container should be sufficiently sealed to prevent outside contamination and direct sunlight if water is to be stored for a long period of time. If proper precautions are not taken, additional treatments may be necessary. For best results, cap Aquamira® Water Treatment bottles tightly and store away from heat and sunlight. Contact with extreme heat or extended direct sunlight will reduce the effectiveness of Aquamira® Water Treatment. 

So you are probably fine with a clear bottle as long as you don't leave it out in sunlight. Or, do what I do and carry an opaque bottle for Part A, and a clear one for Part B. You need to be able to tell them apart to refill the bottles anyway, so you might as well make it obvious. The [MSDS for Part B](https://www.aquamira.com/wp-content/uploads/documents/Aquamira-Water-Treatment-Part-B-EN-OSHA-GHS-SDS-2016.pdf) says nothing about storage and sunlight so that one's fine in a clear bottle.

The RHCSA cert is useless.  The RHCE is the minimum that I have ever seen on a job listing.  After the RHCSA you still cannot install a printer or even troubleshoot basic user level requests or networking issues.  You are still unemployable other than entry level IT support/help desk.

Spending $3-$5k for a 5 day class (plus lodging) is a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.  You'll learn the test (and the limited, almost useless level of knowledge it entails) but have no experience.... and no one hires you because you have a cert.  They ALWAYS want experience.

So at the end of the day you are $5k poorer (and please don't get a loan to pay for the class, you don't want to finance it), still have ZERO experience and still only qualify for the same positions as someone who never took the test.

RHCSA/CE should be IN ADDITION to experience, school, internship etc.  Its NOT a path to a job by itself.

"JoeRogan","t5_2s4tv","&gt; Hardly saying he is going to show up at he door and deliver ""vigilante justice"". How much how a gimp do you have to be to see that as a serious attempt to do harm or as gangster behaviour,

So, because he didn't threaten to go after him and hit him, and because he didn't threaten to hit him really hard or anything, it isn't threatening violent or criminal behavior?

&gt; it was at most a childish response

You know that's kinda' my point, right? Threatening violence over a ""mean"" critique is very childish.

And it was more than childish, because Jordan Peterson put on blast how either how ignorant he is of what ""romancing the noble savage"" means, or he deliberately misrepresented that NYT critique just so he could martyr himself.

&gt; Whats worse is that your doing on someone else's behalf.

... You mean like how Jordan Peterson got really upset on someone else's behalf?

&gt; if you talk shit don't act like a bitch when someone gets upset at you for it.

That's also my point. Jordan Peterson, very obviously, got very upset. Being ""upset"" and ""angry"" are very unhinged emotions. Threatening to hit someone because you got upset isn't a logical or rational reaction.

So, let's remove the useless personal drama you're trying to turn this in to, and go back to the original point, which you seem to be agreeing with.

"stepparents","t5_2t08x","***UPDATE***:   Well, last weekend, we caught her smoking in the house and she had her bong on full display on a shelf in her bedroorm.  We both flipped shit on her and that night she moved out again.  I for one am quite happy she's out again.  House is quiet, peaceful, clean. Found quite a few things that she SWORE she didn't have whilst cleaning her room.  Hard on her mother to see, but she needed to see it.  I'm officially over her (SD's) petty, selfish bullshit.  Whether her mother is or not remains to be seen.  If she decides that she wants to come back at some point, her mother and I will have to have a long talk about rules and enforcement/consequences before that happens.  

Thanks for your advice and encouragement over this ordeal, it is appreciated. ",1522540977

Also just a suggestion, rather than texting each fight and that it was his mother possibly put them on a Google calendar with a specific color. You can make a few notes and invited him to the event. It seems a little less aggressive but also sometimes it really helps to see shit like that on a calendar, my husband and I did it for a non MIL related issue and it really opened his eyes to exactly how frequently a specific thing was happening and that there was a pattern to it.

I'm not sure what you mean by dimension of input and output. A neural network receives a one-dimensional vector of input. The first ten components of the vector might represent the contents of the first five-pixel wide column of screen data, the second ten components the second column, etc. A neural network always produces a one-dimensional vector of output, in this case an eight-component binary vector of button presses.

The data that fills the input vector can come from somewhere with a notion of dimension (like a game screen(, but even then I don't think you're asking the right question. I could restrict the network's input to a two block radius around Mario. That would still be two-dimensional, but would surely produce a worse player.",1522540978

&gt;Demonstrators who participated in other recent violent clashes on Berkeley’s streets began gathering at a city park and on campus Thursday to fight for free speech or to protest hate speech. Many were geared up — with helmets, shields and padding — for a confrontation at the park, just blocks from the campus and Berkeley High School. And the possibility of violence caused authorities to turn out in force.

"destiny2","t5_2we4j","I could get on board with shortening it by a few frames at most.  
  
Personally, I like the primary TTK. I compare D2 to halo in this sense, but halo allows for individual power and plays through grenades and melees. You can win odd man situations with these tools in their high TTK environment. Grenades are on the map, are dropped from enemies, and a rear melee is an instant kill. We currently have a 3 melee Kill within standard resilience. Charged melees don’t seem to really be that hot either. The only builds I’ll even consider melee mods on is nightstalker and stormcaller since they give utility outside of simply damaging an enemy. Most grenades don’t do much damage either. I mainly use mine for area denial. If we had a sandbox with the current weapon play, a 2 hit melee, and grenades bringing people down to a point where a scout Crit would kill them then I think this feeling many have wouldn’t be so prominent.  
  
It would be nice to have a setup where speccing completely into ability mods could make you as dangerous as primary weapons, all while sacrificing your gunfighting abilities by not slotting resilience/recovery/weapon mods.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"NFA","t5_2s7fq","As noted in the other thread, they've reposted the proposed rule and opened up comments on that rule under a new ID number. There's no guarantee that previously submitted comments will be incorporated into the new ID, so consider resubmitting good comments again.

This is not a democracy - the number of comments for or against the proposed regulation do not determine whether it will be implemented or not. Copypasta jobs of someone else's comment don't add weight to a poorly formed argument. There are already 35,000 comments submitted, and just from looking at the first page of 25 comments, 5 of them appear to be copypastas of some text.

Take your time, look at the proposed logic behind the regulation, provide a thoughtful, well-reasoned argument (preferably raising several points) and word it your own. Or browse through the comments and find one that sounds good and reword it a bit.

Here are examples of bad comments:

 *  I do not support rate of fire regulations on semi-automatic firearms. Thank you for your time and effort.
 * This would not eliminate anyone from murdering people. Criminals do not follow laws. Thank you XXX
 * Bump Fire stocks do not meet the requirement for classified under NFA or any other firearms regulations, it is a weapon accessory.

What might a good comment look like?

 * One aspect of the regulation is that current owners of bump stocks will be required to dispose of them in an approved fashion (although, since they're not registered and no serial numbers are on them, who knows who has one?). To challenge this portion of the regulation, an argument could be made that manufacturers, retailers and consumers purchased these items which were approved by the BATFE as legal firearms accessories. They have spent money purchasing a legal product that BATFE apparently accepted as such through letter rulings. Requiring consumers to destroy their property without compensation because BATFE's interpretation changed 10 years after the fact, constitutes an improper taking by the government by denying citizens the right to their property. If the regulation is implemented, BATFE should be required to compensate consumers for the estimated market price of all devices surrendered for destruction.

Other arguments can be made addressing points like:

 * The bump stock requires a semi-automatic firearm to fire a cartridge, thus it is not in and of itself a firearm
 * The bump stock does not change the underlying method of operation of the semiautomatic weapon - it still requires the trigger of the semiautomatic weapon to function each time a cartridge is fired, thus is incompatible with the legal definition of a machine gun (26 USC 5845 (a)) and compatible with the definition of a semiautomatic rifle contained at 18 USC 921 (a) (28). 
 * Under the regulation as proposed, any semiautomatic rifle compatible with a bump stock could be considered a part necessary for a machine gun. Any essential part of a machine gun is considered a machine gun, therefore, semiautomatic rifles could be banned, whether or not a bump stock is possessed by the individual.
 * Using the expansive logic associated with redefining what constitutes a machine gun, any firearms regulation could be accomplished through ""interpretation through regulation"" rather than legislative changes. The democratic republic under which we live envisions the representatives of the people being answerable directly to the people through the process of election. A government employee is not accountable in the same manner.

Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as White's concerned, you're both chunks of coprolite.

I didn’t give you Earth to get rid of you, Pink. I did it to protect the Empire. Not in a [burps] noble sense.

Canadians are amazing people.  Most Canadians don't really get how amazing this country is.  It's the only country I've ever truly felt at home in.  And I say that as a brown man.

* **Original**: Looking at all tests and performances, I have concluded that this student of mine is excellent in math, average in chemistry, but a failure when it came to history

* **Hundred years later**: This student is ""Excellent"" in all courses but ""Average"" in math.

Since you only have one card in your deck to banish ojamas (ojamadification), a searcher that rely on battle destruction (ojama blue), and 10 bricks, that's probably why the deck isnt working too well. 

Ie: If you draw one ojama black and 2 ojamagic in your starting hand, you're playing with 2 cards because 3 cards are worthless, at least until you manage to unclog.

Similarly its why 3 copies of brilliant fusion become bricks when you draw gem knight garnet, you either play more garnets, shuffle them back into the deck, or play with 3 more potential bricks. But brilliant fusion is a bad example because it's a combo extender, ojamagic is a combo enabler since it allows you to activate 'madification's steep cost of 3 ojamas from hand, field, or GY.

I’m pretty happy with the final results.

It’s 49/18, somewhat stiff but feels fast and quick. Carries momentum very well. I can power up hills no problem.

The tires are fat 32mm Continental 4 Seasons. They’re light for how big they are.

The drivetrain is Sugino 75DD with a 49T Zen Chainring. The chain is an Izumi ST.

My favorite part of the bike is just how damn quick I feel on the road and in traffic now. It’s just great. It’s light enough, and feels solid when slamming down on the pedals.

Couldn’t have asked for more!

FYI The Hub Bike Shop in Minneapolis helped me with the facing of the bottom bracket and headtube, and also with installing the headset and finishing up the cockpit (though I installed the brakes myself). Retrogression built the wheel set. I did the rest of the build. Quite frankly without Retrogression and The Hub here in Minneapolis I would’ve been somewhat lost on this build.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","Value to me is how much better you make your team. If your team is bad enough, it doesn't matter how good you are. This isn't the NBA where one star player can will you into the playoffs. Using qualifying for the playoffs is such an arbitrary cutoff to define when a player provides value. Why not make the cutoff top 3 in your division?or top 10 in the league? 

Are you really going to say, if the Avs or Devils finish 1 point out of a playoff spot, that MacKinnon and Hall provided no value? Because Erik Johnson and Varlamov got injured, MacKinnon somehow was less valuable? That just doesn't make any logical sense to me.

The Oilers are really, really bad. Even with one of the best two players in the world on their team. McDavid's value is keeping that team from being the 2016-2017 Avalanche or even worse. It isn't his fault that the team around him is a total dumpster fire.",1522540986

"ultrahardcore","t5_2tswi","welcome to the fucking attention club
k so since everyone feels that saying this is the equivalent of saying that lucity should be fucking shot and killed in a large crowd of people or something I figured I'd explain my opinions on the matter
basically, I see no need at all to let 6,000+ people know this. it's been stated plenty of times in the past, but to be blunt your sexuality doesn't matter. nuked said it pretty well with his comment, everyone is still a human being at the end of the day. contrary to what a large number of ignorant people might think, I'm not trans/homo/whatever-the-fuck phobic at all. as a matter of fact I'm pretty understanding and accepting of everyone's choices in terms of sexuality.
what does irritate me is the fact that every time I look at the community post it seems like someone else has to make some grand fucking announcement that they are suddenly a female or gay. why does it matter? I'm willing to bet that &lt;2% of the people that actively read the subreddit posts actually care about stuff like this. it's your personal choice, and it shouldn't affect others. if you make the choice to be anything other than what the norm is seen to be in society (heterosexual who stays with the gender they were born with), good for you! it's a very difficult thing to acknowledge and it takes courage to do so. does that mean thousands of other people have to know/care about the situation? nope!
there's nothing wrong with letting some close friends in the community know about what you've decided to do in life. I've personally shared some experiences that have occurred in my lifetime that have no need to be posted on a large public forum like reddit, twitter, etc. with a select group of people in the community, basically the harbored group. it's absolutely necessary to get these things off of your chest sometimes, I understand that. everyone's been through a challenging experience that they just needed to talk to someone about. it's human nature. if that means posting it to this subreddit, then that's your choice; I've just personally felt like a lot of the coming out/real life event posts almost seem like the person writing it wants attention or pity.
the 6 words at the top of this comment could have and should have been worded less harshly, I'm not denying that. however, I've just grown tired of seeing things like this. it's a personal matter. if you want to share it with others, go for it. just understand that not everyone is going to care as much as someone else, and that seeing many posts like this makes some people, myself included, skeptical and that I may consider the 10th post less impactful than the 1st post.",1522540988

&gt;  Please assign a probability to that statement and then you'll have said something meaningful. 

Why? A student may have killed himself without this ""intervention."" They ended up not killing themselves. The possibility that the student felt support and became less likely to kill themselves that night is, by consensus and rational thinking, greater than the likelyhood that support made them more likely to kill themselves. Net positive thing to do based on expected values. 

&gt;  there are other more effective options, like idk an in class awareness session or a buddy system or something. Actually a buddy system could be extremely effective, rapid, free, and minimally invasive

I agree. There's always a better way to solve something. However, if this student made this reddit post at 8pm then he may not have attended an in class vague awareness session about why you shouldn't kill yourself. A buddy system would be effective too but I mean, isn't that just having friends? What do you mean by a buddy system? This also seems like something that would be great if it was established at the beginning of the year and less effective if trying to establish it the night before someone kills themselves.

"ipad","t5_2rgny","I was always an android guy and then i felt there wasnt much to keep improving. Everything started to feel the same. (Samsung flagships anyway. So i made the jump from an S7 to an iphone 7plus. From there I updated my fitbit to Apple Watch. I just enjoy how everything “just works” no finessing things or having to get everything to play nice. Well work gave me a new 10.5 IPad Pro and I love it! Using it at work really made me want to get home for personal use and going from a pro to a 2017 i was unsure about because at home I’m really not going to be using all the power of a pro i couldnt justify that. I also wanted to get an Apple Pencil but it seemed silly to buy one i could only use for work.
	Then the 2018 was released! I figure i can use the pencil while at work and then at home as i want, kind of a pain to switch (a minor annoyance to just plug it in to pair) but it gave me an excuse to get the new toy. I find the 2018 really enjoyable and the screen doesn’t bother me at all. Sure the pro is nicer but not $300 nicer! I also liked that the pro had 4 speakers. Once again, I dont think i need to pay an extra 300 for what is essentially Netflix in bed and journaling and drawing. 
	I’m a terrible artist but I like the idea of doodling. I have been physically journaling the last couple years and just the couple of days with this i like that i can write like i would in the journal and add photos from my day (using OneNote. I think there are better ones out there but I figure OneNote will be around the longest or at least will be compatible with something that comes along later. I’d be interested to hear from anyone that has experiencing exporting huge notes from a different program)
	If you are not going to be a power user or serious artist or student I think the 2018 is the perfect balance of features and economy. If you are a student or artist you may want more real estate for the screen but to be honest I wanted a new toy and I’m super satisfied with what I got. ",1522540990

&gt; Utredare Mari Heidenborg föreslår skärpta regler för erkännande av utländska äktenskap som ingåtts av barn utan tidigare anknytning till Sverige. Förslaget innebär att barn i Sverige, oavsett medborgarskap och hemvist, får samma skydd mot barnäktenskap. Utländska barnäktenskap, där ingen av parterna har någon anknytning till Sverige, ska inte erkännas om någon av parterna var under 18 år när någon av dem kom till Sverige.  Lagändringen föreslås träda i kraft den 1 januari 2019.

It was seriously out of nowhere and even though I was usually a really passive kid, but I knew that x-rays did not require cotton balls stuffed down my throat or hands on my neck. He was down low enough that I could kick him in the face and get away, and I don't think his hands were on me long enough to leave any bruises or anything. Didn't fuck me up too bad but I do get really nervous about dentist's offices and I tend to have panic attacks if I'm in the city where it happened. Practice closed down not long after then and the building is abandoned now.

And also my older brother has tried to kill me on more than a few occasions. Chasing after me with knives, baseball bats, shoving me on the floor and jumping off the sofa onto my head, etc... Every house we've lived in has a door that was busted down from him trying to get to me. He lives far away from me now and after dealing with him just when he was a kid, he isn't allowed back home. Thanks to that and some other more disgusting things he did to me, I have PTSD. Physically I'm fine, but I have really bad panic attacks and recurring nightmares where he's trying to get me, and fighting back does absolutely nothing.

- Starbound (very simple but can be fun for a few hours)

"CPTSD","t5_2vvid","Just my hunble opinion - it sounds like you are trying valiantly to keep your anger in check and not do harm to your husband or relationship- which is the right idea. But, in my experience, it doesn't work. It will never work that way..... 

What I have learned to do is to get alone and somewhere safe and BE ANGRY. Be honest with yourself, even if it seems ""wrong"" to be angry - your emotions are valid regardless. Feel all the anger and hurt and all the reasons and what you're really afraid of. What happens with me is a) that takes most of the power out of the emotion and b) I usually find out the issue was something different anyway, and that frees up my current relationship. This can be a very intense process and you should definitely talk to your counselor about it. :) naturally, everyone is different and also at a different place on their healing.

Also, I have cut ties with my mom. It took me 10 years to decide to do it, and I worked out several issues on the way. Ultimately, tho, she continues to be controlling and toxic, and I don't need that in my life. This sucks in general, but it is an option that you can consider.

Interesting article I read.

I was thinking that playing the infield in doesn’t seem to work out that much, and this (while it is 13 years old) it looks like the numbers support this. Interestingly the increase in BA on line drives and ground balls seems to suggest that playing the infield in may cause more runs to be scored overall.

I also disagree with the usage of the infield in during the second inning. If anything I would play corners in, but the entire infield in doesn’t seem to do much good unless the ball is hit right at a fielder",1522540995

 Supposedly, the nerve agents would have been very sophisticated, with *only Russia* able to produce them, so how would the proper antidote be determined?  

I'm not an expert on poisonings or nerve agents, but I would imagine there would not be be a one size fits all type of an antidote, just as there is not a single antidote for a drug overdose (as an example).

Fun fact: Einstein didn't believe that this principal was proof of randomness in the universe and just believed that it was part of an underlying function we don't fully know the nature of.

"otomegames","t5_2t3uv","1. All English releases except the ios version. My favorite content-wise is KY+EB and the PS3 version for the extra fandisc scenes.
2. My favorite ROUTE would probably be...Iba's since it's really different, Sanan's since it's really different, Harada's since it's really different. Basically, the routes that are really different lol. My favorite CHARACTER is Souji, but his route is terribly depressing.
3. I just 100%ed EB like, 5 minutes ago. I was missing one bad end, so I had to go through them again until I found the one I was missing. OF COURSE, it was the 12/12 one I was missing. Darn you Sanan. EB is like, 1/3 the length of KY. It took me max 2 and a half hours per route, often only taking me 2 hours.
4. I like Chizuru because she's proactive for the time. Sure, she can't fight, but she at least tries to fight. One important thing to remember is that even though people complain that she never really fights, EVERYONE else is super amazing at fighting. She couldn't feasibly beat anyone, yet she still pulls her sword out to try and protect her man. I think that's worth some points. Plus, Kazama says [that demon women are the same strength as your average human, so...she can't really do much](/s).
5. That depends on if I had a steady supply of blood. Like, if I could drink from Chizuru or something, then probably yes? Also, what version of the stuff I got (can walk in daylight or not) would be another factor. I don't think I'd like to be born in that setting, but if I could somehow time-travel and had my knowledge of the future, then that would be pretty cool.
6. Hijikata is OTP, so save him for near last-ish. Souma's and Souji's routes are terribly depressing, so save them for later. Harada's route is like walking through a flower field, so save his for when you need a break form depression. Otherwise, go for whatever you feel. Couldn't watch much of the anime since it was just animated sadness. Totally recommend the OVA's though.
7. The whole Shimabara segment from the PS3 release is great. (And most Souji scenes are a-okay in my book).
8. KY+EB spoilers [Nagakura hiding out in a shack was sooooo out of character, it was laughable](/s). How about maybe making it so Souji's route [didn't have Chizuru turn into a fury?](/s).
9. Didn't watch much of the main anime series. The OVA's got it pretty close to the in-game scenes of the Shimabara segment though.
10. People seem to recommend Nightshade (though I haven't played it yet). Destiny's Princess (again, haven't played it), seems similar as well. DOOOOO NOOOOOOT play The Amazing Shinsengumi (Steam). One of the routes is deplorable, one is sooo boring, two are genuinely fine (though poorly written), and one is pretty bad, but he's my favorite character int he game so it didn't bother me as much as it would others.

Get a one or two shot jakobs shotgun to build stacks, then switch to a high pellet count torgue shotgun and just aim at the ground. Gaige is my favorite of the six vault hunters, so that's my opinion.

Maya's rez skill is amazing, simply must have for cooperative play, but the effectiveness of shooting teammates to heal them seems to drop off once you reach even the end of tvhm, not to mention higher levels, due to it being better to focus down enemies rather than take a quarter of your team's firepower and squander it. Ammo also becomes an issue for extended fights, and with no way to regen in her skills, she'd be reliant on absorption shields, which generally (unless you're running with a Sham, but even then...eh) aren't that great. That's not even mentioning that they only absorb bullets, so in melee fights it's truly not worth taking. 

If you really, REALLY want to be a bro though, go with axton's slag turret. A big part of late game is getting that sweet x3 multiplier on enemies, but it can be frustrating to swap out to a slag weapon and back again if you don't have anything affecting reload speed. Slag grenades work well, but unless you're using something like the magic missile, you'll only have so many to throw before you run out. The turret though can last a long time, has a short cool down once specced, and slags damn near everything. Bonus points if you go for the double turrets too.

Sorry to ramble, but these are my three most played classes, so I feel qualified to give input. Just watch out for axton, as unlike the other five vault hunters, he doesn't really have anything you could consider OP, like anarchy, gunzerking, or death blossom.

Aioli or aïoli ( or ; Provençal Occitan: alhòli [aˈʎɔli] or aiòli [aˈjɔli]; Catalan: allioli [ˌaʎiˈɔɫi]) is a Mediterranean sauce made of garlic and olive oil; some regions use other emulsifiers such as egg. The names mean ""garlic and oil"" in Catalan and Provençal. Its association is with the cuisines of the Mediterranean coasts of Spain (Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, Murcia and eastern Andalusia), France (Provence) and Italy (Liguria, Sicily and Calabria). Current versions of the French-Provençal sauce are closer to a garlic mayonnaise, incorporating egg yolks and lemon juice, whereas the original French-Provençal and Spanish Catalan versions are without egg yolk and have more garlic.

Although direct or indirect if they called and told me “the store told me to call to get my activation/upgrade fee waived” I would send them back to the store because they have just as much ability to offer credits as we did (well indirects not as much but they’d have there own bogus setup fees and shit that the customer thought was an upgrade fee and then are confused when the real upgrade fee hit their bill).",1522541012

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I have some gripes with the KH series.

First of, cutscenes. There are so many things happening in all different places that it would just be better if the games were made to have multiple playable characters in different areas or if there was nothing going on behind the scenes. The transitions breaks the gameplay constantly, and it gets annoying.

Second, the combat. I wish an air dodge was given to you right away and spells were stronger than melee from the get-go. I keep hearing the complaint that you can just mash X to win when playing KH, and it's somewhat true, as magic is pretty bad early on compared to just swinging. Imagine if the final fight with Xemnas' Reveral thorn things had flying combat mixed in with that, somewhat like Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3's combat. Having blocks and counters happen, along with magic and combos that work with said magic, would make the game feel more interesting.


Third, Synthesis research. If you've gotten a certain Synthesis material from an enemy, it should show up on Jiminy's Journal. Not something big, but it would help a lot.

I have average hopes for KH3. I wish whoever buys it a good time, but I will sit this one out until I see reviews. Considering this is the final chapter of the Xehanort saga (Or so I've heard), I wonder if they would dive into having custom characters and movesets for the next game.",1522541012

Heres the example of a community tool made for ""Path of Exile"" (an ARPG). 

**It has player driven economy:**

http://poe.trade/search/otutotasenosit

You type in the item and can quickly see:

* Price

* Stats

* Name of sellers, with option of copy pasting a direct message to him (""whisper"" button, message shows name, location in sellers stash and price)

* Online status of the seller (AFK, Online, Offline)

* Age of the sell (if an item is for sale for a longer time it might be priced too high and you could try to haggle with the seller)

**A public API also allows Statistics gathering, like seen here:**

https://poe.ninja/challenge/unique-armours

* You can see here the price of items per category (for example helmets, body armor, assault rifle, ammo etc. in EFT) and how the price is fluctuating.

Overall i dont really know if the devs would even want that considering the realistic implementation in the game world. But PMCs will surely have a PC in the hideout so the idea isnt far off right?

I saw him,

At the furthest reach of my retinas.

I always knew him, even though I never met him.

.

.

.

He looked at me with such expression,

Hope,

Sadness,

Grief,

Trust.

.

.

.

Time starts to move again...

.

.

.

No, please!

I beg you!

Don't bring me to him!

Just let me be,

Here in my zone,

With no responsibility.

I'm not ready to face him! 

.

.

.

But time never stops moving...

Time waits for no one...

.

.

.

I've made my decision.

With a glimmer of hope, I breathe.

I breathe the air of determination,

The air of desperation,

I quicken my pace,

To embrace him, whatever he is.

.

.

.

It's up to me to decide,

Wether to face him head on, 

Or to be drowned in the currents of time.

Can you give me an example of a type fundamentalism that is intolerant of ""the other""?

&gt;There is no such thing as moderate Islam, there are Muslims that use cognitive dissonance to avoid following some bad parts of they religion, but Islam itself isn't moderate

Your application of the term cognitive dissonance is incorrect. Cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. Cognitive dissonance occurs as a consequence of a person doing something that contradicts his or her personal beliefs, ideals, and values. So for example, a Muslim whose interpretation of Islam does not include the belief apostates should be killed or the belief that people should have limbs amputated as punishment for theft is not using cognitive dissonance by opposing those beliefs because they do not contradict his or her personal beliefs. 

And to be sure, I never claimed Islam itself was moderate. However, one can be moderate in one's practice of Islam.

"WayOfTheBern","t5_3ff8l","&gt;The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","The Breed Club will have a list of recommended health tests, and you can plug the dogs into the OFA database to make sure they were actually tested and got good results. 

Make sure your breeder is doing ALL of the recommended tests for BOTH parents, and verify the results yourself. The breeder my family went to only tested the dad’s eyes. I thought I was so knowledgeable knowing about this eye condition and asking for the OFA papers. Our poor dog was diagnosed with a luxating patella at a young age because the breeder didn’t test for that. Her littermate has to have expensive surgery for this, and has a totally different temperament (plus off standard color). Our dog loved agility but she’s not allowed to do it anymore because it could hurt her leg 🙁

I’ll talk about breeding mixes from a slightly different perspective. It’s super hard for the average person to find a reputable breeder because BYBs try their best to look reputable. We got our puppy the year before her breed got AKC recognition. Because her breed had not been “centralized” (can’t think of a better term) there was no consistent information on what health tests the breeder should be doing, what size they should be, what color, temperament, etc. Because the breeder didn’t show or participate in any sports, there was no way to “prove” that she consistently produced healthy dogs that were the correct size, temperament, color, etc. And as we later found out, her dogs varied A LOT in all categories. 

Looking back, I really wish we had gone with a breed that was already recognized by the AKC and a breeder who showed their dogs. Even if they’re “just” showing conformation, as a buyer you know their dogs are at least healthy and sane enough to be examined by a stranger in a loud ring with lots of other dogs. 

If I were you, I would go to a local dog show with breeds you are interested in. Talk to the people there (just make sure they’re not about to go into the ring!), ask them about their dogs, what makes their breed special, etc. People love to talk about their dogs! See what breeders are there, ask if they have litters planned, verify their health testing in the online databases (good breeders are proud that their dogs passed all of this testing!) and get on a waitlist. Then enjoy your new puppy that will have the best chance possible for a healthy, long life. There is an article called “I don’t want a show dog” that explains why even if you just want a pet, you still want a dog from a show breeder. ",1522541022

"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt; Economic oppression and social oppression have always been linked together, that's why everyone from MLK to the Black Panthers were socialists, because they couldn't talk about black liberation without including economic liberation, because it was economic oppression that allowed for their social oppression, and it was the concentration of economic power in the hands of white supremacists/capitalists that empowered their oppressors.

There's no social oppression in Canada right now unless you count stuff against white people like affirmative action. 

&gt;Trying to deal with social issues without dealing with economic issues is the number one reason liberal identity politics is trash compared to proper leftist identity politics, because liberals are capitalists and refuse to deal with the role capitalism has had in social oppression, instead hoping token representation among the ruling class is enough to deal with social ills. 

Implying leftist identity politics isn't trash and won't lead to millions dead if we keep going down this road like identity politics always does. 

&gt;A multi-cultural capitalist class ruling over a multi-cultural working class is not a solution, it is ultimately only superficially different than a homogeneous capitalist class ruling over either any type of working class. A multi-cultural working class overthrowing the capitalist class, on the other hand, is the ideal solution.

Nobody is ruling over anyone we live in a democracy and at no point does race or gender fit into that anyways...

&gt;No matter how much idiot liberals, be they the pseudo-woke or plain-old status-quo warriors, try to act like the two aren't linked, their feelings on the matter do not change the facts. Social issues and economic issues are tied at the hip, and must be addressed together.

They are correlated they are not tied at the hip. Someone with a shitty upbringing is more likely to turn to crime and less likely to go to college which will negative impact their economic status but that's not a problem for the finance minster to solve and worse we aren't even talking about actual social issues we are talking about identity politic bullshit which has destroyed economies when applied financially.

"CoDCompetitive","t5_2tvg8","In BO3, Rise was solid at the beginning of the game taking 1 or 2 titles, Optic flourished throughout the bulk of the year, picking up a decent amount of titles, where NV came into the 2nd last event of the year and took it, winning champs as well. The faze lineup from aw was an ok team all year, very good online, with decent placements, 3rd being the highest. They didn’t play optic in Bo3 on lan and stayed undefeated into IW.

In IW, the first event as usual was more fluky you could say. Rise took it with the bulk of BO3 elevate roster. IW would prove to be the most contested year ever where we saw the rise of eUnited, a team made up of 3 young players and a relatively unknown veteran (Gunless, silly, arcitys, and prestinni) taking a tournament early on. Splyce (madcat, jurd, Bance, zero) became the first European team to win on NA soil. Lg and optic both took a tournament home. Optic also won the last event before champs, and won champs, ending the undefeated streak faze had against them as well.

WW2: the first 2 events were won by the current tK roster, which was quite unconvincing, the team always seeming to clutch up and pull out wins by the narrowest of margins such as in back to back tournaments defeating eU in game 5 round 11s for T3 in both. Clutch factor is huge in ww2. Rise with the resurgence of Methods performance in which felony was dropped and methods was picked up along with the trade of aqua for Gunless has seen rise secure themselves as the #1 team currently.

&gt; Study done on Rehabilitation of stroke patients and acupuncture

https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/acupuncture-doesnt-work/

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/5-scientists-weigh-in-on-acupuncture/

Studies are irrelevant if they are poorly done.

&gt; Chiropractic - We already know that shit works, we have the science to prove it.

Hi there, it's your friend science, here to ruin your dreams: https://health.spectator.co.uk/the-evidence-shows-that-chiropractors-do-more-harm-than-good/

https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-chiropractic-conundrum/

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447290/

&gt; Cupping - Cupping in relieving chronic neck pain Studies show that it is effective, but not necessarily more so than massage. 

https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/cupping-olympic-pseudoscience/

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fibromyalgia/expert-answers/cupping/faq-20058053 (it doesn't help fibromyalgia, at any rate)

And basically, everything I could find on cupping being effective in any way stated that we needed further, more scientifically rigorous testing to be sure of anything.

&gt; Homeopathy - This one is always up for debate because people who are stupid use it as a cure all. 

Nope. It does not work in any way. https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/1800-studies-later-scientists-conclude-homeopathy-doesnt-work-180954534/

&gt; Naturopathy - Their job is preventative medicine

Yeah, preventative medicine where you tell people to avoid vaccines (the ultimate preventative medicine) and take supplements that you just happen to sell instead. Here's the secret: ND stands for ""Not a Doctor"".

She confronted them and they admitted it and laughed about her crying about some stupid farm animal that made such delicious pork. She just locked herself in her room and let them finish their party.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","So, toning down the Lord Ruler to... well the Lord Ruler and not ""Guy who uses the Bands of Mourning as a buttplug"" it would be a battle to either wear down their opponent's source of magic (Philosopher's Stone for Father, metalminds for the Lord Ruler) or to remove them from their person.

Father's body is fueled by the Philosopher's Stone. Lust's body was destroyed when her stone ran out of souls so I'm assuming Father's body works on the same principles.

The Lord Ruler can only have so much metal at a given time and as such can't use Allomancy forever unless he's taking bites of whatever metal he's throwing. His metalminds would eventually run dry, however with compounding he could theoretically keep this going until the foundry around him runs out of metal.

So if attrition is the game here, Father probably has the win as it only takes a lucky shot or perhaps some arm removal to remove the Lord Ruler's bracers, killing him. The Lord Ruler probably couldn't be killed in any other way so long as he still has gold metalminds filled (he was decapitated and burnt to a crisp and survived although I'm not actually sure how since that's not how gold Feruchemy actually works) and most importantly attached to his body. The Lord Ruler's weakness is blatant enough that Vin, someone with little Mistborn training, half the metals, and no real knowledge of his weakness managed to killed him.

And that's assuming that his metalminds are somehow resistant to alchemy (Feruchemical attributes, essentially Investiture, as alchemical fuel would be a neat concept though) and can't just be transmuted into a shape that falls off his body or turned into lead (I vaguely remember transmuting lead into gold in FMA:B is illegal because it would crash the economy, so I'm assuming that it's both possible and reversible).

On the other hand, Father with the Truth is resistant to lava... but is an earlier version of Father? The Lord Ruler could very easily burn through massive amounts of the Philosopher's Stone by putting Father into molten metal (which a foundry would have, think the climax to T2). While the Mistborn books have oddly never had an action scene in a foundry, I see no reason why you couldn't Push/Pull on molten metal (or use molten metal as a metalmind but that seems more than a little dangerous). If Father somehow found himself in a pool of metal T2-style. Alchemy is the science of manipulating matter but *not* energy, so I think it wouldn't be possible for Father to simply cool the metal before he touches it. Sitting in molten metal should destroy his body and drain his stone in attempts to escape/regenerate.

As for rounds 1-4... I'd give it to Father about 6-7/10. The Lord Ruler could win using his environment but Father has no real need of his. Taking the fight further away from molten metal (like outside the foundry) increases his odds dramatically.

Round 5 starts getting a little esoteric and honestly their powers start getting even more ridiculous. Not in a bad way or anything, but in a Silver Age Superman ""I can do literally anything!"" kind of way because they've both stepped past God-King and firmly into god (small ""g"") territory (neither can create souls as far as I'm aware). I'd still give it to the Lord Ruler since Preservation isn't corporeal while Father with the Truth still is. The Lord Ruler could attack from every angle simultaneously against a physical being while Father doesn't even have an enemy to hit.

Also, as for the ""Truth is a Shard"" thing, rereading the wiki shows that perhaps the Entity Beyond the Gate (that eye) is the Shard instead with Truth being an avatar. As I differentiated between Alchemy and Investiture in the actual fights it shouldn't change Round 5.",1522541030

"saltierthancrait","t5_9d1wl","It's still a little too fast for a *Galactic Empire* to collapse.

The strongest Empires in history took decades, if not centuries to fall. 
The Roman Republic and later Empire took *fucking* forever to finally fall.   The British Empire slowly faded away as they ceded control to the countries themselves after a *cataclysmic war* (WWII).   Spain withered and died to rebellion and stronger powers  (France, Britain, etc...).  Russia imploded and the German Empire (not the Nazi's) were beaten down through 4 years of brutal warfare.

Japan is the one imperial power which still controlled quite a bit of land upon their collapse and had the quickest dissolution, but its worth noting that they were facing 3 superpowers at  once, one of which had a literal doomsday weapon.

What does this have to do with the Sequels?  Well, simply make the Empire and Republic be the primary factions involved and the First Order/Resistance be their proxies vying for control in the Unknown regions.  It'd be an actual Cold War.  What's even cooler is the way you can fill in the  30-year gap which we have with smaller,  but equally interesting conflicts of pro-Republic and pro-Imperial factions.  Neither the Republic or Empire would want to directly engage each other  because it'd be even more destructive than the  Clone  wars.  ",1522541032

When Jimmy is injured (and when he's not) I want Wiggs being as aggressive as possible on the offensive end because outside of him and KAT right now, nobody can actually create anything on offense.  He takes stupid 23 year old shots just like any young player, but we need to give him more patience as much as some fans hate to hear that.  We can't say ""well, he's a generational athlete and has shown flashes, we should wait and let him develop"" then turn around and get upset when he plays like the unpolished talent we all know he is.

The process to intercept the package will allow you to return to sender, change delivery location, or hold at the post office for pickup. If you process an intercept to a new address or schedule to have it held at the post office you can add signature confirmation. Keep in mind the base charge to file the intercept is ~$14 plus additional expenses for changing the address or adding signature confirmation.

Although I cannot comment on your case because I haven't read your article, before saying stuff like:

I would encourage you to make sure you understand what CSW is saying in the first place without confirmation bias. And then to not misrepresent what he is saying. Because him being arrogant or having a big ego doesn't justify you misrepresenting what he is saying. Again, I'm stating a principle here.

You are just anthropomorphisng them. If you went up to a cow and said you were going to kill it you would get no reaction because the cow doesn't give a shit. There is no higher brain function, no fear of the threat, no existential dread.

If you attempt to kill it and fail obviously it will run and try to get away, that is basic animal instinct to survive. Plants do the exact same thing to the best of their ability.

I think you should do this, as you planned. You know what you are doing, trust yourself. Your mom has doubts and is dumping them onto you, those doubts came from her and not from within, like you said ""I’ve read a lot, saw trans people enjoying life and was getting so excited that I didn’t sleep properly for a couple of nights"". She grew up in a different world decades ago, and she likely grew up comfortable in her mind and body which makes it very hard to understand what you feel. If you pursue transitioning then  even if your body is ""not as the real one"" you will still be farther away from a body you hate and closer to a body you love. ""and that I’ll end up killing myself""--everything I've read says that trans people are more likely to be suicidal before transition or if they can't transition, trans people are almost always happier with transition (not always, do your research and figure out what was different in their situation and choices). However, if you are in a place where you would constantly be ridiculed then you'll have to think deeper on how to proceed because not being accepted and being ridiculed are things that can drive people to suicide, it can be safer to wait it out until you can move to a more accepting place.

"mixingmastering","t5_30dmz","Hey Kyle,
I would be curious to know if you have been filling in forms for their quotes (on mixing engineers websites) or emailing them etc and what have you been asking for? It seems odd that none of them has given you a price. The advice given here is fine but there are many mixing engineers who are at different levels and therefore you will find someone in your price range hence why I am surprised. Usually, there is a form asking you basic questions before the quote is given. This is usually to save time down the line as the engineer knows how much work is involved, it may be a hassle to do it but again if you have done it's odd they would not then respond with their prices (for all they know you are a billionaire with a songwriting hobby!) Sometimes if something seems off it is worth investigating how it has been approached. Some of the help here is I am sure honest but it is speculation to suggest what a ""good"" place would charge. If someone doesn't give you their prices they probably are not a good fit however you will need to give them some info first, unfortunately. Some of those who have straight up prices or simple hourly rates may seem more genuine due to their transparency but in my experience, it may not include everything you need to get a finished mix such as editing, tuning etc. They will either charge what they advertised giving you a result that is not really finished or add in extras on top of the advertized price whereas often a quote request will prompt a quote that is total after they figure out what you need and therefore how much work it will be. A bit like an electrician coming to your house to look at an issue before giving you a quote. Hourly rates are almost arbitary in my book, you don't know how long they will take unless you have used them before and how will you know if they have actually spent that time doing it? Again I would want my electrician to look at the issue after I give him/her the details and then give me a quote. I don't care at that point if he is quick or not, I don't want him drawing out the project because he is paid hourly especially if I couldn't see him work on it. I know this is long and doesn't answer you directly but we could maybe help with your approach to stay clear of charlatans if we know how you have gone about it. Where do you live?

"dementia","t5_2rfqf","Hey Lauren.  The first and most important piece of advise to give you is to learn patience and very thick skin.  Dementia is like a spectrum so not all people with it have the same symptoms.  

But, one thing is for sure, the people around your loved one are the ones who truly suffer the most.  

You’ll see periodic changes in personality and more likely than not, at some point, not recognize your loved one from a physical and / or personality level.

What I discussed is for the sake of the experience, the challenge, the self-improvement, and the competition with others.

You don't speedkill to grind out gear. You don't do min ilvl challenges to grind out gear. You don't do Ultimate to grind out gear. You do it for the *experience*.

There's a vast, *vast* difference between running Hell's Lid ten times for tomes and running Hell's Lid ten times to try and improve upon your completion time and to beat other's completion times. It's not about the tomes. It's about the *experience*.",1522541040

My standard basic recommendations for newbies are:

Download [Enhanced User Interface](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/enhanced-user-interface.512263/), which places information more intuitively and makes things easier to understand. Thoroughly read the Civilopedia's (the in-game help) Game Concepts, Terrain and Features, Resources, and Improvements sections. 

There's a lot of quality material on Youtube. I recommend watching any 2 of FilthyRobot's Overexplain games (these are played with the r/nqmod, but the logic and decision-making processes are relevant to unmodded BNW):

How the fuck am I supposed to call for national-funded Healthcare and Trade Education, if I don't have the guarantor, via small arms, that the citizens maintain the ultimate check, and can ensure that these services are actually carried out? How can I hope to move beyond our current political systems into a People driven future, if We as a People aren't armed?

Lol when you explain actual legal human rights its a ""rant."" Consent requires the following things: Full disclosure, just compensation, no duress, means of arbitration and definitions of legal responsibilities.

You probably have zero clue what these mean.

Do you realize how idiotic and barbaric it is to say risks of legal activities equal consent to have your human rights removed?

By your logic therefore, if I walk on a sidewalk and I trip, therefore the government can say ""You tripped! Now you have no more freedom of speech!""

&gt;Yes having sex comes with consequences

Abortion is a consequence just not one you approve of. I love it when pro-life people consider children a punishment.

&gt;sex crazed need help

Jibberish.

&gt;There is no reason with modern medical science for a woman to die in child birth if they do someone messed up

Yes and I guess you don't care then that a family with a dead mother received no just compensation for it at all. Even privates in the army are paid to scrub toilets by the government.

You think giving birth is some disgustingly low thing don't you. You have no respect for mothers do you? Meanwhile if you are disabled or die while *killing other people for the government*, your family gets a lifetime pension. Why? Because that's called *just compensation.* 

&gt;“Rarely extremely damaging” did you mess up.

That's proper English lol.

&gt;Either way the rapist should be punished

Self defense is not punishment you idiot. Self defense is your right to protect your body from immediate threat to life and well-being. The punishment comes after, once a court decides if the rapist is legally fit to trial (aka potentially cognizant of their behavior). Do you have any concept of law at all?

Sounds like to me you never even considered these things and only went with what you were taught.

&gt;an innocent baby 

There are innocent rapists too. I worked with disabled adults (autistic and downs syndrome) and there was a down syndrome rapist. Innocence has zero to do with the right to justified homicide.

Innocence or guilt of the person or thing putting your body at risk HAS ZERO bearing on your right to protect your body from harm by defending yourself from them.

Say that slowly to yourself if you cannot understand what I just said. ALL people are innocent before determined to be guilty by a jury of their peers. So it doesn't fucking matter if someone harming me is guilty or not, since guilt is only determined much later, and I HAVE THE IMMEDIATE RIGHT to protect myself from harm.

The fact you say this, and continue to say the word ""murder"" means you are being willfully ignorant to the human rights you take for granted.

Adoption is an option for parenthood, NOT an option for the pain and trauma of giving birth, for which you would force on women with ZERO just compensation or due process and for which you wouldn't give a shit if some die and leave a family motherless because a doctor ""messed up"".

BUT if that is the case then tell your spouse how you are feeling and perhaps say ""I am not happy and something needs to change or we are heading down a rocky path!""  I'd like to think this is what I would have done and not have chosen to put myself on a dating site on a global dating site. I am not sure anyone spouse could honestly and completely get over that betrayal (with or without kids). Sorry for the ramble. Maybe I am just living in a fairy tale world and expect too much. Who knows maybe that's the problem. Cheers!",1522541045

As it does so more and more people on the right feel alienated and gain traction themselves until the pendulum swings. 

The problem is that if you go too far in either direction, in my estimation, society suffers and the landscape changes. The pendulum swings happen but they have to happen frequently enough and be short enough to maintain a balance.",1522541046

"MilitaryGfys","t5_32br2","**Range safety**

In the field of rocketry, range safety may be assured by a system which is intended to protect people and assets on both the rocket range and downrange in cases when a launch vehicle might endanger them. For a rocket deemed to be off course, range safety may be implemented by something as simple as commanding the rocket to shut-down the propulsion system or by something as sophisticated as an independent Flight Termination System (FTS) that has redundant transceivers in the launch vehicle that can receive a command to self-destruct then set off charges in the launch vehicle to combust the rocket propellants at altitude. Not all national space programs utilize flight termination systems on launch vehicles.

In the United States, range safety is usually the responsibility of a Range Safety Officer (RSO) affiliated with either the civilian space program led by NASA or the military space program led by the Department of Defense, through its subordinate unit the Air Force Space Command.

Como el lienzo era limitado y el espacio no era mucho, habia otras comunidades que querían pintar arriba de lo tuyo para hacer sus logos y sus mierdas, y así surgieron ""alianzas"" , sobre todo con finland y uruguay, que intentábamos arreglar los píxeles vandalizados de nuestras banderas y promover la paz y el orden.

Postural also means that a usually involves a change in position for example from laying to sitting or sitting to standing and if you do that too fast and you have pots your blood pools in your legs and your pulse speeds up trying to get oxygen to your brain and since I can't do that effectively, you drop, you don't have any warning.

You can also try a dangle feed - it feels so odd but can work. 

Also make sure you’re feeding baby from that side often, even though it hurts.

The green on the pale pink looks very ugly. If you change that green to a dark or very light grey, I think it'll look better. 

The section under Clients needs more hierarchy. You have the headers bold, but they're nearly the same size. Make the text of the paragraphs smaller than the headers.

Yes, you can still get a programming job without a degree, but you have to decide what you want to do. What field? When you know what you want to do, learn that particular subject more than the other things you know. Then you should have a Linked In, have your resume online at Monster.com and Indeed, and you will get recruiter emails. That's how I got my current job.

I don't recommend a bootcamp. I lived in a hacker house in California for the summer last year and it was full of bootcamp students. They have a lot of projects/homework to do and they attended classes from about 8 AM to 7 PM. A bootcamp seems harder than school, but they are less on theory and more on jumping into the subject.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Just in response to those who are saying this is a buthurt issue for those that practice/studying to practice medicine etc (I'm sure GuessableSevens and others will agree):

These things matter. Advice/insight, no matter how harmless it may seem, given under the guise of medical background is reckless. There is a very specific pattern of approaching what is wrong with someone that we spend over a decade trying to perfect. I would say it's the opposite of arrogance, it is the utmost humility and understanding that we really know nothing even with all the experience. You realize how stupid you are every single day. Surgical residents in their last year of residency or even fellowship (5+ yrs after the M.D) no matter how experienced always defer to the attendings and get berated, ridiculed and humiliated on a regular basis at some places. The reason for this is is that in the line of work where people specifically come seek you out for advice on their health, there should be as little a margin of error as possible. You may hear the most classic presentation for CHF in the world, but if you don't go down and perform a hx &amp; physical you are committing malpractice even if its right.  The steps taken in formulating a differential and then getting to the assessment and plan are holy and universal, no matter where you are on the globe. That's why explaining or coming to any sort of conclusion without seeing the patient, let alone not even having the slightest clue on whats going on  is an obscenity to any clinician. This code and this approach is what is keeping everybody safe, and has everytime they have sought out medical advice or been given it. 

The second point is that it is no relation to this person's area of study..and just so happens to be one of the broadest things in the world (extremely extremely difficult). Its like saying someone has a fever. It could be anything. Attempting to explain something like that shows anybody that has approached a cheif complaint like that, that the individual has no idea what they are talking about. It really serves no point, no matter how many pubmed searches you do. ",1522541062

Just make smart and safe decisions and you’ll do great! You’ll understand what I mean as time goes by. This is true for anybody. It’s the time you are responsible for yourself and you don’t want anything to bite you in the butt.

 I review a LOT of gamers and all of them want to be the next Ninja or DrDisrespect. The reality is that as a kid you are going to have limited options unless your parents are in your corner. If this is not the case,  you need to reestablish your own expectations and focus on what you CAN do - not what you CAN'T!

Its easy to say, I can't create because:

- shitty internet 
- shitty games
- shitty PC
- no elgato hd60 Pro

The reality is this,  what makes a good steamer is not the gameplay,  its the persona the streamer conveys. You don't need to stream to build that persona. You don't need the best PC. You simply need to work every day on building your character and focus on the things you can do - like make a video or a highlight reel or any number of other things available.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","&gt; Better technology. Faster speeds. Lower transaction rates

It's not like dial-up in this regard. Internet speeds in the dial-up era were held back by lack of expensive infrastructure, slow computer clock rates and the need for relevant R&amp;D in the field of high-frequency waves, fiber-optics and shit. With Bitcoin, it's completely different.

Let me break it to you: to get more speed, you need to accept some more centralisation. When you go from 3–7 tx/s to 1,000,000s tx/s, you also go from peer-to-peer internet money to PayPal, from BitTorrent to YouTube, from Napster to Spotify. There's no progress to be made, just the trade-off.

See, Satoshi wasn't stupid when he developed Bitcoin. He was an experienced C++ programmer in the field of cryptography, so it's pretty well optimised. You can't have less bits per transaction, otherwise the system wouldn't be cryptographically secure, and, to put things simple, you can't really have more bits per second, otherwise peers would start to fall behind.

There's no real significant improvement ahead, especially with Moore's law betraying us like that. Bitcoin is about what we'll ever have when it comes to decentralised money. I'm not trying to say that it's bad or useless — quite the contrary, which seems to contradict your opinion when you get all into the future talk.

What's really missing is unifying opposition voices that bring together all the discontent with various aspects of Trump's administration. There's one Trump. There are millions of people opposed to him, but all in their own ways. The advocacy groups against him are mostly focused on issues affecting them. Comedians mock Trump, but most of them don't put forward alternatives. In the absence of common leadership, Trump fills *that* void with his own stupid impulsive ideas.

The campaign against gun violence is successfully promoting its message in the face of opposition. Stormy Daniels is getting her message out and keeping Trump off balance.

A bunch of friends [One who travelled from India] and myself decided to go drive to Hatta because they were expecting rain that day. 
Somehow all of us missed the warning tweeted by Dubai police not to travel to Hatta. 
Anyway we were driving through some heavy rain and noticed some flooding decided to head back only to see some massive amount of hail. Reached a crossroads where every single route was flooded and we had to wait there for 2 hours. 
Later that evening a police escort came and took us through some route in the mountains only to realise we were on the route to the border. 
Out of the 4 of us in the car 3 of us had emirates ids the other had his visit visa on the phone.

The immigration officer took our ids and told us to go around and come back in. While doing that they changed shifts and they we got pulled over into secondary while the cops tried to determine whether or not we were smuggling my friend in from Oman.

Escalation procedures for us is one of 3 things:

1) if it can be argued it infringes on a legally registered trademark that you hold, go via your legal team. They can sort it out. Even better, they can usually seize it in to your own domain portfolio to stop it happening again.

2) if it’s being used for phishing, a vendor like PhishLabs/etc can handle this for you (if you’re paying them for services, obviously). Note that the vendor typically ends up owning the domain in this case... you may or may not care about this.

3) if it is being used maliciously and you have evidence of it, you can go via the abuse process with the registrar. YMMV on this as some registrars are not typically responsive. We go through *our* registrar, MarkMonitor, because we pay them big $$ to handle our problems. If you have a ‘full service’ registrar they may handle his for you, especially if 1 is true. You can also go to the hosting provider the A record is pointing at it the registrar isn’t responsive: this is a band aid since they can just move it though.

Good luck. Shit is a PITA. We outsource this now. You might want to dnstwist your domain, unsure if it’s catch this one but may catch a few you’ve missed and can protectively register.",1522541069

Running a country != running a company

&gt; The altenrative is not secession, but a fairer way to distribute funds, that ensures states are not penalized but at the same time making sure money goes into the right cause.

On what basis do you suppose we distribute central funds?  

&gt; Hmm that's not what democracy is. What you described is a mob government. A democracy has to ensure every person's voice is heard. If you don't accept gau policies, you have the right to protest and make your voice heard through your representatives.

Of course you get your voice heard, but the will of the majority is ultimately followed. States’ rights and other protections and checks and balances are there, but the will of the majority is what is listened to in a democracy.

&gt; LMFAO. This is the bane of modern socialism. Rewarding the irresponsible habit of breeding like animals.

That sounds very crass on your part firstly. Secondly, demographic transition is a natural process. There is no socialism in saying we should allot states the revenue based on population. Communist/socialist will argue for giving more money to North on top of their population portioned amount. Same amount of government spending on everyone is socialist? Do South Indians deserve more money than North Indians now?

Kerala once had the TFR of the underdeveloped states of the North. Just because we have climbed out of it does not mean we get to act superior and be condescending. Disparity in revenue sharing is only going to aggravate the situation. Those states require funds if they are to see the TFR reduce.

we are going hybird first anyway, so there will still be pow for quite some time and i dont want that pow to be based on chips made by bitmain only

hard forks ARE a serious matter and i think we should take this situation seriously and consider one.

whats the point of making ethash ""expensive to make asics for"", but then when someone still does it (surprise surprise), you dont react and just give them the castle?

if you want to be asic resistant you have to stick to your guns and actually invalidate asics as they appear (and thus fuck bitmain)... then again ethereum doesnt exactly have the best track record when it comes to ""sticking to your guns"" ",1522541070

But in any case you are wrong about your assertions that per capita gun statistics are more or less on par with Europe. But even if you were right, it doesn't mean you don't have a gun problem. It means that both the US and Europe have gun problems. Comprende?

But, in any case you are wrong. I don't care where you got your numbers from, because reading the retarded diatribes you have on here with other Dickheads its most likely you've lifted your stats from a news article or a blog post, or a youtube blog video. 

Instead read Richardson &amp; Hemenway, 2011, Grinshteyn &amp; Hemenway, 2016 who take World Health Organisation firearm and nonfirearm homicide statistics and compare America to other high OECD countries per capita (100,000 people). Shows a reality that is very different to yours.

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","EverSync seems to be the best alternative. It has a high cost of $45 USD/yr. for the Pro version. This is much too high.

Overall the program is built better, but still a quirky layout in areas. X-marks was basically abandoned and never kept up to date. It's a shame, because it had the most potential.

EverSync syncing seems to be better and is definitely a lot faster. I've read user reviews that say it is more reliable with less conflicts.

They don't support Profiles. This is a major caveat, as they are charging $45 for the Pro version. If you want Work and Home separated, then you'd have to buy 2 Pro subscriptions.

The only good reason that I see to purchase the Pro Version is the centralized backups. The backup you see on the Free Version is local only. If you remove the Extension/Add-on then you lose those local backups.

I'd recommend periodically exporting backups, if you are using the Free Version. I've read that a Firefox account will create online backups and this would automate it. Another option that I am looking at is using Backupery for Chrome with Cloud Storage.

If EverSync supported Multiple Profiles and charged a more reasonable price of $15//yr, I would pay for it.

The web interface is much better for managing Bookmarks/Favorites than X-marks. You can move entire folders on the server/central repository. The UI is a bit more modern, but still 8 years behind.

Added Bonus are the SpeedDials. I am testing them out and they are also syncing. They provide quicker access to Most Used Sites, instead of using the Bookmarks Toolbar. Hoping they don't act buggy.",1522541073

I agree with op because that's a much more heavily loaded sentence than ""damn noob"" or other verbal harassement.

You are right in that toxic people are creative in the way they flame but if even a fraction of the player-base using this sentence could be deterred from using it. I would be fine with more ""fuck you noobs"".",1522541073

"geologycareers","t5_2x755","Grad school admission for geosci in my experience happens in two rounds. One is an early round with letters send by mid Feb and requesting an answer ~March 15 but federally mandated to allow up to April 15. The second round is for when mentors don't get their first round picks for students and send out a new batch of offers. 

&gt;Is it still too soon to worry?

No, I received my offers for grad school in mid to late Feb and for another top US oil school I was told by the person who I reached out to that he'd already sent out offers in Feb. Second round admits are April 16 - May (particularly for schools with slow pipelines like Texas schools) but they're unlikely. A lot of institutions are hosting visiting prospective students right now. I know this for a fact because i've gone to three now. I received notice of a likely reject from one program where the woman liked me enough to tell me it was likely to come based on funding issues in advance- but it was more of a kindness than the expectation. Rejects usually only happen early if there's something egregiously wrong with your application or if the department knows something is likely based on their Jan - Feb meetings. 

&gt;I've been looking into some post-bacs...

You've definitely been passed over for first round admits by all five schools considering it's late march so while you *may* hear back for round 2 admission, you should *definitely* look into other options. 


&gt;I have a 3.5 GPA, two years of undergraduate research, a research internship, and field camp experience.

Not to be catty on the internet, but considering you didn't humble brag about your GRE score, I suspect that's the issue. There's a post on here where someone claims to be a professor at a D1 research school and gives advice on applications being sorted by GPA having cut off of 3.2 and then highest to lowest GRE percentile scores and in my experience talking to faculty that's exactly true. 

&gt;I didn't expect the path to graduate school to be so rocky (ha)

In general, funding is low and tight and the amount of students applying is very high at top schools (mine is a name you'd recognize and they had ~400 applications to the department if I'm correct). There are MANY people who have good qualifications and don't get accepted, it's not just you. Having good stats just isn't enough anymore tbh.  ",1522541074

It's not an exaggeration to say that if they were employed by a company and not volunteer open-source devs many of them would be fired immediately for that massive failure. Instead they were toasting ""champaign"" and saying ""mission accomplished we did it."" So they didn't even learn from their mistake, they celebrated it!

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

We catch knives, firearms, mace, and other weapons/dangerous items all the time. I personally have caught a handgun, a small propane tank, and other potential threats. Even then, the intentions of the individuals with these items are often unclear. But then questions are raised like is it because TSA an effective deterrent?

"toronto","t5_2qi63","I would say internal and external, as I consider things such as schools in areas with a large Black populations typically being pretty bad when compared to others being an internal issue. I think trying to balance out funding between schools in lower and higher income neighbourhoods so as to balance out the financial playing field, increasing the amount of support for students (things such as after school programs, tutoring, etc), bringing things up to date (updating texts and textbooks to more modern editions, replacing or purchasing new equipment and bringing in more youth workers within schools. Those are pretty basic things that can easily improve the education system for not just Black students but pretty much everybody.

Well, I think that anti-black racism is so pervise and impactful due to the actual history of Black people in North America. Black people were initially brought here as property (something other groups were not, and before someone comes in here talking bout the Irish, they were mostly indentured servants,who chose to trade 7 years of labour for passage, food &amp; housing and after their 7 years were given either land or capital, or prisoners) and faced segregation via Jim Crow up until 1964, just 54 years ago. That is like one generation back, so obviously that would have an impact on African Americans and African American culture, let alone everything that came before Jim Crow. On top being subhuman, we are the largest non-White racial group in the US according to the 2010 Census and due to how long Black people have been in North America (first slaves were brought in 1619) and how influential Black culture has been to just general Amerian culture through entertainment and the arts, Black people are pretty much a larger, closer target than other minority groups, you get more ammo to fire off and you get some hollow tips instead of regular rounds. Also dash in the fact that anti-black racism is not isolated to just white people but is also a thing in other racial communities as well, you got pretty much everyone firing shots.",1522541078

Now don't get me wrong, I love the gadgets that the game has available for use, and they tend to at least be believable in the same way that I am believing a highly trained super-espionage agent can do the things that Fisher and friends do... however, looking at the difference in available tech as the games progress through the series is enough to convince me you could continue to tweak the time period and maintain the same feel of doing just what it is that a splinter cell do.  You'd have to rework your agency of command a bit (unless Echelon is actually some sort of Templar shenanigans or something?) but as long as you have some sort of tech at your disposal to give you an advantage it'd still feel like Splinter Cell.  Now personally I'm one of those sadistic fools who likes to set the difficulty as high as it will go and waste hours of my life at a time either playing through as a perfect ghost pacifist or an angry, genocidal spectre that leaves no evidence in their wake, and nothing about that has to be time-specific.  Do that in the cold war, and you got James Bond.  That sure feels like it'd be in the comfort zone of Tom Clancy.  I know the future-fad sorta came and went, but game designers taking artistic freedoms with available tech is no stranger to the series.

So yes, to get back to your initial question, at that distortion it's not going to be a perfect ellipse. In fact it's never a true ellipse, but it's more obvious in this case. In drafting we'd construct these shapes by drawing each quarter arc separately making sure the ends are tangent to the center points of the square's sides, like you're doing.

Sorry I went off on a bit of a tangent with my explanation I just wanted to ensure you knew why the shapes are doing what they're doing instead of just giving you the answer.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Myu3zwfGGwc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5m44s

However, what he *was* referring to was the equality gap in real estate.  The idea that some people of a certain gender do *not* want to go into a job is perfectly reasonable.  For example, as a man I would *never* want to go into daycare or teaching young children.  Why?  Because I've seen far too many dudes be falsely accused of *everything* while they did those jobs.  The level of paranoia and sexism in the USA around that job is staggering.  You couldn't pay me enough to take on that risk.  Another job sector men avoid: make-up.  There are exceptions, but you will find that the bulk of people doing jobs around make-up (even if just selling it retail) are women, and that's not due to women being evil sexists who pushed men out -- that's just... most guys don't know how to do it, don't wear it, don't care to get that job.

If women want to dominate real estate, they can.  If they want to abandon it, they can.  As far as I can tell, the 3rd man interviewed was *not* arguing that women should be paid less, and neither was the OP you replied to.  They are both suggesting that women like different industries than men do, and should be allowed.  If men can have industries they want to avoid, I don't know why women can't also.",1522541082

Just because you’re athletic doesn’t mean you’re great at something. 

Edit: Added record holders in combine events that didn’t translate to jack shit. Also added link to prove that combines don’t matter. 

Vertical jump: Chris Conley 

Broad jump: Byron Jones (set an unofficial world record at combine) 

3 cone drill: Jeff Maehl (Who?!?)

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","&gt;You blame the unhinged right, but the tea party movement (and Ron Paul) marked the beginning of Russian influence.

Like I said, I don't think they were doing something there they wouldn't have done anyway. If Russia has put &gt;1% of the money into US politics than the Koch brothers have I'll be astounded. If they haven't.... there about 1% as responsible for this as two mental billionaires.

&gt;The divide was there, but they managed to get us all riled up even more.

They ? Russia ? 

No. They've been cocking about. They've been exacerabting this stuff. They've been doing that with about 1% as much resources as those two billionaires and 0.05% as much resources as a handful of right wing billionaires. They're not responsible for this.

&gt;And imho the fact that you blame the tea party shows just how much of an influence they had.

No. If russia had never interfered, not spent a dime, not done a thing, the tea party would have unfolded just as it did with all the funders and behind the scenes leaders they had. Because thats who guided this.

Now, if you can show me that the Russians had the Koch's (and other billionaires) in their pocket and those guys aren't really ""nutso right-wing billionaires"" but actually long-term russian moles doing the russians bidding. THEN you'd have a point.

If Russian money/influence was joining nutso right-wing billionaires money/influence and it was restricted to a few tens of millions, they're a bit player. A tiny and ignorable effect. With the Koch's throwing in a billion per cycle alone... and the Russian's buying, what ? $50k of facebook ads ? $1-10m worth of internet trolling ? They're not the cause of this.

They're not even as influential as Rupert Murdoch yet.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","My issue was and still is that many people argue transgender people like me are dangerous. This is a hugely popular narrative used against us. One of the main things seems to be a focus on sex and abuse, that somehow transgender people abuse women or kids in bathrooms and we are dangerous. This is troubling for all of us as trans people.

When someone who is underage comes to a public forum and immediately begins in detail describing their knowledge of some of the most violent pornography out there (i'm familiar with it and fine with it if it's adults BTW and adults talking about it, i'm not a prude) i feel instantly uncomfortable.

I feel as an adult first and foremost i should if anything try to impress upon the person that content a.) isn't suitable for them &amp; b.) is promoting a stereotype of trans people / sexuality that is anything but real or respectful on many fronts. Even though i again am not against it, i will admit that content isn't promoting the good of mankind exactly. It's just something adults do and we all leave it at that. 

I feel it's wrong to do anything other than that. I can't justify talking to your kids about BDSM &amp; violence in sex anywhere. I've been a step-parent twice in my life essentially (Not married) and the last thing i would ever do is disrespect another parent by having any other stance on this than i do.

Maybe i am wrong but i think i did the right thing given WHAT the content is and this person's intro / knowledge of it. They need help with that first and foremost, then trans questions is my view.",1522541087

Our team has been working around the clock to finalize v3.1.0 for a release tonight. We are working full throttle to have the new wallet available for download ASAP. 

We will not be releasing a build that we are not 100% confident with. Hang tight, PIVians!

The meaning of life is whatever you want it to be, I think. You are put on this Earth for a limited time, make of it what you will. For me, I choose to learn about the world and be kind to others. Life is too short to be mean and ignorant.

Human consciousness is a bit more tricky, and I don't know hardly enough neuroscience to even begin to answer it. The human brain is one of the most complex and intricate structures we have ever come across, and I suspect it will be a while before we can completely unlock its mysteries.

Still, I am more fascinated with the mysteries of motion. What makes the universe tick? How do objects behave on a fundamental level? What is the history of the universe, and where are we going?

The freedom of not having to plan/attend multiple meetings and worry about preparing for presentations, etc etc - that freedom has been the most interesting to experience. It’s wonderful. By simply removing the chains of obligations that didn’t nurture my soul, I am astounded at how light and open I feel. 

I think the most empowering thing for me has been not denying the fact that I am a human who has good days and bad days and that it’s just life — and that makes me feel connected to other humans on a more genuine level than when I looked at life/people thru the Gakkai lens — I often felt like in SGI we were encouraged to push past and “fight” our way out of feeling sad or angry like it was a bad thing. Life is just hard sometimes and you go through it.
For as often as the words “fight” and “battle” are used as a means to inspire people, I always thought to myself “Gosh, what an EXHAUSTING way to live.” Is it just me?

I’ve also been reading a lot more than I ever did - I always thought I had to read SGI material to get my study in but opening my eyes to the world of reading (both fiction and self help stuff) has been a game changer in getting to know myself and building my own belief system.

"povertyfinance","t5_hcycg","The biggest way to avoid poverty is to follow these three rules need in actual research: http://www.jacksonville.com/opinion/editorials/2012-01-27/story/three-rules-staying-out-poverty
Graduate high school
Get a full time job
Dont have children before marriage, and don't get married in your teens

I started working in high school, got my first full time job upon college graduation, and had kids in my 20's (planned) while married with a spouse who was also working. Pregnancy was so much easier on my body in my 20's, health risks were less, delivery was less expensive bc our health insurance was better with lower copay/deductible (high deductible plans and childbirth are $$$ - it really hurt us financially with our last child's delivery). We also had the advantage of younger grandparents who were able to pitch in with childcare while we worked bc they were also young enough. We aren't dealing with ""sandwich generation"" stress (our oldest is now in middle school and we're in our late 30's).

Becoming a parent in our 20's was easier than in our 30s even though we have more money now bc we were younger with mood energy We were financially stable when we decided to have kids even though we didn't have $40k in the bank, and we would have missed out on so much by waiting an extra 5 years to have our kids. Our incomes have continued to increase as we've gotten older, and we're able to provide very well for our family now (we could in our 20s also just on a tighter budget)

I honestly think that some people wait too long to have kids because they think they have to be 110% secure financially. No decision in life comes without risk and uncertainty. I'm planning to advise my own children to not delay too long once they've got the basic foundation in place.

There is real grief when someone isn't able to have the number of children they desired due to waiting too long. I'd have to see the ""I need to save up an entire year's salary or I'm financially irresponsible"" be a further barrier to someone who desires to be a parent.

Worrying things like him questioning the taking down of a mural depicting a group of anti-Semitic caricatures playing Monopoly on naked poor people.

Worrying things like the UKIP-like regularity with which Labour councillors, candidates and members have found themselves in the news for various anti-Semitic social media posts over the last couple of years.

Just worrying things like that.

For what it's worth, I don't think Corbyn personally is an anti-Semite. It is clear though that his (usually *very* keen) anti-racist radar is at best blind and at worst consciously uncaring about this particular brand of racism - and he shouldn't get to call himself an anti-racist unless he's against racism in all its forms.

I also think that if Theresa May found herself caught up in some of the types of controversies that Corbyn has (for example: if we learnt she was a member of a secret Islamophobic Facebook group), then Corbyn and his allies would quite rightly be calling her unfit to be prime minister (or even more so than she already is).",1522541092

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","This. I think the most common misunderstanding about karma (not that it can ever be understood, but it could be less misunderstood) is that it's some great cosmic calculator balancing the ""good"" against the ""bad,"" and people are rewarded and punished according to what they (do not) intend / (do not) do. It doesn't work that way. There is no ""good"" or ""bad."" The universe doesn't care what you do or don't do; it doesn't care what happens to you, be it ""good"" or ""bad,"" whether you perceive it as a ""reward"" or a ""punishment."" Your limited perceptions/experiences/interpretations/judgments mean nothing in terms of the karmic flow of the universe. Karma is simply cause &amp; effect. Nothing more and nothing less. Your actions have certain motivations, and they create certain consequences. You can never precisely or accurately predict what those motivations may have been or what consequences there will be. 

It's like the law of physics that says for every action there will be an equal and opposite reaction: for every cause there will be effects. You wouldn't argue against or try to manipulate the laws of physics, you would just be careful not to punch a brick wall really hard because you know that if you do it'll hurt. The same goes for karma. Don't go punching karmic brick walls, but acknowledge that sometimes out of ignorance people do (and sometimes you may too), and you'll be more or less fine.",1522541094

I forgot to mention why Dickey was controversial. The people in charge of it had leaks and statements showing that they clearly didn't like guns and wanted to make them ""the new tobacco"" (&lt;- paraphrased) but stupidly close for an organization that is, ostensibly, a scientific organization and not an advocacy group.

We actively _discourage_ critical discourse like this because these are serious, complex issues and not something to joke and meme about.

"FeMRADebates","t5_2y44v","&gt; There's one sense of non-objectivity where a claim is completely dependent on the subject, to the point that mutually incompatible claims can be true for different subjects (ie: ""cottage cheese is horrifying"").

Agreed. But I don't think it is broadly true of truth. That is just a personal or subjective truth. 

&gt;We just recognize that we always understand reality through particular concepts and particular mental schemas to which there are other alternatives. 

Well I don't just think it's that. I think by saying there is no objective viewpoint, even in theory, you have conceded that all viewpoints are equally true. Because without an objective viewpoint with which to compare the subjective, you cannot be sure which is more anchored in reality. 

&gt;That opens a domain of inquiry on truth that isn't about whether or not our claims are true, whether or not they accurately describe reality, but instead is about the particular ways that our claims divide up, conceptualize, and engage with reality

Star Marine could have and should have been handled better but like CR said in the video you linked - Star Marine was only meant to be a module until they could have FPS mechanics ingame by the time 2.0 came out they had them ingame which to their mind defeated the purpose of a prioritized custom module for FPS mechanics.

Don't get me wrong - CIG absolutely handled it wrong - but they didn't throw anyone under the bus and even tried to explain the situation without attributing blame (Measurements being wrong and no one catching it from either side)

CIG have been improving and I think we're all going to have to accept for CIG their method of game development is soundly in the (Trail and Error) camp - make it, test it, break it, fix it - nearly every patch - some people hate that method, some thrive on it and others just become apathetic towards it.

&gt;So shall we make of them then when only one is fully knowable and the other fails, time and again, to meet expectations?

Give and take is important though - they've failed to meet dates and to hit expectations on key features - but they've also shown active development on future content and exceeded expectations on features thought not essential.",1522541099

You can smell them out because all you see on their post history is endless pages of copy and paste pro trump, pro nationalism short quips designed to normalize their crap and divide people up. They have no human identities and no posts of actual interests outside of their ""lol R U TRIGGERED liberal?"" posts. Political bots come in two forms: cyborg and botnets. Cyborg accounts have more of a human presence, occasionally posting original content. That ranges from acerbic messages about the state of a nation or rude insults to liberal competitors to hyperbolic statistics and links to fake news articles. Bots can be a single account or small group of accounts that can suddenly become hyperactive and tweet 1,000 times a day. Botnets tend to be larger groups of accounts, typically in the hundreds and thousands, that tweet identical or near identical messages at the same time. Those messages flood hashtags to cause them to trend, which baits reactions from the public. Botnets can also amplify messages from cyborg accounts through re-tweets, follows, and other interactions. It's likely this account is the former rather than the latter. https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/russia-troll-farm-r-the_donald/ http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43255285",1522541103

Look at it like this: instead of having 3 options (or whatever) to choose from to perform your entire task, you'll have 1000+ smaller options to choose from, you can choose as many as you like, they can each do portions of your task, and the process of choosing, delegating and distributing your task is automated based on price (and other factors, like reliability).

The thing is, since big data processing has competitors, if the price of a task on golem is more than aws or something, more people may choose the competitor, leading to less demand for golem, leading to a price decrease. Essentially, golem collateralizes processing power and the cost of that power is reflected in the price of the golem token (and the price in golem tokens to perform a task on the network). Centralized competitors cannot efficiently price processing power real time in this manner, so most likely golem will be cheaper.",1522541104

"Unity2D","t5_2yfb2","Sounds good! I gave monochromania a try! (controller, and keyboard, but only really played with controller)

Seems like a solid start! Here's my thoughts after playing through the levels:

\- I appreciate the auto-walljump when I hold the jump button. That feels good to me.

\- Is the point of the game to jump on your opponent? The ""**BE THE ONLY COLOUR**"" line seems like a fairly major directive, which makes me think I should be ""capturing"" as much ground as possible. But for all the beginner levels , a much more important goal is to catch the other guy. Pushing him off is unlikely, and somehow getting 100% while he's in the air is way more difficult.

\- I'm having trouble understanding the dash. It feels unresponsive when I try to dash there and back, and then hyper-responsive when I double dash forwards, and then it feels like a dead button when I try to dash upwards (even when I'm on the ground).

\- I feel like I can't control myself in the air that well, and I spend a *decent* amount of time in the air in this game. It's really easy to overjump.

Also, easy on the vibrating text. It's really hard to look at lol.",1522541106

I don't plan to quit Hearthstone -- but a few weeks ago I discovered Faeria and its an absolute blast to play. It's a crime this game isn't as popular as it should be 

So the main thing you should know is definitely the announcement they made yesterday. They plan to become B2P and they announced they're cutting mobile support (including an iOS iPad version already in existence). Given the news I'm a little worried about the financial future of the game. 

For now I'd sit tight and continue to grind out gold. Keep it F2P for yourself until they announce otherwise. Buying adventures is the best way to build a collection. Also Pandora is a lot of fun -- they give you a practice coin every day, if you get 3 wins you get 1/3 of a real Pandora coin... which can be used for prizes. It's a million times better of a draft format that Arena. 

Hope this helps! I'm as disappointed as anyone about the announcements yesterday. I really thought this was my escape from Hearthstone. ",1522541107

Actually the areas where they've experimented with UBI found that many people continued to work and simply had enough to live reasonably when given UBI. Remember, minimum wage has become effectively less every year since the 70's when adjusted for inflation. 50% of America makes 30k or less a year - that's really pathetic for the richest country in the world; and ever.

That's not true. Your comment supposes that we actually function as a democracy which we don't - the marijuana debacle proves this beautifully. Despite the vast majority of people supporting legalization for years, there is still no legalization at the federal level in sight. Most people also support medicare for all and that isn't close to happening and most people also support increasing minimum wage and that isn't happening. What you mean is enough oligarchs and power tyrants disagree with me that the ""political support isn't there"".

I'm quite sympathetic to the genetic side of the Murray et al. arguments but that's correct, in fact they explicitly mention so in the Bell Curve in their conclusions. They're basically right-libertarians who believe in a ""meritocratic, strongly hierarchical society"".

I also dig your reference to the Jewish thing. In fact, if this kind of research starts becoming more mainstream we'll possibly also be seeing Kevin Macdonald et al. type of arguments become more popular. Some people, like Sam, might enjoy going down that rabbit hole cos ""truth and intellectual consistency"" like we've seen but quite a few other ""interesting"" arguments like that will start popping up along the way.

It's the same reason why every time the Jews are brought up in e.g. Peterson's subreddit you have various people who don't exactly like them, to put it mildly, get upvoted - when you keep harping about certain general issues, even if you end up telling your readers to basically drop a subject because ""we know the answer"" (like Peterson did), well they won't.",1522541111

"BPD","t5_2qqdp","I did this but only because I felt like the few people I was still ""friends"" with were really toxic to me and didn't treat me with the same courtesy and respect I tried my damndest to show them. Honestly this was years before I was formally diagnosed and I still haven't had many close friends since. 

But it's ended up being for the best because it's forced me to really look at myself and think about what I want and deserve and not allow anything less. I'm making some connections now, slowly, and being careful to nurture and actually treat people right instead of manipulating my relationships. 

I felt like I was universally hated and my actions reflected that. Now even though I know there are people who don't like me, I can accept that, and move on and reach out to those who I can still build and grow with. The ones who accept and love me even on my bad days and make an effort to understand me. 

It depends on your situation. Would you be cutting them off for attention or because they're bad people and treat you badly? If former, reach out instead let them know you miss them, or whatever you're feeling. If latter, think about what's best for yourself and take some time to think about it. You'll know you made the right decision if once you cut them off you feel lighter and happier and can't remember why lol ",1522541113

I didn't become a history teacher, bc I naively believed her.  But then again, there was a fellow female student that wanted to be a history teacher: our main difference being our political stances.  The professor just happened to share the other student's views.  So I'll always wonder if the professor was just being dumb, or if she didn't like my views and wanted me out of the way.  Did she encourage the other student, or discourage her in the same way?  We'll never know.

&gt; Ok, all done. Here is what you'll want to do:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Relieve fuel system pressure
&gt; a) Open gas cap
&gt; b) Pull the ASD (Automatic Shut Down) relay, this shuts off fuel
&gt; c) Try starting the truck, it should immediately stall or not start at all. Mine did not start
&gt; d) Disconnect the negative terminal on the battery. 
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Remove the old sensor/line. The connectors are easy to figure out if you have the new part to look at. I disconnected the one from the fuel rail first (red one), then the one that connects to the line off the fuel tank (blue one). Note that these are different types of connectors, the red one has a sort of gate that wraps around the line to cover it all the way around.
&gt; 
&gt; The wiring harness was the most difficult to get off. There is a shroud that covers the latch that clips to the sensor, I had to get a narrow flat blade screwdriver under there to pop off the latch. 
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Once that was done I connected the blue end, red end, then the wiring harness. The part will now be on, you just need to reinstall the ASD relay and connect the battery in that order.
&gt; 
&gt; My clock lost the time, but the CEL did reset itself. The job was overall easier than I thought it would be. The hardest part was getting in position to reach the line which is back by the firewall. I had to get a blanket and drape it over the fender like I did when changing spark plugs, then leaned on the intake manifold with my elbow.

You can find the part for $50 - $90.

I would contact the dealer anyway and make sure there's no recall on this part. This issue seems to be pretty common.",1522541116

What part are you debating here? That the tethers are 400 km? Because he does say that in the video, look at 9:29 he specifically states that the ring is 80 km up, much less than I said, and that there are modern materials which have a breaking length much greater than that.

The inner ring can be a cable, a stream of pellets or a steam of plasma, it just needs to spin in a circle and be contained by magnets. As for drag, the spinning part can be a cable, that doesn't have much surface area for air to drag on. And if that is still too much you can wrap the ring in a vacuum tube, the air pressure is so low at 80 km up that a thin wall of aluminum would be strong enough. 

That is just a silly insult, take issue with the designer of the system then.

Prove it. Just saying ""its not"" isn't an argument.

"GenderCritical","t5_2yk5v","I'm going to give the same response to you as I did to tossinglobster. You're all going to have to come to grips with scenarios like mine or you're never have a chance of wiping out sex slavery. DID is real, you can argue over how to treat it, how to conceptualize it clinically and socially, etc., but until you acknowledge it is real you won't a chance at ending slavery. 

I survived 40 years of torture and slavery at the hands of a powerful, family connected trafficking network. I am lucky to be alive and sain. I am not stupid or lacking in insight or agency. I did not invent my symptoms. I have woken up with foreign objects in and on my body. Former roommates, partners and caregivers have picked up the phone and heard the threatening messages intended for me. Friends have witnessed death threats made in public. There are witnesses to what I've experienced, the amnesia, the behavioral changes, the harassment, and there is material evidence. I did not invent the threats, the abductions, the torture, nor did any doctor suggest them to me.

The people who did this to me relied on my ability to dissociate, from the very beginning, from when I was 4 years old. They're not stupid, they know how dissociation works, and they count on it. They used torture to reinforce my amnesia, the amnesia barriers between my waking normative self and the split off aspects of me that handle the trauma. In fact, the perps not only relied on it, they made sure I wouldn't try to heal, and they are still threatening me today. The formation of DID is a perpetrator dream come true. If you cannot remember, you cannot tell.

This is how sex slavery works within the most powerful trafficking networks. It's worked this way for 70 years. There are thousands of survivors. I personally know hundreds, women who've been traded among elite men. 

We need feminists and advocates to recognize this is happening. It is so, so long overdue. We need safe houses, we need treatment. What got me through the worst was believing that one day I'd make it out and be able to tell. I never thought that people wouldn't care, or they'd just outright deny what happened. I never thought I'd spend the rest of my life arguing against the propaganda created by my perpetrators, and trying to convince people to care.",1522541117

Ideally, you wouldn't care about the answer to your question about whether he was real, because you'd not be invested at all in whether it works out with this particular guy or not. You need to contact way more people, to the point where you're having trouble remembering who any particular guy is or what you guys texted about, and then they only get on your radar **after** a video chat, phone call, or in-person date.

If you did it right, at this very early point, you wouldn't even concern yourself with whether he was real or not. If he just disappeared, you should be in a mindset where you wouldn't even notice. This guy should not be taking up any of your mental real estate at all.",1522541118

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Comepare to Fiora ulti (i think it's a pretty good comparison. They both take time to get the entire benefit from your ulti and they both have in built heals)

So if you get 4 procs at lvl 6 you do minimum 10% max HP true damage. So usually around 100+dmg, but you also get healed 55hp per proc and 30% bonus movespeed per proc, followed by a 5 second heal of 80+hp per second.

Fiora ultimate give damage, and bulk utility in a 1v1 with the movespeed and the massive heal. It also has room for counterplay you can try and position so she cant get sll the procs off, shove your arse against a wall so she cant get them or dissengage. So it's strong and offers both players options.

Irelias ulti does 320 dmg minimum if you hit all 4 blades, and heals for 80hp.

Irelias pre-RW ulti is completely un-interactive to play against and if your just throwing it down in a 1v1, offers no options for how you use it or play against it.

I actually like the GT because I can charge up my shot, swim through the ink and pop out with a full charge, but agree that the GT is probably the weakest overall of the snipers. 

The way I rank most weapons is how efficiently they ink and mobility. I like this set of weapons because they are all usable. I hate being gimped by a heavy weapon like splattlings, weapons with poor range (cant reach steelheads or reach further enemies) or ones that cant lay ink around your feet.

"oddlysatisfying","t5_2x93b","I was a CD for 11 years @ a Fortune company, so know that I understand where you are, better than many, many others. And your sentiment is similar to those I have heard echoed by many a brilliant, creative mind. It's also correct, in terms of a borrowed layout being pedestrian and unworthy of accolades.  

What I would ask is for you to recall that most people don't move and experience the whole aesthetic of the world in the way that we do. They don't engage with functions of form, space, and tone as we do. Yes, seeing something worn and decrepit held up and lauded as something unique and special is irritating to our sensibilities and taste, especially when you know those (or are one of) special designers whose skill is often unappreciated. 

In short, while you're right from our perspective, remember that not everyone sees as we see.

"Fallout","t5_2qnzu","I was a bit surprised to see that Spotify had obtained the rights to various library music albums.

In Fallout, there's an enormous number of stock/library/production music tracks licensed from APM Music that were never meant for public sale. These include ""I'm Tickled Pink"", ""Jazzy Interlude"", ""Let's Go Sunning"", ""In the Shadow of the Valley"", ""Lone Star"", ""Goin' Under"" and all of the instrumental tracks on the radio and the Mysterious broadcast.

For all the other vintage songs, they are listed in the end credits with the song and artist information. For these in Fallout 3, they simply read ""Courtesy Of APM Music Inc."" New Vegas actually omits these songs entirely from the end credits. All of the ""missing"" songs that were not reprised in Fallout 4 from 3 were from APM Music.

The problem with stock music is that they were never meant to be sold to the public. As a result, it's difficult to find artist and recording information since they were only meant for the film and TV industry. However, since the artists aren't restricted with trying to get their songs on the radio, there's a surprising amount of creative freedom. 

Film directors like to use these soundalikes for an instant vintage sound without having to pay expensive licensing fees. Artists tend to forgo royalties in favor for one lump payment. Bethesda seems to be using these songs to pad out the soundtrack.

If you want to do it without a guide the most important things are that you don't ignore your defenses and go only for damage. You should  get life on the passive tree and always cap your resistances (fire, lightning, cold) at 75%.

**2)** The leagues are 3 months long and contain a new mechanic which might or might not get added to the core game later (in reduced frequency in which you encounter it). After the league is over your characters get merged into standard. For me personally i only play the leagues as i quite like the fresh start and would get bored always playing the same character.

Take cavalry charges in Med2. They were unreliable and sometimes failed to work consistently. BUT, and it is important to note: cavalry took time to rev up and lower its lances. You needed a clear, open path for this. And after a while they'd switch for their secondary weapons. Current games don't have this, charges are more streamlined. 
 
Same with pathing. It worked mostly fine except for sieges. And sieges in Med2 could have multiple walls. Not to say, maps were dynamic depending on city size and buildings present; nowadays it is a finite number of pre-made maps.  I'd argue you that even current games have wonky pathing in sieges: stuck ladders, wall movement is still crappy, and AI still over-commits on obvious choke points. ",1522541123

I don’t know how much danish news is covered in Sweden, but last year there were a lot of shootings in Copenhagen but this was mostly gang/drug related and almost always gangs against gangs.

"MIEFoundation","t5_hfhgo","&gt; then what happened at the end of act 1?

Reaction of narrative plot device. MC is a ""humanoid avatar"" of the game but he is **not** an independent character. Notice how MC stops reacting to things the more game worsens in terms of integrity, and how it's all back to normal reactions once Act 4 is set back. I do not believe he is an actual character, I think he is more like representation of the game. That dialogue also contains clear narrative guides to player to try to load game since MC says ""this isn't some game where you can load file"". From here we have two options:

1. MC is as omnipotent as Monika... and does absolutely nothing to stop her.

2. MC is merely an avatar of the game and represents game's reaction to turn of events. This may sound weird and a bit irrational but it actually makes more sense when you take the bigger picture into account and how behavior of MC correlates with state of the game.",1522541124
"PlantedTank","t5_2szbf","Find out if your gas shop swaps tanks or will do fill-ups. It would be a shame to drop $70 on a nice aluminum cylinder that you can't do anything with, or lose forever.

The most important purchase is your regulator. Regardless if it's chrome, brass, etc. it should be a dual stage, two-gauge regulator to prevent end-of-tank dump that will kill your fish.

Sea Freak, GLF, Tunze are all reputable brands. Expect to pay $100-150. You get what you pay for, and the cheap $50 chinesium regulators on Amazon would be fine for 3-6 months (I would inspect these daily for leaks/solenoid/gauge failure).

Other than that, make sure you get air tubing that is co2 corrosion resistant, a diffuser, drop checker, secondary check valve (to prevent syphoning) and a bubble counter (If one isn't attached to your regulator) that you think is aesthetically pleasing, and you will have a safe and easy co2 system.",1522541124

Here's the thing about web development. It's about content. Without content you can't properly design a site and without good design you can't properly display that content. 

My suggestion would be to find some website that are ugly and don't function  (plenty of them out there) and redesign them.

The key is that a website needs to a) function and b) be attractive enough that people want to go deeper. The good web designers are really good at highlighting and placing content.

Don't be discouraged it takes time and many attempts before you can really nail web design. I can tell that you have the basic design stuff down. Now let's see it with content. Does it achieve the goal of the content?

Best of luck! Keep posting! It will only make you better. Don't be dismayed by critical critiques use them to become better!

"PUBATTLEGROUNDS","t5_3fmbm","I'm afraid I'm not very good at writing ELI5 stuff (I prefer the personal approach) but here's a first attempt:

To have objects collide with each other in a game you need some kind of system that checks whenever collisions occur and what to do about it (for example the player not falling through the ground).

In 3D games this is usually done by a rigid body physics engine which is a library that knows how to do these things for 3D shapes. 

These shapes can technically be exactly the same as the visible 3D models themselves but since it's very computational expensive and thus slow to make these checks for complex shapes (and very accurate results aren't required or even desired anyway) developers usually will use rough approximations for this job.

Instead of a rock you might just take a sphere, instead of an awesome looking crate you might take a cube... and instead of a 1,80m tall person you might use a 1,80m tall cylinder with half a meter of diameter or so. Collisions are very easy to calculate for these and for the player it doesn't really matter if their shoulder actually touches the wall when looking at it at a particular angle. In practice something shaped like a pill (basically a cylinder with half a sphere stuck to the top and the bottom) works even better since you can drag it along the floor and the spherical parts will smoothly glide over bumps while the hard edges of a cylinder might get stuck.

This can work really well but if the collision shapes of the environment aren't optimized to interface with this shape you end up with a lot of awkward movement when on rough ground because you tend to slide off of bumps etc. You also still might get stuck on small ledges that any human would step over without thinking about it.",1522541126

A Poor excuse to damage control a bad game or problems within a game that need to be fixed. But a refusal to acknowledge it to justify said purchase. Overall the game isn’t reviewing that well form both users and critics. Very mediocre, mostly in the 60s/100 and other scores equivalent to that scale. So that’s saying something. The reviews most certainly don’t match up the the hype it received prior to launch.

Oh it’s a game for me. As I’ve said the times before. The concept and theme for the game is amazing. Execution is poor. The difference I want them to do better. What does that say about the gamer that’s completely ok for settling for a lesser quality product for the money they’ve given.

If Richardson meant that he ""permitted"" chess with karahah, then this is correct.

As a rule, I wouldn't recommend relying too heavily on non-Shafi'i scholars and books for information on Shafi'i positions (and likewise for the other madhahib.)

I was thinking maybe Delta 400? Open to recommendations! I do also realise that it could be my developer, I'm currently using ID-11 but thought maybe DD-X?

The highest combined healer DPS parse only uses it 8 times in what could be a 10-cast fight

https://www.fflogs.com/reports/3k6zQLnvqRPra9AX#fight=4&amp;type=casts&amp;source=2&amp;ability=3571

Holding it for times where it'll:

A) save a GCD heal

B) hit more than 1 target

Is an important part of Assize usage",1522541131

HOESS: Yes.

COL. AMEN: I ask that the witness be shown Document 3868-PS, which will become Exhibit USA-819.

[The document was submitted to the witness.]

COL. AMEN: You signed that affidavit voluntarily, Witness?

HOESS: Yes.

COL. AMEN: And the affidavit is true in all respects?

HOESS: Yes.

COL. AMEN: This, if the Tribunal please, we have in four languages.

[Turning to the witness.] Some of the matters covered in this affidavit you have already told us about in part, so I will omit some parts of the affidavit. If you will follow along with me as I read, please. Do you have a copy of the affidavit before you?

HOESS: Yes.

COL. AMEN: I will omit the first paragraph and start with Paragraph 2:

""I have been constantly associated with the administration of concentration camps since 1934, serving at Dachau until 1938; then as Adjutant in Sachsenhausen from 1938 to 1 May 1940, when I was appointed Commandant of Auschwitz.. I commanded Auschwitz until 1 December 1943, and estimate that at least 2,500,000 victims were executed and exterminated there by gassing and burning, and at least another half million succumbed to starvation and disease making a total dead of about 3,000,000. This?figure represents about 70 or 80 percent of all persons sent to Auschwitz as prisoners, the remainder having been selected and used for slave labor in the concentration camp industries; included among the executed and burned were approximately 20,000 Russian prisoners of war (previously screened out of prisoner-of-war cages by the Gestapo) who were delivered at Auschwitz in Wehrmacht transports operated by regular Wehrmacht officers and men. The remainder of the total number of victims included about 100,000 German Jews, and great numbers of citizens, mostly Jewish, from Holland, France, Belgium, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Greece, or other countries. We executed about 400,000 Hungarian Jews alone at Auschwitz in the summer of 1944.""

That is all true, Witness?

HOESS: Yes, it is.

If there's a 30 minute wait always say at least 30 minutes for takeout because if the kitchen is slammed most places put takeout on the lowest priority. ",1522541140

"books","t5_2qh4i","The beginning of Toni Morrison's Bluest Eye:

""Quiet as it's kept, there were no marigolds in the fall 1941. We thought, at the time, that it was because Pecola was having her father's baby that the marigolds did not grow. A little examination and much less melancholy would have proved to us that our seeds were not the only ones that did not sprout; nobody's did. Not even the gardens fronting the lake showed marigolds that year. But so deeply concerned were we with the health and safe delivery of Pecola's baby we could think of nothing but our own magic: if we planted the seeds, and said the right words over them, they would blossom, and everything would be all right.

It was a long time before my sister and I admitted to ourselves that no green was going to spring from our seeds. Once we knew, our guilt was relieved only by fights and mutual accusations about who was to blame. For years I thought my sister was right: it was my fault. I had planted them too far down in the earth. It never occurred to either of us that the earth itself might have been unyielding. We had dropped our seeds in our own little plot of black dirt just as Pecola's father had dropped his seeds in his own plot of black dirt. Our innocence and faith were no more productive than his lust or despair. What is clear now is that of all of that hope, fear, lust, love, and grief, nothing remains but Pecola and the unyielding earth. Cholly Breedlove is dead; our innocence too. The seeds shriveled and died; her baby too.

There is really nothing more to say--except why. But since why is difficult to handle, one must take refuge in how.""",1522541140

Age: 23

Timezone: EST

Summary of Tabletop Experience: 2.5 years of 5e 95% of which has been on Roll20 and a weekly campaign in Pathfinder that lasted about 6 months

About me: I’m pretty laid back and like to have fun with my fellow players. I enjoy games of all sorts, watching shows and what not, and reading. If for some reason we get an unexperienced player I’m happy to help them learn the game.

Character Concept: Wood Elf Monk named Fu. He is about 650 years old but it’s been so long that he doesn’t really know exactly how old he is. He worships the peaceful and loving god Bahammus. Fu quotes from the holy text, the Book of Hesitations. Bahammus’s main tenant is to not take any humanoid life and only a creature’s if it’s for food. 
Brief backstory: Fu was born as Sigil Gladmagol (adult name Maethor) and he was meant to be a fighter for his people. He trained every second he could to be the best (kind of like Bakugou if you watch My Hero Academia). At the cusp of adulthood, there was a tournament to test the skills of their young fighters. Fu lost disgracefully and was shunned/stormed out of the village vowing to return and be the greatest warrior they’ve ever had. Fu spent the next century trying to find places to teach him different ways to fight but was eventually kicked out of all of them for his anger and injuring the other students in sparing. At some point he finds the Temple of Bahammus. There he eventually finds inner peace and forsakes his given name and takes his new name Fu which means tiger. Fu, wanting to die a warriors death, volunteered to go out and spread the word of Bahammus and to aid those in need.

What you look for in a game: Interesting campaign, some combat, some RP, and a lot of fun with good people. Also for the other players to be committed to the campaign.

Additional Comments/Questions: I’m happy to provide any more information you need. Thank you for your time and hope to hear from you soon.

Ended up getting 3.6 miles in 28 mins. Not too shabby for a 195lb dude who literally never runs. Well it's about an hour after my run now and I can barely walk because my calves and Achilles are shot. 

On the bright side, I caught more than a handful of ladies mirin' me while I was running shirtless, some of them were even holding their bf/husband's hands. Felt pretty good. 

Also, runner's high is a real thing. There was a point 3/4 of the way through where I had Rooster by Alice In Chains blaring and I felt so happy despite the pain. Not worth the pain of doing it again though. Cardio is bad. ",1522541141

Europe and North America are ***not*** Muslim regions, they are Christian regions, despite that religion being practiced less now. It should not be assumed that people from Muslim societies that have not evolved functional individual-rights-predicated polities will hold values in keeping with traditionally Christian Western polities. And it is inevitable that many who emigrate to Western societies will attempt politically to bring those societies more in line with Muslim values. This cannot be allowed to happen. We have spent a lot of time and effort minimizing the role that religion plays politically in Western societies, with greater or lesser success depending on the country. It is utterly unacceptable that this be reversed, especially by an ideology that is fundamentally unlike the one that is the foundation of Western societies, and a sickening tendency of modern Western societies to be.... how to put this....

"JUSTNOMIL","t5_377ps","First, YOUR actions did not lead to a death. You bear NO responsibility for the harm done. In all your descriptions of your actions, you acted to prevent or reduce harm. All harm caused was directly a result of Vacation Bitch and her choices, in spite of all attempts of the people around to try to prevent or reduce harm.

And feeling sad, or feeling regretful is a very normal and human response. The whole mess is really a horrible tragedy, made worse because it was so senseless and so pointless. And it's right and normal to feel a weird mess of conflicting emotions. But guilt should not ever be one of them for you. You did what you could, and your involvement  may very well have  helped expose the insanity before VB killed someone. But make no mistake, the way she was going, she very well would have killed someone else if things had gone differently.


I suspect when Diabitch dies, it will be worse for you. At least for a while. Because you will have a personal connection and a much more complicated relationship to deal with. My dad was a JustNo, and a pretty bad one. I'm not going to go into details here, but  I will say he tried to kill my siblings and I  to 'punish' my mom, and admitted this, to my face. Still, when he died, I felt  an awful, complicated, conflicting mess of emotions. Because horrible  a person as he was, I still grieved, and felt relieved, and felt guilty, and a whole mess of other things, all at the same time.

I’m glad you’re in therapy, getting to that stage is really hard but it’s one of the best things anyone can do for themselves. I was in therapy for a couple of years, one of which I was going about once a week. If it feels like it’s not helping, maybe you need a different therapist? I remember that for awhile it felt like it was hurting more than it was helping, it did take quite some time before I felt okay. 

You said this to someone: “You're a good person, you don't deserve any sadness. I'm sorry you think it's you, but it's not. You are fucking amazing, please believe that! q_q”
And I want you to know that it applies to you too. You also said once that hearing about loss on the news, no matter who it was, makes the world feel a bit colder. **You matter.** Even if it’s just to strangers on the internet, your presence makes a difference and I’m glad you’re here. I hope my lurking wasn’t too creepy, I just wanted to get a sense of who you are. I hope stuff gets better for you, I’m 26 too and just barely getting my life in order.

For one it's a lot more interactive as you can from time to time communicate with the streamer either via donations or their chat or even when they're not streaming via discord/twitter. The second is that they build up these communities to make you feel as though you're apart of their lives almost and have a feeling of family typically especially with those with heavy discord use and such.

I feel this so much. I rely so much on my fiance and his mother, and my fiance has issues of his own (dermatomyositis and chronic fatigue, and his mother is almost 70). It makes me feel so helpless. At least I come from decent money and when my mother/sister passed I inherited quite a sizable amount, so I own the house we all live in and have investments making some more money, and I can at least provide for them financially. But its so demoralizing.

Thank you so much for sharing. I am so sorry you have to suffer but appreciate the insight. I see so many posts of people with fibromyalgia who say ""chronic pain sucks but you have to do what you have to do"" and it just makes me feel so worthless.

""Do you not believe there is a why? Do you not believe there is some purpose as to why we are here? Or do you just believe that we are here to exist and die? ""

no purpose that im aware of.

""but for me personally, I believe there is a purpose for why we are here, and I will try my best to live up to that purpose that God has laid before me""

Arcanas：Indomitable，Guerrilla（yes，better than assassinate）and Skewer.

Attack speed is more important than physical damage，for attack speed can trigger WW strong passive ability，also WW skills‘ damage do not rely on AD very much.Armor pierce is not necessary，when facing brittle heroes，arcanas are enough，when facing tanky heroes，passive has true damage，also Fafnir Talon hurts tanky heroes badly.",1522541151

"bleach","t5_2rk7q","&gt; It's still the same goal of protecting people.

Except in the soul society arc it's specifically to save Rukia. Which is about the same specificity as finding all the Dragon Balls.

&gt; He cares for them because he wants to become the pirate king. I think you don't see the difference. Luffy started his journey because he wanted to become the pirate king, not because he wanted to protect the people and that has never changed. Everything he does is to become the pirate king. I'm not saying he doesn't care for his nakama, he wants to become the pirate king with the help of his nakama, he couldn't do it alone, but the main reason he is fighting against everyone is because of his selfish goal.

If the title of Pirate King didn't exist, Luffy would probably still have ended up going adventuring with friends who he would still care for and protect. His care for his friends is not because of the title of pirate king. I honestly find it hard to believe how you can think this. And I never said he wanted to protect the people. I said he wants to protect his friends. It's not his main goal, but it's something he always does and would do regardless of whether or not the title of pirate king existed.

&gt; is goal was protect people from Hollows initially, but he fights anyone that can be a threat to his world because he is motivated by Isshin and Rukia's words to him during Everything but The Rain chapters. 

That's protecting his friends just in more words.

&gt; Also, his subtle goal was to understand and accept himself as a way to obtain more power.

A vague and meaningless goal which adds nothing to his character because it wasn't handled well in the story.

&gt; He is one of the best protagonist. The word you are looking for is realistic.

First of all, realistic protagonist != good protagonist. You can have a realistic, bland boring character. Second of all, I don't see what about him is so realistic compared to other shounen protagonists. If you want an example of a relatable shounen protagonist, I would point you to Midoriya from My hero academia.

&gt; Kubo developed him a lot.

He really didn't change much from start of series to end. His character development is nothing special. I would say Naruto is a far more developed character than him.",1522541151

If I want a Tesla sedan? Model S. Tesla coupe? Model S. Tesla sports car? Model S. Tesla convertible? Model S. Tesla city car? Model S. Tesla wagon? Model S. 4x4? Model X. Minivan? Model X.

Everything is funneled into the one or two cars because you literally don't have any other option. If Tesla started offering more cars/body styles, sales of the S will tank as the people distribute out the Tesla cars they actually wanted to buy.

Tesla will enjoy beefier numbers on their very limited selection of cars since all the other manufacturers are spreading their sales out around several models.",1522541154

It is very shoneny and pretty simplistic, if I'd watched now, I wouldn't have gotten past the Heavens Arena arc.

He did it again, so I pushed his feet again. He did it again, so I turned around to tell him to knock the shit off and he just laughed. His dad was next to him, but was also with the more kids, so I dont think he was paying attention.

The kid then started rocking my chair back and forth so I turned around, ripped a sandle off his foot and threw it over the railing. He kicked my chair really hard and then went to get the sandle. His dad was pissed at what I did, so I explained what was happening and he just said ""I'm so sorry!"". The kid came back and all I heard was a fucking ""THWAP"" immediately followed by ""OOOWWWW"". Some unintelligible stern whispering was happening and then radio silence.... that kid was a saint for the rest of the movie and as we were walking out, he came up to me, shook my hand, and apologized.

&gt; As for the latest fight, I knew Wolverine didn't have his healing, but I didn't know that affected his skill level. Scans?

He [refers it here](https://i.imgur.com/9z9wjTM.jpg).

"wow","t5_2qio8","Probably a healer, most often a Discipline priest. 

Tanking is important, but perfectly doing your job as a tank is expected of you (because the tank mechanics are often dull and trivial) and no matter how good of a tank you are, you're never going to push your raid to be better at dodging, DPS-ing, healing and doing their own mechanics. Maybe you can move the boss a little to the side or a bit closer to where idiots can get in range to him without dying, but you can't do much more than that really. If you don't do your job, everyone's screwed but if you do your job right, the only thing you'll be thanked for is the extra DPS that you can dish on the side.

Damage dealing is also important, especially when you can pair it with the ability to perform difficult tasks during certain mechanics. Being a good damage dealer also speeds up the fight a lot, but you're still one damage dealer in a sea of damage dealers and you impact is inversely proportional to the number of people in your raid, so that's important to keep in mind. 

Having a good healer - specifically a good Discipline Priest - means that:

* retards can stand more in fire and do more DPS
* tanks can survive if they fail to tank swap on time and your raid won't die
* you're doing extra DPS which can actually be of tremendous help if you have to deal with small adds
* if your HPS is good enough, you can have some of the other healers go into their OS and deal extra DPS
* disc specific tools (like bubble and pre-shielding) can cheese certain mechanics sometimes 
* your significance is not impacted by the number of players in the raid ",1522541159

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","&gt;I have been with this guy for 3 months now. He is very good to me in the sense that he will do laundry and cook food for me. However, despite all these gestures of love, I do not feel loved by him because I'm more of an affirmations &amp; quality time person.
 
3 months is pretty short time to feel love and feel loved. It takes time to develop. He sounds caring. You sound like you need him to do specific things to feel loved. Did you tell him this? How important is it to you that you get this specific kind of validation? We don't know enough information to know if your need for affirmation is within just normal range, or if you actually depend on it, to feel good about yourself. 

&gt;The fact that he doesn't compliment me bothers me. The reason is because my previous boyfriends were constantly complimenting me saying I'm pretty or cute yet he does not say anything AT ALL. It makes me really insecure of myself as I'm afraid that he doesn't find me pretty or physically attractive.

Again it sounds like you got used to a specific kind of validation and are not happy because he is not giving you what you are used to. It could be that you are insecure about your looks, and senses that you need his validation to feel ok about yourself. Affirmations/compliments should come out of a genuine feeling of the person who is giving them. It could be that once he senses that you need that validation to feel good about yourself, he starts to feel like whatever he is expressing is a chore, because he is doing it to please you/ make you feel better about yourself, rather than expressing a genuine feeling in the moment.  Does it act as if he is attracted to you in other ways? Are you guys physically active? It's a bit like with alcohol if you run a shop. You might want to give your friend a bottle of nice booze for their birthday, and it will be a genuine gift. But you might later realise they actually need booze to feel ok about themselves  - because you are their friend, they will now start coming around and expecting you to give them booze for free. If something like this occurs, you might feel justified in actually not wanting to give them booze, even though you can afford it - because it does not come from a genuine desire to give, but from feeling pressured into giving something to them, because they need it in an unrestrained way. 


&gt; Furthermore, I know how critical he is about people's looks and many people I find good looking is not good looking to him at all. So when I brought this up &amp; asked him about it, his reply really shocked me. It doesn't make sense to me AT ALL and I would like to know if any redditors feel the same as him.

I am not sure what this refers to. It sounds like you guys have different views on what you like in other people. This is entirely normal. People have different tastes. 


&gt;He told me that he doesn't want to compliment me because he knows I am insecure about my looks. That's why he doesn't want to build my confidence by complimenting my outer appearence, but want me to build it up myself because then nobody can take away this confidence from me.

This sounds caring, and it actually seems like he is looking out for you. He might be a tad condescending about it though. 

&gt;He also REFUSES to encourage me to do anything out of my comfort zone. I have anxiety &amp; low confidence so it's holding me back from things I want to do. He said that he will only praise or encourage me when he sees me ACHIEVING something. This confused me greatly?? Isn't the point of encouragement to motivate others?

What are you doing about your anxiety? I had it as well &amp; I do know people who have it - it can really mess up your relationship because it leaves you with a tendency towards codependent relationships. Relationships where you mix up your feelings with the other person's feelings - you might feel that your life's burden is too heavy to carry  for you and you want to be encouraged, because anxiety leads you to a lack of motivation. 
I agree that it would be nicer to be encouraged to do stuff- but really it also sounds like he does not want to carry the burden of your anxiety for you. It really is for you to sort out. 
Anxiety works in relationships the following way: 

Anxiety about doing things/life - not feeling strong about doing things- not wanting to face it - seeking relief anxiety through confidence boosters from partner, in your case compliments- and feeling better about yourself- something else happens- not dealing with anxiety- back to partner for short term relief. 

A healthy cycle is: anxiety about something- being able to put things into perspective and regulate the anxiety response- not letting anxiety blow things out of proportion - getting on with things to the best of your capacity. You compliment/ do nice things for each other with your partner just because you feel it, the partner feels it, not to regulate anxiety. You encourage each other as an additional push and booster of motivation, especially for ambitious things, but you fundamentally should have the capacity to self-motivate sufficiently for most things, and not use your partner as this figure who carries responsibility for your success. 

It really, really looks like your boyfriend is refusing to enable your anxiety and engage in this cycle. He might be doing it in a clumsy way, and be patronising in some way- but he does not sound like someone who is mean or uncaring- he sounds like someone who is giving you some tough love, and refusing to enable your unhealthy anxiety-relief cycle through external validation. It is 3 months and you are already giving him quite a lot of responsibility, that he should not carry from the start. 

I'd say, deal with you anxiety - seek therapy.  Give the guy a break- take it easy with him, and appreciate what he is giving you so far. If you guys are incompatible for other reasons, let go, but don't do it, just because he has healthy boundaries and does not let himself be used for codependent anxiety-relief, and enabling.

Yeah, McDavid is crazy talented, but part of being a phenomenal player is helping your team succeed. Crosby came into the league to a horseshit Pens team, and it didn't take long for them to start their run. You can't say the same about McDavid.

Sure, it's not entirely on them to put a solid roster together, but as a leader on the team, it's up to him to communicate to the other players, coaches and management what's needed/needs to change. 

If McDavid is so highly respected and such a generational talent, then his own franchise and management should heed his advice, and utilize him the his full extent.",1522541164

"politics","t5_2cneq","That's possible but it's also very possibly backwards e.g. Trump winds up at club with pee show and jokes (because his claim to fame at the time was being a prominent Obama hater) that he would love to have these women piss on the bed the Obamas famously slept in. we know Trump **was** at minimum *offered* a group of hookers at the Ritz-Carlton because Schiller (bodyguard guy) even admits that part in testimony

I'm weary of Putins duplicity and am ready for the possibility that this was a concocted part of the narrative he will use if he wants to sow further discord by doing something like leaking footage of refusing the hookers and leaving his hotel room to go do something else - to try to explode the kompromat and collusion narrative ( the latter of the two being real if not the former) if and when America is uniting around impeaching Trump who appears exposed as a traitor/cheat.

Never built this, assuming it's just cheese highest AC possible:

 - Start Paly 2 for Heavy Armor, defense fighting style, smites, spell casting.

 - Then Blade Singer 5. Either pickup War Caster, or be fine with only ever having your fist for opportunity attacks. 

 - At this point, either go full Wizard, or go Ancients Paly 7 for the resists and saves

 - The shtick is **Haste** yourself, bonus action **Blade Sing**, haste action **Dodge**. Reaction, **Shield**.  Your AC is now:

18 plate + 1 style + 2 shield + 2 haste + INT + 5 shield. 

28+INT AC all attacks at disadvantage.

A Sorcadin can do everything except the INT to AC, and still attack the same turn he pulls out the gimick. Probably better off with Paly 7 / Singer 2 / Sorc 11 or just P7/S13 than this if you want insane AC.",1522541165

"movies","t5_2qh3s","There are plenty of things made for kids these days that do stuff like this. Property sharing: Wreck it Ralph and Ready Player One are pretty obvious ones. 

Kid's shows about genocide: Avatar the Last Airbender, Steven Universe (well there's past genocide and ongoing attempted genocide at least), Voltron Legendary Defender, Those first 3 also deal with themes about war, PTSD, child soldiers, slavery, racism, etc. Gravity falls dealt with the apocalypse and has plenty of fucked up adult themes and scenes, like stuff about homelessness, estrangement, emotional abuse, demonic possession, etc. For recent movies with dark themes and stories there's Paranorman, in which the plot is caused by something very dark. There's also Kubo and the Two Strings, which I also can't describe without spoilers but it's not very happy. There's Coraline as well, which anyone who's seen it will talk about how creepy it is, I'm sure I could find more if I wanted to, that's just off the top of my head.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","The claim that the earth is 6000 years old did not originate with Christianity, as I understand it. 

In order to apply scientific peer review to Darwin's claims, from what I understand, a geologist (Lord Kelvin, I think it was) tried to ""carbon date"" the earth. Evolution as Darwin described it was a very slow, gradual, continuous process, so he expected a very old earth. The geologist came up with a date that was good for what data they had, but they didn't have a lot of knowledge we have now. For example, they didn't know about cosmic radiation. So, he came up with a number that we now recognize as *way* off.

A well-intentioned bishop thought that it would be nifty if he could back up the geological theory of the day with historical record, so he threw together a list of names from Genesis and their associated ages. But, I've lately been reading essays from a [biblical anthropologist](http://jandyongenesis.blogspot.com/?m=1) who asserts that many of the ""king names"" in Genesis refer to dynasties, not individuals, and that the ""ages"" are more about numeric symbology than actual time. In other words, just as the geologist was well-intentioned but way off for lack of data, so was the bishop.

As it turns out, biology is a lot more complicated than even Darwin expected, geology is a lot older than Kelvin expected, and biblical anthropology is a much deeper subject than this bishop expected.

In any case, this 6000-year thing has never been ""core doctrine"" for any major branch of Christianity. The Vatican certainly doesn't teach it, to my knowledge. It's absolutely reasonable to believe that the God who created the universe and each and every one of us did so in the way that scientists describe. The Bible account talks about seven days, but then later it is mentioned that God doesn't measure time on anywhere near the same scales that we do.

Yes, there are some ""Young Earthers"" out there. In my experience with them, their beef is not with science itself. Their hostility is more of a reaction to certain members of the scientific community who have been unnecessarily hostile to religion. The anti-religion bias in academia really is quite strong. I have heard that even non-Christian scientists have found themselves blacklisted for making observations and speculations that *could* sound like Intelligent Design, even if that wasn't where they meant to take those ideas.

Wouldn't it be nice if we could stop treating each other as enemies, and actually listen to and respect each other, not taking disagreement as attack? That would be a novel experience.",1522541166

Being that the vast majority die to Shocks&amp;Bolts. .  . THAT WILL be a problem/annoyance; even if the trigger from Goggles is on the stack you can still lose out to Shocks&amp;Bolts; I also know this from experience in the past btw.


Sweatworks Brawler is honestly not worth it; 
Run Rusted Relic since it's a beefy 5/5 for 4 that is on curve. :) 


Ghirapur Gearcrafter is Dece for 2R BUT. . . For 1R he's outclassed by Aether Chaser who has 1st Strike.They both also have 1 toughness so you aren't losing any Power/Toughness Points. And both make tokens, just differently.


If you are going to run Countless Gears Renegade; it's far better to run 4x Evolving Wilds or 4x Terramorphic Expanse or some mix of the two to easily trigger Revolt :) 

Aether Inspector I feel is marginally better than the 1x Copy of Propeller Pioneer for a number of reasons. 1 being that Vigilance on a 2/3 is decent. And 2 Toughness is not nearly as good as 3 Toughness. :( 

You can also try throwing in some Myr Enforcers btw, and ditch the Propeller Pioneer + shave some other creatures. I would recommend shaving 2 Glint Sleeve Artisan, removing the Pioneer, and get rid of 1 O-Ring. IF you don't want to shave an O-Ring then shave 1x Reneagade and then swap 2 Evolving Wilds/Fetch Lands back to Basics or Gain Lands.  ",1522541168

It's also a reflection on the various strains of Catholicism I encounter, how a friend I have (who I'll admit has a drug problem) can be absolutely *furious* over the current Pope and how meaningless Catholicism has become whilst still engaging in sin, I think that ties well with the idea of being *against* the state of society whilst not living up to the standards of ones' *ideal* society.",1522541170

Xp for offlane is much lower if you get denied, so offlane is harder, you will see a lot more of dual offlane or even aggro trilane.
neutrals give bonus gold to whomever stacked them. 15% if im not mistaken. shrines heal you by a formula only Wagamama knows, so the formula has changed, in a way that clarity and healing salve heal more MP/HP later in the game, one clarity can regen 500 mana at some point.
Shrines sit in jungle, jungle is divided into two portions, they can be destroyed if a T3 has been destroyed, roshan is now north of the mid lane. He's much much stronger late game than he was before.
Now he gives cheese on second kill, and a refreher orb on third kill (that is a consumable that refreshes shit)
Bounty rnes give gold and xp.

Slark is now the worst hero in the game, Techies tries to contest for the  spot. Best heroes are underlord and let's say Elder Titan.
Couple of new heroes, don't know them, last new hero I played is Arc Warden.

best team is Virtus Pro, Na`Vi is between t2 and t3, Alliance doesn't exist, Eg players are still cocky, Miracle is the best player Rn.

"OnePunchMan","t5_2vm97","Jesus Christ man, you’re making it so complicated. Another much simpler explanation is that Saitama already broke his limiter. Every day he’s just getting stronger which is why he had trouble with monsters for a bit before he fights 170,000 Year Magicia Nymph. And since he was such a weak human, it would make sense for him to train for a year and a half to reach the kind of power that dwarfs the combined power of the S-Class. Breaking your limiter doesn’t grant unlimited strength instantly, rather the **possibility to gain unlimited strength**. That’s why Saitama is able to beat the Saitama of yesterday.

Is he really getting a power up? Dude easily takes on TTM and Metal Bat, but has a hard time against some weak A-Classes? (Compared to what he’s been facing) Yeah, he can be considered “weakened” but he still took on Genos and barely managed to survive Bang &amp; Bombs onslaught. That’s not getting a power up, that’s surviving on the edge of death, pouring all his power into evasion, and using any opportunity to counterattack. Genos himself recognizes this.

&gt; Saitama lectured him on how Garou lost because of motivation, that he could never hope to defeat Saitama because he lacked conviction. 

Nope, it’s not that he didn’t lack conviction. It’s that Saitama was just too strong. Think about it, he unleashed a barrage of attacks against an unknown B-Class, he was fully willing to beat Saitama within an inch of his life. You have to realize by now that things would’ve gotten ugly is Saitama didn’t show up after the S-Class got defeated? Garou wasn’t going to stop himself. Garou never lost conviction until he met Saitamas overwhelming power, and anyone who meets Saitama realize their views are dramatic and ultimately laughable compared to a guy who gained unimaginable power just because of a serious hobby.",1522541175

"PuzzleAndDragons","t5_2w23a","The dantalion you want to lead with is definitely the R/D one since you scale off of both fire and dark crosses. As far as I can tell, the leader skills are otherwise identical. As for subs, I would make the dupe dant R/D also since on a cross lead I personally value time more than the sb+. Sanada should be awoken form for better active and more fingers. You will probably also want to use hestia for any dungeon with resolve (NOTE: only make one hestia awoken, keep the other one base form as the active skill changes). I would probably put napoleon or Yamato Takeru in the last slot (depending on if dragon killer is useful in the dungeon). Napoleon brings more relevant offensive awakenings. Takeru has a nice active for 2/3rds of dants leader skill, but his offensive awakenings are wasted. Ronia is not really a good sub, I would use her as an assist though for a triple cross burst board.

My opinion is that ryune will be easier to play and more stable. You trade that for damage potential, but you do have both i&amp;i and the blue wisedragon so I dont see damage being an issue for most things.

-------------------

By comparing to the [numbers from year-end 2016](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/04/statistical-report-2016?lang=eng) :) It's not very specific but you can get some general information:

1. Net membership: 15,882,417 -&gt; 16,118,169 (+235,752 or +1.48%)
2. Full-time missionaries: 70,946 -&gt; 67,049 (-3,897 or -5.49%)
3. Church-service missionaries: 33,695 -&gt; 36,172 (+2,477 or +7.35%)
4. Net missionaries: 104,641 -&gt; 103,221 (-1420 or -1.35%)
5. Wards: 30,304 -&gt; 30,506 (+202 or +0.66%)

It's interesting to note that the membership change is net membership of +235,752, but if you actually add up the figures you can break this down into +340,500 new members converted or born and -104,748 members passing away or leaving the church. That means on a net basis, the growth is +1.48% but on a gross basis it's something like +2.14%. Compare this to global growth in 2017 of net +1.12% and gross of about +1.85% (from 2016), and the Church continues its streak of outpacing global growth for at least the past century!

More, from comparing to the 2015/2016 numbers:

In 2016, the conversion rate was 240,131 out of a starting membership of 15,634,199, or 1.53 converts per 100 members. In 2017 those numbers are 233,729 out of a starting membership of 15,882,417, or about 1.47 converts per 100 members, so almost unchanged. I need to start a spreadsheet :P",1522541177

If you then go and eat before you cure yourself, then you might end up making things worse. Weed is similar in that you will need to feel safe in your own being during the time you ingest it. If you're constantly living in some kind of fear based emotion then it will tend to bring those fears from under the surface and cause you anxiety.

The solution to this will always involve addressing and tackling your fears in a level headed and open minded manner.

You’re absolutely right that an immutable database is not useful for most current use cases - but that also has a lot to do with the fact that truly immutable  database hasn’t existed before. 

OTOH just because it’s immutable doesn’t mean it can’t be edited, updated or records “deleted.” The history of the database stays intact forever, but the current state can obviously be changed. I mean that’s like the whole basis of how currency works on a blockchain, that “coins” are sent from address to address and the ledger is updated to reflect that. Because the history is intact back to the very first block it’s possible to prove that no coins were double spent or created out of thin air, that it’s completely consistent and incorruptible. 

The primary use case of blockchain is that because the data is so resilient, it can be used to represent ownership. The most straightforward expression of that is ownership of abstract units of currency, but it’s a pretty small step to extend that to any digital good. For example, when you buy a game, what would you rather have - an entry in steam’s database that says you have the right to play the game - a license that is no transferable and that they can revoke at any time or that will disappear if valve goes under. Or an entry on a blockchain that you can freely transfer without valves permission to anyone else and will persist indefinitely? ",1522541180

The pan flutes (also known as panpipes or syrinx) are a group of musical instruments based on the principle of the closed tube, consisting of multiple pipes of gradually increasing length (and occasionally girth). Multiple varieties of pan flutes have long been popular as folk instruments. The pipes are typically made from bamboo, giant cane, or local reeds. Other materials include wood, plastic, metal and ivory.

Lunar Chronicles, Mistborn, Riyria Revelations, Belgariad, Mortal Instruments, Elemental Masters....

Imagine if people had held this same stigma about calling themselves civil rights advocates? Groups will always attract extremists because groups attract people and a certain subset of people are extremists. In my opinion, calling yourself a women’s rights advocate and a men’s rights advocate is the solution. Both labels are concise. Unlike feminism, they clearly state their goals in the name. That offers protection against extremism in ways that feminism doesn’t have because you can easily assess if someone is adhering to the core goal of the group or not. 

That’s my take on it anyway. The point I was trying to make is that I’m an MRA. I don’t consider myself to be an extremist (who does? I guess you just have to judge based on my actions), and I don’t think the movement should be disbanded or ignored because of a few crazies. It seems you disagree, and that’s understandable.

One thing that **may** be at work here is the accuracy of the ""children of record"" number. 

I may be wrong, but I **think** that this number is derived from the baptism of 8 year olds, or perhaps the blessing and naming of babies.

In either case, if 60% to 70% of the baptized and confirmed membership is inactive, then we can probably figure that babies/youth in that population are **not** brought to sacrament for a blessing and naming ordinance or baptized at the same rate as in active families.

The free market has closed a lot of those. Almost all of them at least make a decent low end rifle now. I'd say a $399 PSA is about the lowest acceptable quality personally.

&gt;and hardly any machined parts compared to a quality hunting rifle. 

I don think that's right.

&gt;What sank Remington is that they thought the fear based gun buying from the Obama years would continue. They built up capacity and then it dropped when Trump was elected.

Ha this proves you know little about the industry. Remington was bought by Freedom Group in 2007 and their quality took a nosedive. Their guns rust before they even get to the salesfloor. They'll be in a humidity control safe and still rust. They're cheap. Besides Remington hardly makes anything that someone would panic buy. 

&gt;
&gt;See, the gun culture, when afraid of their guns being confiscated, buy more .... to be confiscated, I guess. 

That definitely happened in 2012 but by now we're all well stocked. Magazines and rifle last about forever. The only ones stockpiling now are late bloomers. And it's not for confiscation. If this theoretical assault weapons ban is like the last anything they buy will be grandfathered it. That's why we stockpile.

Don't worry not ignorant at all, there is probably hundreds of languages in the Americas and other places I've never heard of either, thing is though you probably use Gàidhlig quite often without even realising due to English loaning words such as:

Cairn,

Shanty (as in town), 
Brogues, 
Plaid (as in tartan fabric), 
Smashing (as in a great), 
Well (as in ""well I wasn't sure""),

To feel like a suicide attempt is the cause of a break up, only led to more attempt down the line , that pretty much put a nail in the coffin for us to ever talk again. I went to far out of pain, and said / did things that made her hate me more. Things where told to her that were taking out of context and in the heat of the moment when I was surrounded by cops and had a gun to own temple. But will never get to know what I did wrong for sure, outside of the stuff I did when I felt like a drowning man losing everything and tried to take her with me.

"anime","t5_2qh22","&gt; Complaining about the ""harem"" as the other guy did however is just missing the point

No it's not. It just highlights the weakness of the author.

The author doesn't give the MC a choice. He doesn't let the MC choose. Because choosing creates a personality and he can't let the MC have that. Everything that happens with the MC happens by coincidence. He doesn't investigate the forest because he loves animals since he was a kid, he just does it because the map is blank and that's the easiest choice to make. He frees slaves because that's the easiest most good-guy choice to make. Every choice he makes is the DEFAULT choice. It's what you'd expect anybody in his position to do. And it just shows he never comes across any moral dilemma or internal conflict because he's a shit character.

But then comes his harem. Like any other generic harem, it's full of girls made out of different ~~fetishes~~ attributes. Like any harem anime, if he chose one of them, it'd reveal character, but the author doesn't have the balls to make him choose. Because if the MC chose one character, the readers would think the author doesn't like another character. Or maybe the author himself doesn't have the courage to choose one of the girls he made up. Anyway, it just shows an extreme lack of decision-making that's known in every harem anime ever. But what sets this one apart from the others is that the author, instead of TROUBLING THE MC WITH THE DECISION, went for freeing the MC from making choices by just making him go after literally any random girl in a brothel and forfeit the entire harem-picking premise.

That's the disturbingly shitty writing. I have never seen a character so weak. It's disgusting.",1522541189

&gt;+Adds/disads

Robust modifier system that's easy to play with without referring to the rules constantly.

&gt;+Classless

Only real function of classes is to change the point cost of skills, so can easily be ignored.

&gt;+Point Based

Distribute points among six attributes, spend points on ranks in skills.

&gt;+Skill Based

Every check is a skill check. If you don't have the skill, you roll ""untrained"" at half your attribute

&gt;+Deadly Combat

One hit can kill you, or disable you beyond the point that you can recover on your own. Use of cover, and avoiding fights you can't win, is vital

&gt;+-Tactical(I want tactical options, but still be able to run TotM simply enough)

Cover bonuses, suppressive fire, waiting for the right moment to advance towards the enemy to avoid being fired at in the open, aiming for weak spots. I run it TotM.

&gt;+-Medium Crunch

I don't have much basis for comparison sorry. It seems pretty crunchy so it's at least in the middle, but I'm not familiar with other crunchy games.

&gt;+-Generic

Skills cover just about anything you can think of, item lists are broken up into ""progress levels"" going from primitive to far future, it has rules for magic separate from psionics, but also cybertech, space combat, mutations, shadowrun-style net hacking.

Una pareja quedo embarazada accidentalmente, la mujer queria tener el bebe y el padre no, entonces el hombre abrio un reclamo por via legal para poder renunciar a las implicaciones (lo que algunos sociologos le dicen ""aborto financiero"") del nacimiento de ese hijo no deseado.

El juez fallo a en contra del hombre, juzgando que el derecho de una mujer de llevar adelante un embarazo o no, no es analogo al de un hombre de rechazar la paternidad.

Siguiendo esa línea, el juez tambien considero que el derecho del niño a tener un padre, además de la cuestión del pago de manutencion necesario para la crianza, estaba por sobre el derecho del padre a renunciar a la paternidad.


es un tema extremadamente complejo, y sospecho que el juez del caso este puntual que menciono, tampoco quizo fallar a favor del hombre para no dejar un precedente judicial que abriera las puertas a que de repente una oleada de hombres decidieran abandonar las responsabilidades de hijos concebidos por accidente.

"linuxquestions","t5_2rbms","I'd suggest you to begin googling and perhaps looking at youtube videos about several different ""desktop environments"" available on linux. The most famous ones are Gnome, KDE, XFCE, LXDE. They're basically suites of software for ""lots of stuff"" that share most dependencies, when compared with applications of a different desktop environment. Gnome and KDE are the heavyweights, the other ones are somewhat lighter. XFCE is perhaps one of the most popular nowadays, with the fall of popularity of the new Gnome, as XFCE is pretty similar to classic Gnome.

System settings panels will have some interchangeable stuff, but also their own specific settings, pertaining to different desktop environments. Sometimes you can install packages that allow you to change settings of one DE from another.

Regardless of you choosing to go and install a ""full"" or minimal desktop environment from the start, versus trying things literally in a package-by-package basis, perhaps being aware of each D.E. and their ""family"" of components will aid you in making comparisons. Ultimately you can combine things of any desktop environment, even though it comes at the cost of some more space for the non-shared libraries. The great divide is perhaps QT versus GTK applications, more than the desktop choice itself.

I'd also suggest as a middle ground to install a ""minimal full"" DE, such as LXDE or XFCE, and then trying some applications of KDE or Gnome. I don't think one gains that much useful knowledge in installing things one by one. It's not that it's particularly mistake-prone, only cumbersome, and increases the odds of leaving something like power management out. In my opinion that's the thing one does after having already developed some particular preferences over applications and desktops, after trying a little bit of the ""full"" version of everything. You'd already have something more specific to aim for, and even more experience if you stumble into some roadblock.

If you feel that the ""right way"" of doing things is having GUIs with all the settings, then it's even more recommended that you'd start with some ""random"" ""full"" desktop environment, rather than going through the package-by-package route. Which is kind of paving the road ahead of you instead of taking one that's already there, in a way. The odds are they you'd have a ""frankenstein"" set of applications, not completely covered by a ""random"" settings GUI you decided to install. And if you install the settings' GUIs for every desktop, that's probably installing something like 1/8 of the ""full"" desktop anyway.

I've using linux since 2006 or so, for the first times I've used KDE desktops (fairly lighter back then, even though also more fully featured), then I gradually migrated to minimalistic ones, such as fluxbox and openbox, even though still using several KDE and GTK/Gnome applications. My biggest ""cheat"" is to use package managers such as Synaptic (Debian and Ubuntu), which, with an ""add-on"" allow for instant searching of packages according to keywords filtered. It's almost like an ""embedded google"" about the packages available. That and trusting the dependency resolution solves most of  the problems, even though sometimes achieving the desired settings may be a problem on its own.

Even though I'd recommend Debian stable, I'm sure Arch linux also has some sort of analog to Synaptic, I've used it for a while, just going back to Debian because I didn't see any big advantage, and I was more used to doing things the ""Debian way"", not seeing much use in starting another learning curve to achieve the same things.",1522541194

*This will be my first DAC and I'm just starting out again (this time for real) so my goals are:*

* *Log every day of the month and to be honest about it.* **Check!**

* *Drink more water and less sugary drinks/beer.* **Check!**

* *Lose 5 pounds (low but I want to manage my expectations).* **Check!**

* *Connect with people from here on LoseIt!* **Check!**

* *Walk the dog 3x per week (weather depending).* A little iffy at first but overall I'd say **Check!**

* *Check in on the daily threads.* **Check!**

I feel like I've gotten a lot more comfortable with tracking and living a healthier lifestyle in the last month. The scale reflects that and so do my clothes. I wore a shirt today that was skin tight a couple months ago and is loose now! These daily check ins have been a big part in that, keeping me honest and accountable.

"Design","t5_2qh78","You are of course entitled to your own opinions and definitions, as am I. Don’t ask for critique, and immediately dismiss it without some level of discourse, especially in any medium where your voice is represented via rhetoric.

Your process may be one shared with many disciplines of design, but that is not the goal of design, to evoke emotion and make people think about things, especially thinking about the actual design. Design is a methodology for solving problems with any number of methods of communication and feedback. Don’t get me wrong, emotion and memory are the key ingredients to having an experience, I did my entire thesis on emotion and experience for my BFA ten years ago, but to say that they are the goal of design is dangerous. I’d recommend reading some John Dewey, Neil Leach, and check out an article called Wicked Problems in Design Thinking by Richard Buchanan for a better understanding of the goals of design.

Your work is creative, artistic, and shows some real promise, but you should really be open to learning more about the discipline, how it differs from fine art, and how to take constructive criticism.

Best of luck!",1522541194

1. **Black Tiger Sex Machine**: cool live performance, very heavy, cool masks.

2. **Chris Lake**: straight up house music, very danceable, bound to be fun

3. **Crankdat b2b Dirty Audio**: good mix of trap, future bass, bass house, dubstep. 

4. **Elephante**: super fun music, happy, but also energetic

5. **Flux Pavilion b2b Doctor P**: dubstep legends, flux's heavy melodies and dr p's wonky synths, guaranteed to be good

6. **G Jones b2b Eprom**: maybe not for everybody, but if you want to hear some crazy shit and get weird, this is the set

7. **Illenium**: the feels, if you haven't seen him it's worth checking out

8. **San Holo**: future bass, he always plays some great sets, super catchy melodies

9. **Spag Heddy**: bass heads will fucking love it, others maybe not

10. **The Binches**: Dotcom (marshmello), Kayzo, Ookay, &amp; Yultron. Idk wtf this is gonna be and I'm very curious

11. **Virtual Self**: watch porter robinson put a new spin on the old school, nuff said

12. **Pendulum**: probably one of the most legendary groups and they really don't play shows anymore, unfortunate that it's a DJ set and not live, but definitely still worth it

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I can understand this point of view.  For example, also most guys prefer women to have longer hair as opposed to short hair.  And yet short hair styles in woman are popular because they are easier to manage and in some cases out of practicality because the woman can not grow long hair for a medical reason.  In this thread, I am more interesting in what those other reasons would be for nose rings?  

Although I am curious if maybe you do have some limits here.  For example, would you be as open minded with body changes your boyfriend or husband might make like shaving his head, getting a giant facial tattoo a la Mike Tyson or even a nose ring?  Do you feel you shouldn't have any input at all in this since you would be a couple, a family, children and so on?  ",1522541200

Then lining all the tracks up so they play at the same time at the beginning of the sentence.

From there you just reduce that scale so they line up and fit in the screen one by one, this can be done with simple math or guessing, and then just trim each of the tracks forward by a second or two so they appear one by one.

Now, of course, different people speak in different tones, afflictions, and paces so that's why you can't seem to understand it past a certain point because they all become out of order. Tops half an hour of work. *Not trying to discredit the editor btw, they did a great job*.",1522541202

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","I get that, but this is also a unique game where the player base is playing the game through the development cycle and providing feedback to the developers.  So it's not a typical early access model where the core mechanics and stuff are done when it goes to the players and then they fix whatever is left plus add new content.  Even if they fix all the crash causes today, there will be more as they continue development and break more stuff.  When we get to the point where the whole Stanton system is in and travel time is 30 minutes between planets, they are going to lose a lot of players who don't want to risk putting in an hour for a round trip only to likely have it crash at some point during that transit.  It is a bandaid for now, but one that allows the backers to participate in the whole game without feeling overly frustrated during the upcoming development process.  

If it's a massive amount of work then it might not be worth it, but the state information already exists at the time of the crash, so it's just a matter of writing it somewhere and looking it up again during the spawning routine.  The functionality needs to be there in the future as well when we get the log off/on in beds functionality and to handle similar situations where you lose connection in the final game.  So this could be version 1.0.",1522541202

He showed the ability to dodge Hell Stab. That's plenty enough reason to use the one fingered version, which is longer and harder to dodge. Coupled with Naruto's massively enhanced durability, it makes perfect sense why the Raikage would feel the need to use his full-powered Hell Stab, especially considering the fact that literally no one has ever countered it. 

&gt;Increase in power = ability to strike an elusive opponent? Makes no sense.

You're absolutely right. You know what does make sense? Increasing range=ability to strike an elusive opponent, and increased range is exactly what his one fingered Hell Stab provided.

&gt;The side with more stamina and being utterly impervious has no reason to hurry anything. No reason to pressure. Hell, he could ignore Naruto completely and just slaughter the fodder into forcing Naruto into a retreat.

Oh cool so you admit the fight between him and Naruto would have ended in a stalemate had the Raikage relied solely on his two fingers. Not sure a living, breathing Raikage would be satisfied with letting Naruto get away if his goal was to capture him. Also, thanks for acknowledging the fact that the side with more stamina has the advantage. That means a living, breathing Raikage would feel pressured to use his one finger Hell Stab, because Naruto has more stamina than he does and would outlast him.  ",1522541204

My guess? That Nigerian is contextualizing the conflict differently. Honestly, I find the idea of suicide bombing very easy to empathize with. I don't understand why it's so confusing to so many people. It only takes me a couple of minutes of imagining myself as an Arab or African Muslim to start seeing the attraction of wanting to harm the (white, Christian) West.

&gt; Why were people dying to protect or avenge a proto-state in Syria which they simply didn't belong to?
&gt;
&gt; No nationalist framework can explain this, you need a pre-nationalist, religious conception of the Ummah to do so.

I agree that strict nationalism doesn't explain it, but pan-nationalism seems to do a pretty good job.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","To be fair, I do not know any friends who eat or have eaten whale. As far as I know, the vast majority of the whale meat is exported, of which Japan is one of the main importers (however, let's not demonize the Japanese on racist grounds). Whale is not common in modern-day Norwegian cuisine although whaling has been done for centuries. 

While I am 100% against whaling, the current stock of minke whales in the North Atlantic counts over 100.000 individuals. The quota was in 2017 consisting of 999 animals (often this number isn't even reached as Norway only hunted 438 animals in 2017). In addition to this, the population is at all times monitored and the hunt would not continue if the population was to go on a steady decline. Hunting techniques also emphasize ""ethical"" killing blows, as in the whales should feel no pain when dying, and indeed, 80% of them are claimed to die instantly, while the remaining 20% are claimed to pass out and feel no pain as death occurs.

It is definitely possible that whaling has negative ecological impacts and that, in essence, hunting whales is wholly unecessary. However, before you criticize, the meat industries of poultry, beef, fish etc. etc. are arguably as bad if not worse for the enviroment *and* the animals concerned. At least the whales were free prior to their slaughter.

In all, I think we as humans need to reconsider our food habbits and move on to more sustainable ways in general. Harvesting from sustainable populations is infinitely better than raising animals for consumption, the problem is that if everyone were to hunt whales, they'd go extinct. So our concern should be more focused on fairness and common sense rather than ""whales as intelligent beings"". All animals are intelligent to some degree. You eating your steak does not differ much from the guy up in the North eating whale.

If the idea is to gauge public opinion, then this can be done (and currently is done) perfectly well through opinion polls, as long as the split isn't too 50-50 that MoE comes into play. 

If the idea is to improve public debate by improving participation in politics, then I would say that recent evidence shows that this will not lead to healthy debate. This will only be exacerbated by making the polls advisory (they currently are anyway, but this could be more clearly stated). Ultimately, if the government goes against the poll, the debate will just fall into a shouting match of 'enemy of democracy' and 'the poll was only advisory'.

I think that the current system of opinion polls is good. It allows the government to gauge public opinion whilst being in no way bound to the result.",1522541207

I once did a calculation, iterating a factor for rope stretch from factory data. After 5 rounds it converged nicely. Basically if you’re less than 100kg, anything that holds over 7kN is pretty good and 10kN is bomber.

No other game has nearly the detail that SC has *and* SC is in an alpha state so RAM is not being used optimally. What you've experienced in other games is kind of irrelevant, the bottom line is that 16 GB is required and will likely be required even with optimization. 

When you have poly counts that are multiple times that of other triple A games and they're all mapped with textures of much higher resolution you're going to need a lot of RAM and a lot of VRAM no matter which way you slice it.

"LabourAntisemitism","t5_h6sff","&gt; Jeremy Corbyn faces a damaging new anti-semitism scandal as a bombshell dossier reveals the full extent of anti-Jewish, violent and abusive comments on Facebook groups mobilising his most fervent supporters.
&gt; 
&gt; Twelve senior staff working for the Labour leader and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, are members of groups containing anti-semitic and violent comments, including praise for Adolf Hitler and threats to kill Theresa May, the prime minister.
&gt; 
&gt; The most comprehensive investigation conducted into 20 of the biggest pro-Corbyn Facebook groups — numbering 400,000 members — found routine attacks on Jewish people, including Holocaust denial.
&gt; 
&gt; The dossier was compiled over two months by whistleblowers working with The Sunday Times in the groups, who gained access to restricted membership groups. They uncovered more than 2,000 racist, anti-semitic, misogynistic, violent and abusive messages.
&gt; 
&gt; Lord Carlile, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said the comments appeared to breach hate-crime laws. The investigation found:
&gt; 
&gt; Posts including support for Adolf Hitler, with one saying the Nazi leader “should have finished off the job” and another claiming the deaths of 6m Jews in the Holocaust “was a big lie!”
&gt; 
&gt; Labour supporter, Patrick Haseldine, who posted an image of the Israeli flag on one Labour group on Facebook, with the swastika replacing the Star of David
&gt; 
&gt; Ian Love, a Momentum organiser on one of the groups, who claimed the former prime minister Tony Blair was “Jewish to the core”, and told The Sunday Times last week he believed the Rothschild banking family controlled most of the world’s finances.
&gt; 
&gt; The Facebook groups — which include We Support Jeremy Corbyn, with 68,000 members — have played a key role in helping Corbyn win two leadership contests and boost his performance in the last general election. He is under strong pressure to confront the anti-semitism in his party.
&gt; 
&gt; The abusive messages regularly targeted Jewish public figures, including the Labour MP Luciana Berger and Jonathan Arkush, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews. There are also many violent threats against politicians.
&gt; 
&gt; Berger said she and her staff had gone to police about the abuse they had received from left-wingers, including one email urging her to kill herself. In an article for The Sunday Times, Berger says: “Where people indulge in illegal racist activity I will always use the full force of the law to pursue a prosecution. I will continue to do that even when they are people from the left.”
&gt; 
&gt; Last night, Christine Shawcroft resigned from Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) following pressure from Tom Watson, the deputy leader. She had opposed the suspension of a Labour member accused of Holocaust denial. “It is clear that my continued membership of the NEC has become a distraction for the party,” said Shawcroft, who will be replaced by the comedian Eddie Izzard.
&gt; 
&gt; David Prescott, Corbyn’s senior political adviser, was a member of We Support Jeremy Corbyn, the biggest group, until last week; Laura Murray, a stakeholder manager in Corbyn’s office, is a member of Supporting Jeremy Corbyn &amp; John McDonnell; and James Meadway, McDonnell’s economic adviser, is in the groups We Support Jeremy Corbyn and Supporting Jeremy Corbyn &amp; John McDonnell. Labour said no one in Corbyn’s or McDonnell’s office had seen, posted or endorsed anti- semitic or abusive messages.
&gt; 
&gt; Some posts decry the lack of availability of “assassins” in Britain for “getting rid of politicians”, with a picture featuring May. Another post, about the former deputy prime minister Damian Green, says “why don’t we just don’t get on with it and lynch him”.
&gt; 
&gt; Robert Ford, professor of political science at Manchester University, said “online hate factories” of the type uncovered by the investigation could encourage violent or extreme reactions.
&gt; 
&gt; The revelations came as it emerged that MPs who were at a rally to oppose Labour anti-semitism had been told to “explain” themselves to their constituency parties.
&gt; 
&gt; MPs who joined the rally say they have asked Corbyn to make clear he does not think those who attended were attacking him. He has not done so.
&gt; 
&gt; Labour said: “These groups are not officially connected to the party in any way. Labour is committed to challenging and campaigning against anti-semitism.”
&gt; 
&gt; The women’s parliamentary Labour Party, made up of the party’s female MPs and peers, has demanded Jeremy Corbyn suspend a male MP accused of domestic violence while the allegations were investigated.",1522541210

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; I feel like we agree that our hypothetical officer is doing something wrong by having sex with this woman who's making the offer. it's only a disagreement as far as how wrong, and what degree of punishment he should be subjected to. I feel like putting him on a sex offender registry wouldn't serve any real purpose. Yes, he abused his position by accepting sex, but it wasn't something that he went in with a goal of doing, the sex was incidental to the accepting of a bribe. So as long as he was kept out of similar positions of authority in the future there's no need to specifically mark him out as having accepted sex as the bribe.

This is a hopelessly naive view of people. Abusers will put themselves in that situation intentionally, and then take advantage of it. You are creating an environment where it is easy to rape people, and where they have an excuse to lower their sentencing. Rapists absolutely will go into the job with the goal of raping prisoners.

&gt; So as long as he was kept out of similar positions of authority in the future there's no need to specifically mark him out as having accepted sex as the bribe.

That's precisely what the sex offender's registry is for.

&gt; The whole scenario falls squarely into that gray area that some people would think of as rape and others wouldn't (along with things like having sex with a mildly drunk person, or exchanging sex for gifts) and which we don't really have a good term for. The manslaughter of rape, if you will, where it's no question something bad was done, but there's no real ongoing threat to the world at large from the perpetrator.

Again, your comparison to manslaughter is wrong. This is rape, it's not a grey area. You keep talking about how it's ""not as bad"", but the difference is barely there. It's less direct, but that doesn't make it less bad. Why is using the threat inherent to imprisonment less bad than using the threat of direct violence?

The only difference between the case of the child and the case of the prisoner you gave was that it's obvious a child can't consent, while with a prisoner you feel they can. The answer to that is really simple - codify it in law that a prisoner can't consent, and then the line is very, very clear.

No one can say ""oh, but I didn't think I was raping anyone"", because the law makes that line very clear - you are in a position of power, that person isn't capable of consent. Even if you think they really want to have sex with you, remember you are in a position of power over them and they can't make that decision without that coming into it.

Your argument is precisely the reason to set it in law - so everyone knows that it's rape and it should never happen. Your view that it's a reason not to put it into law is backwards - it completely ignores the victims that are raped as a problem. Law is also about deterrent, we don't want prisoners getting raped. It should not be that anyone sees it as OK to abuse that situation, just as it's not ""less bad"" to accept a child's proposition for sex vs holding the child down. Either way, you are raping the child. They can't consent, because they aren't capable of it.",1522541211

Ghost recon, Links these games took community and fun and allowed us some true escapism. What we have now does not come close.

Who thought of him as that? Where is his record against Povetkin, Wlad, Haye, Valuev, Fury, etc? You know the guys who actually fought in relevant fights.

Wilder is apparently the best American heavyweight and most of Ortiz's record seems to be clearing out Americans who never got close to holding titles. That to me says a lot about where he is at and where Wilder is at. None of these fighters have been relevant. None have been a serious contender to the contenders. Do you think Ortiz fights Povetkin? Valuev? Haye? Fury?

What was he doing all his career? Did he not try to become world champion? Having watched him today I think Povetkin beats Wilder or Ortiz even at 38.",1522541216

I did a Google and Google books showed just enough of the pertinent scene in that book for me to identify it, but it didn't show enough for me to get all the words I didnt' figure out on my own.  There is apparently a photograph included in that scene but of course we don't see it here in this transcript. 

Edit: the photograph is a group of people who rebus into a clue forthe phrase safety deposit box, which apparently is in Lucerne. 

I managed to find Act 1 of this play in Pdf format and got this much so far.  And thanks to Loopy_doop for the ""number"" and ""older gemini"" solutions.

 **[Skin idea] Dark Star Xerath**

&gt;https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/010/073/703/large/thorsten-erdt-dark-star-xerath.jpg?1522417226  
&gt;  
&gt;There's already a Thread asking for a Dark Star skin for Xerath and I totally agree.  
&gt;The pursuer of power is destined to become a cosminc entity of dark energy and destruction.  
&gt;  
&gt;This skin concept went through multiple variations (check out my artstation link for more).  
&gt;The final version has a core inspired by cosmic clouds / nebulae instead of the usual glowy strings.  
&gt;For animations I'd imagine the core to rotate slowly and the glow on the collar could radiate up and outwards, like energy coming out of a rift in space.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can find my other skins and more stuff in my artstation gallery here:  
&gt;https://www.artstation.com/thorstenerdt/albums/751268  
&gt;  
&gt;As always, if you like it, give it a thumbs up and comment if you want to.

Cool.  Part of the job application is demonstrating that you understand and can conform to workplace norms. In the US, we use resumes, so following a CV standard could easily come off as not having the ability to edit or prioritize or just not understanding how things are done in a US workplace. Both could very likely make OP seem like they need more training than if they just use a standard resume.

"occult","t5_2qhmc","&gt;The tree is not cursed for its biology, the tree is cursed because it already is cursed.

That's not true. Jesus found a tree without fruit, then specifically cast a spell to torture and kill the tree. Jesus then follows up by saying that you can curse whoever you want if you have enough faith.

Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, ""May you never bear fruit again!"" Immediately the tree withered. When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. ""How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"" they asked. Jesus replied, ""Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.""

The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. Then he said to the tree, ""May no one ever eat fruit from you again"". And his disciples heard him say it.

...

In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. Peter remembered and said to Jesus, ""Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!"" ""Have faith in God,"" Jesus answered. ""Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.""

&gt;the fact that Jews at absolute best are indifferent to the well-being of whites 

In what way? Devoting myself to their happiness and satisfaction without even knowing anything about what kind of person they are? If so, then I'm indifferent to the well-being of Jews as well, and everyone is indifferent to the well-being of anyone, since there are plenty of Whites you don't care about.

Does that mean being indifferent to a white person losing his well-being just because of his race? If so, then no, I would prefer for that not to happen.

&gt;And those inadvertantly those side-issues often support the conclusion that Jewish interests diverge from those of whites. 

No, they support the conclusion that Jewish interests diverge from those of Whites whenever Jews are unable to pursue individual interests on equal footing. 

&gt;well it's not Jew's fault they were pushed into exploited whites

I don't think all Jews were ""exploiting"" Whites, agreeing to take a loan from someone on his terms or going to your local cinema to pay for watching a Warner Bros movie in 1920 is not ""exploitation"", and that's not even something a majority of Jews were doing either.

The argument is exactly the kind of nuanced discussion which can't be found in many Alt-Right circles. It's that there can be bad Jews and bad Whites and since everyone is a product of circumstance, there have been quite a few decisions by Whites which shaped Jewish circumstances.

&gt;That still still support that whites should want separation. 

If that is what they want, I am not opposed to it. It wouldn't be ideal for Jews to reside among people who insist on hating them ( And the Zionists believed the same ) to begin with. I just don't support needless expulsions and also I don't think separation is really what the average Alt-Righter wants. Most of them are edgy young men with much more psychotic goals.

&gt;I can respect Jews that admit Jews are a separate people with separate interest

I can't admit to something which isn't true. William Shatner doesn't seem to have any significant ""separate interest"" from Bruce Willis, or that the Rockefeller family has some significant separate interest from Goldman Sachs, other than being competitors in the business.

&gt;But these Jews want whites to treat them as part of the white ingroup while Jews should be able to not reciprocate.

Nothing qualifies as sufficient reciprocity for you though, not even [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Jewish_military_personnel_of_World_War_I), so please inform me what you mean by reciprocity exactly.",1522541223
"exjew","t5_2seh7","I find that modern Orthodox have a generally more well-rounded, humane, and decent way of thinking about non-Jews compared to black-hat frum Jews.  That said, I knew many wonderful yeshivish people who were brilliantly kind to goyim.  And I know of plenty of modern Orthodox (perhaps more in Israel than in America, but whatever) Jews who were less than decent in their attitudes.

The primary reason I left my own yeshivish life was precisely due to the racism against non-Jews.  The things people would say still shock me even today.  It often goes to the core of how people think about God and the world, and so extricating from those communities is pretty difficult.

You seem to have nice air bnb hosts, and that's where I'd begin looking for roommates or other, more permanent housing. They may also be open to you staying longer if you asked them. However if they are not open to it, it is in their interests to help you find more permanent housing. Through them, you stand a better chance of getting a roommate who has been at least tangentially vetted by people you like. 

You can and deserve to live independently if you want to. When I got my first solo apartment I was barely capable of caring for myself, which meant buying furniture was out of the question. I spent the first year on an air mattress. It was still better than being with my abusive parents. My credit was also terrible for years because I couldn't handle administrative tasks. But you seem to have a lot of this handled, which makes me think you may be being hard on yourself. No one with an 820 credit score is bad at being an adult, or bad at the administrative side of adulthood. The social skills you can learn. You have accomplished a lot already; you must be intelligent with a strong drive. 

Just out of curiosity, do you have a therapist or psychiatrist? Please consider getting one or both if you haven't already. 

You are right to be worried about someone trying to take advantage of someone in your situation. Reading between the lines, I think I may know how you made that money? Not trying to pry at all but if it involved anything under the table you do need to be very careful who you trust. However, a therapist can't tell anyone anything unless you're planning to hurt yourself or others. I think having someone to listen might help a lot to shift yourself out of the mud here. Sorry for the digression if you already have a t or p-doc. 

Hope any of this helped, if not forgive me for rambling. I hope things look up for you soon.",1522541232

I think so too. I also like the fact of kids cussing and doing dangerous shit. I really liked the scene where they confront Soerento in his office. Sheridan gives a good line when he says ""I don't give a good goddamn what you say"" and point the gun in his face. That felt like that more dangerous element you would feel from some 80s movies like that. 

I think this was a solid Spielberg entry. Not his absolute best work but it's one of his most enjoyable action/adventure films probably since Minority Report honestly. ",1522541233

"Military","t5_2qh8y","They derive their authority from the head of state, where as a Sgt's authority is derived from their experience and skill. It isn't about common sense historically, it's about who your daddy is. We've moved quite far away from that since, but in the context of this question, they automatically have more responsibility because they ""earned it"" by completing a degree. If NCO's wanted to fly, they should have ""earned"" it by completing their degree.  

I think there is also a lot in learning flying that is just pure organizational management. I just sim pilot, so I'll happily fuck off if someone who actually does this for a living wants to correct me, but your average enlisted guy isn't exactly up to the task of flying a plane, let alone a jet, let alone a military jet, just based on ability to deal with the amount of knowledge you need to have. Math, critical analysis, and very good reading skills ALL go into making great pilots. A 4 year degree is at the very least a great way to show you have what it takes to be prepared to be a pilot. So, again, officers were responsible and went to school to get the billet, which is why /u/BitterEndForward I think, has a good point. ",1522541236

Boots you must prioritize 40%+ lightn. res. 25%+ movement speed, 50+ life. Helmet needs 50+ life, 40%+ lightn. res., 200+ accuracy. Belt is . . . . you guessed it 40%+ lightn. res., 50+ life and 10%+ increased flask duration is nice. You can get a dirty Stygian Vyse withlife,  lightn. res. and a Searching Eye jewel with flat phys. and whatever other goodies you want. Rings and amulet must have flat physical damage to attacks on them, this is your biggest source of damage (the best defense if one-shotting everything onscreen). Other than that get 40%+ lightn. res., life, 100+ accuracy, 30%+ crit. chance, and 20%+ elemental damage to attack skills, if you can get it. Quiver should have 30%+ crit. chance, 30%+ crit. damage, life, and any other resistances you need. Doomfletch and the fated version, Doomfletch's Prism scales increadibly well with flat physical damage off your rings, ammy, gloves, and belt (stygian vyse) so prioritize that first. To not die all the time, stack lightn. res. on every piece of gear (if you manage 170% uncapped lightn. res. you should be very durable. Then prioritize life, accuracy, crit. chance/multi.

The paradox of tolerance was described by Karl Popper in 1945. The paradox states that if a society is tolerant without limit, their ability to be tolerant will eventually be seized or destroyed by the intolerant. Popper came to the seemingly paradoxical conclusion that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","Ehhh, I'm not so sure on this. Just looking at the power of these abilities versus what other classes get. Ignoring theme.

* +2 STR/+1 WIS - standard
* Speed: 30 - standard (no swim speed)
* Hold Breath (1 hr) - not even waterbreathing
* Claws (1d4) - ribbon ability; Monks get this unarmed damage anyhow
* Skill Proficiency: Survival - compare with Half-Elf ""choose two"" or the Elf's perception; or weapon proficiencies of Dwarf, Elf, 
* Language Proficiency: Aquan - pretty standard; consider Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, Dragonborn, Gnome, Tiefling all get languages

So yeah, they get a basket of mundane stuff. Arguably worse stuff than is standard for the PHB classes. And they don't get any resistances as many classes do. These classes all bring something else that really defines them. They can hide or cast spells or manipulate damage dice.

So the highlight of this race is really supposed to be the defense, which is no surprise because the dominating feature of the race is a shell. This comes in two forms: Natural Armor and Shell Defense. 

**Natural Armor**

The 17 Natural AC is a trap. It's good at low levels, but it keeps you from getting most bonuses (Shield of Faith spell, Haste spell, Mage Armor spell, Barbarian and Monk’s Unarmored Defense,  Fighter and Ranger’s Defense Fighting Style) that would quickly allow you to surpass that AC. Instead, you're capped. The racial ASIs tell me that I should be using a War Cleric, but I'm setting myself up to never get that plate mail bump to 18 AC.

**Shell Defense**

This should do something. [Racial abilities shouldn't be worse than a base combat mechanic](https://thinkdm.wordpress.com/tortle-shell-defense-is-broken) (i.e. Dodge).",1522541240

If it's plot-dependent, I'll correct them, but otherwise I go off their collective recollection of what happened.

Once that's done, I build my notes on top of that, tweaking what I need, and storing it in a Drive folder so I can access it on my tablet along with my notes for the next chapter and the monsters they'll be fighting, complete with statblocks of things I think will be useful and NPC notes.",1522541240

Maybe more than that, someone above politics, immune from needing to make bad decisions to get reelected and someone who can make decisions with a long view, knowing they'll still be there in decades to come, can be a valuable thing.

The weirdness of the system aside, the Queen has been an excellent diplomat and figurehead for the UK.

Relationship difficulties depend how serious you are. If you're just beginning, the time away is a struggle because you haven't established a foundation. If you're willing to move and live where he gets sent, do so knowing that you chose to make the sacrifice and it won't be all sunny days. Our bases are often located in less desirable places, so prepare for small-town nowhere. 

If you're young in your life and haven't started down your own path, I seriously suggest you take a look at yourself and think about where you want to be in 10-20 years. Then consider if being in a small town with limited access to a lot of resources will get you there, or if you need to be around a University etc. Lots of young military couples break up because a woman follows a guy somewhere with rose tinted goggles.

Exodus 22:18
&gt; ""Do not allow a sorceress to live.""

Romans 1:27
&gt; ""In the same way also the men, giving up natural intercourse with women, were consumed with passion for one another. Men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the due penalty for their error.""

&gt; ""Wives, submit to you husbands as to the Lord""

Peter 2:18
&gt; ""Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the cruel.""

Deuteronomy 23:1
&gt; ""He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord.""

Deuteronomy 22:20-21
&gt; ""But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.""

Matthew 5:28
&gt; ""But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.""

Leviticus 12:5
&gt; ""But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.""

"politics","t5_2cneq","Not a lawyer, but my understanding is that it's a crime to form an LLC for the purposes of performing an illegal action - e.g. if you formed a LLC for the purposes of blackmailing someone, then not only is the LLC breaking the law re:blackmail, but the people who set that LLC up (presumably to separate themselves from the blackmail) would also be explicitly guilty of a crime. It follows the general rule that 'steps taken to cover up a crime are themselves crimes' to help ensure that people don't get away with Crime A by simply committing 'minor misdemeanour' B  (like lying to law enforcement, destruction of evidence etc)

No idea about corporate protections, but not sure it would matter in this case, as the purpose of the LLC was (AFAIU) to provide a level of anonymity between the pay off of Stormy and Trump himself rather then legal protections. Hilariously Cohen broke a level of that while signing it anyway, so it's all insanely idiotic at every level.

There's an excellent episode of the *Opening Arguments* podcast released a few weeks back I'd recommend you give a listen - proper lawyer explains the ins and outs of the actual legal trouble Trump/Cohen are in; they've had a few follow up notes as well, as Trump and his lawyers find spectacular new ways to incriminate themselves or contradict their own arguments!",1522541243

She may just be shy and afraid to initiate, so if that's a part of her personality, if I were you I would say something along the lines of ""Hey, is there anything you've been wanting to check out? Like a specific movie or restaurant you've been wanting to try?"" This shows her you care about what she thinks and want her to contribute when it comes to dates, and may make her more comfortable voicing what she wants and help her take some control in the relationship and hopefully encourages her to initiate dates. 

If she's pretty outgoing and not shy, however, it may be a sign that she doesn't want a relationship or to continue dating. I'm fairly extroverted, and at the beginning of the long-term relationships I've been in I always make a point to initiate dates to show the guy I'm interested, even if it's kind of vague like ""Hey, are you free to hang out at all this week?"" 

That's just my personal insight though, and in no way a guarantee of what's going on or what she's feeling. I could be way off, women are mysterious and confusing creatures lol",1522541244

Edit: The barbs do stimulate ovulation, but whether or not females like it is up for debate. Here are a couple of descriptions I found 
&gt; The male bites down on her neck, keeping her from fleeing. That seemingly melodramatic behavior isn’t because she finds boys icky. Cat sex is excruciatingly painful. The cat penis is essentially a horrifying engine of pain covered in a dozen tiny fishhooks.
http://knowledgenuts.com/2013/10/15/cat-sex-is-effectively-torture/

&gt;The other purpose of the barbs on a cat's penis is to keep the female cat from escaping before mating is complete. She may attempt to flee because cats are more likely to be loners than dogs and resent the intrusion to some point. Mating is also painful for female cats, both because of the barbs themselves and because the male cat begins by biting the back of the female's neck.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","It's not popular *now*. It's been popular for a very long time. It's a step above ear piercings which are as vanilla as it gets, but it can still be discreet enough and acceptable in most workplaces. If it's on the nostril you can get a really thin, delicate ring that's barely noticeable unless it catches the light, you can get a tiny stud, or you can wear something more obvious. If it's a septum well septum piercings can have a lot of intricate designs to them, and if you are wearing a circular barbell you can hide it which is why it's popular with teens and also people who need to conceal their piercings for work. 

I like it. I've had both nostril and septum but my skin is sensitive so I couldn't keep them in for long. I like facial piercings and a nose piercing is very low tier on the edginess scale so it's much more normalised now than maybe 40 years ago. It's just not that shocking anymore, like brightly coloured hair isn't shocking anymore.

Also, if you're black juul doesn't hit as well, try pushing the battery up a little bit from the bottom with a pen. It will get a better connection and hit harder. You can also take its battery out and clean it. If that's all too much. Try fully covering the clear part of the pod with your fingers when you take a hit. It tightens the airflow and pod connection and will make it crackle/hit harder. Let me know how it turns out. ",1522541244

Even for myself, a lot of the changes I've made that have made me more androgynous could be, by anyone else, chalked up to just personal preferences. Besides cutting my hair and wearing androgynous/masculine clothing (and the obvious binding, but for all purposes of my point that's not *too* too necessary), I haven't really made much of a big change. I look and act more androgynous now, but most of it really hasn't been an effort to *solely* be more androgynous; it's just how I am.

And then, I still like a lot of relatively feminine things, and some people (not me lmao) would even consider my personality or behavior somewhat feminine. I bake, I love bright colors, I'm sensitive and excitable, I'm way too caught up on my appearance, hell I even paint my nails sometimes.

But I still have constant dysphoria against being referred to or thought of as female at all; hell every time I hear ""missy"" or ""girly"" or ""girlfriend"" my heart jumps in my throat and I low-key wanna puke. Then sometimes I get dysphoria from the other side too, that brings me down because my body (mostly genitals, if we're being honest) doesn't look or function quite the way I want it too, and goddamn maybe I should just be a boy, goddamn maybe I should have been born one at least. But that fluctuates, and my body is really only *slightly* off to begin with.

I'd consider bottom surgery, but it's more than likely not gonna happen. Top surgery is pretty much a distant dream. I'm not going to do much in terms of my voice. I'm definitely not going to change my behavior. And most importantly, I don't want HRT *at all.*


Yes, I've made some changes; but no, they aren't *nearly* as huge as most trans people's, and not for the same direct purpose either. But I still identify as transmasc non-binary, and I still experience dysphoria. My lack of direct transition doesn't make me any less trans than those who transition fully.",1522541246

"uwaterloo","t5_2rb5s","I agree with what you said about woman in NA trying to have a good job instead of focusing just on taking care of the family, but I do not see that as a bad thing. There is anything wrong with a woman wanting to find a stable job and be independent. While it is true that taking care of your family can be fulfilling job, it should not just be the job of the woman. The dad should also be spending time and looking out for the family. Additionally, while your situation of the woman staying at home looking after the children without a job may work in most situations where this happen. However, if your husband were ever to cheat on you or bail on the family, what now? If you do not have the skills and experience, how would you have the means to support yourself and your family. Sure you can live off the government, but it is not the same as being capable of supporting yourself without the help. As for woman being less good of a partner if she is more ""concerned for her career than family"", why can't the same be said about the guy? Finally, why can't a woman multitask (take care of the family and have a job to support the family)?

As for the obesity point, obesity is partially genetic. So if someone is born ""obsess"", why should the society be putting them down. They did not ask to be born that way and if they can't change it completely, they should still get to feel like a part of the society. We should be helping those people too and encourage them to focus on things that they can change (make a difference in world in other ways). 

Those are my 2 cents. And I don't see your point in writing the part about the people you consider smart. ",1522541247

Send a text back to FFIL saying ""hey, there is so much that is hard to convey over text so give us a call and we can talk, no problem!"". This way if it is him - you will know but aren't being disrespectful to him with a text like that. If it isn't him.....well call FFIL tomorrow and just say ""we wanted to clear the air since you didn't call last night after the text you sent."" He'll be confused as to what text and you (being the smart cookie you are) will have the screenshot of the text from his number, and can explain what happened. You can even say ""if you're upset with me, please let me know. I have alot of respect for you and want you to know that you can always come to me and talk if you're upset about something I've said or done"". 

Doing it this way will 1) get her caught without it looking like you are trying to start shit, 2) show FFIL that you are an adult and will handle things the way an adult should - by talking it out in a mature and respectful manner, and 3) enable you to point out just how immature she is behaving, because you and FDH are behaving like mature adults and the woman who is twice your age is acting like a spoilt teenager.",1522541259

I produced for fun in FL Studio for the better part of a decade... and eventually when I bought a mic and started recording people the problems started adding up quick.

You get good by grinding through each problem one by one. Sometimes it's technique related, sometimes it's a new plugin you need.. 

After solving hundreds of those problems, you go into each new track knowing how to avoid that stuff from the get-go.. and that's when it gets fun.

For me, I know I have the knowledge to create amazing tracks... but I lack some of the things I need to get to what I have in my head.

I need a new Laptop, because my current machine just can't handle all the plugins and processing I like to do anymore.

I need to buy Monitoring speakers. The Yamaha NS10s are considered the standard of the industry. Some day maybe I will buy them.. but maybe not. I mix with Sennheiser headphones and for the most part I've learned how to work around the problems that arise using cans instead of speakers.

The larvae do not bite or sting, but some people are sensitive or allergic to their shed hairs, which may provoke an itchy rash or bumps that resemble bug bites. Also, the larvae are protein feeders. No big deal when they're munching away on detritus such as dead bugs, hair, skin flakes, pet hair and dander, or pet food - but they can be destructive when they devour your preserved insect collection or taxidermied animals, or start munching away on your wool clothes, blankets, carpets, or upholstery.",1522541271

"OSHA","t5_2y3wz","they have kevlar gloves made specifically for chainsaw use but I have no experience with them.  I am always weary of using gloves while using tools with rotating parts.  I am a construction safety guy so this is a pretty common issue for me.  

My first job had a 100% glove policy and we had two recordable injuries and both would have been prevented had the employees NOT been wearing gloves.  Both employees made mistakes that didn't help anything but the gloves were definitely a factor.

The first guy was using a dril with a 3/4"" paddle bit to drill through plywood.  He had his left hand pretty much on the shaft of the paddle bit guiding it while getting it to bite (you're not supposed to do that per safety policies.. your non-trigger hand is supposed to be on the handle that screws into the side of the drill, but hardly anyone follows those policies.. it just bites you in the ass when something like this happens).  Anyways.. his gloves gets caught on the the very top of the paddle bit and sucks his finger in, ripping some skin off the top of his finger.  He had to get stitches due to the skin being so messed up and getting stitches is one of the criteria that makes an injury recordable.  That is why there has been a lot of advancement in wound closing technology to avoid stitches(butterfly strips, glues, etc).  Recordables raise insurance rates so companies will do almost anything to avoid getting one!

The other injury was a guy got his finger sucked into a skilsaw blade by his glove.  He obviously had his hand to close to the point of contact with the blade and the plywood but the glove sucked it in and made it worse.  He was lucky to not lose a finger.

The first injury i dont think would have happened at all if it wasn't for the glove and the second guy would have just had a scratch rather than a cut to the bone on the tip of his finger.  These are just my opinions of course.

At the end of the day, I don't think blanket policies like ""100% gloves policy"" are a good idea because each task presents different hazards.  Just saying ""wear them all the time"" is a cop out so you don't have to truly evaluate the task for the hazards.  Any supervisor who cares about his employees should be doing that evaluation regardless of the company policies.",1522541272

"cardfightvanguard","t5_2tcbx","I keep seeing this and it's just not true at all. Considering the New V-era units all universally powercreeped everything in g-era and before I really doubt they had any intention of curbing powercreep. If they DID then we would have gone back to the power level of the older sets but instead we've got more efficient units with high shield and power and better triggers. This is just flat out wrong.

There was no gameplay need for a reset, Powercreep continues as bad as ever. I think the reset is purely because Vanguard's popularity has waned and Nostalgia sells plus a hard reboot encourages new blood. All that put together and they're essentially releasing a new game they can market cleanly with appeal to new and old customers for profit.

This is not about powercreep, this is about boosting sales.",1522541273

Those are the millions. Look at Call of Duty. 3 years of the 'jetpack era' pretty much wiped clean all the veteran and old school players. I played throughout and noticed it more and more. Most people said 'Infinite Warfare' was the nail in the coffin. Not to mention these games also brought in heavy mictrotransactions. Despite all this COD WW2 released and was the biggest entertainment release of the year, biggest digital release in history and sold the most units of any COD on initial release. You might say the scenarios are different but they have the same grounding. The majority of people will buy on release. Most people dont want to miss out on the hype of the games release and however bad it may be the first month will always be fun. ",1522541273

That is indeed correct.

And the customers who disagree with these collaborating manufactures are going to spend their money elsewhere.  The customers that get pissed off are going to boycott.

This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.

&gt; It really shouldn't be hard to understand that the NRA is not the authoritative voice of all gun owners in the US.

Of course not ALL.  But they are an authoritative voice for SOME of them.  Lots of gun owners support the NRA.  And those gun owners are willing to use their money to engage in a boycott, in order to supports their beliefs.

History proved that those people who support the NRA are indeed a large amount of people, as proved by the fact that they bankrupted Smith and Wesson.

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","Fun fact! Most people don't know how to knife fight properly.  You generally don't wanna stab, you wanna slash.  That means, don't hold it with the blade on the thumb side, but rather [on the pinkie side, sharp part facing out](https://www.knifeplanet.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/holding-a-bowie-knife.jpg), hand close to your body with your non-dominant hand out in a protective stance.

This allows you to make a great sweeping slash motion, and with a twist of the wrist bring it back the opposite way if possible.  By keeping the knife close to your body, your attacker cannot attempt to disarm you without entering your striking range, and if he attempts to strike you, you can ward off the blow with your free hand before stepping forward for the attack.

Slashes are preferred over stabs because they are effective with glancing contact, maximize the area of flesh injured, maximize the amount of blood loss, and don't lead to the possibility of your weapon ending up stuck in the enemy--potentially allowing him to gain control of the weapon and inflicting injury on you before he has the chance to succumb to his own injuries.

I'm sure it could be made into a GREAT game if you invest the time and money necessary. :)
I got a few questions, though:

1) Do you plan on changing the UI? I feel like the UI is not polished enough and should be a bit more...Clean, to say the least, like the WoW/Battlerite ones.

2) What are the classes, races, etc? Will you have to play with specific characters or will you be able to create your own?

3) Assuming the anwser to the second question is the latter, will there be a transmogrification system like in WoW?

About the third question, I'm sure people would love if rating gave you rewards. Like in WoW (using the same numbers): 2k for Elite Transmog, 2.2k for a Tabard of some sort, 2.4k for beautiful Enchants/Illusions or something like that. :) 

Also, if there will be cosmetic PvP rewards, please make them as beautiful and eye-catching as possible!!! :)

"COMPLETEANARCHY","t5_397x6","A spook is an idea which takes control of an individual's unique essence. When someone believes in private property rights, they could be starving, and they would not steal food to survive - even though that would serve their interests. When someone believes god hates gay people, they will stifle every homoerotic desire they feel - even though gratifying those desires would feel good.

The basic structure of these examples is present in nearly every social construct and ideological edifice; morality, rights, the revolution, anarch**ism**, identity, race, gender, nationalism, God, even the idea of ""the individual"" can if not consistent with the momentary self, stifle the individual. 

The common reply to those who haven't read Stirner is the idea that ""avoiding spooks is a spook"". The counterargument here is that if one can live entirely in each present moment, and maintain the creative individual force to *create their own value and meaning from nothing*, without precedent, they will achieve the highest state of *ownness* conceivable. For Stirner, ownness is superior to mere ""freedom"" because freedom means so little if one is unable to articulate their own unique essence and meaning. 

To some extent, it is inevitable that students of Stirner will inflect Nietzsche's ideas into the mix, simply because they are so similar. Whether or not Stirner influenced Nietzsche is indeterminable as it stands today (and whether or not Stirner was the nom de guerre of Engels is also debatable).",1522541277

I don't like cellshade coloring style usually, and like when artists can blend and highlight in a painterly fashion.

A lot of my favorite artists are for otome games. I think their designs for guys and girls are really good. I'd pay for a galge of otomate's heroines since most their designs are cuter than a good half of bishoujo game characters out there. Some of my favorite artists are Satoi, Mai Hanamura, Miwashiba (Ayakashi Akashi is a VN and 1bitheart is on vndb so let me include them since they're my favorite artist in general wheeze) Sayori, Nanaka Mai, Satchely, doomfist, Chikotam, Rosuuri, Namie (I've been a fan of Namie for awhile, so seeing her do art for a yuri game is like a dream), batensan, Saeki Nao, Teita, Kuroyuki and Kinami Yuki. Bonus points go to if artists have a unique eye style or do great original coloring styles. I also like on the character designer side artists that aren't afraid to do weird hairstyles rather than stick to the stereotypical styles used for most characters in every game.

Moving back in with your Nrents will undo the progress you've made in building up your confidence; they will sabotage you and blame you for any opportunities they mess up, citing it as proof that you can't handle the real world, or aren't good enough. You  need to be in a supportive environment; and even if you lived in a single dorm and binge-watched Netflix in your pajamas, it would be more supportive than being verbally and emotionally abused by your Nrents (I'm taking for granted that you would've already left your abusive nboyfriend in this scenario.).

Finish your degree; make friends on campus; get involved in the activities; and just enjoy college. Because you deserve to. 

Your mental health will only get worse if you stay with either your abusive nboyfriend or abusive nrents. Even take student loans if you have to. If I could do it over, I would have taken out loans and moved out. My Nrents prolonged and worsened my mental illnesses. I was supposed to ""save money"" on rent and living expenses while getting psychiatric help and finishing my degree. I think you can guess how that turned out. 

Don't let them scare you that you're not capable of handling it. You've made it through three years of university with abusive Nrents, and now an abusive nboyfriend. I'm sure there have been other horror stories and struggles you haven't shared. You are strong, and you can handle ""the real world.""

As far as romantic relationships go, I would advise waiting until you've recovered from this nightmare before dating again, because you want to keep your guard up. You can't do that when you're still licking your wounds. From personal experience, I've been hurt worse by opportunistic abusers who swooped in while I was vulnerable. Don't let anyone pressure you with the BS: ""the best way to get over a relationship is to start dating again."" No. That's how you get hurt again. The best way is to build yourself up with self-care, take time to heal, explore hobbies, make friends, and gain confidence in yourself. Then when you meet another N, you'll spot the red flags immediately, and tell him/her/them to get lost, because you'll know your boundaries and that you deserve to be treated better.

Phew! Okay, sorry for the novella, but I didn't want to post without urging you to seek counselling for your suicidal thoughts. Two months ago is very recent. Please provide an update on how you are currently feeling and whether you can keep yourself safe (both because of the suicidal thoughts and also because your boyfriend is a scary dude), so the sub can advise you further.

How about Finland?  
Freedom House (a US Government-funded non-governmental organization that conducts research and advocacy on democracy, political freedom, and human rights) made a Freedom in the World-study and ended up with Finland being the top most free country in the world.  
Australia was #6.  
The US was #28.

This is because the area of the brain used to interoperate visual stimulus had been repurposed for other things like touch, and smell (When one sense is lost the others grow stronger). 

Coming back to the universe, do naturals develop these kind of pathways? If so are their other senses weakened? Do the surgery always succeed, or are there cases like the blind man listed above. Do naturals develop synesthesia?

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","You've turned it on its head. The treasuries you speak of aren't debt for the private sector. They're quite literally the opposite. They're assets. A treasury is just a form of dollar(with a term, and a coupon - they're basically a savings account of the US government). 

The US government cannot, by definition, be in real debt. It's the issuer of its own currency. It can create an unlimited amount of dollars out of thin air in mere seconds with a few keystrokes and mouse-clicks.

&gt; Every dollar printed has debt attached to it, and that debt falls to every citizen

That's nonsensical. What was the last time you paid off any debt that ""printing"" incurred on you, or paid off interest on this debt?

&gt; Every dollar printed has debt attached to it, and that debt falls to every citizen. When the government seeks funds from the FED banking system, every single dollar has debt attached to it.

You know, the Gold Standard was killed by Nixon. The modern fiat monetary system works in a completely different way. The US government doesn't print money to fund spending, nor does it seek money from the Fed(the Fed doesn't print money either - it only sets the price of money).

The sentence, ""when the government seeks funds..."", is ridiculous. It makes no sense. Why would the government seek funds? The government creates them, out of thin air. The government doesn't borrow money, it does not seek it out. When the government wants to pay for a good or service, it goes to the bank account of the provider of that good or service and types in a number, let's say $10,000,000, and that $10,000,000 is spent into existence. 

Let's make it even simpler. Let's explain what it's meant when people say that Japan or China or Germany own American government debt. First, they produce goods, and then export them to America, where these goods are sold for dollars. Japan/China/Germany now have dollars in their bank accounts. They use those dollars to buy US treasury bonds(a type of dollar that pays interest), so the Fed takes their dollars and moves them from a reserve bank account to a securities account. That's not debt...that's exactly like you or I moving dollars from a checking to a savings account. But for some inane reason, people call this debt as if the antiquated gold standard wasn't killed generations ago.

National debt isn't national debt. It's national savings. It's all US bucks ever issued by the government, from the foundation of the country up until this moment, that have never been taxed away and taken back by the government. These treasuries don't finance government spending, their only utility is to act as risk-free interest-bearing savings accounts and to drain excess reserves from the banking system. The US government could abolish them literally tomorrow and find another way to fulfill the same functions, which would probably be more efficient, but it doesn't due to institutional inertia. 

&gt; There isn't enough money in circulation to pay the debt owed.

Dude, go to the Treasury website and open the Daily Treasury Statement. The US government redeems(i.e ""pays back"") around 95 trillion dollars every year in bills, notes, bonds and other securities. The 20 trillion ""national debt"" isn't a particularly big figure. ",1522541286

Men who are open to dating women unlike those they’re dated before and willing to kiss a few frogs to find a princess.  Men who don’t feel lonely every time they’re alone.

Subjectively you can get some pretty far flung answers about the Trump administration.  Some love the guy regardless of how bad it gets, some hate him even if the policy makes sense.  

But when we look at this administration objectively, we see things we’ve never seen before.  Aside from policy changes.  The high rate of turnover is something we’ve never seen.  The amount of vacant positions is something we’ve never seen. The fact that there are people in the White House that can’t pass a security clearance is staggering.  People being walked out of the WH without their jacket because they are being investigated for financial crimes is heinous. 

And that’s before we get to the investigations and law suits.  Currently there is a special council investigation into the Presidents campaign, a FBI investigation into the AG, a FEC investigation into the presidents campaign, a civil suit about paying a porn star hush money, a sexual harassment suit against the President by a playboy bunny, and 3 or 4 emoluments clause law suits in various states.

Ram temple and cow was not even supposed to be part of debate. It has nothing to do with population and revenue sharing.

"ACMilan","t5_2rnmt","&gt; Jack's dedication is there but since that resurgence under Gattuso he has stagnated and been pretty poor for 5 or 6 games now. 

He's been poor for some games now, but it's not since the resurgence under Gattuso. Jack also had a very good period under Gattuso. He's scored 5 goals since Gattuso took over for example, which is very good for a midfielder (even an attacking one), and I believe that makes him our second only to Cutrone for most goals under Gattuso (Suso scored more in total under Montella and Gattuso). There was a lot of talk about Jack when we started to win under Gattuso, as one of the key factors to our success that Jack was doing so well, before guys like Bonucci and Biglia really got into top gear.

So sure, I expect more from him than he's shown lately, but it's going to take a whole lot more games than this for me to think it's anything other than a run of bad form. If we had good options in his role in the squad then that would be great, we could rotate Jack out and play him sparingly when his form was poor.

However you see some Milan fans talk about Jack like he's finished, that he's not good enough anymore. I don't at all understand how people can say that when his best period of the season was going on in December-February. He's basically been in poor form for maybe 4-6 weeks, but we've played so many games in that period I guess people think it's been ages? It's kinda absurd.",1522541290

Opening match was weird but kinda fun, Kelly/Morgan was MOTN and one of the best women's matches/matches in general I've seen this year, the Graces had a great hoss match, I crashed really bad tiredness-wise after the interval to the point that Jetta is now my third favourite woman in wrestling and I can't explain why, my exhausted mind just decided she's queen, Wolf/Jayne was really great and the main was a really fun clusterfuck.

Matchwise, as I've indicated, it was fucking great. However, logistically the show was less impressive, to the point I probably won't go back to the ResGal unless the card is amazing. The biggest problem was the twenty-five minute overrun, which given it was a late show I feel is totally unacceptable: I couldn't really enjoy the second half of the show, especially the main event, because I was worried about getting the last train home, and I missed out on merch which really bummed me out. A show advertised to end at 11 ending at half 11 is not on. The owners, whilst they were funny, talked a little too much for my taste: I know Jim Smallman can go on a bit at times, but for the most part unless he has something important to say he'll run through the announcements quickly and snappily, whereas the Reads went on a bit too long before each match for me. I didn't have a problem with the chant explanation, because EVE targets first-timers who may not know how wrestling crowds work, but even with that understood, way too much talking for me. The venue was way too cramped for my taste too, and the crowd were extremely obnoxious at times, again for my taste.

Overall though, I had a good time, and I'll still go to Queendom. The really big takeaway for me is that, between wXw and last night, the BritWres scene needs more Killer Kelly, because holy shit is she great, she's like a cross between Millie McKenzie and Ilja Dragunov and I want to see her in PROGRESS (obviously they were going to have her at 65, but she needs to make a debut soon), Riptide, Fight Club, all that shit. The other big one is that Charlie Morgan is criminally underutilized in a heel role, she should be a face everywhere, and she's clearly putting in like 20% as a heel in PROGRESS compared to her 100% in EVE, where she's amazing.",1522541291

"totalwar","t5_2rq9c","In warhammer sieges are from one direction, and the towers can shoot infinite range. Which forces the tactic to basically be either CHARGE ALL IN, or do something cheesy to abuse areas of cover. But basically its charge all in. All units can climb walls (towers) and/or destroy gates.

In say Rome or Medieval 2 or Shogun 2 or Rome 2 you could surround the entire settlement. It was 360 degree. And towers were not infinite range death machines, just short range ones. In Rome and Medieval 2 you actually had to build ladders if you wanted them. Units COULD NOT attack gates in Rome and Medieval 2 as well.

Basically, in warhammer the one and only encouraged tactic is ""bum rush"". In previous titles the tactics amounted to slowly working and worming your way into the city. And the center of the settlement was a ""last stand"" area where the enemy was immune to routing which you would have to work to and slowly kill them.

The distance from the sniper doesn't matter. The context does. If this were a man ""running away"" to give guns to the protestors, and those protestors had already used guns against the Israelis, would you be condemning sniping the runner? If not, then our difference lies in recognizing he dangers of rolling a burning tire at someone. So let me ask you, would you consider it an assault if a group of thousands of protestors were on the other side of a fence, and they were rolling flaming tires at you? At what point is it an assault? Once they actually hit you? And remember, the Israelis had already exhausted nonlethal weapons such as tear gas and rubber bullets. ",1522541293

Let It Be, Long and Winding Road, Across the Universe, and Get Back are classics (although I do prefer the lengthened single version of Get Back). Two of Us is really good too, and so is I've Got a Feeling, and I think One After 909 is one of the most underrated Beatles songs. Don't really care for Maggie Mae or Dig It at all, and I'm not a huge fan of For You Blue either, but I like the rest of it.",1522541294

"Physics_AWT","t5_329oc","[Econophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econophysics) is an interdisciplinary research field, applying theories and methods originally developed by physicists in order to solve problems in economics, usually those including uncertainty or stochastic processes and nonlinear dynamics. 

Stochastic behavior, like the Brownian motion of particles in a fluid, can be understood with so-called kinetic theory. In this approach, one starts with a model of microscopic interactions (or collisions) and builds that into a macroscopic framework. The end result is an equation, such as the Boltzmann or Langevin equation, that describes the evolution of particle position, temperature, or some other large-scale statistical variable. Econophysicists have tried to develop a kinetic theory for financial systems, but they’ve lacked data on the microscopic behavior of individual traders.

Kiyoshi Kanazawa, from the Tokyo Institute of Technology tracked the behavior of traders, both in their “bids” (buying price) and “asks” (selling price). The traders submit orders every few seconds, but a transaction only occurs when one trader’s ask price matches another’s bid price. Kanazawa et al. found that traders responded to each transaction by adjusting their bid/ask prices in accordance with changes in the market transaction price. They modeled this “trend following” and showed how it led to a Boltzmann-like equation for the overall price movement. This macroscopic equation could reproduce large-scale observations of the foreign exchange market.

"Amd","t5_2rw0n","Actually the CPU frequency is not that important for gaming as most think - there was multiple tests where Ryzen and Coffelake and Skylake was downclocked to around 3GHz, and the intel CPUs were still ahead, the main difference between the platforms was RAM latency, which is much better on Coffe/SkyLake, the Skylake-X X299 platform has the same issue as Ryzen - cant match those CPUs in RAM latency, thus they are worse in most games even when at same frequencies. 

However one of the improvements of the Zen+ CPUs is seemingly lower RAM latency, so this can actually improve things better as the clock speed itself for gaming.
I doubt they will match up in latency with the Intel *Lake CPUs, but they will get closer, while still retaining superiority in multi-threaded applications, which also improve overall responsiveness and smoothens of the system.",1522541294
