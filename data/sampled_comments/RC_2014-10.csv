These are all personal attacks.

I don't think it needs as much ""modern technology"" as you suggest.  This is also why I think pulling up technologies of the past, things that worked doing similar things to what will be needed on Mars, will likely be needed.  Ignoring those ideas and concepts in favor of systems that will easily break down and require a supply chain from the Earth is going to be far more dangerous than simply using systems that may require more manual labor but can be made from basic local materials.

BTW, this is the philosophy that is being used in the design of the Inspiration Mars mission.  They are purposely including systems that may not have so much in the way of advanced electronics and technology in favor of things that may require some physical labor to operate but can be fixed in space with few parts or even machined on the spot.  Life support systems in particular are being made in a way to also occupy the time of the crew so they are in effect an integral part of the system.

I anticipate it will be that way on Mars too.

Besides, I think you are too dismissive of the technology of the 19th Century.  They weren't exactly cavemen scratching their behinds with their stone flint axes.  Railroads, steamships, telegraphs, and even a digital computer was built using that technology.  They also had at the time the ability to take some basic tools and move into a wilderness to create whole new cities in a matter of just a few years using local resources, which is a skill that hasn't really been needed since.  I think there is a thing or two we could learn from our ancestors about how they did that.","1412121603"

The problem here is that Crescent Bay is essentially feature-complete.  DK1 to DK2 was as revolutionary as you described because DK1 was lacking so many necessary features for good VR.  Now that most of the missing pieces are in place, we will only see incremental improvements in the headset itself.  Eye tracking and foveated rendering are a couple of features that could elevate CV2 over CV1, but they aren't as fundamentally important as something like positional tracking or low persistence.

The tick-tock development cycle mainly applies to chip makers who march to the beat of Moore's Law.  Coincidentally, that's where you should be looking for the next ""revolutionary jump"" in VR.

&gt;It was well known that producers (a game industry position, roughly equivalent to PMs) had to make a change to everything that was done. The assumption was that subconsciously they felt that if they didn't, they weren't adding value.

&gt;The artist working on the queen animations for Battle Chess was aware of this tendency, and came up with an innovative solution. He did the animations for the queen the way that he felt would be best, with one addition: he gave the queen a pet duck. He animated this duck through all of the queen's animations, had it flapping around the corners. He also took great care to make sure that it never overlapped the ""actual"" animation.

&gt;Eventually, it came time for the producer to review the animation set for the queen. The producer sat down and watched all of the animations. When they were done, he turned to the artist and said, ""that looks great. Just one thing - get rid of the duck.""

"anime","t5_2qh22","Uh, it's not meant to be funny. It's actually a kind of depressing song about a hikikomori feeling shut off from the rest of the world and would rather live life as 'human baby' to not suffer everything that an adult has to go through and that everyone should do the same as not to be hurt by others. This is flawed in it self and only continues a cycle of a hikikomori. The whole song basically sums up 'Welcome to the NHK' and how the main character feels. The song is just done with a quirky sound. Example of the lyrics:

When humans are born naked everyone is loved the same
Why then is it that during our lives
Our fates are divided in a most cruel way

Some look people in the eyes, others are not seen, some know love, others don't
If that's the case I would rather be a baby until I die - a baby human

""Oh what a cute baby! He makes me want to love him!""
(All according to plan!) (That went great!)

The baby she hold is actually a baby human
Behind that innocent face he is snickering inside
You should be one too! It's nice and easy! Baby human
Ababa ababa, dance, multiply, and then world domination!
Conquer Russia, Canada, and India too

They don't do what I say, even though I'm the king, she doesn't look at me, even though I am her lover
Why is reality like this? Do we even need truth?

I pretended to laugh it all away, but the day I was told that was impossible
I decided I have no choice, but to be a baby until death - a baby human","1412121614"

"xboxone","t5_2xbci","I think the extent of Windows 10 opportunities for Xbox One will lie in the OS that handles the apps, the Kernel. This would allow for the develop for one platform, deploy on all devices approach they're wanting to go with along with a shared app store.

For the Xbox OS itself and how that translates into what will be done with the home screen, pins and the customisation in general, I think that's specific to the Xbox One at the moment. Even if it isn't, I don't see this drastically changing the Xbox One interface just because it doesn't make sense.

Background colours and images might be added, tiles may gain additional functionality for live tiles and resizing pins, all of which would be nice but this doesn't have anything to do with Windows 10. They could do this now and they are probably going to start (if they aren't already) working on some of these features to implement in a monthly update at some point.

There's lots of exciting potentials for Microsoft's approach to apps with Windows 10 along with it being a single OS that scales for the device it's on. That will allow MS to build up an ecosystem that may bring more users to more of their platforms. It will also likely solve the problem on all MS devices of there not being many apps to choose from.

This definitely does affect the Xbox One in some form though. I grabbed [this](http://i.gyazo.com/721afda093e998a3c57fcccc69b6d82f.png) screenshot of from their [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=84NI5fjTfpQ#t=197) of when they showed the OneNote app for a second in their Windows 10 event today and that suggests we'll be hearing some news soon. Others have noticed this but I've yet to see a screenshot of it so I thought I'd do that.

I'm pretty excited to see what comes of all this but I'd keep my expectations tempered for how this applies to the Xbox One. There's no point setting ourselves up for disappointment.","1412121616"

Yes. It was fraud. But she wasn't pretending to be someone else. Asking for ID would have shown that she was who she said she was.

&gt; However, I would imagine that a voter ID would have an address or voting district on it and could probably prevent people from either registering illegally or voting illegally in the manner she did.

No state has a voter ID of that sort. No state even has a voter ID. Driver's licenses or other forms of ID are used.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I respectfully disagree. If men and women were 100% equal, male disposability would only be an issue to the exact same extent that female disposability would be, and the same would apply to every other issue. I don't agree that ""egalitarianism acknowledges both sides of the issue whereas feminism can have a very polarizing effect."" I think the word ""egalitarianism"" is often just a cop-out or a way to avoid the negative stereotypes around the word ""feminism"". 

I'm not trying to make it into a feminism vs. MRA thing at all. I'm trying to say gender quality is not a result that means women are better off than men, because by definition that wouldn't be equality. Feminism focuses on the female perspective because today, and even more so historically, women are the more disadvantaged sex overall, even if there are some areas where men suffer from sexism. The goal of feminism is still gender quality. It emphasizes women for historical and practical reasons, not because the goal is to replace a patriarchal system with a matriarchal one. ","1412121619"

"Seireitei","t5_2w82b","Zemaiah tapped on the scabbard of his straight-edged, European-like zanpakuto as he listened to Shinya talk about his decisions. Although he didn't get into further detail, and was rather vague like his former captain was on what exactly happened, Zemaiah had already decided beforehand that being on the fence about issues regarding the Gotei was not effective and that he would have to choose sides sooner or later.

He had already left Panda to her duties and reassured her that he didn't need any help. Now it was time to choose a path. He removed his face mask and gazed at Shinya with gleaming, emerald-green eyes seemingly piercing into Shinya's soul.

""You may recognize me; you may not, but I when I returned to Seireitei after dealing with issues in the World of the Living, I realized that I didn't belong anymore.""

He kneeled onto the ground and bowed his head.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","BTW (just started watching so I don't know if this is mentioned in the episode) the Octium 4 chip (besides the name being a play on the Pentium 4, released late 2000) is probably based on a real chip released by the NSA called the [Clipper chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip). Basically if a telecom company used these chips, every key they generated and programmed into a chip for use by a customer had to be handed over to the government. Then:

&gt; If government agencies ""established their authority"" to listen to a communication, then the key would be given to those government agencies, who could then decrypt all data transmitted by that particular telephone.

So the NSA has free access to all the keys, and in all likelihood the NSA, not the courts, would be the one who decided whether an agency's request was adequately ""established"". The chip turned out to be shitty encryption-wise, but the NSA still tried to force it on telecom companies until there was a huge backlash and the chip was scrapped. It did encourage people to make strong open source encryption packages, like PGP, available to render the clipper chip obsolete before it ever saw any use.

Of course the NSA managed to attain their goal of freely spying on US citizens regardless, but it did set them back several years.","1412121624"

"MCFC","t5_2s14k","I was stuck by Liverpool fans...but here's the catch- this was inside of the ""manchester city supporters section"". We paid $100 per ticket instead of $35 to be sat inside of what was called the manchester city supporters section. We called the company after asking if they know what a ""supporters section"" means but they said ""this is america, not Europe. We can't control who sits where"" and the stadium was maybe 50 to 1 in favor of Liverpool fans literally dead serious. With that ratio I wasn't surprised at all the city supporters section was filled 75% with Liverpool fans. Bottom line is Americans fuck just about everything they possibly can up dealing with the sport I've always loved.

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","This is honestly a question only you can answer. You need to realistically ask yourself if you think you have what it takes to turn this into a living. If you truly feel you're talented enough and just need the time to make a name for yourself, go for it. But a college education won't hurt you (unless it puts you in debt, of course). I've been in your spot, but I'm fortunate enough to have a mom who will bust her ass to put me through college so I don't end up in debt. And I'm not gonna waste the opportunity for a free education.  
  
I have told myself and others on multiple occasions that if I had to pay for my own college, I probably would have dropped out and just focused on music a few years ago.  
  
But this question is a super grey area thing. Some people have dropped out of college and been extremely successful in music and some people have college degrees and have been extremely successful in music. The opposite is also true (i.e. an utter lack of success).  
  
So really, you just have to ask yourself if you think it'd be worth it. I'm finishing up my last year and I can't wait to be done so I can just completely focus on music. But I'm still glad I went to college, if not for anything more than the experience.","1412121634"

&gt; 115.2. There are seven special actions:  
115.2a Playing a land is a special action. To play a land, a player puts that land onto the battlefield from the zone it was in (usually that player’s hand). By default, a player can take this action only once during each of his or her turns. A player can take this action any time he or she has priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of his or her turn.

So while older cards said ""play"" for everything, nowadays the correct term is ""cast"" for spells and ""play"" for lands. You never cast lands, thus you can play lands around Godsend's ability because you're not casting them, since it's just stopping you from ""casting"" them.","1412121646"

Your muscle's ""memories"" are triggered by what you hear on a second-to-second basis.  All of these motions have to be adjusted on the fly by your brain, something that takes feedback from hearing yourself.  On top of this, playing to live music 100% means you need to hear yourself as a live band rarely plays in perfect time.  

All this aside, you really are just hating on her.  Defending Courtney Love is the last thing I thought I would be doing in this thread, but it's so obvious that she is putting on a show in this video and not even attempting to play.  She knows no one can hear her, makes no attempts to sound good, and people like you are trying to use this as an example of her ineptitude.

"classiccars","t5_2t1di","Corvair's are cool cars. Don't listen to people badmouthing their handling characteristics, especially the '65-'69's. The reason so many early examples crashed had more to do with the fact that Americans didn't have a friggin clue how to drive a rear-engined car (keep in mind that Beetle's and Porsche's were still were fairly uncommon in the early 60's). It's a *completely* different driving experience. Besides, by the time Nader's [book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_at_Any_Speed) came out, the rear suspension had already been updated to be a bit friendlier to the average US consumer, but the damage had been done, reputation wise... In any case, the real problem with Corvair's are finding parts and then having to empty your wallet to pay for them. 

If you're into mid 60's Chevy styling, you could always go with a '62-'74 [Nova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Chevy_II_/_Nova). There's a *huge* aftermarket, prices are affordable, they're easy to work on and the cars themselves can be had fairly reasonably if you look hard enough.

It's like saying ""oh it's easy to lose weight, just upreg your metabolism and run a temp of 101 for a few days.  The fat will melt away. ""

You can't do that, because your body regulates metabolism and temperature. 

But for a lot of people who can't lose weight, their body's ""nutrition"" thermostat is defective for some reason.  Yes, they're eating too much.  But if it were really as simple as ""eat less"", they wouldn't be fat.  The issue is their body is telling them to eat more than they need.  (which is where your thermodynamics comes into play).  When your body wants food and you're around food, it's really really hard to resist.  

But the goal is to reset that thermostat in order to then lose weight.

In less than a day, the most advanced civilization of the ancient world had perished.

The layers of *pollutantus literati* and *pollutantus gravitas* that covered the continent hardened into rock, and knowledge of the ""lost"" civilization almost vanished entirely. Interest was revived briefly about six hundred years ago with the discovery of fragments from a series of writings attributed to the late-twentieth-century Franco-Italian traveler guido michelin (no relation to the Anglo-Italian traveler guido Blue). The meaning of the few legible symbols, mostly stars in various groupings, could not be deciphered, and the matter was eventually dropped.

Four hundred years later a young and ambitious archeologist named Currant Bunliffe had a revelation. ""The suddenness of the catastrophe,"" he wrote in one of his notebooks, ""combined with the subsequent solidification of the surreptitious substance (*pollutantus aliterati*) has probably preserved, intact, a moment of history."" He immediately informed his colleagues at THE UNIVERSITY that he was going to search for fragments of that moment. He was never seen again.

Since 3850 hundreds of scholars and souvenir-hunters have chipped away at the continent's alluring crust. Although North America has not given up her secrets easily, a number of significant discoveries have been made.

First things first: *the artist is putting themselves out there, too.* It's one thing to sit at home and trace anime characters into a sketchbook no one will ever see. It's another to go to a room full of other artists, some who are probably waaaaay better than you, and have the audacity to claim that you belong there.

Everyone's there to improve their craft. When you pose in front of them, judgment on your beauty or character goes right out the window, and is replaced with abstraction, and probably a hell of a lot of negative self-talk and doubt: ""Eh, I put that eye too far from the nose. I messed up the arm, and now it's throwing the entire thing off, crap crap crap!"" In short, you're no longer a person. You're just a really difficult set of lines, value, and form that has to be somehow translated onto a 2D sheet of dead tree.

Those that aren't there to improve are quickly found out and expelled. I've never had it happen to me while I was monitoring, but we do have procedures for handling oglers, and we encourage our models to bring up *anything* that may make them uncomfortable.

This includes temperature. :) Many studios have portable heaters that can be set up around the model to keep them toasty warm, and if they don't, they should be constantly pressured into purchasing one!

In the end, your largest worry will probably be holding the pose. It's harder than it looks, but remember you can always request breaks, and we can tape off your silhouette so you can return to the exact same pose once you've stretched your everything.

In short, go for it! We always love having new models!","1412121656"

"gay","t5_2qhef","It says that but the whole point of jesus on the cross was to die for your sins so you can get to heaven. (Unless you don't subscribe to that belief) It says these sins and more are ungodly and wont be entered into the kingdom of heaven. Thats why jesus was sent to be the ultimite sacrifice. Through him I believe everyone can get to heaven no matter what the sin. 

as much as I back up that it is a sin, I do not think you go to hell for it if you really except jesus but I do believe that a gay relationship adds a life time of sins automatically and I do believe we as christians should try to avoid it as best we can. No one is perfect but you can always try to please god and he will reward you in return for your effort. It says if you do it his way he will give you all you need to be happy in the bible.

I don't hate myself but I really hate my situation. I don't think people can help but I think god can if we are willing to do it his way. It saddens me to believe his way of helping is to maybe help me cope with being alone but who knows, I don't know his ways but he promises happiness. 

I am doing just that and I know what you mean. In my prayers I get so worked up I vocally ask why me, cause I feel like i am not strong enough to avoid what everyone in this society is looking for most. I feel to weak to but I am trying. I once heard that god will never challenge you with something that you can't handle. You can continue to live how you want, I don't think you are hell bound but remember what gets you to heaven (unless you dont believe in the crusifixion the way I do) and don't give up hope. Which is weird coming from me cause I feel like I have but its also never to late to live the way you want for god.

You can be both I believe which I know is hard to by because if you are in a certain mindset, you can't just change but maybe think about it? See if it adds up to your beliefs and if not thats fine. Ill pray for you, again I think you will go to heaven if you have a true relationship with christ. We all can.

I just can't believe you are living life thinking you are going to hell. Thats horrible. Please PLEASE if u want to know my side more on this please let me know. It bothers me to know that someone could go through life knowing it will end in hell.

Having unclean hands spreads disease, and having smelly hands is unpleasant for you and others.

But generally speaking, your butthole is hidden between your buttcheeks and usually has at least 2 layers of clothing separating it from the outside world. I'm not suggesting not wiping or anything ridiculous (that would be super uncomfortable and probably a good way to get a skin infection), I'm just  saying that I do hold my hands to a higher standard of cleanliness than my butthole and I don't think that's unreasonable.","1412121659"

"baseballHOF","t5_2ylcx","Yes, but if

&gt;a player is at the top of his position for 7-10 years....they are at an elite status.

Then you have guys like Roger Bresnahan (best C in the majors for the first decade of the 20th century) who are borderline at best. It's not a bad rule of thumb, but it's certainly not infallible. 

So yes, Pie was the best 3B in the majors from 1924-1934, but first, that's not in of itself a sure sign of eliteness, and second, look at his competition. Joe Sewell is tied with him in first with 33.8 fWAR, but if we remove him (since he split time between 3B and SS), then Pie is ahead of guys like Freddie Lindstrom (30.2), Willie Kamm (27.8), Woody English (25.1)...you get the idea. 3B was not a strong position then, and Pie was able to lead all 3B in fWAR during that stretch despite only putting up 33.8. 

A lot of people say that Traynor was the best 3B between Home Run Baker and Eddie Mathews, but for that ~30 year stretch, I would say that [Stan Hack](http://www.reddit.com/r/baseballHOF/comments/1vnar5/1956_rbaseball_hall_of_fame_ballot_and_discussion/cev8qc4) and [Bob Elliott](http://www.reddit.com/r/baseballHOF/comments/1v2dzn/1954_rbaseball_hall_of_fame_ballot_and_discussion/ceo7cq2) were both superior players to Traynor.

As for the quality of Courtney Love's music - I think people don't go to see her because she's an amazing musician - more because she's a ripoff of Sid Vicious and Joan Jett - but with the ""credibility"" of having been married to Kurt Cobain.

check with a lawyer on the following

* Line out the objectionable lines and then sign it. and have a copy made with a notary. In negotiating an agreement, you do not have to accept all clauses.

* send them a similar document saying that if they do not pay you in a timely fashion, that they owe triple penalties, and a similar clause to not talk bad about you.

* Contracts can not be used to cover up a crime. check with the State attorney general about something shady going on.

* Take them to some TV Judge like People's court.

Grinding, leveling, farming, skill/area gating and such are characteristics of RPGs, not necessarily MMOs. Most, if not all, MMOs use RPG elements. Even Planetside 2 which is primarily an MMOFPS game has RPG elements of progression (seriously ever since CoD4 did it everyone has to do it). Consider any modern single player RPG: Final Fantasy, Tales, Elder Scrolls, Fallout. Story and various unique mechanics notwithstanding, these games are built off of the same fundamental core mechanics which comprise of: Kill enemies &gt; gain resources &gt; use resources to become stronger &gt; kill stronger enemies. These are core RPG mechanics, not MMO mechanics. The MMO part of **MMO**RPG implies the amount of multiplayer interaction and potential social interaction the game requires of you. The RPG part of MMO**RPG** is what gives all those previously mentioned mechanics to the genre.

And yes a huge majority of games now are using RPG mechanics. But this is an different topic that could easily have it's own discussion. Personally, I think it's an easy (from a conceptual design perspective) way to add additional content and a sense of progression to what could be potentially a boring or bland mechanic. So instead of shooting a gun for 12 hours, if you shoot it for 3 hours you unlock lightning bullets! Now your bullets look and move slightly differently and we can hide how uninteresting our enemies are behind how cool it is for you kill them. (This is basically all Dynasty Warrior games btw. Which is fine, I like Dynasty Warriors but it's not exactly the Hamlet of video games.)","1412121667"

"hockey","t5_2qiel","Great move by Nill and the Stars. I think the Broncos and the CHL fight it quietly, but Honka stays in the AHL for the full year. 

Because under IIHF rules, Honka was on loan from Finland to the Broncos (and not signed by the Broncos), it basically nullifies the portion of the CHL-NHL transfer agreement that affected other players in the past. Grigorenko was signed to his QMJHL team, not on loan from the KHL.

This is similar to Nicklas Jensen and the Vancouver Canucks a few years ago. Left the Generals, played in Sweden and then played a partial season in the AHL before the time requirements from the CHL. Jensen was on loan from Sweden to the Generals. Because of this, he didn't have to play for the Generals if he played in North America. Honka is definitely going to be interesting because he isn't going to return to Finland for part of a year before moving to the AHL.

For more on IIHF loan and transfer rules, be sure to check out [the link](http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/Sport/2014_IIHF_International_Transfer_Regulations_130626.pdf).

There are all types in the church, including many who are pharisaical - I try and remember that at the heart of it, they are trying to please God. 

But they are doing it the wrong way, trying to appease with their actions - they are still bearing the burden of their sin and when we feel guilt the first thing we do is try and put the blame on others - just like Adam did. 

I do have hope for my church, because of people like you who aren't afraid to say No - its about love !

"spikes","t5_2utkz","From the KTK Release Notes:

Deflecting Palm doesn't target any creature or player. You choose a source of damage as Deflecting Palm resolves.

So yeah, you can do that. Which means it's probably not a good idea to say what you intend to DP until opponent lets it resolve. Kinda like ""O-Ring targeting your Grizzly Bears"" is a shortcut for ""Oblivion Ring, if you don't respond, the trigger will target your Grizzly Bears"".

From the MTR:

""If a player casts a spell or activates an ability and announces choices for it that are not normally made until resolution, the player must adhere to those choices unless an opponent responds to that spell or ability. If an opponent inquires about choices made during resolution, that player is assumed to be passing priority and allowing that spell or ability to resolve. ""

So for the situation above, if I say ""Deflecting Palm your Polukranos"" and you Hero's Downfall it in response, when Palm resolves I can say ""Okay, Palm resolves, choosing your Stormbreath for redirection."" However, if you don't respond, I can't say ""Palm resolves, choosing your Stormbreath"". You must adhere to the choice.

(Before I get confused replies, Palm doesn't target, so it gets around SBD's pro-white.)","1412121674"

That in itself is a serious issue, but I strongly doubt China will see any repercussions from the mayhem in Syria and Iraq.

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","I don't mean to hijack the thread, but I also have a question about the argument from motion. We went over Aquinas's first two proofs in my philosophy of religion class recently, and my professor said that there is a category error in them because if you put God at the beginning of ""things"" (movement, events) in the universe, than God must take on the qualities of those things and thus we can ask, ""What moved God? What caused God?""

I thought the point of the argument from motion was that you cannot have an infinite regression of movement because than there wouldn't be any movement at all. Isn't Aquinas saying that unless there is an unmoved mover, a starting point per say, than there is no movement? Movement is something going from A ---&gt; B, so if there is no A, just &lt;-(infinity)- B -(infinity)-&gt; is it movement at all? So asking ""What moved God?"" is missing the point of the argument, God is the unmoved mover because without him we would have an infinite regression of movement and thus no movement at all.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","The Review

Grace Walker watched her husband fold his dress shirt neatly, stacking its on top of the others, a little hill of plaids and solids pressed along the edges of his suitcase. He kept rubbing his eyes, dark shadows and creases along his lower lash line. As he rolled up his belt, she pressed her hands tightly against the suit jacket she’d bought him for their thirtieth anniversary. 

It had been nine years and three hundred and sixty four days since the last Review, and tomorrow will be Noah’s fourth, but that didn’t stop Grace from chewing at her nail beds until they bled or pore over old photo albums that had accumulated dust. 

“Maybe you should go with the gray suit,” she argued, gesturing weakly towards their closet. The bedroom was a mess: annual reports scattered along the dresser, certificates from work ripped off the walls. 

Noah looked up, his dark brows furrowing in a neat line across his forehead. Grace saw a muscle tic right above his right eyelid, a habit she’d noticed when her husband was under high stress. “I prefer black,” he replied simply. 

She crinkled her nose. “Black is what you wear to funerals.” She caught sight of her reflection in the mirror and immediately shifted her expression to the usual, vacant canvass. The wrinkles that jumped so quickly to her gaze was startling, her age beginning to show in the crow’s feet at the corners of her eyes. 

“It’s professional,” Noah said, closing his suitcase. “It’ll do.” 

“Don’t forget to mention your promotions,” Grace said quickly, “And bring the letter of reference from your boss.”

“Already packed it,” Noah said, snapping his briefcase shut. The leather was worn, scuffed on the bottom where he’d once thrown it on the subway floor, weathering through urban winters. 

Grace caught sight of the teddy bear lying on the corner of their bed. “I thought you packed Gabriel.” 

“The Board is evaluating my life for the past ten years,” Noah scowled, “I wouldn’t call Gabriel a success.” 

“Does that mean you left the birth certificate as well?” Grace strode over to their dresser and yanked the drawer open. Between the expired condoms and both their engagement rings, the birth certificate lined the bottom.

“Grace,” Noah said gently, “His fate was determined like all of us.”

Fifteen years ago, the evenings when Noah put in extra time at the office, Grace was swollen and full in the house, lonely with the exception of the companion in her tummy and a teddy bear perched on the pillow while she watched “The Daily Show.” She waited until she heard Noah’s footsteps up the stairs, then rolled over and pretended to sleep. 

When her water broke a month early, Noah was away on a business trip. The nurses congratulated her when he sent her a care basket, but she was lethargic from the epidural as they took their son into an incubator. She spent the next ten years with their boy, watching his bright, innocent face in a world of judgment and darkness, waiting for his fate. 

She burned the death certificate, ten years to the day after he was born. The excuses made were callous; he was too slow in school, his development was retarded from the premature birth, he could not contribute to the society they lived in.

“I called a cab.”

Noah’s voice shook her out of her thoughts. She helped her husband into his jacket and escorted him out the door. He turned and gave her a kiss as she stiffened, his lips cold against her skin. 

She watched the taxi drive away, listening to her heart pound in her ears, a bird in her chest rattling against the cage of her ribs. She waved goodbye as it turned the corner sharply off their street, and Grace could see it no more.

When she walked back up to their bedroom, she found herself mechanically tidying the mess Noah left behind. She began to roll up his socks and stocking them in the back of their drawers. 

Outside, the sun began to set, its light shooting through the blinds and casting a gradient of red over the room.

I still think that anyone who's pretty good at guitar would simply not be able to play as badly as in OPs vid without trying to intentionally sound bad (assuming of course they know the song - which it seems she does because she's playing *approximately* the right notes, just playing them really badly).  Or drugs, but again, that'd require a *lot* of drugs to make you that sloppy, and she can still sing ""ok"" it seems (anyone complaining about her singing hasn't heard Hole before).  I'm pretty sure she can pull it off so horribly mostly because she's not very good to begin with.","1412121676"

I'd also pull the drain plug, rather than just try to capture the oil/ATS out the back.

I'm trying to inform people who don't know much about it here and there. Had some nice discussions with older and younger people. Not spreading crazy ass pro-mj propaganda. When someone likes to talk about it, I'm glad to tell what I know. If you don't know *everything* about MJ, it's totally okay too. Just share your experiences and knowledge and others might share with you too, which might end up in some interesting conversations!
 
Even those who never used MJ and don't want to use it personally in the future, those have their own opinions too. And also sometimes like to expand their knowledge. So give them respect for talking with you openly about this topic. If you happen to run into a talk with an older person like this and you happen to have good skills in listening and talking - you might remove the bad drug image from someones head at the end of the day. Destroying lies which older generations have been taught and what some govs told.
One person at a time. But don't forget to keep it easy, don't stress people out and rub it into their faces. Be friendly and reveal the truth that the majority of users are not the stereotypical persons who hang out with high ass gangsters all day and do illegal shit 24/7. You maybe have a good job, work hard for your money and see yourself as a regular part of society. Just show the world that you still are a nice person, who just smokes and lives a regular life. And that there's nothing that can change that, illegal or not. It's about social acceptance and respecting each other.

I go to leave, and she's like we should get together some time and she takes out her card and writes her personal number down. This girl was a 9.5/10, and my fucking response was ""I don't think that would be a good idea because I have a girlfriend."" 

I still have the card, but I feel like it's been too damn long to give her a call. I sure as shit wouldn't mind getting together with her now.","1412121681"

Gulu Gulu is filled with hipsters, but has a great beer selection and the owners of that place own Flying Saucer next door which has some awesome pizza. Opus is nice, the foods good and the place has some cool shows..my roommate just performed at a burlesque show there last week! Pretty fun!

Harrison's is a comic book store downtown and there's another new comic book store in the mall on Essex st. I've been in both. Harrison's has a bigger selection. I think the Red Lion also has some comics as well.

 For walking/bike trails theres one that starts near Salem state and goes into Marblehead that's pretty nice.

I pay 475 and live with 2 other people in a 3 bedroom. This is the most I've ever paid and I live by Derby Wharf which is a short walk to the downtown area. I paid 225 living in the point with roommates as well as around 350 so it really varies.

I made 9 an hour at the YMCA and I was getting by...It depends on your expenses really. Grocery shopping isn't awful..I mean if you go to Market Basket you'll be fine haha. It's so cheap! 

The Point isn't really that bad. I lived smack dab in the middle of it for a year. Use to get drunk a lot and walk home at like 2 am alone. (Probably not the smartest choice haha) I got hit on a few times, but then was left alone. Shitty place to live around the 4th of July if you hate fireworks though. They shoot those things off all damn night for like a week straight leading up to the 4th.

Salem is wonderful around halloween because of all the stuff going on..but also sucks because of all the fucking tourists. 

I've lived here for 6 years now though and I really love it. The architecture is beautiful and living near the ocean is great.

My initial comment was about whether Waco would be ""rocking"" for Gameday. Regardless of my feelings about Baylor as a university or  football team (which are generally neutral), I contend that Waco, as a city outside of campus, based on my experience, is a hell hole.

Now regarding your stadium. I have been to Floyd Casey but never to McLane so I certainly have no first hand knowledge of the atmosphere. By all accounts it is fantastic, and I don't doubt that. I do think it's interesting that your football program is stronger than it's ever been, but your brand new $250 MM stadium currently has about 15k fewer seats than Iowa State's Jack Trice Stadium and 5k fewer than the one you abandoned (sans tarp of course).

To be fair, it was probably wise to pick that capacity. The living room is winning out over the gameday experience for a lot of fans and I wouldn't be surprised if attendance at live sporting events wanes significantly over the next several decades. All that being said, I still find it amusing to poke fun at the stadium's capacity since it always elicits the same response from Bears.

TL;DR I'm just being an asshole to you and I'm sure you'll get Gameday soon enough and it will be great.","1412121691"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;""You don't have to be subjected to it,"" isn't usually a good response to the idea that something shouldn't be permitted on principle.

I don't agree.  The OP said it was ""a violation"" - but they are only violated if they choose to listen.  Usually, a violation implies that there is no choice involved - that you are strapped down and subjected to something.  Which is why I asked for a clarification.

&gt;I don't think it's very convincing to simply cite a Supreme Court case. OP may very well disagree with the decision, which they are certainly allowed to do.

While I appreciate your constructive criticism, I disagree again.  I was establishing an example of even more offensive speech being upheld.  Since they consider themselves ""pro free speech"", it forces them to either concede that it should be allowed, or that they disagree with the First Amendment as currently understood by the courts (or they could argue that the people on campus are worse than the Skokie Nazis).

&gt;So allowing the WBC to picket, etc., is the price to pay for ideological purity? Why is that a price worth paying?

Again, the OP claims to be ""a huge promoter and supporter of the first amendment right to freedom of speech and protest"" which would generally imply that they would, go fig, find speech worth protecting.  If they don't think that, then, again, we can go from there.","1412121691"

Hey I'm a liberal but putting up children to make emotional appeals and then using hyperbole and weasel words like ""flying death machines"" in order to make the audience hate drones based on his own technophobia is not the way you do journalism. It is the antithesis of journalism, it is propaganda.

He's basically giving a monologue where he lectures you about his political views. 

Not a single thing he described about the drone program, is worse than what we've been doing in the 1990s with jets or tomahawk missiles or carpet attacks. It is no different except that drones are more precise and therefore will lead to less civilian casualties.

I find it very interesting how he doesn't mention ISIS anywhere on that video and how instead he focuses on Yemen, banking on the fact that you won't know much about the situation in Yemen (where the Yemen government was basically begging for help from the US because it was going to descend into chaos just like Syria-Iraq).

Maybe John Oliver prefers the Bush-style invasion and occupation instead.  Would that satisfy John Oliver? I mean obviously soldiers aren't going to shoot innocent people like drones right? 

What would John Oliver prefer the military do? Apaches? Jets? Tomahawks? foot-soldiers? carpeting the whole area like in the 1950s? Hire local killers to do the job with no media involved (especially no complex drone graphics on Iranian television!!!) ??

He was a popular man, a righteous man with community spirit at the core of his beliefs. He greeted townsfolk by name as he made his way through the small town. The thatched roofing of the woodland turned slowly to majestic concrete structures which lined both sides of a cobbled road. At the end was Hildon's, a seventh generation butcher shop with all the original fittings, passed down to Frank from his father and his father before him. 

""Good day young boy!"", screamed Frank. ""For fuck sake you old shit would you put your hearing aid in!"", started Nigel, his 22 year old apprentice. ""You can't be yelling in my ears all day it's really unsettling!"". ""Sorry Nigel you know I'm getting old - now, will you do me the honour of unloading the truck out back?"".

Jon Rappoport is an investigative journalist, author and publisher of the website nomorefakenews.com. He has worked as an investigative reporter for 30 years, writing articles on politics, medicine, and health. Jon has delivered lectures and seminars on global politics, health, logic, and creative power to audiences around the world. He returns to give a complete run down on the recent CDC scandal. 

On August 25, 2014 the CDC published a press release defending its 2004 study on autism. Two days later CDC whistleblower publicly admits he and his co-authors cooked that study and committed fraud. The CDC was referring to the 2004 study whistleblower William Thompson co-authored, the study he admitted was fraudulent, the study he and his co-authors slanted to bury the connection between the MMR vaccine and autism. 

Jon discusses the complexities behind this huge cover-up. Actor, Rob Schneider also said he has a copy of ""the original CDC report that was later suppressed and fraudulently changed."" Later, Jon talks about the striking similarity between the Thompson and Snowden stories. In this extended interview, we’ll continue discussing the vaccine as well as the length the CDC and government will go to obscure damage they’ve created.","1412121695"

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.

So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.

Uhh nah dude. You are completely missing what I'm saying. His practices were reaching 7-9 hours a day with very little rest during training camp. That is not something that ever happens. It killed them, they were not hard practices. But draining and long practices for old bodies and major sugery recovering bodies.

How did it effect us long term? Is that an actual serious question? He fucked up the team of Kobe, Pau, Dwight and Nash. He ran an offense that just did not fit our team at all. Why the fuck are you running the princeton offense with Dwight and Nash. Everyone thought it was dumb fuck retarded.

But that led to us not getting a good start and never creating a bond between the players. We played pretty well post all star break, but the damage had already been done. Dwight leaves, which left us with one direction to head and that is down.

Mike Brown doesn't get hired, Mike Brown doesn't fuck up the 12-13 Lakers, we may have kept Dwight. Which may have let us be a playoff team at this current moment.

The Mike Brown hiring is why we're in such a shit show. It's very little to do with Kobe's contract. With or without that contract, we would be a bad team.

As you move towards a full language you need more complexity like higher order unification to perform elaboration and implicit argument synthesis (like it is done in Agda).

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","Multitasking is when a computer performs more than one task at a time (note: this doesn't imply genuine parallelism). There are multiple strategies for pulling this off.

Multiprogramming was an early strategy that involved doing a context switch when a program blocked on an IO operation.

Most modern machines do preemptive multitasking, where the active process is interpreted and context is switched to a different process.

*Threads* are simply tasks that operate in a shared memory space, which is to say in the context of a single process.

tl;dr: ""multithreading"" and ""multiprogramming"" are both forms of multitasking. Multiprogramming is old. Preemptive multitasking of processes and threads is more modern.","1412121699"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Mind your language. I messed up using the old fashioned 1BN = 1 million millions. 

But lets take away the other mistake which is to assume that its equally shared throughout the [entire population.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom#Age_structure)

So, I think its reasonably safe to assume those below the age of 10 are not engaging with hookers, and any who are sadly engaging with drugs are not spending money they themselves have earned and so it should be considered spent by the person who in fact did earn it. As an upper boundary can we agree that 70 years old is most peoples cut off for either hookers or drugs? 

So perhaps a reasonable range to 'spread' the spend is 15-70?  That's 44.7M people. 

Using todays exchange rate on the $20BN annually is 12.4BN GBP.

So now its just 12.4BN GBP / the eligible population of 44.7M which gives you 277 GBP per person per year.

Average income pre tax 26,500, post tax 21,000 = 1,750 a month after tax. 
Now minus average rent of 900 leaves you 850
Minus average spend [489*2 note: the stats only give you household spend per week so assuming two adults in that household its probably reasonable to say per person, per month is 2X the weekly household average rather than 4X](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/annual-domestic-energy-price-statistics)

Now you're already into negative figures and have had to resort to paying your hooker with the same credit card you wanted to cut your coke with.

Decisions decisions.

Mirena IUD's have the same medications as birth control pills but with lower doses from what I understand. Both forms of IUD's are used widely in Europe among females of childbearing age, so substantial information should be available in human samples. 

I like IUDs though with their near surgical sterilization rates of effectiveness, their effective maximum duration of five to ten years and which is practically idiot proof, and which is instantly reversible. In the case of the copper version, you could get pregnant immediately after removal. IUD's have the benefit of being the most effective, easily reversible, no-thought required form of birth control. Its biggest drawback is initial cost if you don't have health insurance.

There is the risk of course of uterine perforation, but given a skilled OB/GYN, I would expect the risk of this during insertion to be minimal. Your uterus can basically rip to shreds in VBAC, though it's a low risk, it is still a risk. Lots of things can screw you up, the question is the likelihood it will happen. ","1412121705"

"truezelda","t5_2tfzp","&gt;What I was really shocked by was the subsequent of bashing on the MM Link is Dead theory, saying how it had been debunked before and MatPat was just spreading it and etc.

Yup, it's dead in the water. There's absolutely no way it can be true. With the most obvious piece of evidence is Link's lineage. If he died in the lost woods, he wouldn't have kids, and thus wouldn't be related to TP Link. Obviously that's not the case.

Another thing to point out is that if he *did* die in the Lost woods, he'd be a Skull Kid, not a Stalfos, IIRC.

On top of that, you still don't explain how the Mask Salesman travels to and from Hyrule/Termina. He clearly does.

&gt;and I want to know what other MM theories are out there and if any of them make more sense/are much more possible to be true, with facts and scenarios to back it up. Because for now I wholeheartedly believe the Link is Dead theory, and if it's totally false, I'd like to know what else there is!

Well, as it stands, Termina is a real place, and the events in MM actually happened. They have to. As determined by future games (and past games, and MM itself).

That said, for theories about MM/Termina, I have on that I particularly like. Which is that Termina is literally underneath Hyrule. Similar to how Subrosia is under Holodrum. As for proof, look at how you enter termina from Hyrule: Fall down a long hole -&gt; Walk through a twisted corridor, not unlike the one in OoT's forest temple (that lets you walk on the walls/roof of that particular room).","1412121706"

Super briefly, atoms of different elements pull harder or lesser on electrons. In HCl, the Cl pulls harder than the H, so there is more of a negative charge on the Cl and a slight positive charge on the H.

""Just because the odds are 1 in X doesn't mean that the odds get any better after Y failures"" 
True, dice have no memory, but if you roll a hundred times, the chances of the weapon breaking during those attack rolls are higher than it breaking on just one roll. This is both intuitive and logical. It's also true that your weapon will not be guaranteed to break after 8000 attacks if the chances are 1:8000, but certainly the chances of your weapon breaking during those 8000 attacks are actually considerable. Just like rolling a d20 one hundred times, there is a higher chance to get a natural 20 in at least one of those rolls than the chance of getting a 20 in 1 roll.

I understand what you mean, is not like the possible rolls were being exhausted and suddenly your weapon is guaranteed to break, but the amount of times you roll to attack do matter, not because the chances increase for the next rolls, but because in a higher number of rolls the chances of it happening in at least one of the rolls are higher than the chances of it happening in just one roll. It follows a binomial distribution, there is a probability of the weapon breaking in each trial, and X number of trials, if you increase the number of trials, the chance of your weapon breaking during those trials increases.","1412121708"

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","It's not especially well known as to who gets to keep their bodies, or why. When Goku is first killed during the battle with Raditz, he's the weakest being that we've ever seen use a physical body in the after life. Other beings have died previously (Krillen &amp; Chiaotzu) while significantly weaker, but it was never reported. That said, when Goku first arrived to the planet, King Kai suggested that he was probably stronger than any apprentice he had ever taken on... so it's hard to say.

Batman isn't capable of lifting cars or demolishing boulders with his bare hands, something that Goku could do at power level 50 when he was only 11 or 12 years old. Goku as we see him in the afterlife had a power level of something like 300 prone, or somewhere around 1000 while charging a kamehameha.

So... Batman's not that powerful compared to Goku, fighting skill aside. Goku as a child could literally overpower Batman in raw strength.","1412121710"

"wow","t5_2qio8","WoW is always in the top 10 on twitch and if someone like Reckful or sodapoppin go one it easily breaks into the top 5. That's hardly no one watching. The game isn't big and it never will be but RBGs will never get as big as Arena is now and neither will live raids.

 &gt;Because WoW PvP is the equivalent of little kids running around with toy guns screaming out ""I shot you"" and ""No you didn't"".

So you don't like PvP yet you want to dictate what is and isn't the focus of PvP players? Arena is what the majority of WoW PvPers want to play, they don't want to play RBG's, so what would trying to force people into RBG's accomplish? The only way people would leave Arena is if it was removed or severely diminished and those players would be more likely to stop PvP all together rather then switch to RBG's.

&gt;It doesn't make it unviable, but it does create an additional challenge.

It's not merely an additional challenge. WoW isn't an esport with arena as it is, it will never be an esport with BG's because no one is going to fly 10 people to a tournament. If Blizzard wanted to turn WoW into an esport they had the opportunity to try that 6 years ago and they chose not to. Their response to esports questions has been the same for years, all they ever say is they're interested but have never actually done anything.

See, what the artist is trying to tell us here is that in reality, we're going nowhere right now in our educational system and the problem (which the picture makes painfully obvious) is the that the parents are too close to the children. I mean think about it, parents always want to be involved of every part of a childs life, which is great, but we live in a day and age where it's hindering our growth. What this artist is expressing is that if the students themselves can separate from their parents and move up, just a little bit, all will run smoothly. This also indicates that there would be a barrier between the students and parents by the teachers, which I think is EXCELLENT. Oh and want to know what all of these mechanical parts are there for? You guessed it! That bell up at the top! It's perfect symbology for how until our students can separate from their parents and learn to rely more on the teachers, we will never be the ""bell cow"" in education... absolutely beautiful...","1412121712"

Eating meat is easily defensible.


Vitamin K, Vitamin D  ( or is it B ), Omega 3, Animal Protein, ...


Some nutrients you just can't get from Plants.


Variety with plant based food will often require non-local/or and out of season products. ( that comes with other costs ).


Plant based foods have huge amounts of waste that Humans can't eat and animals do. Disposing of that waste is expensive has environmental concerns.

This is similar to how I feel. I was kind of excited at first about becoming a default, because I thought it would invite a lot of interesting discussion and perspectives. Instead, I've found myself slowly becoming exhausted with all the knee-jerk hostility in gender-related discussions.

For another, you don't invite anyone off the street to walk into your home and search your house for something to pay you for. Opening up your home to the public is exactly what it looks like. if you want to kick someone off, sure, you could, but if it's open to the public, putting up a sign saying ""no blacks or irish allowed"" will get you into a legal headache quick.

The point being that a business that is open to the public is hardly private property. Though is commonly treated as such, it is also commonly treated as an exception, which is why you have states that do not allow signs of any kind to have force of law, you have to be physically told to leave.

Have a boyfriend that gained 110lbs and plays WoW instead of spending time with you? Your girlfriend doing everything she can to prevent the two of you from having alone time? If you don't talk with them about it, then you're more to blame. If you're honest with them and open up to them about your needs/desires and they continue to neglect you?

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;So you don't get any revenue? Why would a business do that?

Maybe I'm sadistic and I want to see you starve to death.  Or maybe I just want your land for cheap to build an amusement park.

&gt;No it isn't, since people can move. It would be a natural monopoly if you couldn't move.

Well, you can't move if I jack up the price to infinity first.  Using my roads would be theft of service, and I'll have you thrown in jail and take possession of all your assets in compensation!  Even if you did move, now your land is worth very little.  I'll have an agent buy it up for cheap so I can build my amusement park.  You're now out a lot of wealth -- and you're now at the mercy of some other private road owner!

&gt;Also how is such a monopoly different than the government monopolizing roads and dictating rules and fees of use? 

Governments (in first world countries) don't charge exorbitant fees for roads -- not only would that kill their chances of being reelected, there are also checks and balances which stops one sadistic individual from killing people by confining them in their homes.  Also, governments generally don't charge fees for using roads outside of a small number (relatively speaking) of toll roads.  It makes traffic a lot smoother!

&gt;Again, how is that different from government?

"Techno","t5_2r5uc","No probs, I also find some nice stuff here: http://www.teaandtechno.net/

I posted a mix a while back with a ""i'm a female DJ and here's my new mix"" and I got a lot of stick for it, I was only trying to draw some attention to myself and i'm shit at self promotion generally but a lot of people saw it as a pretty desperate attempt at getting myself out there by using my sex as the most important factor, but anyway it worked I think I got like 85 listeners and people enjoyed it which is the main thing. I fucking love music and mixing so if others enjoy what I do then I can't really top that.

Yeah you are right, i'm just looking to meet some new heads who are passionate about the music they play, I think there's probably a lot of undiscovered talent who are afraid to even try and get noticed cos the London music scene is so massively competitive at the moment. It's grown hugely as house and techno have gotten so popular but the problem is the smaller parties really suffer as a result, people will pay expensive ticket prices for a night out but expect to see at least 4/5 headline acts for their money. So in my view it's kinda taking away the magic of the smaller and more intimate parties. On another note i'm also growing tired of being surrounded by fucking posers everywhere you go, but so far with techno events it's been pretty good and it's more about the music - is that true where you are?

Thanks for your feedback on the mix. I agree with you actually, I got to that point in the mix where I was having so much fun that I got a bit carried away and the planning went out the window and there is a massive key clash with the more melodic tunes 3/4 of the way through which lets it down a bit. You didn't rain on my parade it's all valuable to have other people's perspective. Perhaps you could send us a mix? ;)","1412121725"

"osugame","t5_2s3lm","Yo. I think I'm gonna just start doing skin reviews from now on, this shit is fun to talk about for some reason. As always I'm writing this only based on your video.

Anyway, I like your skin, I can see what you mean by it not being made for playing. I also can't format for shit, so I'm gonna be spacing out stuff that probably shouldn't be spaced out.

For starters, videos are the best way to go, preferably youtube, and if you want link a webm with the youtube link. Webm is nice and all but mobile users can't look at it, which I understand isn't a big deal but for people like me who bookmark skin posts to come back to later it makes it annoying when I can't see what the skin looks like. Anyway, good on you for posting a video at least, but never use auto or an SS play to show off your skin, no one cares what the play looks like, just as long as it shows the 100, 50, and combobreak images.

I like the slider circle thing, I've only seen a version of it once before and it was much darker than yours, and I like how the hitcircles look, they're transparent but not hollow. I like hollow hitcircles, but your full hitcircles are pretty nice from the looks of it. I'm also not much of a dot/star guy, as I get lost in the hitcircles pretty easily and need the numbers for help, but for some reason I like your stars too.

The mod selection menu is way too red for me, especially since this is supposed to be a rainbow skin, I'm just curious as to why you didn't at least color-code them ROYGBIV or something, but I understand that they aren't an integral part of the skin. I'm also surprised that you didn't change the comobcolors to ROYGBIV as well, but kept them default, and also that the scorebar is green with that streak of orange, which seems to throw off the rainbow aspect of the skin, but once again I understand if you didn't want it to be a full blown rainbow skin, as I've seen plenty of *terrible* full blown rainbow skins. 

From the looks of your video, it looks like you have a really fast 300 image on there, which is nice for replays, but may take distract people when playing, but as you said it's not made for playing but rather for video, so it fits it perfectly. My only hope is that you included the invisible 300 image in the extras folder so those of us that want to use it for playing can change it rather easily if need be. 

That's about all I can think of, it's a nice skin, I'll probably download it.

edit: used it now, you didn't show off most of the things you put into the skin, which upsets me for you somehow, look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JF0TSe8Rho&amp;feature=youtu.be) video, he shows off almost every single thing about the skin. If you took the time to insert a smoke image into the skin, show that off in the video, if you took the time to make a pause menu and fail menu, show that off in the video. People love even the simplest things about certain skins.

Also know that this is an awesome skin and I'm am nitpicking as much as I possibly can.","1412121725"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","I believe rather than just saying ""let's raise the minimum wage to some arbitrary round number for an arbitrary amount of time until we raise it again""; we should do the actual economic analysis to figure out what the ideal minimum wage is.  

Minimum wage proponents argue that raising the minimum wage actually increases employment, because the boosted spending among the working poor flows directly back into the economy.

Minimum wage opponents argue that increasing the minimum wage actually prices many people outside of the labor market, increasing unemployment.

It's quite possible that both of these arguments are true, for different values of the minimum wage.  At the extremes (say a minimum wage of zero or a minimum wage of one million dollars an hour), i suspect it leans towards the latter argument.  However, a minimum wage of zero in a welfare state (like the US) will push more working people onto government income assistance programs, necessitating an increase in taxes, and negating many of the economic benefits of decreasing the minimum wage.  So it may be that some form of minimum wage is ideal, pending major reform to other sectors of government.  Perhaps a slight minimum wage increase in this light would be good for the economy, but it might also be that a slight minimum wage decrease would yield the optimum result.  So we should set aside our ideological biases, and try to figure out what the ideal number is, and then set it to that, with some indexing to cost of living increases.","1412121727"

A lot of people giving Timmy the upper hand for longevity, but Shaq played for 18 seasons. Timmy has played for 16. Okay, let's take away the dwindling Shaq seasons, let's say from when he left MIA, that still leaves him with 15 seasons, one less than Duncan so far. So in my eyes Duncan hasn't really been much more durable than Shaq.
Even with those last couple of shitty seasons (for his standard), he still has better or same averages as Duncan, despite shooting 50% from the FT line.


To me it's Shaq, 'cause even though they in the end are kind of the same stats-wise, you get 11 amazing years, 3-4 good ones and 2-3 OK ones from Shaq. With Timmy you get 16 great ones.
I also think having Pop, same ""system""/people around you + 2 amazing players for a shit load of years benefits Duncan, as opposed to Shaq who played amazing ball for 3 different clubs, and won titles win 2 of those (though he did have great players next to him as well, I'm not saying that, I'm saying that he had to adjust much more to new players opposed to Timmy).","1412121729"

Met a friend I still have today on the bus out there that's from my state.  And through my friend I met his bff who I've since become very good friends with and try to go out and visit once a year.  

Also my gaggle of really great friends I made on okc whilst rebuilding my social life.  Every one always bullshits about its not for making friends.  I met one of my best friends on there. We talked constantly for a month. Texting and on the phone. Then I was like fuck it I wanna hang out with you and crazy group of friends. So I go to TN and stay on his college campus for a week.

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","[Read this and the comic illustrations](http://www.storyboardthat.com/articles/business/negotiation/getting-to-yes)

What you just read is sometimes called soft positioning, getting to yes, or Harvard Principled Negotiation. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_Harvard_Principled_Negotiation)

* The goal (at least for right now) is to get you into the doctor's office.  It is not to get your dad to like you going into the doctor office, it is not to get you the diagnosis, it is not to get your dad to accept the diagnosis, it is to get you to a doctor who if presented with the symptoms of ADHD and the doctor thinks it is ADHD he will tell you its ADHD and will tell your dad is ADHD.  (The next step of getting your dad to accept it and treat it comes later, first we tackle the small problem before the big problem.)

So we need to convince your dad that **it is in his best interest to take you** to the doctor office.  Notice what I said, **I said his** not yours best interest.  The other option is we need your Dad,  "" we need this man to want to say yes I will take you to the doctor, that he accepts that going to the doctor is a good idea for whatever reason.""

You do not need to convince him (now) that it is a medical problem.  You do not need to convince him that this diagnosis is important for him, that it gives him answers.  Right now our ""manipulative goal"" is to get him to take you to the doctors.  So here are the things we are going to do.

To do this we are going to do these things.

1.) We want your dad to see you two as allies, as friends, as father and son together.  We do not want him to see you two as adversaries in this conversation, if he sees you as adversaries he will dig in his heels.

2) The goal is aggreement *we should go see the doctor, **together**."" Not the goal is victory, victory for dad is no doctor appointment, victory for son is doctor appointment.

3) Be willing to give *some* ground as a good faith measure to show your dad that you and him are in this together.  Admit some mistakes you have made in the past, admit you screwed up.

4) Follow up the admission of mistake by saying something like ""that is in the past, and I am trying to work together"" another option is ""in the past you made me so angry, it hurt, but I understand you were trying to do what you thought was best for me."" By being soft on yourself or on them you are allow the opposite to happen, you show your dad it is okay to be vulnerable and for him to give a little ground in reciprocation.

5) Tell a story of the problem (I got grades because I think this happen, and then tell the story), **do not** state the problem (this is what happened is the worse way to start this discussion).  Stories are bendable entities, and they are also non confrontational, we want him to be willing to bend his traditional answer, to give ground, to say yes.  Hard statements of facts lead to yes or no answers, we want him to say something like I understand and then something like yes.

6) Make an offer your dad is willing to say yes to.  Something like can we go see the doctor, I understand you do not think it is this, but what is the harm of trying?  If its not a stress problem or motivation problem dad I will try harder,  I want to do good, I want to succeed.  Those 3 run on sentences are things your dad can easily agree yes too.  **Your dad thinks he is getting everything he wants, he thinks he is winning, and he is winning in a way he does not take losses** thus your dad is almost guaranteed to say yes.

7)

 7a) If your dad says yes, then you just won

 7b) If your dad says maybe, press on him what would make you feel better, or what can I do to change your mind?  Be prepared to take another loss but a loss in good faith to show your dad you are wanting to make this work.  If he gives you something that for no reason you can accept respond gently with a counter offer saying I understand your position but can we do this instead?

 7c) If your dad responds with a reasonable counter off or conditional be prepared to take another minor loss to strike the bargain.  If your dad seems on its face a good counter offer but in reality it is a bad offer try your best to counter with a counter offer.

 7d) If your dad says **flat out** no, like this was never a negotiation in the first place, then stop the conversation, act hurt, betrayed, and leave.  If your dad sees being a hardliner will lead to no progress he may reconsider.","1412121730"

Sunroof step rails etc.) And when the lender does the ""welcome call"" to the customer it is revealed that it does not have an option listed on the bookout. Thus adjusting the book value.  The lender will not fund the deal based on the new LTV and the dealer has to fix it. 

More lenders are checking by calling customers after many repos did not have half the equipment the dealer said it did at time of financing. Sometimes an accident, most time not. So to make up for some of the lost profit the dealer ups the interest rate a point. You save overall, and the dealer saves face and makes a little more on the backend to compensate.

"umass","t5_2qowg","The police are not at all at fault for his death.

-Student caught selling molly and LSD in a sting operation   
-Offered ability to stay in school/ not be prosecuted if he helps police nab a bigger, more criminal dealer   
-Helps police arrest bigger dealers   
-Leave contact with police   
-Overdoses on heroin several months later   

At no point is it indicated the police had any reason to believe he had a drug problem, let alone a heroin problem, which is an entirely different drug from what he was arrested for.

The whole article pins blame for his death on the police because they didn't tell his parents he'd been caught selling drugs, which is ridiculous- he was an adult with privacy rights who specifically did not want his parents to know he did or sold drugs. The ""UMass policy [calling] for parents to be notified the first time a student violates alcohol or drug rules"" includes several other ways for students to avoid having their parents told.

If you're playing CQB/door kicker, shorter gun is going to be way more manageable.  If you're playing field, longer gun won't matter.  

In reality, barrel length has little to do with accuracy beyond certain lengths.  It depends more on barrel and hopup qualities that will get the reach.  If you don't care about aesthetics (I personally find longer guns more eye pleasing, so a 14.5"" M4 looks better than the 10"" CQB-R ones), the shorter one would allow you more flexibility most likely.  You won't get hung up in CQB and with some fine tuning you might be getting into anyway, you can still play field engagements decently.","1412121737"

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","I think mainly in terms of auteur cinema, and would therefore have to qualify the work as British. Holding true to the directors vision, the film has a distinct Steve McQueen quality to it, and feels like one of his movies. The leading actor is British, as are some of the other major leading roles, which only add to the overall feel of an English film. Money can certainly have an effect on a director's vision, but not enough, in this case, to remove its cultural stamp. 

The source material is certainly American, but the source hardly defines the nationality of the work. Sergio Leone Films feel Italian, and The Magnificent Seven feels American. ","1412121740"

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","To me, the overarching question here can be synthesized to this: As an owner/operator of a business/corporation, is it my right to deny access to my services/products to anyone, anywhere, anytime for any reason that I choose?

I think it is safe to reason that if it is okay to deny services to homosexuals who want to get married, then it should also be okay to deny veterans services because they have been in combat, or to deny black people services because of their skin color, or to deny paraplegic people based on their inability to walk. Maybe this is non obvious, but the point is that if someone can discriminate against one type of person for one reason, everyone should be able to discriminate against anyone for any reason.

Certainly, on an individual level, a person should be allowed to choose not to associate with others based on whatever criteria he or she prefers. If I don't want to spend my time around truck drivers, dammit I shouldn't have to spend my time around truck drivers. So, should this same fundamental right extend to businesses and corporations?

Honestly, I'm struggling with this concept. If it can be verified that giving businesses and corporations the right to discriminate against their customer base will not be radically detrimental to society to as a whole, then I cannot determine another reason why this right should not belong to corporations as well. I do suspect that this would be rather problematic for the country if businesses were capable of freely discriminating, but I cannot prove this. 

I do not think that ""corporations are people too."" I think this has been an incredibly destructive concept to our society due to campaign contributions alone. But, if feelings are all that are truly in the crosshairs of allowing businesses to discriminate, then that is not a good enough reason to prevent these businesses from doing so. The free market will conceivably take care of these things: the baker who is willing to make cakes for gay couples might just make more money than the baker that won't.

But, all of that being said, I don't think freedoms of speech and religion should extend to businesses/corporations; there simply isn't any reason for them to. This notion does seem to be destructive to our society, harming the fragile balance of power that we have. Maybe freely discriminating won't cause any harm other than a few hurt feelings (And who cares really), but maybe this would cause significantly more problems than it solves. I can't claim to know.

**2.** darling girl's living dead gurl. UM. easily the most gorgeous and unique blush i've come across! layering it over a conventionally coloured blush makes me feel so glam and witchy lol. dat sheen.

**3.** alkemia's county fair. it was a bit cloying at first, but good god do i love it now. i feel like an adventure time princess wearing it. this one scent makes me want all the alkemia.

**4.** duochromes! i used to be devoutly matte, but i can't resist the pull of two colours in one anymore.

**5.** detrivore's chai tea embalming tube. i will never shut up about this. divinely melty and moisturising, and smells exactly like my favourite hot drink! what's not to love?

**6.** haus of gloi's litchi milk tea hair oil. not only does it soothe my frazzled, colour damaged hair, but it makes an amazing facial oil cleanser too (i can actually wear revlon colorstay without breaking out!). plus, i smell sooo good.

**7.** sounds dorky as hell, but i have a bunch of self image issues and being able to put all these beautiful products on makes me feel like i can be kinda beautiful too! :)

**8.** the monthly exchange! as a uk buyer, being able to nab unwanted goodies from multiple companies without the hefty international shipping fees is a dream come true. i can't emphasise how hyped i am for the next one!

First off to be clear Zoe Quinn is a person deserving of contempt. Contempt for her flippant actions towards TFYC and Wizardchand and contempt for her abusive and hypocritical treatment of Eron. She is no innocent bystander and yet she received no more harassment than your average celebrity does everyday.

The actions of inquiry and discussion of the possible corruption stemming from her affairs were both legitimate and needed.it was nothing that needed apology or was unethical.

If I get 40 percent on a midterm, I might be more inclined to work my ass off and get an 90 on the final.

"facebook","t5_2qh8o","&gt; Does one need to be signed in to look up someone else on FB?

No. Try it for yourself: log out of Facebook and search for your own profile. You'll find it easily if you know your own name. ;)

The ability to search for someone's Facebook page depends on that person's privacy settings. There's a setting in there somewhere which says something like ""show my profile page in internet searches"". This is switched **on** by default: you need to switch it **off** if you don't want non-Facebookers searching for your profile.

&gt; Can the person being searched see who searched them?

No. All those posts about apps that promise to show you who viewed your profile are scams and lies.

&gt; Will searching for someone auto add them as a friend?

No. The **only** way for two people to become friends on Facebook is for one person to send a friend request to the other person and for the other person to confirm that friend request. There is no automatic friending function.

&gt; I am friends with people who I know, but I did not friend them. How did this happen? 

You friended them. Either you sent them a friend request and they accepted it, or they sent you a friend request and you accepted it. There's no other way for people to be added as friends on Facebook.

When you get to 4th job you can either upgrade Spirit Claw for your main attack or Bomb Punch, Spirit claw is for hitting less enemies but dealing more damage and Bomb Punch is for hitting more enemies and doing less damage. By lvl.180 you should have enough SP to max every skill after mastery books.

I personally use Spirit Claw as my main attack because it is REALLY powerful when fully upgraded and sorta removes the need to hit more enemies at once because they die so fast. Right now I can do 400% damage hitting nine times and 3 enemies because of my hyper skills. It's the best move against bosses too because another hyper skill adds 20% more damage against bosses making for 420% damage against a boss which gets even crazier after you get your hyper skill buff and maple warrior.

First, I am just as pumped about the noise record as anyone.

Second, the comparison of measurements are pretty much meaningless. For example, the chart in this picture gives no distance. The inverse square law says (very basically) that if the distance to the sound is cut in half, the volume will be squared. We all know that an airplane is quieter from a mile away than from 100 feet away. Since these dB levels have no distance from the source, the comparisons that are inferred are questionable. In addition, the volume of the stadium is measured from a little cove on the field surrounded by people less than 15' away. Because of this, 1 person in that 15' radius will ""count"" for the equivalent of an entire section of the crowd on the other side of the stadium. They are also measuring peak dB, not averages. This means that the volume only needed to be that loud for a tiny fraction of a second. The average is somewhere in the 110-120 range.

Third, and most awesomely, the dB scale is logarithmic. This is deceptive, because in this scale, every 3dB represents a *DOUBLING* of the power of the sound. This means that the Chiefs stadium measured more than TWICE the power of the Seahawks.

I said elsewhere that before we separated, we were earnestly working onthe problems that we could. Intimacy was one of them. She agreed her libido was abnormal, and she would like to fix it for me. So she suggested watching stuff together, masturbating, more intimacy, etc. Then she left lol. Sucks so bad.

Anyways, if I can stomach taking her back, sex should be better. Hopefully everything else is.

(And some of them are also paying dividends through Nxt). Nxt assets are very real and useable, and now there are a lot of Nxters with experience in asset issuance and management.

Edit: He was also probably nervous about getting ebola and transfering it. I would guess the reason he came to the USA to visit family was that he was close to someone who had died of ebola and was curious if he had it. He decided he didnt want to be there anymore because of the risk and so he went back home.

That baseline CPU is [$1,070](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117462) alone. This SSD for [$650](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA0AJ1292207) is as close as you are going to find that matches, but is still 25% slower than what's in a Mac Pro and good luck finding one 500 Gb or 1 TB.

So already, we're at $2,730:US and it's not as fast, we still need a motherboard, power supply, and case to put it all in.

I feel that on a fundamental level they are one in the same, an incorporial soul isn't inhabiting a brain, the complex series of cells in the brain interacting gives a level of consciousness. And I believe that computers are very similar in that sense.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","&gt;What is the simplest way you can explain this without getting into equations upon equations.

How would you write 10/3 as a decimal number? You can use as many digits as you want, but it won't be exact.

Computers use base 2 (aka. binary) though, and there are many numbers that can be represented exactly as a decimal number (such as 2/5 = 0.4) but not as a binary number (0.4 in binary is 0.01100110011...).

That's the simplest explanation I can think of. The fact that computers usually use floating point doesn't really matter; the fact that they use binary does. Floating point just means that bigger numbers are less accurate.","1412121757"

Then I decided to grab a mid-range crappy Samsung phone that was reduced to a buggy paperweight after the Ice Cream Sandwich update. It also suffered from screen burn-in with dat AMOLED screen. :'(((

Finally I went back to HTC with the HTC One m7. Ooooooohhhhh what a fresh start. BoomSound speakers, frequent updates, Sense UI, wide-angle front camera, unibody metal? This thing was, and still is, a beauty. This was also the first phone where I rooted and installed a custom ROM. Man, was I missing out on a bunch of stuff!

The only thing that plagued this phone though, was the mediocre battery life and it's lackluster camera shots. I didn't consider the M8 much of an upgrade, so that was off the list. I've been looking at the Sony Xperia Z3 for a while, and it has everything I need: Remote Play, longer lasting battery life, and a nicer camera.

"Spanish","t5_2qtt1","Well, I learned Spanish formally, at school, and as of now I have been studying for 5 years and some change. Years one to two I learned the very most basic vocabulary and I believe only present, preterite, commands (only tú form), and i guess present progressive. My sentences were of the ""tengo un gato en mis pantalones"" variety. My third year was what I consider the first year where my spanish knowledge was enough to make coherent thoughts **of my own chosing** into sentences. I learned all of the tenses (not subjunctive) by the time that year was over. Spanish four was the first year I could understand more than half of (reasonably paced) spoken Spanish. I was also introduced to the subjunctive. Spanish 5, which was last year, is where I finally became pretty damn proficient. I had an awesome teacher. I was able to analyze literature, watch movies, write short essays, wing presentations, understand 90% of spoken Spanish (given that it wasn't super fast and thick accent, looking at you native Mexican man I talked to at a restaurant), and generally be able to conjugate relatively subconsciously. Now I'm taking 5th semester Spanish at my university and am in a room with a majority of native speakers (hardly fair). We'll see where this takes me. Currently I feel that my weak points are vocabulary (need to google too much for my liking sometimes), understanding native speakers in more than a general sense (i usually know what they're saying, but not perfectly), and the ability to read advance literature (there's a difference between reading a short story and reading an academic journal). Most importantly, I'm still clueless on how to properly swear in spanish. I don't know how people actually do it, and if i look it up there are a bunch of comments saying ""nobody says this"" or ""people say this, but differently"".

I am sorry to return to this topic so often in this thread, but again: a hymen *does not need to be broken*. This is a common misconception that a surprising number of people believe. Imperforate or micropreforate hymens cover the vaginal opening, but they are very rare types of hymen that can be considered medical anomalies.

The typical hymen does not cover the vaginal opening, but is rather an elastic ring of tissue that lines but does not obstruct the vagina. With sufficient lubrication and relaxation, the hymen (and vagina) should stretch to accommodate the penis instead of tearing (the vaginal wall can also tear and bleed). In the majority of cases, bleeding and pain can be avoided almost altogether when a woman has PIV sex.","1412121760"

Starting pitching ( injuries ) was complete crapola to start, then it seemed like the pitching, offense and bullpen traded off sucking. I did enjoy seeing some minor leaguers come up and do some solid things. 

Strength and weaknesses: Some positions look solid going forward, Miggy picked up his offense, but took a few steps back throwing runners out. Out pitching staff gave up so many bombs(fuck reed)

Offseason: Take it away TLR. 

Next Season: The Diamondbacks are pretty likely to turn shit around. Their history certainly shows a recored of up and down seasons from year to year. I'm looking forward to seeing what TLR and Stewart put together. ","1412121765"

Chat in strike missions, and crucial events should be mandatory because a lot of people go in to these not knowing what the heck is going on and become huge detriments to the team.

"furry","t5_2qi2h","1) A friend of my aunt's is an artist and I met him a few times and he was a cool guy, so I added him on facebook and occasionally he uploads commissions and drawings he does. One time one of his commissions was of an anthro dear and either another dear or a canine (can't remember or find it), it was from the waist-up and the dear was wearing a puffy red vest while the other was shirtless. One of the comments on it was ""Furries are going to be eating this up"" and another in response was ""Already are."" I liked the drawing, it was well done, cute, and I really liked the idea of human-like animals; So to figure out what a ""furry"" was I opened google and searched. Needless to say I found what I was looking for and a bit extra. The extra was very intriguing to 13 year old me and I found myself going back to it more and more, rather quickly it almost completely replaced my normal... *endeavors*. 

I didn't get into the actual community until a year after searching ""furry"", and found out just how much more there was that I had been missing.

2) I hate to admit it but yes I am afraid to tell people that I'm a furry.

My main reason for being afraid is because it doesn't fit with my day-to-day personality; most of the time I'm one of the quieter and more serious people that you find, and wanting to run around and be smushed in fur-piles and group hugs while wearing what non-furries would consider a silly costume kind of changes how people look at you. I don't want to be like that around regular people, I've always been introverted and save ""the real me"" for my *closest* friends and family, and I consider the furry community as part of my close family, whether you want to be in it or not.

Another reason is that if they don't know what it is they may search (like I did) and find the other side of the fandom, but instead of liking it as I did, being repulsed or weirded out by it. If they do supposedly know what it is then chances are they already have an opinion and its more than likely along the lines of bestiality/CIS episode/weird fetish until you explain to them what it is, if they let you. There are always exceptions but I just don't bring it up unless I have a reason to.

3) No, I don't have a suit. I do want one and hope to have one made within the next three years (can't exactly hide being a furry from your family when you have a tiger fursuit, and also I would need money for it).

7) I have never felt like being a furry was ""wrong"", if anything I felt it was *right*. I get a very giddy feeling when I think of what it will be like to attend conventions and have a fursuit of my own.

8) I accepted that I was a furry when I was 14, shortly after finding the ""regular"" community. My thoughts were basically ""Wow I love everything about this."" A few months ago I decided I wanted to be an active member of the community, which led to a great boost in overall happiness (and a much needed boost).

9) I'd say the best parts of being a furry would be all the different people you meet, I've made a few friends (over the internet) in the fandom since I decided I wanted to be an active member a few months ago (as apposed to lurking), all the art (SFW and NSFW), just how accepting furries are, and the easily attained feeling of camaraderie/family love between most.

Worst part would have to be how some people view furries in a bad light, other than that the fact that I don't have a fluffy tail ^or ^^ears ^^^or ^^^^paws. If we had the technology and there were no dangerous side affects I would be first in line for a full transformation (remember, I don't actually think I am an animal, but that doesn't mean I can't want to be one).

10) Funniest moment (so far) would probably be when a few of us watching a stream made bear puns for nearly an hour.

11) I didn't feel like a furry or that I had a fursona before I discovered the fandom, though I loved animals way more than the average person and always wished we could communicate.

For reference I'm currently 16 and in 10th grade (high school with two years left, for any furs that have a different school system than Americans).

Think Richard Nixon after Watergate or most serial killers who profess their innocence even after the evidence is clear that they committed the crime. 99% of the time they'll think utilizing carless straight talk will make their situation *worse* in their mind. 

Women are naturals at Powertalk and successfully utilize it to play victim card if they ever find themselves in situation where plausible deniability can't save them. In fact, *all Powertalk cheaters, regardless of sex, will profess their innocence since they honestly believe they didn't do anything wrong, or want to convenience others that what they did **wasn't so bad** or **justified***

Part of the reason feminism is so cruel to plugged-in men is because they don't have the upbringing/tools to see past a girls Powertalking shit tests. Hating cheaters/liars is a given, but it's better to simply know/protect yourself from such emotionally manipulative behavior in the first place.

And sorry I should have been clear, I'm not planning on going crazy every day (I still need to function), I just want to experience what it's like on these drugs, even if I only do them once.

And I'm aware of how much SSRIs can screw with you; I was on them as well, once. Fortunately, mirtazapine is not an SSRI. I looked around for stories about people's experiences with psychedelics while on mirtazapine specifically, and I didn't find much in the way of horror stories - in fact all I could gather was that shrooms are less effective. Which may actually be better for a first experience.

Speaking of which, I have a friend who should be able to spot me for shrooms. That's really the one experience I'm worried about, and if it goes to hell I don't plan on being alone. And can LSD go bad? A 12 hour trip doesn't really appeal to me, but if it's safer than shrooms...

As for DMT... I'm still feeling around for it. Fingers crossed. If I get the chance I'll take it.

Or maybe this will all fall through and I'll just be stoned the whole time XD  Regardless, thanks for the reply. If this does happen, I'll be cautious about it.","1412121772"

If Bo is on, we can throw up points on them and our D might literally be the best we've ever had; they are straight up nasty. Bo will have time in the pocket due to Bama's relative lack of a pass rush. Short passes, 3-5 yrd runs, and long sustained drives will be the order of the day. Bo just has to stay calm, trust the offense, and not make stupid mistakes. If he does that, we have a very good chance of winning.","1412121774"

Right now, only Koeman knows who is best based on performances in training, and Alderweireld has hardly had a decent game to feature in (Yeah, really troubled in Newcastle) Then again, both will feature as I'm sure Gardos will be a rotation player for non-league games.

The whole denying the buy-out is stupid. Why have the buy-out in it then? I doubt he is going to get into Atletico's first team, so they may only deny it to demand more money, and at that stage, if we want to buy him, his current price is a bargain, so whatever they demand could only be fair, if we are interested at the end of the season.","1412121777"

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","OP, I will answer your questions as honestly as I can....

Why do I personally think there is nothing wrong with disliking an entire gender? Because no one actually does dislike 100% of a gender 100% of the time. If they did, they would universally dislike all family members as well as all coworkers of said gender and this would not bode well for a male wanting to remain a productive member of modern society.  Some Lone wolf Mountain Man? Maybe. But to draw the conclusion that there is an entire sub full of commenters with this attitude without factoring in that people lie and especially lie online is just asinine. This is a math problem really.... Anonymous Action + No Fear of reprisal = Lying Assed Bastards Online.

Lather, Rinse, Repeat the sentiment for a race, creed, and color too. Anonymity online was my very first concern wayyyyyy back when ARPANET was a thing and the Internet was something people talked about while drawing on napkins while eating pizza rolls. 

I knew back then that hate would be rampant online because of anonymous keyboard cowboys. But I have always said.... a hetero sexual man can tell me he hates X and I can go find a bunch of X brand hotties and suddenly nailing X goes from impossible to taboo and finally brand X will rise to a point of desire. Sometimes men are less sentient philosophical beings and just giant hormones with feet looking to nail something.... unless they are anonymous online and then they are just big fat liars most of the time.","1412121778"

Just give me a schedule that is realistic so that I don't have to give you 20% of my paycheck to do rounds and rounds of ridiculous notes. Bravo has excellent lawyers and the move to fire Ryan Seacrest's production company was calculated. Maybe the next step would be a lawsuit but I'm sure it will be a long time before that is resolved. 

If the union wants to make an impact they should seek out every Bravo editor working at this moment and organize a walk out collectively.  Bravo wouldn't be able to handle a shut down of that size without coming to the table. ","1412121778"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","very late, but:

What's the difference between Princess Diana and 25 pence?

[It's easier to scrape together 25 pence.""](#s)

This one's a little longer:

In the middle of the desert, there's an old hotel, which looks pretty dingy. It's windows are boarded, and it looks abandoned. A lone motorcycle pulls up to the hotel, and a man wearing blue jeans and a blue shirt gets off and knocks on the door. An elderly man greets him.

""Hello. Do you need a place to stay?""

""Yes, please. I've been travelling for a long time and would like some rest.""

It's important to know that not only was this man wearing blue, but his person was completely blue; he had a blue face, blue hair, blue lips, blue teeth-- everything about this man was blue.

""I think I have just the place for you,"" croaked the man, and led him inside. They went up 3 flights of stairs, down 1 floor in an elevator, then went all the way to the end of the hall and came upon a blue door. Inside, everything was blue: the carpets, the walls, the bed; Weezer's Blue Album was playing-- everything was blue.

""Great, this is perfect,"" exclaimed the blue man.

""Just remember,"" replied the hotel owner, ""breakfast is at 8:30 *sharp*.""

Later, another guest pulls up to the hotel. He gets out and asks for a place to stay, and he turns out to be completely yellow! He has a yellow face, yellow eyes, yellow clothing, and a yellow body.

""I think I have just the place for you,"" says the hotel man, and he leads him inside, and they go down 6 floors into the basement, walk down a hallway for 3 kilometres, and finally arrive at a yellow door. Sure enough, everything inside is yellow.

""Wow, this is perfect! This is totally me! Thanks!""

""Just remember, breakfast is at 8:30 *sharp*!""

""Alright, see you then.""

Finally, a red Ferrari speeds up to the hotel in a cloud of dust. A man in a red racing suit walks up and demands a place to stay. He too is completely red; red hair, red face, and a red body.

""I think I have just the place for you,"" says the manager.

They then go up very high in an elevator, up to floor 160, but then go down the fire escape a few floors, and go into a room. The manager pushes a button and a bookshelf slides across to reveal a red door. Inside, everything is red! Taylor Swift is playing, Game of Thrones' Red Wedding is on the red TV, and everything in the room is red.

""Thanks mate, this is perfect.""

""Just remember, breakfast is at 8:30 *sharp*! Don't miss it!""

""Alright, I won't.""

Night falls, and each resident goes to sleep in their respective rooms. Eventually the sun rises, and they are all downstairs, ready for breakfast at 8:30. For breakfast there are only 2 choices: bacon and eggs and pancakes. The red guy steps up and helps himself to some bacon and eggs. The yellow guy thinks *yeah, red guy has it right. I'll have some of those too* and takes some bacon and eggs. The blue guy thinks *no, pancakes are where it's at* and gets some pancakes.

From this we learn that [2 out of 3 people prefer bacon and eggs to pancakes.](#s)","1412121779"

"DenverBroncos","t5_2s51j","We've used it since Peytons been here.  His first year it was Tamme/Dreesen, Last year we used Thomas/Tamme/Green and this year its been Thomas/Green/Tamme.  They use 2 TE's based on the defense were playing and what the Broncos want to try to do.  It helps with the pass pro if one TE stays in and it obviously helps out run o because they are just bigger dudes than our WR, but it does a bunch more than that.  With 2 TE's in, LB's have to account for the potential of the TE releasing for a pass, because of the extra responsibility the LB will tend to hesitate when the ball is snap because he will either have to cover the TE 1v1 or try to bump the TE before releasing into his zone,  this is all while still having to respect the run and plug their holes if need be.  Long story short, it allows our offense to do more, helps set up the individual matchups we want, and makes the defenses work harder.   ","1412121780"

"horror","t5_2qh9x","I'm glad you asked!

First, there really isn't much from the Fifties other than *I, vampiri* and *Caltiki, the Immortal Monster*, both by Freda courtesy of Bava. Italian Gothic Horror (which is basically the First Age of Horror for Italy) really kicks in in 1960 and its cycle largely runs out by 1969, when gialli usurped the number one position and began The Second Age of Italian Horror. Of course, there would be fusions of the Gothic with other modes past 1970, but it was far from dominant, and excepting the case of Bava, much less compelling or landmark. The most important directors are Bava, Freda, and Margheriti, though others would occasionally achieve brilliance.

In chronological order, here are some of the more important/interesting titles of the first period:

* *Black Sunday*
* *The Mill of the Stone Women*
* *The Horrible Dr Hichcock*
* *Slaughter of the Vampires*
* *The Whip and the Body*
* *Black Sabbath*
* *The Virgin of Nuremberg*
* *Castle of Blood*
* *Castle of the Living Dead*
* *The Long Hair of Death*
* *Terror-Creatures from the Grave*
* *La vendetta di Lady Morgan*
* *Kill, Baby, Kill!*
* *The Third Eye*
* *Nightmare Castle*
* *An Angel for Satan*
* *The Witch*

Later Gothic titles include

* *Baron Blood*
* *Lisa and the Devil*
* *Death Smiles on a Murderer*
* *The Perfume of the Lady in Black* (a giallo crossover)

Basically, any Bava rocks the socks off. 

Now looking at the second cycle, there's a whole school of gialli prior to Argento's incredibly influential debut; [this post](http://peanutbutterandgialli.wordpress.com/2013/06/27/a-quiet-place-to-kill/) has some history of the early giallo. 

Bava is again the place to start, but Umberto Lenzi was also huge, and *The Sweet Body of Deborah* was a major influence. Unexpectedly, Lucio Fulci's early gialli are more in alignment with the pre-Argento thrillers than the gorier later films. That really takes us past the Sixties, however (*One on Top of the Other* was Fulci's 1969 giallo; the others were early Seventies before he explored a more fantastique style). ","1412121784"

"forhire","t5_2qzbh","The hourly rate a team member earns really depends on a couple of things: The type of content they are writing and how efficient they are. For our authority stuff we pay $0.04/word, $0.02/word for the SEO content and $0.01 for the rewrites. The SEO content can be done in roughly 40 minutes once you're familiar with what we're looking for, and if you're familiar with the topic, that can drop to 30 minutes. To qualify for our authority service you have expertise in your niche, and consequently the research time required for an article is often reduced significantly and 500-600 words can often be completed in 40-45 minutes.

It's true that you can probably grind out $20/hr in some content mills, and if people want to write and research more for the same rate, that's their choice. I've actually been there myself a few years ago, and I honestly commend anyone that is able to put up with producing that stuff for any stretch of time.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","I once considered myself a middle-class American, but I came from generational poverty that my mom and dad couldn't escape. To live a better life than my parents, I worked 2 jobs to make my bills if I lived alone, or one job and attended school while having a roommate. When first starting out, I blamed my parents' for the poverty we lived in, even though my dad was working two jobs to support our large family. He became a stranger in my life, unable to attend baseball games, help with homework, or offer any of the life lessons to ensure my success as an adult. I now realize the heroic sacrifice my dad made to keep me fed, clothed, and sheltered, by forgoing his own comfort and sticking around. He voted Republican.  
  
Unlike the author, I do behave like a corporation in my day-to-day dealings with the corporate world. I think of this as 'exploiting hidden investment opportunities.' When I find a loophole in, for example, a corporate coffee shop or drugstore, I exploit it viciously. The same applies to energy companies, television/radio entertainment, and travel. And like a corporation, I feel absolutely no remorse for my actions. I feel no pity for the corporate world or the monied class because I know they care nothing at all for me. I encourage anyone and everyone to behave like a corporation, and look for ways to exploit them.","1412121795"

""We must introduce into their education all those principles which have so brilliantly broken up their order.""

""Classicism, as also any form of study of ancient history, in which there are more bad than good examples, we shall replace with the study of the programme of the future. We shall erase from the memory of men all facts of previous centuries which are undesirable to us, and leave only those which depict all the errors of the governments of the goyim.""

""In this way, by inculcating in all a sense of self-importance, we shall destroy among the goyim the importance of the family and its educational value [...]""

""We have in our service persons of all opinions, of all doctrines, restorating monarchists, demagogues, socialists, communists, and utopian dreamers of every kind. We have harnessed them all to the
task: each one of them on his own account is boring away at the last remnants of authority, is striving to overthrow all established form of order.""

""“Do not suppose for a moment that these statements are empty words: think carefully of the successes we arranged for Darwinism, Marxism, Nietzsche-ism…. it should be plain to see what a disintegrating importance these directives have had upon the minds of the goyim. ”

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; 3-D Biotechnology Developed for Space Shuttle medical research, a rotating cell-culture device simulates the microgravity of space. This allows researchers to grow cells in three dimensions. The device may one day help researchers find cures for dangerous infectious diseases and offer alternatives to patients who need organ transplant surgery.

This is a ""this might be useful someday"" statement. Except, to be blunt, the rotating cell culture approach wasn't all that successful, which is why we're using 3d printers for that purpose now ([More details](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/12/131218100227.htm)\).

I find that claim extremely questionable. Joysticks for gaming purposes pre-date the shuttle.

I'm on a college campus and I use their internet service. To use their service I have to sign in which allows them to monitor web traffic and block users from breaking policies.

My theory is that one or more of the files that I need to run the game is a torrent or something that my campus internet service thinks is a torrent. So what might be happening is that these files are being blocked by the anti-piracy filter.","1412121804"

These are people that have a lifetime of dealing with these situations in Los Angeles. I am willing to bet that YOU have never taken a civil rights case to court.

"KerbalSpaceProgram","t5_2smr1","yes, in order to calc those attrs the site would need to hold all the .cfg files for all known parts, just having the craft file is not enough. 

That in itself would be easy to do.  When someone runs the partmapper tool it reads in all the .cfg files in their KSP install but what it sends up to the site is just the part names and which mod it found them in.  Several reasons; a. so its fast &amp; b) most importantly so I'm not storing bits of mods. Sure its just the .cfg but it is still part of other peoples work and I don't think I should be storing that.  It's a bit of a grey area which I'd rather stay clear of! So all that is stored in the DB is the part names.  It also opens a couple of wormy cans to do with mod versions and those cfg files changing, which is much less of a problem when I'm just concerned with part names. 

Unfortunately you can't make any assertions from just part names as there is no standard naming convention (some mods follow a format of having the mod name in the part name, most don't).  So the part mapper builds associations based of folder structure and sends that info up to KerbalX. When craft are uploaded the site does a direct by name look up in the DB for parts and then the mods are known via a join table that links parts to mods.
(sorry if that was TMI!)

edit - just remembered what the main point of this conversation was!!
so, those attrs dV, TWR will be optional values that people can either enter themselves or not.  Which is not ideal, as a) its a problem for searches as craft without them will be excluded, b) people may put incorrect values. 
One possible option would be to have a mod that uses the game logic to calc the values and then adds that into the craft file where KerbalX can read it. But that adds a dependency on people needing to use a plugin in order to upload and I'm not a fan of that as I want pure stock players to use this just as much as mod players.","1412121805"

He clearly reacted to that player who zoomed out of the corner like a madman, and predicted where he was gonna be. Little did he plan on having a fat pole in the way, that absorbs like 70% of the damage. He did not ""try to shoot through them"", he didn't plan on that pole being there, when he swiped to the right. No one is intentionally aiming for those poles you spastic, that's kind of the whole point. If we have hundreds of poles across mid on mirage, the same issue would appear, except in greater numbers. Shotting through the poles, would be like an on/off switch for the bullets. The inconsistency lies in the fact that thing, is in the way. The way it reduces the damage like that is just obnoxious and annoying. How do you not see that?

"dwarffortress","t5_2qyn1","Long ago, the mountain-folk were one people.

But some learned the ways of elves, and adopted the practice of animal husbandry. They went into the caverns and tamed the Giant Cave Swallows, Giant Olms, and even the Cave Dragons that dwelled therein. Their society prospered, and they grew to tolerate their old enemies, the Trolls and the Ogres.

Others of the mountain-folk detested these ""innovations"", and all things elvish. They derided raising livestock as a slippery slope to cannibalism. And viewed Trolls as abominations. For them, the caverns remained places of danger.

The mountain-folk who raised animals became known to those that did not as ""gobblers"", a pejorative reference to their (notional) cannibalistic practices. Over time ""gobblers"" became ""goblins"" and it is by this name that they are known in the tongues of men. This because the cavern-dwelling ""goblins"" were less likely to make contact with the surface dwelling civilizations than the cavern fearing ""dwarves"".

Over time, many of the cultural prohibitions against animal husbandry were forgotten by the dwarves. But, the cultural divide between the mountain-folk, deepened by the Trollish and Ogre influences on goblin society, remained.

To this day the mountain-folk remain embroiled in war and blinded by centuries of hatred. Their animosity is so great that they cannot conceive of the notion that they are one race, though we low-landers can hardly perceive the differences between them.

As a practical note, it is well-known that confusing goblins and dwarves is a tremendous faux pas, sometimes fatal. It is commonly thought that goblins can be identified by their Troll-fur clothing, since dwarves do not sheer Trolls. (Troll fur is blue, and possesses a distinctive odor, reminiscet of chalkdust.) But, I must stress that **should the Troll-fur clothing-item bear blood-stains, the wearer is very likely a dwarf**. ","1412121806"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","The most important part of an encounter isn't the NPCs themselves, but it's the environment and reasons. If players encounter a group of goblins on the other side of the river that push a cart with a hand sticking out of it - that's an interesting encounter. Why? It's intriguing and interesting AND it involves some terrain which you could use for your advantage/disadvantage and do some tactics stuff.

When they enter a room, describe the fluff first, then go into important stuff. 2 reasons for that. For example, you enter a room, there's a sweet scent and there's a red carpet on the floor. Your torchlight is flickering but you see a chest in the corner. If you started this description with the chest, players would either a) stop listening to the rest of your description the moment you mentioned a chest because - hey, a chest, fuck everything else! or b) forget about the important stuff by the time you're done with your description. The chest falls into a) category but other important details definitely fall into b).

You ""teach"" creativitity step by step, by providing obvious choices with obvious consequences. You can either defend the captain who is being overrun by the kobolds or you can chase the assasin that killed the princess! After a while they will start asking questions like ""Actually, can I use hold person on the assasin and help the captain?""

GM is not a storyteller. GM points players in a vague direction and the players create the story using their actions. It will save you so much headaches the sooner you ""get"" that.","1412121809"

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","&gt; it's a relatively small question in my mind since we're already intelligent

I get most of what you're saying except for this. So because there are more questions that follow the answering of ""are we alone in the universe?"", it's not an important question? If NASA were to report that they had discovered extraterrestrial life, I can say for a fact that it would change humanity more in magnitude than any preceding moment in history. The questions that follow this don't diminish the importance of it. 

&gt; But we need art and philosophy just as much.

I really wish you would stop lumping philosophy in with art, I see philosophy being far more related to science than art, as it studies problems related to reality and existence. 

Art is great in regard to self-expression and identity, but not really for finding any truth about the world. Try telling the billions who rely on fertiliser produced via the Haber process that sustains their food supply that they *need* art as much as science. Or the people who rely on medication to stop them from having seizures everyday, or those who rely on pacemakers and prosthetics. 

&gt;I yearn for more and I find personal truth and beauty in art and philosophy. So to me, those questions are relatively small when compared to other questions.

"Nepal","t5_2qs6h","Great information and memories there friend. I'd like to point out that Today(Oct1) is not the day for sacrifices. It is on Friday. Mahanawami (9th day) and Bijaya Dashami(10th day) is on the same day (Friday), this year. Tomorrow is Fulpati which is when they are supposed to bring the ""[Jamara](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Dasain_Jamara.jpg)"" from Jamal to Hanumandhoka. But there might be 1-2 animal sacrifices, not sure though. I prefer to stay indoors on the 9th day.

Since the OP wants to check out animal sacrifices, I recommend him/her to go out around central Kathmandu (Kathmandu Durbar Square area) on October 3. You'll see people sacrifice animals to their vehicles. Pretty scary for me to watch. I sacrifice a coconut for my motorbike.

Also, Dashain is the festival when everyone goes home. So, you will find Kathmandu empty for a few days. Enjoy the crowdless moments when you can and there might be a few public Dashain bashes/parties here and there. But this festival is when people spend their time with their family.","1412121816"

You can see a preview here: http://bit.ly/1owHARz, and you can also access the full video and all our September videos on our site as well.  In terms of what I think, the best extempers really develop and extend their impacts.  So be sure to tell us why your arguments are important, on multiple levels if possible.  I also think the biggest mistake that extempers can make is not answering the question directly or not answering the question at all.  So before you start outlining, take an extra few seconds to be sure that you are answering this exact question.","1412121818"
"baseball","t5_2qm7u","What level of baseball are you playing?

At high levels, a good changeup is nearly impossible to adjust to on the fly (once the ball has left the pitcher's hand.)  At lower levels you can usually find a pattern from the pitcher in the count.  Pay attention to the pitches thrown and at what point in the count.  Expect offspeed stuff if your down in the count.  But also, practice hitting everything as if it's a fastball.  Stand in the batting cage and just watch 100 fastballs fly by.  Then turn the velocity down and do it again.  Then have someone randomize it and just try to shout out the speed ( fast or slow).  Don't use a bat, just try to recognize the speed as quickly as you can.


Then grab a bat.","1412121818"
"oneplus","t5_30qnb","When I was younger(around 9-10) or so, I started growing hair around my pubic area. At the time I thought that it was extremely unnatural(I haven't taken sex ed classes yet) and I felt super insecure about it as I thought to my self"" WHO GROWS HAIR AROUND THEIR PEE HOLE?"". It bothered me for a month or so and when more and more hair started growing I became more and more insecure about it and when I could start feeling the hairs touch my pants that's when I decided to do something about it. 

So me being a kid in grade 3-4 during that time(Can't remember), I talked to my best friend about it(Still best friends with him to this very day, I'm 21 now.) and asked if he had hair down in his ""pee area"" and he, being the same age as me said that he didn't and told me that I wasn't normal and said that I was going to be hairy all over to the point where I won't even see my own penis. So at this point im freaking out and I'm crying and I ask him if he could help me get rid of the hair.....

So my best friend being a fucking genius says ""Ok, you go down to the washroom during recess and I'll meet you down there after 5 minutes or so"" Recess starts and I'm just standing in the washroom by myself waiting for this guy, 5 minutes later he comes with ""Elmers White Glue and Duct Tape"". Me being a stupid innocent kid and at that time didn't think that anything was wrong with the shit that my friend bought, I imagined to my self that the glue and tape will just slide the hair around my pelvic region right off. I was fucking wrong. 

I pulled down my pants and my friend glued up my pelvic region with Elmers White Glue and then when it dried he applied duct tapeover it. After around 5-10 mins I laid down and closed my eyes. 

I ended up leaving school early and getting a skin graft on my pelvic region and the look of shame from my Asian parents. ","1412121818"

After I graduated with my M.A. I got a job in a field that was slightly related and when I got there I felt like the stupidest person in the building.  

They picked you because they liked more than what you immediately bring to the table, they likely picked you because of your potential, personality and attributes to make it in that industry.  The more lost you feel the worse it will get.  Don't at all be afraid to ask questions!  You need to show that you want to learn and are eager to learn.  If you don't have a ton of work, ask what you could be doing?  Summarize what you've done or make a list of things you think should be done and run it by your supervisor.  It's all about how you word things.  So you'll likely want to say, ""Hey ""Mr. Boss""!  I finished up X, Y, Z and was thinking of the best way to maximize the use of my time.  I was thinking of working on A, B, C but wanted to run it by you and see how I can best help you / the team.

Assuming you were 100% honest in your interview and didn't oversell yourself they knew who they were hiring.  Use this opportunity to show them that you want to learn, are a hard worker, self-starter and eager to do what's needed for the company/team.

"battlefield_4","t5_2uie9","&gt;This is because mouse movement is mapped linearly to the change in angular position, but the screen space is not mapped linearly to angular position. 

Is it though? Screen space is mapped to angular position. If I had someone's move along just outside my monitors view, that would follow an angle (out from my character).

It would be so much easier if I drew it out. I guess a better way to  explain it. Say a player is pretty close to you (forget about vertical and let's just talk horizontal here for a sec). You see the center of his nose 3 inches to the left of your cursor. Let's say for simplicity,  this also takes 3"" horizontal mouse movement to line up your crossair with nose (let's just talk hipfire here).

Now he proceeds to move farther away, keeping his nose, reletive to 3"" from your crossair (vertically). In order to do that, he must follow the same angular line, projecting from your character.

So if he is a mile away, it would still take 3"" of mouse movement to like your cursor up with his nose (assuming his nose remained in the same spot on your monitor),it would just look much smaller.","1412121820"

I understand your second point too...I think you'll find if you hang around a while you'll find you're not as atypical as you're feeling now.

I have jogged off and on for the last ten years (I started to make an excuse to hang out with my now-wife who was a jogger at the time), but that's really it.

Right, but we still label water. And salt, and vinegar and other things which are completely safe.

&gt; If it's tested and safe, it's not necessary consumer info.

That's a valid philosophy. A different philosophy would be just put everything on the label. Perfectly efficient markets require perfect information. One could make the argument that even something as completely innocuous as water, is somehow relevant information to someone, at some point. And something else is to someone else at some point. So  you can either try to reduce the cost of labeling and only label known dangerous things. Or try to maximize market efficiency and label everything.

""Shut your gobber,"" replied a man, obviously Rodrik. ""They're going to wake my dead father, I bet."" He chuckled. ""More wine?""

*Garlan! Garlan! Garlan! Garlan!* The sounds continued. Serra cursed herself and tried to get to sleep, but she couldn't. She tossed around in her bed, smashing her face into the pillows, but Mina Redwyne's screaming only seemed to get louder.

""More wine, aye,"" replied the man. ""They're fucking like dogs in there!""

""He might wed her, did you know?""

""The price of taking a woman's maidenhead. Last girl I took didn't quite scream like that, but I don't think that matters much, they're both enjoying it.""

*Marriage,* Serra thought bitterly. The thought of having the Redwyne girl as an older sister, as well as the bitter visual that came with their screaming, was not fond to Serra. Her heart was sinking in her chest and she curled up, looking for a way to escape the girl's consistent screaming.

""Well, you never know. Maybe the girl's there for a good time. The Redwyne Whore, we should start calling her.""

Y would always be shorter in time than X. They sort of concluded the same global consciousness with the fact that the older puzzles had been completed by more people as time progressed. 

Also, there has been some interest in the fact that certain advances in technology have occurred at similar times in history for locations that are geographically very far apart.

"dogecoin","t5_2zcp2","* Value comes demand for its use, just like any currency. If people do not have confidence in a currency thus not use it, it loses value.  

* In the early days it was possible to mine tens of thousands of coins per day with a basic computer, however now most people buy their coins, it is not all that expensive to buy 100K then use that to buys goods or just tip people.   

* Bitcoin was the first crypto and initially for the first 3 years it was well under the $40 mark. But demand for its use by underground/black markets drove the price up. (demand creates value).  Many people saw this and begun to treat bitcoin as a speculative commodity and not a currency.   
Which means people started to buy BTC in the hopes they can make money as it increases. Of course many did make money.  
However, many more people jumped into the bandwagon and started to buy more and more just in hope it goes up, this created a very strong push upward, so the price skyrocketed.   
It was a self fulfilled price rise, i.e. purely based on speculation, which means it had no real economic reason to be priced so high ($1,200~).  
Anyway, BTC experienced a few bad news and problems with exchanges, which means speculation of further increase in value halted, many people panicked and started to sell off.  
Then the price dropped down to a level were there was some kind of economic support, however even now you can see the price is still dropping. A currency needs to have economic support to have a stable value.   
Dogecoin started as a joke, but the community got behind the coin to build it as coin to help others. This also created demand, so initially it also attracted the people looking to make a profit based on speculation.  However we as a community reiterate that dogecoin is not an investment vehicle, we are creating a currency.  
If people want to still ""invest"" they should only ever invest what they can afford to lose. Dogecoins value is slowly going up but it is backed by a community that is building an infrastructure to support and circulate the coin. Thus it will rise organically as the dogeconomy grows.  

* Mining is not really an option for the average person. So treat dogecoin like you would treat currency from another country.  
Say you are going to travel to Japan, before you travel there in order for you to buy goods and services you need to carry their currency, so you would buy Japanese Yen using your local money (USD?) .  
Now when it comes to dogecoin, treat it the same. You now want to go to this new country the Internet, in order for you to buy their goods and services you need their currency, so just buy Dogecoin to cover enough of your expenses during your trip to the Internet.

"formula1","t5_2qimj","I think Kimi is a bit overrated, like you I think the Kimijerk gets annoying.  But man if you don't think driving style has a lot to do with racing, and that some drivers can be extremely fast in a car that suits their style and relatively slow in one than magnifies their weaknesses, you don't fully understand racing IMHO.

Don't get me wrong, all F1 drivers can change their driving style. But since different types of cars play to the strengths and weaknesses of each driver it's rare for a driver to be as quick as the quickest in each type of car right out of the gate.

A perfectly, instantly, adaptable driver is the exception rather than the rule.  Vettel has flat out stated the modern RB doesn't fit his driving style.  But adaptability is only one metric out of 100+ I would use to grade drivers.  And if you think about it, if the car is perfectly honed in, it's a metric that doesn't hold much weight at that point.","1412121827"

"Columbus","t5_2r373","Hey. I actually moved from Montreal to columbus to work at honda a year ago. If your looking for anything similar to Montreal when it comes to urban life you'll want to stay away from marysville and dublin. You're best bets are Victorian Village, Downtown, clintonville, Arena District, Short North or Grandview. It should be about 45-50 minutes from any of those. Brewery district is also cool but might be a slightly longer commute. One thing you'll definitely miss from Montreal is public transit. It sucks here. Period.

I commute from grandview right now and it takes me about 45 minutes to honda every day. Your going against traffic in the morning and afternoon. The most you'll get is an extra 10 minutes in the afternoon if you leave at just the wrong time. It's nothing compared to traffic on the 720, 15 or 40 in Montreal. In fact most of the time you can drive anywhere within the outer belt here within 20 minutes. 

I also climb and there a really cool outdoor wall that's free so long as you have your own equipment. Vertical adventures is a great gym here and though it can sometimes be crowded they're supposed to be opening up a brand new gym in the next couple months. There's also new river and red river gorge. Both amazing outdoor climbing/camping destinations within 4 hours.

Good luck. PM me if you have any questions or want to meet someone from honda. ","1412121827"

The real question, however, is whether you doing a special action (such as flipping a morph) passes priority back after the flip resolves, and I believe it does. (Though I am NOT an authority on that by any means.)","1412121827"

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","I'll do my best to explain this without getting into the exact specifics of how floats are stored in binary. I will discuss binary, but at a very high level.

For whole numbers, you can get the next one in sequence by adding one. So for a normal binary number like 0010 which is 2, you just change the last bit to a 1 and get 0011, which is 3. Let's take the number from your question: .30000000000004

Suppose changing the last bit for it increased it to just .30000000000005
It would take a lot of bits to get anywhere! With 32 bits we can only represent 4294967296 different values, so can't we only represent 0 to 0.4294967296? We know this isn't the case because we can represent all kinds of numbers as floats. The trick is that there is limited precision. Flipping a bit increases a float by much more than 0.00000000000001, the implication of this is that some numbers simply CANNOT be represented as a float, we skip right over them! In fact the number 0.1 can't be stored as a float, the computer has to round to the nearest possible float which is 0.100000001490116119384765625. This is why when you do math operations on floats the answers are a little funny, they had to be snapped to the nearest possible float!","1412121827"

Rejection an assertion is not 'jumping to conclusions.'

Rejection of an assertion due to fallacy, lack of evidence, vagueness, or other serious issues is the most intellectually honest position anyone can take on an issue. The null hypothesis is the only reasonable position sans evidence

I've noticed you've done this quite a bit in this thread, blamed people for 'jumping to conclusions' when they reject assertions for the above reasons.

This is dishonest, lazy, and useless. It is not debating. It's nothing more than a child-like *'cause I said so* argument.

Your arguments are poorly formulated, vague, full of error and fallacy, etc. If you attempted to use this type of logic in any other venue where knowledge and proof mattered, such as a debate over a particular medical treatment, you would be laughed at and thrown out the door before you killed someone.

I was actually very happy with the food choices - sure everything was expensive, but I had a lot of neat options for food made in ways I've never seen before. Amazing crepes, giant meatballs, some sort of meat pie thing that had all sorts of egg, cheese, bacon, and steak, belgian fries, and other cool stuff. If prices were like this and they only offered typical food you would see around America (Hotdogs, bbq, hamburgers, fries, etc.) then I'd be a lot less happy. But, from what pioneers were saying it looks like they made an improvement on that from last year.

I just wish the BBC had beer I've never seen or had before :( 

Edit: Also, for alcohol, it would have been smart to buy a bunch of cases of beer and leave it in the car. Come back out later with 3 friends, grab 4 cases, bring them in. Repeat as needed. Saw people doing this and wish I had thought of it :/","1412121833"

Their senses have adapted to be able to perceive the world in new ways since the ""natural"" world is mostly hidden from their sight as they are hidden from others. They skulk and scheme and generally hide in the shadows to do their work.

Then this shining figure arrives *who can see them* - they are not able to hide from him. He's tall and strong and well-armed and *pissed*. This is a guy who, when the time came, turned and faced down a Balrog so that others could escape. A group of old men does not scare him as he is *righteous*.

I generally viewed the description that Frodo gives of what he saw as being similar to what he would normally look like to the Nazgul. The ""in his wrath"" just indicated to me that it was obvious that he meant business in this fight. The fact that he's one of the Calaquendi who's still around in the Third Age says something.","1412121835"

"Thailand","t5_2qjw5","If money is no object, then just set up a company with 2mthb registered capital, hire four Thai employees and get a work permit and visa for either of you and the other can stay on an O visa. Then you can just abandon ship when the year is up, provided you don't want to return. Or you could wind down and liquidate the company after paying proper severance pay to the employees. Or you could keep the company going with or without the employees. 


You'll also need majority Thai ownership or wait not less than six months for a foreign business license that you probably wouldn't qualify for. To get it set up properly, including bank account, work permit, visas, social security and vat registration (perhaps not needed depending on the business purpose of the company), should run you between 5,000 and 10,000 usd in legal fees. 


Maintenance of the company is usually about 1,000 usd per year but can be done for less. Accountant/auditor fees are reasonable at 1,000 or so per year for a local, non-English speaking accountant. 


Then you've got your salaries, paid monthly at 300 THB per day minimum wage per employee. You also have to find a place to be your registered office, the lawyer might allow you to use their office, your landlord might to. Unless you're buying property with the company, where it wouldn't matter.

I find these discussions about expensive sex toys sort of ridiculous. I own both a hitachi and an expensive silicone vibrator that's a sub-brand of LELO, and I've used the hitachi a tiny handful of times when I was out of batteries, and the other one twice, because I have such a strong preference for my $4 bullet (bought on sale in combination with the hitachi) and my $15 plastic vibrator (which may be described as ""dildo-shaped""?). While I probably have spent $90 on sex toys, I'd never spend $90 on one sex toy, since I've hated every sex toy I've spent more than $30 on, and loved every one I've spent less than $30 on.","1412121843"

We started 8-0, with many of those wins being come from behind and very close wins. Lee Corso said we were the worst 8-0 team in the country. It didn't matter, though. We had the #1 defense in the country. They were just destroying people. Then, we went to Alabama, and our lack of offense caught up with us. Then came the second straight loss at Arkansas. We ended up in the freaking Peach Bowl. Again. I just kept thinking what could have been. 

2000 and 2001 were similar. 2000 was up and down, but finished on a strong note in the Snow Bowl. 2001 was 3-8, but we were only something like 17 points away from being 7-4. Then, of course, came the decade of hell.

"wiiu","t5_2sjnz","In my opinion the only complaints with the way things currently are is that Nintendo Land and Pikmin 3 multiplayer require Wii Remotes to use. This is likely because they are, or were supposed to be, launch titles. Nintendo's view at the start seemed to focus on the allowing people to use previously owned Wii Remotes for multiplayer (NSMBU was another launch offender but has since been patched). As things stand currently they seem to be taking the approach of Gamepad for single/first player and any subsequent players have options, almost all of which include the Pro Controller. 

This is really on par with the rest of the industry in terms of pricing (~$50) and availability, which were your complaints you listed.

I can see how the variety of options can be confusing to some, but I don't see how more options is not better. Except for the couple launch titles, just get as many Pro Controllers as you want extra players. Simple as that. The option many people have of using their Wii Remotes that they already had from their Wii is great and means that these people don't have to spend $50+ for multiplayer. I don't see how this isn't a plus for the console.","1412121846"

"Kikpals","t5_2vnle","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/kikpals because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R]  DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**





Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Thanks! :D

The big thing is that it is getting harder and harder to open a business checking account without EIN and State Registration.

10 Years ago could walk in with just a name and ssn and open a business account.

4-5 years ago you could walk in with your EIN and open an account.

In May of this year had to show them my EIN and register with the state to open an account. State registration was my Sales and Use Tax account.

I have done this over several Major Banks I have done this having other business and non business accounts with them so it isn't just one bank. But your experience may vary.

EDIT: EIN is super easy. If you are Sole Proprietor then you use the same EIN across different Sole Proprietor and can use DBAs for the different Businesses. Otherwise Separate EINs for Each LLC and Corporation. USE irs.gov to do it do it, anywhere else and you are getting scammed and paying for something that is free and easy to do.

EDIT: Setting up your business with the state is a little more involved but plenty of info on doing it. The first thing you need and hardest/consuming is setting up your articles of Incorporation if going that route but templates abound and although you can do it yourself for free, it is acceptable to get some online help here just don't pay much to do it. a couple hundred maybe?","1412121849"

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt; Replacing old bonds with new bonds denotes neither an increase nor a decrease. Simply business as usual.

Yes. However, as the article notes, it does pose a vastly increased existential risk that if interest rates rise, or investors become unwilling to lend each year, the Fed could find itself in a great deal of trouble very quickly. 

It is a conflict of interest for the Fed to control rates when the Fed has to borrow so much, and is therefore afraid of high rates. We may find ourselves in a situation where only higher rates can improve the economy and the fed will be unwilling to allow it to happen, due to what it will do to their borrowing costs.

Ultimately they will be forced to let interest rates float and then federal debt will explode. I dunno if debt service is over $1 trillion a year yet, but imagine that dangerous point. Debt service costs could easily triple if interest rates were left at the market rate.

&gt; In fact - good business would dictate that they replace all bonds before they increase the over night rate to lock in as low a rate as possible. The US Government ought refinance every damn debt it can at the current 0.25%. Right now is the time to invest in $500 billion in infrastructure upgrades.

The gov isn't capable of investing as efficiently as the free market can, unfortunately. So they may build some good things, but at an existential and invisible loss to society in general.

Physically this makes sense, as the scaling factor e^\lambda ^t is going to have to stay relatively small with respect to the 500 year time parameter.  Throwing out jargon to an audience who obviously doesn't know it is usually regarded as a sign that one does not understand the topic.

On to my funny cats story. We have several cats, [here are three of them hanging out in the dryer.](http://i.imgur.com/9hlYpte.jpg). 

For reference, the tiny black one, Tasha, weighs 4.4 pounds and the giant white one, Snowbird, weighs about 11.4 pounds. Recently, Tasha has decided that she'd like to try to scruff Snowbird, like a momma cat would do to her kittens. Due to the size difference, it doesn't work, of course. But that doesn't stop Tasha, so you'll sometimes see Snowbird walking around casually, with Tasha hanging by her mouth from the scruff of his neck. I need to get photos of this happening sometime. 

No cat will ever be exactly the same as your Hook, but someday when the time is right, I'm betting you'll find a kitty that is equally awesome. :)","1412121855"

"travel","t5_2qh41","Depends how long you are going for. If you are going for four or more days you should really look into one of the Epic passes for the Vail properties. That includes Keystone, Breckenridge, Vail, Beaver Creek, and access to Arapahoe Basin. There are a bunch of different passes that have blackout dates at certain facilities so  be sure to read the fine print but you can really save a lot of money on lift tickets that way. 

If you are just skiing for a few days Copper or A-Basin may have cheaper day passes. Look for lodging in the Frisco or Dillon area, both through normal hotel options and VRBO or AirBnB as there are plenty of condo rentals. Try to cram in as many people as you can to save money. 

Food prices on the mountain are a massive rip. Make yourself a sandwich or hit up Subway before you go up for the day, throw it in a bag and skip paying $25 for a burger meal. 

I think Park City and Canyons in Utah are both on the Epic Pass this year also, but flights to Salt Lake City are probably going to be pricier than Denver, although in your case that may not matter.

Actually, now that i think about it, look into Steamboat, Telluride and Aspen as well. I usually skip them because of higher air fare but that might not be the case for you. ","1412121862"

"ResinCasting","t5_2yqob","I believe it could work, but can't make any promises.  You'd probably want to use something like epoxy resin for this.  Possibly even just that 5-minute gel adhesive from the hardware store.  Mix the glow-in-the-dark pigment into parts A &amp; B equally before mixing A &amp; B together to ensure a good mixture.

I wouldn't recommend wiping off the excess; if you do that, it's very easy to have portions that are too low.  It's better to have a little excess everywhere.  You'd need to grind/polish it to make it flush with the surface of the glass.  Yes, this will scratch the glass, but you just keep going to higher grits and eventually to diamond paste and a buffing wheel, and the scratches go away.

The glass and the resin are going to have different rates of thermal expansion.  If the resin isn't physically locked into place, there's a chance it could come loose if pushed to any temperature extremes.  Epoxy has a little elasticity to it, so it might manage a little better than more rigid alternatives like polyester and some polyurethane resins.

"texas","t5_2qho4","I can relate to the sentiment of wanting to root out cronyism. But betting on the tea party isn't where you start. There is a massive network of shady politics and dark money bank rolling these candidates so they can exert influence in the legislature. Many of these candidates don't realize it, but they are pawns. 

And by organizations funneling money I am referring to Tim Dunn, Michael Quinn Sullivan, basically all the organizations that attended the Values Voters Summit, Empower Texans, James Leininger, Texas Public Policy Foundation... I could go on.

The web these orgs and people make is big and it is VERY well funded and they are all working in concert on a very ideological, radical, religiously motivated right wing agenda. Every last break off of all these orgs have several 501c3's and 501c4's etc. etc. that are ""non partisan"" (lol), and using money for political purposes when it is not supposed to be. 

I want less religion in politics, not more. What about the whole separation of church and state deal? Why do they like some of the constitution but not all of it?

Oh right because all those people and organizations (see: Wallbuilders Presentations, inc.) are working to eradicate the idea of separation of church and state and replace it with the ridiculous falsehood that what the Founding Fathers meant to say was they were building a one-way wall to protect religion from government. This mission is not unrelated to the recent text-book debacle.

I do think we can agree that cronyism is bad, only I see the Tea Party as facilitating a whole new beast, comprised of the same players who lost power with DeLay. The same people are behind the curtains, they are just using fundamentalist ideology as wheels. ","1412121869"

The unemployment rate for pharmacists is still less than average too, but considering the average student takes out over 120k in loans, this is concerning. It is also becoming more and more competitive for jobs, though with that said, this isn't really too much a bad thing, especially where it counts. All of my students and residents for the past several years (that were worth a damn) had positions either upon completion of school/training or within a month or two after...

It's interesting, I went through a bout of that in my late 20's, lots of stress, couldn't stay hard on bottom.  When we're on top, we're holding our weight up, moving, blood is flowing, so it was easy.  But on bottom, I can rest and with the stress of the day and such it made it easy to relax too much.

IMHO, again just my opinion, what you can do is stimulate him, use your hands, your mouth, and your body, do more than just sit and twerk in his lap.  For example, and please forgive the graphic language, lean in and put your chest in his face.  Nibble him in places, whisper in his ear how great you feel with him inside of you.  Try reverse cowgirl, scratch his inner thighs and use your nails (lightly) on his balls.  This also really works well if he likes the view of your bottom.

Be active on top, keep his interest on you, show him the advantages of you being on top.

One other thing, and this may just be me, sliding all of the way down and grinding...I know it feels great for you, but for me it does nothing and actually can be uncomfortable.  The more full movements you do, the more stimulating it is for him.  If getting that high up off of him is difficult, feel free to lay down on top of him and move your hips just like he does when he is on top.  Full strokes.

One last thought, and again, this is just me...show enthusiasm.  If it feels good, show that it feels good.  If you're just about to lose control, let it show on your face and in the sounds you make.  If you're bouncing up and down boredly, like an Amish woman churning butter, that's boring for everyone.  But if you're impaled on me, writhing like you can't sit still, biting your lip, eyelids fluttering, losing your mind because it feels so good for me to be inside of you...well, losing my erection really isn't a problem at that point :)","1412121873"

Even he pointed out that it was becoming clear this was not a fight the US should involve itself in, specifically because of the regional nuances of the civil war.

Next scene shows the wife going through some mail and opening up the credit card bill. Of course she sees all these transactions and knows exactly what she's getting. 

Final scene they're sitting around the Christmas tree and the husband hands her the largest box. Without even opening it she exclaims ""Honey thank you so much you know how badly I've wanted these shoes!"" and puts the box down, still wrapped. Next the husband hands her the smaller box and she yelps ""Oh my god it's beautiful! I've always wanted a necklace with a topaz pendent!"" She puts the box down unopened. Confused the husband hands her the card and without skipping a beat she goes ""Oh I love that spa! I've been dying for a good facial for months!"" and wraps her arms around her still confused husband.

If she throws a fit on the leash, don't talk to her or punish her, act like its not even happening and walk faster and with purpose. Make her feel like her behavior is making her left out of all the cool stuff you know about because you are more awesome than her. 

Reward any good behavior you see. While she is walking nicely, praise her and treat her. I recently read an article that compared the effects of just verbal praise for a dog and physical touch.

Here, let me do it in reverse: ""I actually spend my time selflessly being a real-time source of support for learners, whereas she's just this girl that has made yet another free introductory Chinese course like the million others on the internet"". See? Indeed, if you collated all of my posts from every website I've ever posted on, you would see that I had submitted far more content than is contained in this Chinese course. This is, of course, not to say that I've done more than /u/Sprachprofi; she has many many other achievements too. She might even have done far more than I have. But we both do good work.

Again, I repeat: while I think her creating a fully-fledged product is fantastic, I actively object to doing so myself, mostly because I prefer to remain anonymous.

&gt; And charging for an education? She's charging for a product and a service. We don't live in a Utopia, sorry.

"space","t5_2qh87","Not really. Mars doens't have a magnetic field *or* a thick enough atmosphere to make it habbitable, even after terraforming. On top of that, we don't know how poorly mars microgravity will effect humans over a long period of time, for all we know it could *kill* us, make birth impossible,etc. It may take millions of years of going there and dying by the droves to evolve to the conditions on mars (even post terraforming).

No form of terraforming is going to make the atmosphere thick enough to sustain a biosphere on its own, because the lack of a magnetic field is going to make it extremely vulnerable to both solar wind and cosmic radiation. You know those GRBs that have to do a direct hit on earth from a star within a few dozen lightyears? Well, ones a lot further out only have to hit mars with a glancing blow to wipe out any life since there is no magnetic field to absorb most of it. 

Top it off with the fact that the biggest nail in the coffin for life in our solar system is billions of years down the line when the sun ends its main sequence, at which point it doesn't matter if you're on mars, venus, earth, whatever - this Solar System will no longer be habbitable. We will have to go interstellar.

Want to know a real reason to try and colonize mars? Practice. When we eventually can get out of the solar system, practice at mars, moons of saturn, and the further out moons of Jupiter will mean we've solved most of the challenges of colonization, and by the time we have the capabilities of going interstellar we'll only have to solve the problem of getting the necessary people and materials to the new star system. 

Oh, and there's a lot of profit to be made in spreading human civilization out through the solar system, but a million people on mars is such an arbitrary number. ","1412121881"

"latterdaysaints","t5_2uas2","I used to feel the way you do. General Conference was a dreary duty that I often simply avoided and called it a day off from church. But now? I'm actually excited. I love it. 

I don't get nearly as much out of it as I should, and I never go back and read that talk that I promised myself I would read, but I get super jazzed every time.
 
I love the togetherness of it. Together with family, together with the church, and together with the leaders who I have come to love and admire. More recently, I have enjoyed getting together with other members online in social media. It's neat. I really feel an abundance of love and positivity through the conference experience.

I get excited about the sub-reddit, and seeing what others get out of conference. 

I get excited to see #ldsconf trend on twitter, and see how people talk about their ""favorite"" apostle. 

I love the shared enthusiasm for the gospel at all different levels of activity, from the disbelieving youth who will never admit he actually enjoys sitting next to his dad during priesthood session, to the over-the-top gospel sharer friend on facebook making endless pinterest images from quotes. 

The messages themselves? I rarely get an immediate connection to them. In fact, maybe only once per conference do I listen to a talk and ""get it."" But I do try and listen. I try to come with my questions and concerns in mind, and usually I get guidance.  I should be most excited about that, I know, but I'm far from perfect. 

Ugh.  I'm going to stop gushing now.

"Wasteland2","t5_2tq7k","Except it isn't at all like fargo put even a modicum of the wasteland budget into character models.  He probably got exactly what he paid for, which was a workable character model that looks hilariously shitty up close, and fine from the gameplay perspective.  It's not like he spent money in the area and someone just sucked at their job, it's more that he didn't spend the money to get anything graphically done on the professional level, portrait-wise.

You can argue that this was the wrong move, but since noticeably higher-quality character models would not only cost $100,000s+, but also put added strain the game engine (putting additional costs in optimization and elsewhere), AND wouldn't even be noticeable from the zoomed-out perspective of gameplay, doing so would basically be burning money that could have been spent (and was spent) writing thousands and thousands of pages for storylines, alternate endings, unique dialogue,etc.

I've read that Wasteland 2 has more text than all the Harry Potter books combined.  And personally, I'm happy that the money went to the writers of a dialogue-based game, rather than the graphic designers, considering the default player view of everything is about 600 feet in the air above all the action.","1412121886"

Instead of going for what I want, I too often go for what I can get, then start realizing my own self-worth too late, so I'm frustrated and the other person sees me ""changing"" and honestly, it drags out too long.

I imagine the balance will be tricky to achieve in a dry cider, less so in a sweet cider.

I would check Homerbrewtalk for spiced cider and see how much people add.

Alternatively, I would heat couple cups of water to 190F and drop the cinnamon in and make a tea. Strain and add this to the cider.

And I’m just praying that Lil Dicky love it
Always told myself that this the type of shit I wanted
I was being honest, even made a promise
Not with anybody else, this was inner conscious
Talking to my fucking self, das a little bonkers
I know, I still got a lot of shit to conquer
I hope, that ain't even ma concern tho
You know I’ll be working till I get what I deserve
Whatever totems I get personally you know I’ma earn those
This ain't even bout some shit up on a checklist
This about the fact that I’m about to test this
I’m about to figure out what ma best is
I can't avoid it because now ya boy invested
And I ain't gotta a choice except to smile and accept it
Pretty reckless, pretty restless cuz
I’ve lived my life expecting love
To come the second my attempt was done
And yea I guess to some extent I was correct because I’m getting buzz
But now I’m bout to be ubiquitous, look it up
Yeah, or that’s at least what I’m assuming
But as alluded to reality is looming and
Now ya dude about to make a move and take the truth
And hope to god that when he through
That what he thought about is proven
But honestly im not afraid that it’s delusion
I’m hot enough to where I know it’s not illusion
But obviously I been finding this confusing
This ain’t even close to what I thought I would be doing
Don’t get me wrong, I was born to be big
But I always figured it would be the comedy things
So I started rapping just to see what drama it brings
What big dogs from sitcoms would hollerat me
And as the time past, I rhymed faster, lines crafted
Was high class as I mastered my craft and
Goddamn, who’da thought it get like this
Back in 2010 music wouldn’t make that list
I’m talking top 5-10 strengths, wit no winks
I would not lie, ma pen dry, wit no ink
Or…that’s at least what I thought
Till I clawed and scratched the pen till I saw a line draw
Then I coulda let bygones be bygones
But I really wanted to rhyme till ma line drawn
Like where the fuck is ma peak at
Not Brown but I make it pop, then I beat that
Not crowned yet, but I don’t think I decreed that
Not loud, but you know I’m ready to tweet that
I just really hope I’m ready to be that
Now you seeing where D’s at
Cuz even tho I’m softer than a tissue I ain't nothing to sneeze at
I’m smarter, where fuck ya degrees at
And I ain't harder but I’m hotter homie, where da fuck ya degrees at
I’m bout to come in and desaturate
The chic rap today
And evaporate
The feedback I hate
I’ll elaborate
At a later date
But I’m getting off the point with the player hate
What the fuck was I saying, oh_yeah
I’m kind of a slave
To my ambition, I ain't quittin till ma shit is appraised
And I admit it, I predict that where I finish is crazy
But that just means that it’s further away
So…Burd about to work until he turn in his grave
It’s really burdensome when earning something’s fun for the day
But I’m concerned about da burning out from upping the stakes
I’m always uppin the steaks
I’m taking dinner meetings in New York, always up for the steaks
We exploring the discussion of great
They assuring me that when I’m more elite
I’ll be secure and amazed
But this isn’t insecurity mayn…
Like this the opposite of that, confidence in fact
Ma biggest problem is I can't honestly relax
Because inside of me a damn odyssey enacts
And I made a promise that I can't be the body that’s stopping it
Think I need a lobotomy
Lil dicky the prophecy
Little bit of anomaly, not a commodity, not a façade, or a lotta
Da Comedy prodigies commonly brought up wit Dicky
Feelin weird, lemme think of an analogy
Just imagine for a second what if Russell Westbrook never knew his own mentality
Grew up on a farm where the biggest commonality
Was people that conform to the ruralest localities
To Russell though it was nuffin but normality
And he really nice up on the plow in actuality
Everybody liked the kid and dug his personality
And so da mutuality was somewhat rationality
So then ya man made a plan of practicality
Not even a plan, it was more of a formality
Get a little land and attend to its vitality
Then raise a little fam till it all became finality
The strategy was just to stay in the course
And do ya chores, when ya happy you ain't need to abort
Never explored nothing less he rollin round on his horse
Then one day he was up on his horse
That’s when he went past the porch
The path he normally passes forth
Was fast and short, was after more
Went faster north, amassed a lure
To master more…and then discovered the court
He like yaaa…let me down Tim
Hopped off, lookin puzzled at the round rim
Saw a ball up in the corner on the ground then
Russell started dribbling and giggling astounded
Then he shot a brick and then a brick and then he downed it
And when he hit it Russell listened to the fuckin sound friction
Up in a swish make and he was confounded
Because he knew that he had found him
But right now, it was still for the fun
Just a way to kill the time when the farming was done
Then the walking turned to running, and the hoppin turned to jumping
And dunking, and Russell had to keep coming because the young’n was fucking
Disgusting and loving it, running it, all of a sudden the public started to come
In abundance and fuck wit him, cuz he was butter and hungry, hung jury
Cuz stories of glory not normally for people like him
Then the word got around up to ESPN
And they flying Russell down to compete in the gym
Bunch a grown men lookin to belittle the kid
Because to those men, ball was the reason to live
And the GOATS they been all in since they was kids
So this goat owning mafucka look like a dick
And even know Russell knows that, he doesn’t submit
He just chills wit a grin
And then the game start, and this muthafucka take charge
Make it rain, hard D up on these bitches making children of men
Lookin better than his predecessors ever could get
Turned the animosity to respect
And then the Thunder called him
Said they heard a lot about the ballin
Told him that they wanna get involved and
Showed him all the shit that you can get up in the league, it’s so appalling
Oklahoma City in the autumn, hella pretty
Awesome, errbody laud him
Erry bitty lookin like they really fucking fallin
Condominium is so legitimate it’s sprawling
And this muthafucka on the court straight ballin
Cash all up in that ass
Lol’ing at the past like, where the fuck would I be at up on the other path
Right?
If I never stumbled pon the game then think of that life

Shit, who taking care of ma farm?
Who taking care of ma farm?
Who taking care of ma farm?
I really loved that farm…uh

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;So they are willing to trash their economy, submit their people to years of sanctions, isolate themselves in the world community, and all that just so they could ""defy"" the west? That belief is laughable, and is not even remotely believable.

It's actually exactly what it is. Iranian mentality is very different and there's a strong martyrdom culture when it comes to standing up against perceived aggressors. This dispute fits exactly into the Hussein vs Yazid narrative that defines their government and the Twelver ideology. Furthermore, most of the population supports the rights of the country to have a nuclear program despite the sanctions. If you aren't aware of this, then you need to pick up a book and learn something about the country. By chance, I recently saw a documentary that explains this element of Twelver ideology quite well. It's called [Once Upon a Time in Iran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6v30pA7oMY) and focuses on **exactly this problem with Iran that you deny exists**.

Nonetheless, Ayatollah Khamenei issued a fatwah against developing and  using nuclear weapons. You might wonder if that even means anything. Well, when Saddam was killing Iranian troops with chemical weapons, the earlier Khomeini banned the Revolutionary Guard from retaliating with chemical weapons and told them to destroy the stockpile built by the Shah - and he signed onto the CWC on his own accord. In the last ten years there is still zero evidence that Iran has a weapons program.

This is a complex situation and you can't try to apply your own logic to the situation when you haven't read up on the history of Iran and Iranian politics.","1412121895"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A throwaway. 

But there is this one dude who was my childhood friend, but I haven’t talk to for a long time. He ended up dating and marrying this younger girl who is the daughter of his next door neighbor when she was still in high school. She birthed 3 boys in 2 years, two of them twins. Yet, each time she somehow lost the weight instantly afterwards and she now looks hot and slender with a body of a goddess. She’s like 22 or 23 now. Seeing her each time carrying her 3 babies around usually gives me a rock hard boner. So bad that, one time I saw her came home late at night the same time I did. We parked our cars at the same moment. I waited for her to get out first, she was wearing a tight white dress and she bended over to pick something up in her car as her ass is pointing right at my direction. She then proceeded to arch her back and curved her chest forward to stretch her back. I was mesmerized by her and just had it. I whipped out my cock and just rubbed one out sitting in my car as I stared at her rocking her hips back and forth as she walked back to her house. With the load I blew on my hands, I bravely walked up to her parked car, and rubbed my jizz all over her door handles and the chassis. The thought of knowing my jizz is all over her car, I eventually jerked off again later in the night in my bedroom. There, I walked back out to her car and wiped more of my jizz there. This eventually became a weekly and ongoing habit.

And, because they give us wholesome anime and manga fans a bad rep. I'm open irl about liking manga (even studied Japanese to the point of being able to do an independent study abroad program originally because of my interest), but I know a lot of people irl who are afraid to broadcast their liking anime because of sad, creeps like this guy.

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","Your post shows that you have never used Windows 8. It is quite amazing once you actually use it, I honestly can't go back to Windows 7 anymore.

&gt;Well i know the app store is on windows 8 and 8.1 one of the reasons why i still use windows 7

So a completely optional new feature is why you continue to use an outdated OS?

&gt;Which i know i can remove with start 8 but cant be arzed to install a additional program for something that should have been there in the first place.

Windows 7 can't mount ISOs, so you need a 3rd party program for that. Windows 7 also can't put different wallpapers on each monitor in a multi monitor setup. These are basic things that should be there in the first place, but can be done with a 3rd party program. Windows 8 has them native.

&gt;And i don't really mind the store as long as the windows install doesn't come with a bunch of preloaded apps similar to a smart phone.

It only installs a small handful of apps, all of which can easily be uninstalled, easier than uninstalling all those preinstalled apps that come with Windows 7.

&gt;Like the app market i don't need it prob wont use it ever so it takes up unnecessary space.

It doesn't take up much space, its just a basic app to let you browse the market and install apps. It can't be removed as far as I know, but it can be disabled.

&gt;The tiles on the start menu i don't need a bunch of short cuts covering a 4th of my screen when ever i open up the start menu.

Tiles are adjustable in size, in the ""small"" setting, they take up the same space as a normal sized desktop icon. Larger settings give info, so you don't even need to open the app many times. For example, I can tell if I have new Reddit messages by the live tile for Reddit To Go. Same with my email inbox, weather, and so on. Quick glance I can get basic info without having to open an app.

&gt;I also don't need my start menu search to be linked as a additional search engine.

Actually it is quite nice. 99% of the time I don't use it (old habits) but it can be quite helpful, searches things like your Onedrive, browsing history, in addition to news and stuff on the web. That said, if you really don't want it, it is easy to turn on/off.

&gt;I use it to find specific programs not to look stuff up on the web and i don't want it to get clustered with unnecessary guff.

Yep, do a programs search and it only brings up programs! It lets you filter many things, it is quite awesome, vs Windows 7's ""lol here is everything you don't want like system files and readme.txts!""

&gt;When i'm trying to open something like msconfig for example and it will prob be linked to bing out of the box.
So if i where looking for msconfig it would show me results for socks or something.

http://i.imgur.com/as72rm3.jpg

&gt;Oh and i never said windows on all devices was bad that can actually be a pretty good thing.

It seriously is a good thing, MS has been slowly working their way there. Universal apps are great. Code the app once, and with only minor tweaks to get it to work great regardless of screen size.

&gt;And hopefully they wont fuck up any xbone to PC ports unless they do it on purpose sense its basically running on a PC at that point.
A really under powered and several years old PC but a PC none the less.

That is in my opinion why ports of console games as of late have been quite a bit better than others in the past, in the end the PS4 and XB1 have a lot more in common with the PC than the previous consoles.

For the most part, I don't mind being on probation for my GPA, I just want to be admitted to a program.

People make the mistake of thinking religion is responsible for all the ills of the world.  The truth is religion has been used as an excuse for some evils but didn't create it.  There are bad people in the world.  Always have been, before religion even existed, and always will be.  

Now I didn't say ""always will be, after religion ceases"" because just as there are and will be evil people in the world, there will always be people of faith.  It's practically in our DNA.

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

"cringe","t5_2r6rj","&gt; And one reason they wanted to get away from their Ottoman past was the lack of education and scientific thinking that led to them being way behind technologically.

[*What?*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_in_the_Ottoman_Empire) That's completely wrong as you can see. The Ottoman Empire at the time was one of the world leaders in science and education.

&gt; Also, he wanted to get away from the whole hatred for kafir thing the Ottomans had going.

What's this about? I've never heard of it.

&gt; The changing of script was just an example of the changes Ataturk put in place. He did it so that Turkey would have an easier time learning Western languages and thus absorb education from the West easier and spur Turkey on the path to rapid modernization.

That's pretty stupid. Does China change their langue and script to learn western knowledge? Does any other Arab country? Did India leave Sanskrit? That's one of the most bullshit excuses I've ever heard. Ataturk was very anti-Islam and Arabs, so he did all he could to move the country away from anything related to it. So he forced the entire population to change it's script and writing style because of his warped ideology. 

&gt;  Why a country being Islamic is seen as bad is answered by a post in /r/videos[1] today. It's currently at No. 5

*Oh honey.* That video is one of the most biased things I've seen in my life. Have you ever heard of [MEMRI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Media_Research_Institute)? That's where this video is from. The video is full of bias and generalizations. And it's hardly an argument if you're just yelling at someone.

&gt; Headscareves have traditionally been banned in Turkey

And you're ok with this? Women aren't allowed to wear headscarves if they want to? How are you ok with making it mandatory to *not wear a scarf*, but when it's mandatory to *wear* a scarf all of a sudden you wake up and think it's a bad thing?

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","The ultimate reason that sensible-looking numbers like, say, 0.2, end up behaving more oddly than you might think is that floating point numbers use binary for partial values and not decimal, which means that some values you think should be easy to represent (say the value of 1 divided by 5), are actually quite hard. In decimal, 1/5 can be written as 0.2, but in binary, it's 0.0011001100110011....

Other numbers, like 1/2, are easy to write in both. In decimal, it's 0.5. In binary, that same number is 0.1. So a float could probably easily handle it exactly.

You can't completely fix this, either. Floating point numbers can't represent all possible numbers in their range. For instance, a 64 bit floating point number could theoretically represent about 10^19 different distinct values (there are 64 bits, each can have one of two values, and 2^64 = about 10^19), but the largest value you can represent with a 64 bit floating point number is about 10^308, which is way, way higher. Therefore there have to be lots and lots of numbers that floating points simply can't actually be set exactly to, which is what makes them different from integers.

Pitcher | Pedro Avg FP | Pedro GP | Josh Avg FP | Josh GP
---|----|----|---|---|	
B.Cumpton	 | 0.917	|7| 1.000 |3
C.Morton	|0.943	|19|0.900 |5

I ask because (unless you intend to be a SAHM) your career is your long-term ticket. Sure, people talk about family first and all that, but people have children in really poor working circumstances and everything works our because it simply has to. I think ultimately, you should do what's best for your long-term plan (ie., career, unless you'll be a SAHM) and everything else will just fall into place. 

Given that above statement, I suggest you don't base your job choice on family leave policies UNLESS all else is equal between two job choices. Again, everything else will just work out. ","1412121911"

Bear has been sleeping with swine, and has been corrupted by the evil capitalist pig dogs.  he charge me, but all I have is bottle of vodka, and tiny squirrel killing pistol.  I shoot him with tiny capitalist cartridge, but bear is only enraged by this.  So I jam my 3 liter bottle of vodka down his throat, make him drink like true Russian Comrade, and smash bottle over his head,  He died shortly after.

What can't you understand about how sometimes gender ratios are going to be skewed? It happens in gender-balanced environments, it's *more* likely to happen in gender-dominated environments, what do you not get? It's seriously confusing me here about how you could possibly, ***possibly*** be so obtuse and stubborn with absolutely no actual argument to back it up. ""Women exist"" is no argument. I've defeated it in the past many times, but you keep bringing it up. ***There is no 'fem-friend' quota a woman must fulfill to be a decent human being. A white man does not require a black friend to know that black people exist, and he does not require a black friend to be able to at least listen in on discussions about racial tensions. Similarly, a woman not having female friends is not indicative of whether she is a good person or not. At all.***

I said it many, many times, but I'll say it again. The character of a person is more important when befriending them than whether or not they are of a particular group. The compatibility of people does not depend entirely on their race, gender, sexuality, or other such qualities; to hate them for such is evil, but to love them only for those qualities is little better.

Suggestions:

* Motorcycle

* Skydiving


* Scuba Diving


Or maybe develop a passion for something? It could help to take your mind off of the negative, and you might start to forge a version of yourself that you like a lot more!

Suggestions:

* Particular field of education (Try Coursera.com or maybe take a night class at a local Community College)
* Start following a sport more religiously
* Hit the gym

"weightlifting","t5_2rlwc","First of all, yes, absolutely, you will hit rough patches. Everyone hits them, even the best lifters; Caine Wilkes talked about having to take a break for two or three years. I've certainly had them.

There are many possible causes, and this is one of those things that is a bit of your own personal journey. Sometimes the answer is simple: you need to take a break.

It is natural in weightlifting to want to go, go go. We always want to be better, to be able to lift more, and we've embraced the culture of needing to train more and/or harder to improve. Just look at how many people tell us how there's no such thing as overtraining.

Easy to say, until you hit the slump.

You say you've been lifting for two years; have you ever taken a break for more than a week? Not just a break from snatches where you're still squatting, but a REAL break with no training?

Another possibility is a creeping mobility problem. In every snatch from last week's video you were bent forward in the bottom, more so than is generally good and definitely more so than in the opening 73kg snatch in your video from a few months ago. Any reason to believe your shoulders, pec minors, lats, upper back, lower back, hips, groin, or calves (to name a few!) have gotten tight? Not being able to hold a good bottom position can cause many snatch misses and wreak havoc on your shoulders.

In other words, you are not alone, check your mobility, and consider taking time off to clear your head if nothing else.","1412121918"

I got the Paraguard over a year now and am super happy I made the decision. It's just SO convenient. It's reliable. Sex is better. And it keeps me from making some drastic life decision without really thinking things through (and scheduling a dr.'s appt) first. 

My personal experience is that my periods went from 3-5 days with light-regular tampons to 5-7 days, with a few days of heavy tampons, then regular, then light. I have spotting some during the month. Every now and then I get a painful but very short cramp in my cervix. My periods weren't very painful before and they aren't very painful now either. I use Motrin for a day or two and then I'm fine. I rarely need to use a heating pad. I've never been unable to go to class or work because of my period.

I understand some people have periods from hell with Paraguard, but it doesn't happen every time. To me, being hormone free was worth the extra pain, and I lucked out.

    #someID ul li a {text-decoration:none;}

This will prevent the underlining of links, but only those that match this specific container nesting.

Also, the more exact you make a nested rule like that, the more precedence it has.

Urwald was irritating, I noticed that while I was practicing... The other word I kept flubbing was zerbeißen, I kept saying other verbeißung or zerbießung...

For Wildtier: you mean I rhyme it with Am English ""steer"", ""beer""? I thought that was how you pronounce both -ie- and -ee- (as in ""oed und leer"") in German.

If you want it to deal fire damage, it would probably make more sense to call the it the ""Bag of Brimstone"" or something like that, and players simply throw flaming stones from it instead? This could actually be a really cool opportunity to have several different types of these bags in your campaign, each with a different effect and damage type! Or maybe you fill the bag with several handfuls of a small item of your choice such as fireflies, rocks, bits of coal, ice, etc. The bag preserves these things indefinitely and when you take out a handful you can throw it and the effect will be based on what you put in the bag.

I want to say that discrimination against women is wrong, that employers shouldn't assume that all women will screw them over or even reproduce at all, that employers should give is a chance to prove ourselves. And then my whole argument is instantly undermined when some do this and screw over their employers.

It doesn't do any good to ignore this occupance. Problems can't be wished into non-existence. You remind me of the people who abide welfare. Whether or not not they're a majority doesn't change the fact that they exist, and that their existence is used as an argument against welfare all together, hurting the people who genuinely need it.

The reasoning from CR was that you could see further to your left and right without actually turning left and right, which will be an integral part of dog fighting.  I understand where he is coming from but I still think there should still be a range that FOV can be changed, say up to 90 or something.  The other reason is that they will be dynamically changing the FOV based on what you are doing, so if you accelerate fast or lock onto a target it will dynamically change the FOV, so custom FOV settings could potentially mess with that effect.","1412121931"

Ideally they both play great this week and you can trade one of them coming out of the bye maybe once you have some more information. 

If you can't wait, and you are a gambling man, I'd hold onto Kelce and trade Graham for a RB1. Brees is having an unBreeslike year, and if you can get someone like Lynch, Forte or any other top tier RB1s for Graham its a pretty decent deal. You end up with a star still and a *high* chance at a second star in Kelce if he pans out. 

If you trade Kelce for a subpar target, you have a star (Graham) and a depth player instead of potentially TWO stars.","1412121931"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The last company I worked for was a law firm.  A friend of a friend was made the IT Director of the firm and I was asked if I wanted to work for him.  The company I was working for was merging with another so I thought ""why not"", and left on great terms. 

Turns out the ""friend of a friend"" had no managerial experience and also didn't know his ass from a hole in a ground when it came to providing IT support to anyone.  Prior to being made IT director of this law firm, he was just the guy that came in and tried to sell products to people.  However, he just ran around like it was the end of the world, gossip, start fights, schedule meetings with vendors for products not needed, and handed most things that he didn't understand down to the IT manager.  He once told me to format a phone because someone couldn't view a calendar entry, and when I told him that it was just hidden, he replied ""Dont question me and what I told you to do"". 

Oh and God forbid you tried to question him.  He would flip out.  The other two IT guys would cower when he walked in the room.  He would also flip out on our vendors.  However, the 4 people in management took a huge risk on hiring him, and catered to him as he spoke in big words to them, promising amazing things better than their last IT director.  He would even go as far as scowl when someone came in to thank me for doing a good job. 

He would spend hours after work, ""doing code"" but not being able to answer any regular easy support questions. I had to do some ""code"" for him that he told me that it would take 23 hours, and I finished it in 3 minutes.  Well, I caught him in enough lies that I turned him in to his friend in HR that had helped hire him. 

Bad idea, the HR director, also one of his friends that came in late, took long lunches with him, and was just as incompetent ran straight to him and told him that I was going to complain.  

I was fired a month to the day after I went to HR for a ""poor work ethic"", which was the biggest punch in the stomach for me, as I've been working since I was 12, and my main focus is to do a great job everyday.

I was offered a job by my previous IT director that  had joined the huge company that I've always wanted to work for, the afternoon that I was fired.  (Not law firm)
I was told that I had the highest numbers of tickets closed along with customer satisfaction after 6 months at this new company.  I love it here.


He may be the IT Director of that small law firm, but there is one thing that I'll be able to get that he never will be due to all of bridges he's burned and the way he lies and manipulates people...  and that is respect.

Sorry to rant.  I've wanted to share that one for a year now.

Well aware. We are, on average, morally superior to people from a couple of centuries ago.

&gt; Genocide only became morally reprehensible in the 20th century due to WW2 (personally, I don't see why it is particularly more heinous than run-of-the-mill mass murder).

No, it was always morally reprehensible. Popular opinion does not determine what is moral. ""Run-of-the-mill mass murder"" is not OK either. Are you actually from the 10th century or something?

&gt; What you consider morally reprehensible in all circumstances is just a moral knee-jerk reaction to what is particularly poignant to your culture and context (specifically US racial chattel slavery, and the Holocaust).

Not at all. You shouldn't make stupid assumptions like this. If I was born in the 10th century slavery would still be immoral as it is today. I repeat, popular opinon does not determine what is moral.

&gt; Although I would agree that it would be difficult to come up with morally justifiable reasons for both slavery and genocide in a modern context (it is much easier in ancient contexts)

"AdvancedFitness","t5_2s9km","Deadlifts hurt your back because your form isn't good dude.

Notice how your spine isn't locked at all throughout the lift. It flexes when your first pull the bar, then you hyperextend at the top.

There should be nearly zero movement in your spine when you deadlift, unless it's near-maximal weight.

The purpose of the core/back is to TRANSFER force by resisting movement, not to generate force through movement.

Back to your question, I'd say no, rack pulls are not as good for your purposes as a sprinter because it involves a very small ROM in your hips, whereas deadlifts use a hue amount of ROM in your hips.

EDIT: [This article gives a simplified explanation as to how the back gets injured during lifting](http://www.markpieciak.com/2013/05/17/how-do-you-get-back-pain/), and preaches the importance of a neutral spine.","1412121936"

I'm in favour of giving people opportunities to improve as I believe if they put in the required effort and do the research then their may be a place for them.

That is optimistic to say the least though, and the truth is most static groups progressing through SCOB have had to change out at least one member due to the sheer difficulty and skill requirement. 

In a healthy static all 8 people need to be on a similar skill level or at least knowledgeable enough to be self reliant and kill the boss. Otherwise it creates passive aggression, tension in the group and can even lead to worse scenarios like disbanding if not nipped in the bud.

I think that particular argument was in favor of the OP. Since no employer wants to hire a pregnant lady, and she doesn't want to find a job now and then have to find one again later. The longer she waits to get one, the harder it will be because then she'll be visibly pregnant. If she gets one now, she'll have it in time to also take advantage of maternity leave. 

But I agree that they could each do what they need to for themselves. It'll just be temporary, and it won't kill them.

As for too many exit points. I can give another perspective, but I would agree that it is not a strong point against exceptions. In most games, everything is pre-defined (e.g. 50 particles for a bullet ricochet). In which case we usually have memory pools and custom allocators to fit the data in tight loops, well, as tightly and cache friendly as possible.  
      
Cache coherency is of high importance especially when it comes to tight loops in data driven engines. Using RAII will be very difficult as the objects now must have code to inform their _managing_ classes/allocators to clean up (which will be pretty bad code) or the _managing_ classes/allocators perform the proper cleanup after detecting an exception and unused memory. The complexity of such a system will be very high imo. Then again, I am not a guru such as John Carmack, and may be limited with my experience/knowledge of complex engine/game design.","1412121941"

 It actually says in the Koran that This is how Satan became satan, because he was an angel who led worship.

And what they're really asking is: keep track of the baby's movements and call someone if it starts moving a lot less than usual.  They like to quantify it with kick counts because that gives everyone something to count :)

It does have a benefit, as you get closer to birth - late term issues can sometimes manifest as lower activity.  One of my good friends on another board saved her baby by keeping an eye on his activity - he had a day of very low activity quite late in her pregnancy, she called the doc, bla bla bla, induction, baby with a cord around his neck is born perfectly healthy, which might not have been the case if she hadn't been thinking about it and noticing it.

My theory is that it's like Kegels - they tell us to do a million a day because that way we might do at least three.  Telling us to count kicks for two hours (seriously who has two hours!) means that at least we might think once a day ""when did I last feel him move?"".","1412121946"

Obviously.  How does that relate to your first comment?

There is all this hype around dependent origination, and maybe it was an advanced idea for its time, but it's just basic science now. Cause and effect is the nature of the universe and everything is connected through this cause and effect. Scientists can't find the ""mind"" or the ""self"" because it isn't a ""thing"" inside of us. It is the result of many different things coming together at once and none of the components can be independently called a self or said to have its own independent nature. There are cells and molecules and social identity. I can say that I am stardust or an organization of cells or a psychologist. All of these are true, but none of them is the True Self, they are just aggregates of phenomena. Think of a snowman, it looks like a thing on its own but it's really just hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a certain formation allowed by certain weather conditions. And when those conditions cease to exist, so does the snowman. This is common sense right? Well over 2,000 years ago before we knew about hydrogen and oxygen this was a profound teaching.

The only gameplay mod I used was the summon-horses (which also gives a horse to your companion too so they don't have to play huff-puff catch-up all the time)!

I used the Nexus Mod Manager to install them, and then a utility called Boss which ensures mods are installed in the correct order.  This seemed to work for me.  Finally, I started Skyrim from the Nexus Mod Manager (there is a scripted startup file that ensures the mods run properly or something like that).

He has a lot of TD's over the past few years, but the offense just isn't clicking right now. Not like it did when he was racking up TD's. I don't think they'll continue to be this bad as a team.. but who knows for sure. He would of got the ball more if the game was closer yesterday i'm sure.

"formula1","t5_2qimj","The best game currently available in my opinion that have the physics of the 2014 cars is Game Stock Car Extreme. F1 2014 has canned physics. The cars are too easy to drive and the car setup screen is much too simple. Most of your simulation games only you to change front or rear springs in correct amounts instead of a 1-10 scale as well as changing tyre pressure, toe-in/toe-out, spring rebound, front a rear sway bars, etc. if it's adjustable on a real car chances are you can adjust it in game. 

Codemasters games are generally placed in the sim-cade category where they have some realism but are much easier to drive than simulators. They have their place, especially in the console market. Most sims require the use of a decent force feedback steering wheel and pedals and can be difficult to drive with a game pad.","1412121965"

Bein weird like a chatroom
Tryna chill, but I feel the appeals
Hella real, now it’s looking like I’m that dude

Always knew I could be that cool
And I ain’t worried bout a rap duel
Cuz 9/10ths of the names in the game digging trash like a mafuckan raccoon

Made that tape with a gang a hope
And now the hope done changed to know
And now the notes that Dave done wrote
Been looking like a bunch of muthafuckin famous quotes

And nowadays I ain’t phased when they sayin the jokes
Get in the way of displaying the flow
Like ain't nobody rap this way, gonna crack this game
It’s a waste if he playin em both up at the same time

I ain’t even supposed to be the same guy
Ay you gotta switch the funny with the fake shit
Make a fake hit, bout the money rake and
Getting babes like a late zach morris up in bayside

That’s the only way da shit’ll see the daylight
I ain’t even gotta humor dat
Cmon bruh, even though I’m pretty new to rap
The songs y’all make stink like tuna cans
Cmon dog where the real ingenuity at

Errbody wanna act the same
And rap lame crap, tracks get attacked the same
That’s why I been up in this muthafucka practicing
Cuz errybody in the game bout to know D
Old me, not another fake fucking phony homie
You’ll see…

Bet a beer that when dicky done
I’ma make it pretty clear who the gimmick was
Ion’t think I really care who been dissing us
Lemme know when your career as a mimic up
Better yet I think I got a deal for you critics that’s been missing
What I’m spitting one contingency, you listen up

1 year you gonn say it’s legit
In two years you gonn say it’s the shit
In three years, if ma name ain't coming up in conversations bout the greatest
In the game, and I ain’t making the list, I’ll suck yo dick

Now you feelin a bit homophobic
Like ew what is wrong with him
Man this is why nobody big’ll do a song with him
Aiight amigo, we gonn see who goet it wrong again

Comprehend what the man said
Born to win
Sort of miffed I ain't Jordan yet
Torched the net
For minute, I admit I am only a beginner
But admit in ma core I’m a vet

Lil dicky know the chip up his my shoulder premature as it gets
He also pretty sure he the best
That’s why I been up here imploring the bets
Matter fact I’ll put up more than the head

I would give up my life for this shit
You right, then that’s it
Ya knife to ma wrist
The night of that dick suck

Whatchu thought I was here dat a quick buck
I done gave up my life for this shit
My hypothetical wife and them kids
Couple years when ma peers have families
And I’m sippin on a beer being weird as carrie
If you listen closely you can hear the camrys bump

LIL DIC
Erry mafucka wanna be Ali
Erry mafucka talking like they he
But a make believe can’t make belief

Lotta rap dudes brag they great
And this and that dude carry the game
But a select few rap today been saying shit like this, when it’s carrying weight
So who Dave is
Who Dave is
Am I just a muthafucka on a playlist
Am I just another sucka being aimless
Am I just another dummy lacking patience

Tell me now
I been down for my day ones
They were smart enough to fuckin get it
They allowed me to keep going
Now I’ll be flowing till the whole world fuckin wit it
Oh you thought I’m here make a name?
Boi i’m fittna fucking change the game
And if a mafucka sayin the same
I’ll bet brain when you play him, you’ll be saying that he saying the same

Thang you hearing out of errbody
We ain’t fearin anybody
But I’m finished caring bout ya money
Whatchu wearing out when clubbin
Who you staring down, the buddies that been there
And all da hunnies you been snaring
Mafuckas love to wear it out

It’s getting easy to compare ya style
That’s why they looking so uneasy when they hear about
A kid who doing something so unique up rare in crowd
They all preparing doubt
They unprepared now

Like this a new approach to the art form
This muthafucka bringing jokes to the chart or
He doesn’t dumb it down, flow lookin smarter
Bro, iono dis supposed to be hardcore

Up in our sport
It’s a hard court
Shit…I’m on the grass straight laughing
The young Roger Federer of rapping
I’m done dodging, this about to happen

Thinkin back to when lil dicky was a tennis captain
I was second singles, but ma set of skills average
Fuck I admit it, but I hit it kinda different
And my will is what I win it with, it’s only an example

I am nothing standard
Used to be a camper
You the fucking close mind
I’m about to trample
Errything I flow fire
You ain't hold a candle
Boi I think it’s showtime
I am fucking magic

I ain’t fuckin laughin
I am fucking rapping
This is what could happen when I am on a track

And I’m feeling like a Jag
Stuck up in some in fucking traffic
Knowing that the Maybachs could be getting lapped and
Knowing that the fake rap should be getting fact checked
Knowing I could make crap and be getting fat cheques

Das why I never really care for em
I’m too socially aware for em
Like how the fuck do we prepare for him?
You better get another notepad
Flowin nuts like I wrote it from my gonads
I’m tryna tell you muthafuckas I am no fad

Y’all are so bad
I’m a post grad
Getting so mad
Outta nowhere
D it’s only been a half year
But you flowin like you knowing you the last here
But you going like ain't no one in ya class here

We ain’t even gonna post his work
Is he a joke, lemme know when let go of the quirk
And then I scroll down look at sounds goin beserk
Because the whole fucking blog full of flowless twerps

Talking about hoes and twerking, shows what’s working
I ain’t even tryna say I’m perfect
But I been putting out songs with purpose
I been putting out long ass verses
And now I’m starting to take it awfully personal
I’m getting sick of seeing lil dicky search nulls

Errbody act like I’m Steve Q Urkel
Like I ain't Stefan
Like I ain’t the bomb

They treat dave like I’m steve blake
Homie but the replay saying that I’m straight LeBron

Got fans on the cowboys
Sports fans get the transition
But you know you goin down boys
Errbody know I stay chippin
And you know I’m bout to stay different
Even if they gotta try now
It was fun being dumb but you done being numb to the
One that been coming with the high brow

That’s what I’m doing when I’m betting dome ya know
I getcha you outcha comfort zone
You bout to question erry mafuckan thing I’m on
But can’t neglect it when America is singing long to dat

"creativehumanities","t5_33668","At the Fall Research Showcase I observed the poster presentations of Brittany Lyons and Luke Evans, and had the opportunity to engage in conversation with both presenters as well. Brittany’s presentation, “El Sol es el Mejor Torero (The Sun is the Best Bullfighter): An Examination of Ritualized Violence Through Drama” was very appealing to me. Although my first instinct was that I would not like this particular piece because of the presence and nature of violence in the works, my professor actually recommended that I go to see this piece and I ended up talking to Brittany for about 30 minutes because I found it so interesting. She actually wrote a play for her project that I got to read, which was based on her experience in Spain and research of bullfighting and its origins, along with research in literature to provide her inspiration and structure. Personally as a student hoping to write for the stage as a career, I really enjoyed the way the play was structured as it used metaphorical representation and dance to tell the story of a female bullfighter being interviewed and experiencing memories, but with the overarching structure of a bullfight as the structure of the play itself. I found it very interesting that I was compelled to like the play despite the main character’s ease in her role of brutal massacre, but that is what the project intended to portray- the intersection between violence and societal views with performance. The second poster presentation by Luke Evans was titled, “pulling my legs along with my eyes: performance based on international experience”, and it intrigued me because it was something I had never really thought could be a research project. He used his experience in Guatemala to try to relate his actions to his surroundings by recreating the journey he experienced in a different country-motions and set idea of activity- but in a completely different environment in Bristol, Florida. He found that his responses to the same ‘situations’ he created actually differed based on space and audience, and portrayed how site-specific theatre can outline the relationship between nature and performance.

"AcademicPsychology","t5_2sluh","Honestly, that's a really tough choice to make. I see three options that you can possibly do:

1. Go ahead and apply for PhD now. With a 4.0 GPA, high GRE scores (I'm assuming), a year of research experience, and years of clinical experience (shelters/hotline), you would have a decent chance at getting in if you can write an awesome statement of purpose and have clear goals and interests. However, as you pointed out, you would be competing with people that have years and years of experience.

2. Wait until Fall 2015 to apply to PhD programs and work in the lab in the meantime. Another year of significant research experience (and hopefully conference presentations and perhaps even publication credit) would make you a strong candidate, again that's if you have a clear idea of what you want to do. However, during the gap year, it would probably be a good idea to get a job as well to pay the bills.

3. Apply for a terminal Master's program for Fall 2015. That would give you significant research experience and make you comfortable with the grad student lifestyle. However, not all of your courses will transfer and funding is limited at best so you may have to pay out of pocket. 

My personal opinion is that if you can afford the application fees, then go for the PhD this year! From what it sounds like, you do have a pretty strong application and you still have another month or so to research programs and identify professors you want to work with. If you don't get in this year, then one more year of significant research experience should make sure a much strong candidate.","1412121971"

The contracts clause lists certain things a State may not do because only the Feds may and has nothing relevant to this topic.

A public business does not operate in a vacuum, if you want to take advantage of all the services that the public pays for with taxes, you must be willing to serve the entire public. You agree to that by getting your business license and opening your shop to the public.

There is no right, enumerated or not, to operate a business however you wish against the law. If you can't abide by the laws that govern business practices, you shouldn't operate a business and if you do anyway, you'll face the consequences for breaking the law.","1412121972"

Also, paper bags can be recycled and reused more easily than plastic bags. You don't have to pay for ""reusable"" grocery bags either, the store will give you paper ones for free.

Currently, the simplest and closest analogue to digital intelligent lifeforms would be Technomancers. If you change nothing else, then trading physical attributes for matrix attributes can be done in a fairly straightforward manner. (this would preclude using the Living Persona stats)

Resonance : Device Rating (no change here)

Attack : Strength

Sleaze : Agility

Data Processing : Reaction

Firewall : Body

&gt;How do you shoot an AI?

The same way you would normally shoot anything that exists only on the matrix - through the matrix.

&gt;How do you heal an AI?

Rest, but conflating the tests for First Aid and and Repair Matrix Damage isn't a terrible start.

&gt;How do you manage Grid Overwatch on an AI?(yeah he prolly won't be doing anything that would give os but in the instance)

No change.

&gt;I have a player interested in playing an ai rigger

For this specifically, you may want to allow them to purchase the Mind Over Machine (rating 1) echo during chargen.

You flip it. You then pass priority to proceed to the damage step.

My opinion is that it is a huge red herring. It crushes me that the world's environmentalists are so enchanted with this crisis that they seemingly have little energy left for anything else. While the environment is being destroyed around us, the only ones who supposedly care are stuck looking at the sky. It's more important for them to win this useless academic battle than to do anything about the myriad real problems we face.

And then, small victories like a carbon tax or emissions trading scheme make us feel like we've done all that's necessary to fix the environment. It's an undeserved satisfaction and further weakens the environmentalist movement.

I feel like big business knows this and facetiously perpetuates the debate. The environmentalists fall for it hook, line, sinker, rod and copy of Angling Times. It's so, so pathetic and I really wonder how people who are supposedly scientists can be this politically stupid.

""Subject: Pancake-Gate

I regret that my twitter salvo about the treatment I received at a Seattle restaurant and the subsequent digital tempest in a tea pot may have taken away from the important work of those organizing for a $15min wage and the Seattle show I played on their behalf.

When next in Seattle I would be happy sit down over a beverage--or sooner on the phone--and discuss the matter to conclusion with all concerned. The restaurant, the incident and my bruised feelings don't matter. What does matter is the hard, tireless work put in by those committed to fighting for a more just world.

If interested however here is the non-140 character blow by blow of the ""Encounter At @The5PointCafe"":

Our team of musicians flew to Seattle for a benefit show for 15 Now, the grassroots campaign to raise the minimum wage to $15. I've long been a supporter of this particular campaign as well as the national drive for a living wage.

The show itself at the former Off Ramp went great. I was reunited with former @Audioslave band mate @ChrisCornell for the first time in years and together with the raucous crowd it was really a special evening. A good deal of money was raised for the 15Now cause and we wandered into the Seattle late night happy...and hungry.

Two of our hosts from 15Now a band mate of mine, a woman from management, and my brother from Kenya comprised our party. Someone suggested Five Points, a spot I remember fondly from back in the day. I had some reservations because one of our 15Now friends said that while the owner was a good guy and treated staff well, the restaurant itself was on ""the wrong side of the minimum wage issue"" and had attempted to water down the $15min wage legislation by drawing out the implementation period and adjusting for tips to make it more palatable to small businesses. I am 100% on the side of an undiluted $15Now initiative which is in my view the only ""pro worker"" position, but hey we were hungry so let's give it a shot.

The restaurant was packed and spirited and we asked the doorman ""party of 6 for dinner?"" He said they were at capacity and it would probably be a 10min wait. No problem. Then ten people or so left the restaurant. ""Can we come in now? Those people just left."" No. ""Why?"" I'm not letting anyone in. ""Wait a second. Are you at capacity or are you not letting anyone in?"" I'm not letting you in. ""So you're no longer at capacity but we can't come in?"" No. ""Um ok. How about we order take out and sit at one of these 20 empty tables outside?"" No. ""Ok what's really going on here dude? Some of us have traveled a long way. He's from Kenya! I'm from the 90's!"" I'm not letting you in. ""Say, is your manager here? Maybe he's a Rage Against The Machine fan? He might even raise your pay to $15 an hour!"" More people leave the restaurant. It's clearly under capacity. Then our friends see that inside the restaurant several tables are occupied by friends of ours from 15Now. ""Hey look we don't even need a table. We'll just join our friends who are already inside?"" No. ""Really? Why not?"" I'm not letting you in. ""Can we just go TALK to them and see if they have room for us?"" No. It was like a hipster version of a Studio 54 doorman. At that point my band mate made a flavorful declaration and we decamped to the trusty, attitude free, IHOP where we enjoyed a drama free stack of hotcakes.

To be clear: at no point did myself or anyone in our party ""demand special treatment"", a ""private room"" or any other ridiculousness.

I was however pissed at the rudeness of the doorman to my friends and my younger brother--of whom I'm quite protective. I question what underlying motives the doorman may have had. Bad day? Anti-Kenyan? Preferred the Spin Doctors?

Whatever the cause, it is unfortunate that MY actions in response have diverted attention from the great work done by 15Now. ""Twitter bitching"" is counterproductive as it invites grossly misinformed conjecture not easily dispelled in 140 characters. Lesson learned.

As I've said before Seattle is truly an advanced society with its $15 minimum wage, its legal pot, it's gay marriage, its great music and its Seattle Seahawks.

Next time we'll call ahead.

I am agreeing with you. The miscommunication is a fact because we didnt communicate the ground rules with eachother. She just did them, and I didnt do them. I didnt even know about them until after she cheated. Thats not communication.

&gt;She doesn't care about your feelings, she doesn't care about your legal marriage status, so it's pretty much the same as being 'legally' separated. I say 'legally' because there's nothing in the law that says you can't sleep around while still legally married. You're just a fool if you still want to get back together with someone who does.

Its not a legal separation. I dont care if it ""pretty much"" is. No one I know does, not even HER friends. Her friends always apologize to me for how shes acting. No one believes that shit.

My state has a law against infidelity. Its not enforced, I dont think.

Kurdish independence has been a part of Neocons' plan for a long time.

They're just now getting their wishes. The whole ""Kurds are our natural allies and deserve their own state"" is Neocon neuro-linguistic programming; narrative; propaganda, etc.  An independent Kurdistan will harm Syria, Iran and Turkey and would serve literally as a launching-place for further Western intervention in the region.

In case anyone remembers, Christopher Hitchens used to wear a lapel flag-pin of Kurdistan.

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","Exactly. Watching TV is sitting back and using the remote to switch channels every so often - it is a passive activity. 

Playing games is far more active - it requires you to use your brain and input commands. Also, it can be educational, depending on the games you play, more social depending who you play with and more active. Some games require you to conjure up strategies, think tactics and then follow them through in order to thwart the enemy team. If you're playing a social game maybe you're a commander of a squad and have to order one guy to do this and others to do that. Maybe you have to make decisions that will affect the outcome of the story of the game in a negative way. 

Watching TV is just sitting on your ass and pressing buttons on a remote every now and then. 

Playing video games is seen as some sort of nerdy thing. It's becoming more and more acceptable nowadays (especially console gamers) but there's still the very popular belief that it is a waste of your life. I agree with your last statement, maybe such things will come with time where playing video games is looked upon the same as watching TV, I just wish people weren't so close minded or so easy to follow what everyone else says and judge gamers as fat nerds who waste their lives.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","I just got finished fixing a S&amp;W revolver that was beat to shit.  It is most certainly one of the most difficult firearms to repair if shit is fucked up.  There are a lot of simple things that can be replaced and swapped, and there are a lot of simple fixes if you know what you're doing, but if something that requires fitting needs to be replaced, unless you know what you're doing it can be a pain.  replacing a yoke, cylinder, extractor, or side plate requires fitting.  Replacing most parts and pins in the gun are pretty simple swap outs.  Fixing endshake isn't too hard but if you end up with a headspace or BG gap issue, its can open a can of worms.

I advise you watch Larry Potterfields Gunsmithing youtube videos.  Looking at that gun, the finish is pretty good and the gun honestly looks pretty nice.  Do the simple inspection that he suggests and you should be good to go.

This is a screenshot that I just took (I do my withdrawals monthly, on the last day of the month).

You did say that you got this page *after* a message that it was successful so maybe your original page looked more like mine?

You also said this has been going on for a few days. Have you checked the account to see whether the money has made it there? Since you've done this before you probably know about how long it normally takes. Has there been enough time for the money to have shown up?

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;Except of course that in absence of any sort of evidence it most certainly is evidence of absence.

No it isn't. There are millions of things that we don't have evidence for but are in fact true. In the 1600's there was no known evidence for evolution, that was certainly *not* evidence that evolution did not occur. Unless you meant in the absence of any sort of evidence whether it has been discovered or not, then I agree. 

I should change my argument to ""absence of evidence is not **necessarily** evidence of absence"". It can be if you have say, a predicted outcome for a test and it doesn't happen, that would be evidence that the outcome was wrong. But in this case it doesn't work. I'm not trying to say there are no truths except for those which we have affirmative evidence for, and everything else is up to your personal preference.

&gt;There is no proof at all the Loch Ness monster exists, there are many kinds of things that make it unlikely one exists. This says something about the likelyhood of it existing.

I agree, but since that is something that can be (and has been) tested in the present, it is much easier to find negative evidence to show it does not exist. The fact that there are no historical texts from thousands of years ago that mention one person specifically of probably a thousand ""messiahs"" at the time is hardly compelling. I only bring up the lack of historical evidence for Jesus when people try to assume that it is common knowledge Jesus is an accepted historical figure. Which, we know there is about as much evidence for Jesus as there is Zeus. 

It is much more useful to talk about the similarities between Jesus and other mythological figures in other texts as well as common themes found in other mythologies. Either way, we can agree that Jesus most likely didn't exist, and if he did, he was a normal human that was simply written to be much more special than he actually was (I lean towards him not existing).

You're correct, perm muting doesn't help.  They should be banned.  I don't think its entirely the ragging portion that causes the banning, but the ragging, hate, and being a disgusting human in general.  The raggers would probably be banned regardless, but it is hard to find specific people that rag.  Streamers, who have a large fanbase, can easily tell the Jmods about these people. I'm sure the Jmods aren't muting/banning them because Streamers are *asking* them to be muted/banned, but the Jmods agree with them.

"running","t5_2qlit","First off, as to your final question, I'm going to say no, that cadence is not ideal for everyone. For me though it has been great. 

I'm 6'1"" as well, 165 lbs., and you can move your feet that fast, I promise :) You just need to give your body time to work up to it. 

Earlier this summer, after yet another injury, I saw a physical therapist. Among other things, she gave me a gait analysis, and suggested that I work up my cadence to 180 steps per minute (90 strides per minute). At the time I was running at 140 to 145 steps per minute (which I wasn't aware of - I had never really paid much attention). 

On her advice, I did this by installing a metronome app on my phone and running to that. (If you're looking for one, I have an Android phone, and after I tried a few I selected Simple Metronome as it was always spot on, plus no ads). For the first three months I set it at 85 BPM (170 steps per minute), put in my headphones, and ran such that my right foot would fall on the beats.

To make things easier on myself, I started off by running on totally flat terrain. Initially it was crazy hard. I felt like my shoe laces were tied together. Basically I felt like my feet were barely moving, and that I was bouncing on my toes. However, even though I felt slow and awkward, my times were good and health-wise I felt just fine. After about two weeks of feeling like I couldn't move my feet fast enough, like I was constantly having to mentally focus in order to get me feet down in time, I started to ""find time"" between beats. I had plenty of time between steps, and didn't have to focus my mind on my cadence any longer. I started throwing in hills and varied terrain. 

I started PRing my 5k and 10k runs. In organized runs I started to win medals in my group and ending up in the top decile overall, and I wasn't beating myself up to get those, just running like I normally do after work. And best of all, no injuries, besides some calf soreness when I first switched. 

After several months, I upped the metronome to 90 BPM (so 180 steps per minute). Again, it felt too fast, but the change was much smaller and I adapted after only a few runs. My speed hasn't improved from that change, and my energy levels post-run feel the same, so I don't think the difference between 170 and 180 is nearly as important as the difference between 140 and 170. Still, I'm keeping with it, as both the theory and the data make sense, and I suspect it'll be important to injury prevention when I'm older, so I might as well internalize it now. 

Speaking of internalizing, once you get it down, you can go back to running to music or quiet or what have you. 

As to your pace, once you control for cadence, it seems to me that pace is largely dictated by amount of forward lean (assuming that you're controlling for terrain, grade, weather, diet, sleep, etc.). It's like on a bike - you can spin at one cadence and by selecting different gears you get different speeds. Your lean is like your gear. You can stand up straight to get in your granny gear and just turn your feet over all day or cruise up a hill without it turning into a slog, or you can lean forward, work hard, and really put the heat on, even though it'll tire you out. So, if you feel like your pace is too slow, try leaning forward just a tiny amount. 

Other things that I had to work out were breathing and arms. 

For arms, it turns out that the higher you cadence, the more bent your arms. In the past my hands would just brush my hips. When increasing my cadence I initially tried to maintain that, as I didn't want to change too much at once. That was a mistake. Just let your arms do their thing and keep your shoulders loose. 

For breathing, previously my breath was on a 2-2 pattern, which was too fast and shallow for the higher cadence. You will likely need to experiment a bit with this to find what works best. I've settled in to a 3-2 pattern - longer inhalations. 

TL;DR: Try a metronome set to 85 BPM, and headphones; a flat route; and a little forward lean. Give it a few weeks. ","1412121996"

"Overgrowth","t5_2sggk","Red Shards is in the Project60 folder and the file is called 4_red_hills.xml. Copy that file rename it and put the copy in the Levels folder. Then load the copy by typing the name you have given it in the text field in the main menu. That field is case sensitive and requires you to put in the entire filename, with file extension. SO if you have named your file *Aas&amp;SA%SA.xml* you would have to enter *Aas&amp;SA%SA.xml*. I suggest you make it short and simple instead.

Also, there is a thread on the Wolfire Modding subforum that has backups of all maps. It's not always up to date since users are providing those files, but it's better than having to keep a backup of the entire levels folder or reinstalling your game.

All super simple stuff and I'll remind you that your chances of getting it are really low unless you are around someone is is symptomatic. The chances of getting this while someone is not showing signs are very, very low.

- Wash hands frequently or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
- Avoid contact with blood and body fluids of any person, particularly someone who is sick.
- Do not handle items that may have come in contact with an infected - person’s blood or body fluids.
- Do not touch the body of someone who has died from Ebola.
- Do not touch bats and nonhuman primates or their blood and fluids and - do not touch or eat raw meat prepared from these animals.
- Avoid hospitals where Ebola patients are being treated. The U.S. 
- Embassy or consulate is often able to provide advice on medical facilities.
- Seek medical care immediately if you develop fever (temperature of 101.5°F/ 38.6°C) and any of the other following symptoms: headache, muscle pain, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, or unexplained bruising or bleeding.
- Limit your contact with other people until and when you go to the doctor. Do not travel anywhere else besides a healthcare facility.","1412122002"

&gt;I'm a college graduate, college student, hiker and mtn biker, audiophile, craft beer drinker, advice giver, awkward silence breaker, traveler, Movie watcher, hard worker, volunteer, not to be taken too seriously, and a million other things.

A threat to contented dining, the last survivor of Jonestown... nah, man. Pare that stuff down. 

&gt;I'm currently working as a Paramedic

Seriously, what's with you guys who have awesome jobs that you don't mention off the bat? Women fucking LOVE paramedics. I'm pretty sure when Neil Armstrong was cruising for some strange, he didn't wait to bring up walking on the moon.

&gt;Finding the coolest Youtube videos (Come on now; this is a talent! It's taken me years of procrastinating studying to get this good!)

You're the guy who might be giving me mouth to mouth? Sweet Jesus, no.

&gt;Quoting comedies with my best friend.

""This is my buddy, Dave. We're inseparable. Yeah, baby! Do I make you horny?"" 

&gt;I've been known to do the occasional ""stream an entire season of a TV show in one sitting"" 

Fuck that. How many hard boiled eggs can you eat in three minutes?

&gt;I tend to get along in pretty much any car, with anyone controlling the radio. 

So... you don't care too much for music. Got it.

&gt;With that said, I'm crazy about music! I spend hours more than I should trying to find new music. 

My head hurts.

&gt;I spend a lot of time thinking about
All the awesome places in this world I hope to visit. Or, if I find I have an unexpected day off I'll think a lot about ""what am I completely forgetting!?""

I'm now imagining a man stuck in neutral for six hours, wondering what he didn't do, and his whole day passes him by.

&gt;If I'm free on a Friday night, I'm probably with a couple friends having a pint somewhere that has a good local beer selection. I'm also just as content relaxing and catching up on sleep, laying low, or having a night in with some friends.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/Snapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSnapChat).

I've never had a daughter so I don't know what they're comparing his behavior to, but my understanding is that every kid is different and play styles are going to vary and overlap all over the place.

He does like to read a lot every day, run and kick a ball, collect any new ball that looks slightly different from ones he already has, assemble/drive trains, and play with cars. He's not very keen on his stuffed toys or baby dolls yet (27 months old now), doesn't do pretend play, and he can't talk. He really likes Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, and Megamind, and Cookie Monster and Elmo are his favorites right now on PBS.

^ This is like the master summary of my kid's behavior and in the statistically unlikely event that I'll have a trans girl on my hands someday, I'm certainly NOT going to be like ""you seemed hardcore like a boy growing up, rawr!!"" 1) because that's too vague of a statement to begin with and 2) because it's hurtful.

So blah... I don't know.

"anime","t5_2qh22","More: Takeuchi pointed out about three fourths of the way through the construction of what would become the Fate Route that H-Scenes were expected of visual novels at the time; as well as being expected from them as a circle, given the success of Tsukihime. The story was never a shoujo/josei story (despite the abundance of hot guys Ayaka was to assemble into her man-harem), but having sex scenes from the female main character's perspective would have had it lumped in with them, which is where the ""it wouldn't work"" comes from.

With the Grail at the center of things and Excalibur being important to the plot (as well as recognizable to pretty much everyone), they decided to genderflip King Arthur without changing a lick about his character. I believe in one of the interviews, they even make a joke about the Fate Route being the gay option.

This all being said, it all boils down to Takeuchi wanting porn in the game.","1412122019"

"dwarffortress","t5_2qyn1","There are lots of ways. You could just dig a channel out from the side of an existing river, have it flow down a tunnel and drop out from the ceiling in your dining room, and directly below that have grates or bars, with another channel leading down and to the edge of the map where you have smoothed and carved a fortification for water to pass through. 

You need to make SURE that you have the ability to turn off the water via a raising bridge, connected to a lever that could not be flooded by the water itself if something goes wrong. Put it in a secure control room.

g = ground

_ = floor

w = water

\+ = bridge

X = up/down staircase

b = floor bars

F = fortification at edge of map

m = probable mist area

Dig out that final g once everything is set up. You could also just fill a reservoir, and use a pump to recycle the water, so you don't permanently divert the river flow.

If you're like most seasoned travelers, there are more places you'd like to visit than is possible in your lifetime, so it usually doesn't make sense to go somewhere twice.

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","Cliff notes version of Ohms Law... I would highly recommend becoming REALLY familiar with it in full, but I'll try to hit the high points. For the purposes of this post, I'm assuming mechanical mod with no regulation whatsoever. There are 3 ""variables"". Amperage, Voltage and Resistance. Out of those 3 variables, you really only have direct control over resistance. Voltage and Resistance determine your amp draw.

1. A battery fresh off the charger is going to have about 4.2 volts of charge. ALWAYS use 4.2v when figuring resistances and such. This is for safety reasons that should become apparent as we go.
2. Amps = Voltage\resistance. So for a 1ohm coil on a 4.2v battery, you would be drawing 4.2a. For a .5ohm coil Amps=4.2\.5 which comes out to 8.4. So now we can see the lower our resistance, the higher the amp draw from the battery. 
3. Each battery has an amp limit. There are a ton of batteries out there that do not specify an amp limit, DO NOT USE THESE. Also never use ICR or ""protected"" batteries. When they fail, they fail MUCH worse than an IMR unprotected battery. Thermal runaway sounds fun but trust me, it's not. If there is a shred of doubt, don't use it. This is a bit dramatic, but it's indicitive of what can potentially happen during a battery failure. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTzEHsJVZhA
4. Let's assume we are using VTC5s. The 5 is not the C rating, that is a whole different animal. The VTC line is known to have an amp limit of 30a. Knowing this we can calculate how low of a resistance we can use. You can work it out with a pen and paper, but the Ohm's law Calculator on steam-engine.org is a wonderful tool here.  Using it we can determine we need a resistance higher than roughly .15ohm. Realistically, you don't want to get that close to the amp limit. Just because it is supposed to run up to 30a, that isn't always set in stone. It's a good idea to keep your builds .2ohm or higher. Leave some overhead for error. 
5. I almost forgot. There is another piece of kit we need. An Ohm Reader. This is a little plastic box with a 510 connector on it and a switch. We build our coils, flip the switch and the reader tells us the resistance of our coil. THIS IS NOT AN OPTIONAL PIECE OF GEAR. The reader will also tell you if there is a short in the atomizer somewhere. While we are talking about readers, we need to understand accuracy. These little plastic boxes usually run about 20 bucks. The lower in resistance you get, the less accurate they become. I've seen professional grade meters that can't accurately measure to the second decimal place. And even if you found a battery good down to .05ohm... these box readers aren't going to accurately read that low.
6. Another note about battery ratings. Some batteries advertise a ""pulse"" or ""surge"" rating. DO NOT GO BY THESE NUMBERS. Never exceed the continuous amp rating. Surge or Pulse might be fine for brief vape hits, but if something goes wrong and it fires without your knowledge... well like I said, thermal runaway sucks. ","1412122027"

But I'm only going to get this one chance
(Six minutes, six minutes)
Something's wrong, I can feel it
(Six minutes, six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got
Like something's about to happen
But I don't know what
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble
Big trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say
I'm not taking any chances
You were just what the doctor ordered

[Chorus:]
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot

[Verse 1:]
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinski feeling on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match
With this rappity-rap
Packing a mack in the back of the Ac
backpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
and at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop ""F"" bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period
Here's a Maxi-Pad
It's actually disastrously bad
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah

[Chorus:]
'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

[Verse 2:]
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap
Immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid
and did nothing but shoot for the moon since (PPEEYOOM)
MC's get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to 'bus the rhyme'
Now I lead a New School full of students
Me? Me, I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-W-A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and being in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church
And burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game
'Til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face looking boy
You're witnessing a mass-occur like you're watching a church gathering
And take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay
That's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what d'you say looking boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for shit
Git out my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
of keeping up with the same pace looking boy, 'cause

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3:]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself
In the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me
My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize
What I do though for good
At least once in a while so I wanna make sure
Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes
But sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to
Censor you like that one line I said
On ""I'm Back"" from the Mathers LP
One when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line
Add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now
That I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel
With fucking cornrows
You write normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new ray gun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya
Like when Fabulous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag
At Mayweather's pad singin' to a man
While he play piano
Man, oh man, that was the 24/7 special
On the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to radio station the very next day
""Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you""
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
Uh, summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is
Ricochet in off a me and it'll glue to you
And I'm devastating more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know that haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music
You make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do
When they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip hop, it's pop.""
'Cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice,
your songs you could sacrifice virgins to
Unghh, school flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
When I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue-and-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys
""Still chunky, but funky""
But in my head there's something
I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and
Here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Life's handing you lemons
Make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard, be a king?
Think not

"smashdebate","t5_2z7vj","Melee for now, Smash4 for the following EVO. I'm just gonna let the hype train make a temporary stop and say that I have my doubts that people are going to master the game in time for it to be shown on such a wide scale. There is no doubt that Smash4 is a huge step forward from Brawl, but it's still pretty defensive from the looks of things and it's gonna take a focused amount of effort and talented players to really push the offensive capabilities of the game. Melee has such a great flow of balance between offense and defense and depth that rivals even the best of traditional fighters, 13 years of play have proven that, thats why it deserves a spot at EVO. Smash4 is different and new. It takes after Brawl a lot, but Nintendo has taken a couple of steps to make it more competitively appealing. Is it enough? I'm not sure, but I'm pretty optimistic. One thing's for sure is that if Smash4 is at EVO (a huge event where the other fighting games have their shit together as far as having the mechanics flow together well within the context of their game) and the matches showcase the game as having a terrible flow (ie: Duck Hunt Dog dittos kicking cans at eachother for 8 minutes because it was the best we could do up until that point), it would be straight up embarrassing.","1412122029"

It's a look at how a terrorist cell might not be all that bad, how someone who is completely unfeeling (Sphinx 2) can grow attached to someone. It's about how desperation in your family life can drive you to do something extreme, and how if you do something extremely immoral it can be hard to cross back into normal life.

I'm fairly sure it's not 'over' yet, so we'll see how much more development they can work in for the characters.

Edit: yeah, nevermind. Tokyo ESP was crap. I was accidentally talking about Zankyou no Terror this whole time. I never made it past Ep 3 for ESP. A good psychological mutants-take-over anime would be Code:Breaker. It was a bit weak at first, with tie-ins to high school life and some sort of feeble romance, but eventually stepped up to a proper paced anime with terrorists setting off bombs and holing up in the brand new(I believe incomplete in the anime) Sky Tree.","1412122030"

"rust","t5_2s7lj","&gt; My point is simply that iterators (in Rust, Java etc.) are by definition mutable, while streams (and views) can be immutable (even if the underlying collection is mutable).

It is easy to build immutable lazy streams on top of iterators (a shared linked list of thunks that call `next` to generate each successive value); but it is much much harder to build equally powerful ""mutable"" iterators on top of lazy streams when there are affine types and value types (that is, languages like Haskell and Java that have global GC have it easy). That is, the mutable versions are the more fundamental types.

In any case, a stream/view has to be mutating some part of memory, at some point, or else no computation will ever happen; a language like Rust is just exposing precise control over this to the programmer.

&gt; I don't claim it is. I just meant that it can be abused as a work around for the unnecessarily strict borrowing rules, i.e.:

The heap-allocated reference counting is not at all necessary, it's the `RefCell` that's fixing the ""problem"" here.

    use std::cell::RefCell;
    
    fn main() {
      let f = RefCell::new(1u32);
      let r1 = f.clone();
      let r2 = f.clone();
      *r2.borrow_mut() = 2;
      println!(""{}"", r1.borrow());
    }

Anyway, I encourage you to try to formalise (or at least write down) some less strict borrowing rules and see if they're memory safe.","1412122033"

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","Coming from GW2 as well (in the MMO sense, anyway. Played an abundance of shooters), everything in this game just feels lacking. There are barely any items, yet skins are recolored and reused absolutely everywhere. Item icons are reused, item icons don't show what the item actually looks like (looking at you Vanguard/Crucible sparrows). Look at the Strangers rifle. That looks unique. But it's not, there's an exotic scout rifle with the same skin but it's blue.

On top of that, it feels like they are fully aware shit is lacking in the game, and put those limits (100 marks per week, 200 total in your inventory, barely any vault space if you have 3 characters.) to squeeze it out over as long a period as possible.

Edit: I'm reminded of dungeon running in GW2. That could be considered grinding, despite the abundance of dungeon paths to choose from. But even if you did not get anything from the chests in the dungeon, you would be rewarded with dungeon tokens and money at the end. If you played it again that same day, those rewards would be a little less but it would still get you something. Playing the Nightfall strike twice in one week is absolutely pointless.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","Where is the evidence of theaters being in peril? I've heard people say this for the past 10 years and it hasn't been true (at least not yet). The reality is that since 2005 there has been steady growth in both attendance and gross earnings for theaters (even adjusting for ticket price increases). 2014 is the first year that the year-to-date values haven't followed the previous 8-year trend. Is this the starting point of a steady decline? Maybe, but I doubt it. There was steady growth in the late 90's/early 00's before there was a drop from '04 to '05. Since then it's been a steadily growing industry. 

Sure, home theaters are better and the amount of content available in the home has risen, but even as the technology/content advances have increased, theaters have continually seen growth. People are still going to the movies. It's easy to *think* that more people are staying at home when (much of the time) we complain about ticket and concession prices, bad moviegoing experiences, etc... but the numbers say otherwise.

This is a bit off from the bigger point anyway: Will the chains exhibit a day-and-date from Netflix? If they're smart, they will, but they're probably not keen on the idea. There is still plenty of money to be made for theater chains even if this release model puts Netflix in competition with their exhibition. The common thinking about day-and-dates thus far has been that it interferes with people patronizing their theaters. Theater companies don't look at it as being able to get a slice of the pie. That's the issue. Whether or not theaters will choose to exhibit this movie is not going to change the fact that this movie will be released by Netflix, on Netflix. If the chains fail to see this, and with this being a potentially big release, there are going to be a lot of unhappy people if they want to watch this in IMAX at the local Regal/AMC/Cinemark/Loews, etc... Luckily, there are theater owners like Mark Cuban who are trying to drive innovation in movie exhibition. I guess we'll see where all this goes once the release date gets closer.","1412122039"

"duelofchampions","t5_2vwuf","I not too familiar with the state of open atm but I think the following decks are competitive:

* Good old [Cass rush-lock](http://www.mmdoctools.com/deck/1348-cassandra-lock-4-1-5-.en.html), we all know her, she still kick ass.

* [Kenage](http://www.mmdoctools.com/deck/221-the-amazing-kenage.en.html) can flood the board with creatures, buff them with honor and outmaneuver for the kill.

I don't think Crag is as strong as it used to considering the nerf to both DA and Pao.

In standar you have the following:

* [Acamas](http://www.mmdoctools.com/deck/821-acamas-6-1-4.en.html): pretty good creatures, bloodthirst and enrage as well as fortunes for finishing and backup. 

* [Kieran](http://www.mmdoctools.com/deck/861-kieran-linvincibile-5-3-1.en.html) plays around barracks and deploying small creatures to make gigantic stacks and some spells to clear out lanes. There's [another version](http://www.mmdoctools.com/deck/949-kieran-4-6-0.en.html) that packs Time Jump, which I think is more consistent but a bit slower.

* [Ignatius](http://www.mmdoctools.com/deck/220-ignatius-gym.en.html), unlike the other rush decks I posted, Iggy doesn't rely so much on creatures, instead his main win condition is dealing indirect damage via discard and Thrall's and Caller's abilities.

* [Seria tokens](http://www.mmdoctools.com/deck/784-seria-token-4-5-3-red-dragons.en.html) floods the board with skeletons while using some AoE to clear the opponents board. Check it out, there are several builds with slight differences.

Look, I'm not saying that the US wasn't threatened by the Axis, or that they didn't take them seriously.  All I'm saying is that the US supported its allies for more than just petty self interest.

For all the idiot, cowboy shit we can pull sometimes, the United States, on an emotional level on the part of its citizens, takes its alliances and friendships pretty goddamn seriously.  We'll fight for our allies because we think it's the right thing to do as often as we will out of sheer self interest.

But of course not.  There can't be a single positive characteristic of the United States - of its citizens.  No, no - we're just fat, lazy, and stupid, right?  Or we're the evil empire, out to rule the world, right?  Everything the US does is absolutely evil.  The United States has never, never contributed anything positive to the world.  We've never been a stabilizing influence, we've never made sacrifices for the betterment of our species.  Nope!  Just fat, just lazy, just evil imperialists.

For fuck's sake, no nation or people are that goddamn simplistic.  Ever.  There are so many things about my country that make me want to scream, to tear my hair out, things that we need to fight.  Hell, I think the corruption of money in our politics is an existential threat to our very nation - but fuck, that doesn't mean that there aren't redeeming qualities.  There is a lot that I love about my country, about my fellow citizens - much like I'm sure you feel about your nation, about your countrymen(and women [I wish there was a better, not clumsy, gender-neutral term I could use there]).  I'm just sick and goddamn tired of the rampant, uninformed, rabid anti-Americanism that so many subscribers to these subreddits exhibit.

"NCSU","t5_2qsbo","So, fantastic first game, blah blah. We wanted to play the following game so we chose all new moderators (first mistake). They didn't know who to talk to, what to do, pretty much anything but they figured out most of it and for the first half of the week ran a great game.

Unfortunately, some idiot decided it'd be cool to get on top of the financial aid building and splay out with a longstrike sniper-style (important lesson, your players often do stupid things). It wasn't until the police sniper had him in his sights that he said ""oh, that's just a toy."" So they stopped the game and negotiations ensued.

Here's an important aside, the administrators don't care about you. Not just you /u/sentient_beard specifically, but students in general. First comes their job, and second comes the 400+ people that just bonded with one another over a simple game of tag. If the game ends it's no skin off their back. So you have to make it more of a hassle to try to stop the game than it is to just let it keep going.

During that first meeting one of the first points brought up by the chief of the UNCG police was that university events outside needed police presence. We informed him (and the other administrator corroborated) that we were not a university club so those rules did not apply to us. We understood that it was necessary to work with them so everyone would come out happy but in the end we needed nobody's permission to play.

So we modified the rules. Nerf launchers only in designated areas at designated times (during missions essentially). Socks only the rest of the time. We'd give them a list of mission times and locations. Our player numbers plummeted to ~120 people. 

For the second semester we sat at the equivalent of the Talley equivalent gathering signatures from students (we got about 1500, people liked watching us play). The student government passed a resolution calling on the administration to allow us to play with the original ruleset. Both of these were forwarded to the dean of students and we asked him to send them to the other administrators. Nothing, we had to play with socks again that semester.

Finally, the following semester we sat down to talk about the rules again with the dean of students, the head of student activities, and the chief of police. We mentioned the petition and the resolution and the chief of police was surprised. *The dean never sent them to the other two people*. Seeing there was such a high level of support (1500 is ~10% of the student body) the police chief was willing to negotiate. We finally settled on nerf launchers were allowed but only the models approved by campus police. So the realistic ones (basically just the longstrike) and no painted launchers were out. Everything else, no problem.

The game at UNCG is still going, I can probably get you in touch with some of them. I don't remember where I found the university rules but seriously you should look them up and print them out for reference. This late in the semester I'd recommend the following course of action: Have nerf capture the flag games in the afternoon in visible places once a week or so (trees next to the brickyard would be good for 10-20 people. Between EB1 and EB3 would also be good). This should give you an idea of how sensitive campus police is about nerf launchers. [Know your rights](https://www.aclu.org/drug-law-reform-immigrants-rights-racial-justice/know-your-rights-what-do-if-you), if approached be polite but clear about what the rules actually say. This is also a good early recruiting tool and a way to find moderators.

Next semester (or ideally late into this semester) contact the people suggested by /u/SelfdestructV2 to get their feedback on your rules. Be clear about what the rules say and that you are going to play with your friends because it's a fun thing to do. I can send you the full list of compromises we made with the UNCG administration (you might also be able to get the current compromises at UNCG and UNC).

**This is your campus.** You have rights and responsibilities. The right to play whatever game you want and the responsibility to follow the rules on the books (not a bureaucrat's interpretation of those rules). Go out there and have fun!

"technology","t5_2qh16","The way to destroy Facebook is to exploit its weakness: Facebook is great for keeping in touch with old friends but terrible for meeting new people. A social network similar to reddit but with real identies - where you can discuss and meet with new people based on common interests - would be unstoppable. No, Facebook groups do not fit this description. for one, the discussion feature is terrible and makes the whole thing unusable - really I could stop there - but two because I dont want random things I say on, say a tech message board, to publically go to my wall. Facebook is a broken POS and could be easily destroyed in concept. I already have my own successful business or I would build it myself. Really really really.... really surprised that such a POS as Facebook with such obvious flaws doesnt have a real competitor yet - if the competitor existed and simply didnt have many users it would be one thing, but all Facebook competitors have been just as crap as facebook when what needs to be done is obvious. I mean for f sake, Myspace, with their reboot was in a great position to offer obvious innovative features like say, an Unlike button (I mean how rock and roll) but they couldnt even get that right.

And well there it is. If Reddit allowed members to create profiles I might never go to FB again

"Parkour","t5_2qk85","Did Parkour a whole lot about 6 years ago.  Got back into it after 3 years of hiatus.  It was an active hiatus, but not Parkour active.

To me the big issues are 1) impact and 2) range of motion.  Even low impacts can take a surprising toll and of course limited range of motion will suddenly sneak up on you.  

It sounds like you're well ahead of most of the dangers of starting this with your martial arts and bouldering training.  Just go slow.  It's all new motions so don't press too hard.  Running (watch some videos on how to run correctly so you don't hurt your knees, you think you know how to run until something goes wrong), balance for core, and low jumps (&lt;3 ft) to get your bone density up.  

edited: I actually paired my Parkour come-back with some yoga.  It helps core and balance and obviously flexibility.  Helps to prevent injury.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Really you're going to figure out how to balance your monthly budget. Until that's balanced, it's basically a count down to zero money, and any maneuvering can only make that count down slightly longer.

Regarding the car, how much is it worth? If you owe $2500 on a $15,000 car, sell it and buy a cheaper car. Cars only lose value over time, and holding onto an expensive car when you're in financial trouble is a bad idea. Do not take the car to a dealer - do some research and sell it yourself. This is a guess on my part as $400 a month is a pretty high payment.

Regarding medical bills, there are a lot of ways to deal with healthcare expenses. Many places in the US have county hospitals that offer free care. Call around to hospitals and ask which ones have charity care, and what the requirements are. 

It's generally a bad long term move to borrow from your 401(k), but without knowing what other assets are available to you and the terms of the loan, it's impossible to say if this is a better or worse option than others.

It sucks being under water on your budget, but the best thing to do is to make hard choices early and right the ship. The longer you wait, the deeper into debt you fall and the fewer assets you have to dig yourself out. ","1412122051"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I have no experience or anything to reference, but I do have a functional brain and a bit of knowledge on how sieges were done in the old days, so here I go. 

The goals of the offensive force can be variable. If they're there to take the city, destruction will be focused on military buildings and installations. If they're desperate or simply don't care much about what state they leave the city in, they may bomb cultural landmarks, hospitals or schools to demoralize the remaining defenders. 

On the other hand, they could try for a ""softer"" option by starving the people out, burning farms and blockading trade routes. This usually means fewer people afterward, but intact buildings. 

If they don't need the buildings or the people, well... it tends to be leveled to the ground. 

As for the defenders, that also varies upon not only the methods of attack but what kind of resources are available. A city facing armed insurgents can fall back on guerilla warfare, seeing as they have the homefield advantage. If instead they face solely bombardment, infiltration and sabotage would be a likely course of action. If the enemy just wants them dead, escape might be their only option. And if they face a blockade they might try to create food sources inside the city and become self sufficient. All of these can potentially be supplemented by outside allies with air drops or extra troops. 

As a siege goes on, things may start to change. The attackers might not have the resources to keep up the assault. In the past, this was eventually what ended most sieges. The massive supply requirements simply couldn't be met or justified. With increased mobility and supply, it might be harder to reach this limit in a modern siege. On the defender's side, dwindling numbers and a similar lack of equipment and food can also spell the end of their resistance. ","1412122056"

They practice, or are supposed to, universal precautions.

There's also the usual statement from the government that they ""oppose the illegal activities"" of the protestors. 

There's also been focus on the hypocrisy of the western governments for being so supportive of the democracy protests against China when they didn't show that kind of support when HK was a British Colony. Some of the Chinese people feel that HK already gets so many freedoms and rights compared to mainland and that they should be happy with what they have.

The first thing we learned in art class is how to treat a model properly. If the teacher/professor is any good at their job, the students should respect you to the utmost degree. I have never heard anyone talk ill of a model outside class (except maybe that they were moving a lot, but never comments about their bodies)-- it breaks model etiquette. I can only speak for the institutions I attend/work for, but the biggest worry you would have with us is being too cold.

There was this one time that our model didn't show, and this woman in my class just stripped and got on the stand. No one batted an eye, and no one treated her differently after the fact. I thought it was totally badass. We've also had male students at the school model for us. Frankly, no one here gives a shit (in a good way).

"Fixxit","t5_2sti8","OK, so, some of the other posters are on the right track. check &amp; correct your chain tension. 

When you are stopped what you can do is SLIGHTLY release the clutch lever while you gently shift from one gear to another. This is equivalent to rolling the bike backwards and/or forwards. 

The reason this works is motorcycle geaboxes are dogboxes. the gears themselves rotate freely on their shafts, but they have bathtub-shaped holes cut in their sides called doghouses. When you shift, you move 'gears' that have no teeth but rotate with the shaft because they fit into grooved splines on the shaft. The dogs themselves are things that stick out from the sides of the dog 'gears', and fit into the bathtub-shaped doghouses on the sides of the freely rotating gears. When you shift, the dogs go home, and the gears that were allowed to freely rotate are locked to the shaft because the dogs are in the doghouses. 

Occasionally, the dogs and the doghouses aren't in line along the shaft and the dogs can't go home. when you roll the bike back and forth or let the clutch out a little, you rotate the dogs enough they can go home. ","1412122064"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;What do you believe then, if not even yourself? Would you rather be a sheep for someone else's beliefs? It's a deadlock, imo.

I was critical of one specific instance of 'wise words'. My personal beliefs are irrelevant really. I'm not sure where you got your conclusions (questions) from? Because one does not believe in, or is critical of, something it does not imply they believe the opposite (nor believe in anything for that matter).

&gt;If you subtract yourself from human interaction, ultimately there are no good or bad ideas, just ideas. It might mean nothing, but I like to think this quote is not about justifying poor decision-making. If anything, I'd rate it as promoting self-awareness and rationality.

I totally agree with your statement that there are only 'ideas' and that humans add the 'good or bad'. Yet in the subsequent sentences you fully reimpose subjective, human context to reach your beliefs. My whole point is that the 'wise words' in question are FULLY just an idea and that idea can be used to promote other ideas such as enlightenment (seen as 'good' to most people) AND fanaticism (seen as 'bad' to most people).

&gt;Honest question, if someone has flawed logic or a really bad grasp of common sense (not judging, just taking for granted to simplify the discussion), wouldn't that invalidate their internal logic anyway? Hence making the quote not apply to them because of themselves?

To me this just shows both the circularity and limited power of the 'wise words'. The wise words are only useful to those who understand and practice the 'wise words' correctly. What is the point then? Those who are wise are still wise and those who are not are still not. The 'wise words' had no power because they didn't change anything.

Also isn't it a cop out to judge someone's logic to say that their application of the wise words are wrong? ie they can't really understand them? This just lessens the power of the 'wise words'. They are only wise within limited interpretation and context, they aren't universally applicable anymore. You need to apply exterior rules (eg gauging a person's logic capabilities) to allow the words to be 'wise' once again. It is a case of special pleading and circular logic. The 'wise words' are only wise if they are practiced by the 'wise' in a 'wise' way.

On to my general beliefs here:
To me one of the weakest explanations for something is an explanation that attempts to explain 'everything'. I find the 'wise words' presented here as a perfect example. They attempt to be general and universally applicable, but when any negatives in the logic are highlighted, another whole set of rules and 'wise' judgements must be applied to the original 'wise words' for the 'wise words' to be of use. They are not at all what they seem to be on the surface.","1412122064"

"CompetitiveHS","t5_31ns2","It's kind of a trick question, there are ways to lethal either explosive or freezing but not both. I like starting down the freezing trap path with a swing at webspinner from the argus, because it doesn't require mana usage and lets you track for holy fire lethal if its explosive. Freezing's also more common. Of course, this is technically risking a 1 in 6 chance of dying to misdirection, and a 2 in 6(multiplied by chance to draw mark) chance of dying to misdirection + hunter's mark draw, but that's fine.

Assuming no holy fire in deck, it's just a judgment call, explosive or frost, and if you miss your opponent sees another card.","1412122064"

Once they were dropped by Curse, [Denial Esports](http://denialesports.com/) stepped in and began supporting the squad. Apparently as soon as a better deal came around with iBUYPOWER, the squad left Denial and joined the iBUYPOWER organization. There seemed to be some disagreements between the players of the squad and the management of Denial because afterwards a manager with Denial ranted on twitter saying, ""I am done with CS:GO, I hope to never deal with the NA scene of this game again"".

Add to that the child went with a stranger back to his house. The mom was outraged that someone would do that. So consider this, would you let your child play in a football field with strange adults, without supervising them?  
Personally I don't. I know where my kids are. They go out, they play. I guarantee either I or one of my neighbors, who I know, has an eye on them.  
As to your question, it's not illegal. It can be considered child endangerment or even neglect if your child is hurt while unsupervised and CPS reserves the right to check on any instances reported.  
Also is not cps that's the problem. The problem is that in today's media saturated environment the outside world looks like a war zone. People are scared of everyone and everything so more people are calling in problems to cps and the like. They are obliged to take these seriously.  
Your best bet is to get to know your neighbors and be social with those in and around the park. People do this less today. The more familiar you are with those that will see your children the safer they'll be and the less likely you'll see cps.","1412122066"

In a business environment your degree just make you eligible for higher positions what truly defines your growth potential is your experience and good you are at what you do plus throw in normal business cut throat backstabbing politics. Your degree gives you a doctoral level education which is a huge plus in advancing. Some roles they want just a MD,  some just a PhD a few just a PharmD,  but many roles like directors of regulatory affairs or medical affairs and beyond just care it's doctoral level. So director, VP and even heads of entire aspects of companies you are eligible for. Now getting there is a different story. You have to get the right experience and impresse the right people. It's likely you will completely change roles and departments every few years. You just have to be open to opportunities and know what will make you look best down the road. 

Once you have a few years in any department in industry you start to be able to apply for most other positions because most positions just require general industry experience. Now this will limit you with clinical roles so if you want to perform a clinical role in industry or directly work with physicians at their hospital sites you likely will want some clinical hospital experience. But i decided I wanted to avoid that and jump into the more general business side. 

If you have questions feel free to PM me I've actually gotten like 3 people already asking me about it through PM . 

Edit: salary sucks when you start maybe 80 to 85k bit better off you start as a contractor but you then get shitty shitty benefits.

"NorwichCity","t5_2sv0y","I saw the development game streaming on youtube last night. I've got to say, Hooper didn't look anywhere near ready for the 1st team.

 Whilst you can maybe excuse his lack of enthusiasm for a game involving mostly kids, his all-round game left a lot to be desired. Grabban, for all his finishing faults, is actually pretty good while involved in build-up play. He comes short a fair amount and pulls off some useful flicks etc.

 I think if we play Hooper we've got to expect him to do little else than attempt to put the ball in the net, and to my mind thats one too many luxury players when you're playing essentially a 4-4-2 with Wes as a nominal left winger.

 If we played a diamond, it might work. I remember a similar thing working well with Holt (blessed be his name) and Martin up top with Wes floating behind. But that means dropping Redmond, really. I don't think it's fair to drop Redmond for a striker that's done nothing since he came back from injury (obviously he's been out for a long time!)","1412122072"

"wakfu","t5_2sbcy","Dofus is 10yrs old this year. Wakfu is now 5 (I think.. lost track) including closed/open beta phases. I've played both since day one. Dofus died for me after hitting 200, sure theres new content but I can't really progress farther than a new set every couple months to a year. Wakfu is newer, has a fun system with more versatility and play styles in classes, is continueing to grow, and personally I much prefer its movements and combat. One major difference is the use of mp in combat. Dofus didn't have spells with mp costs, that was unheard of. Wakfu really utilized this in mobility/movement spells which is amazing and gives more depth to fights. Spells progression and builds in dofus are fairly cookie cutter, there is no real customization. 80% of a class will be 1 element, 19% of that will be a side build and then 1% will pick the weirder build. (Osas for example are known for intel, secondary is earth and then the weird option is chance.)

Long Story short, Wakfu is a complex sequel that some people like, and others dont purely for the fact they made it different. I personally embraced both and I now like wakfu more as dofus has become old to me. Would I ever go back to dofus? Nahh. I've tried with new servers but it just doesn't have the same community as it did before, everyone is too experienced and likes to play alone.","1412122072"

But simultaneously, at least Bloodseeker puts people in an interesting situation. They can run with Rupture(Seeker's ultimate) and take the damage to run to safety because that damage is better than the alternative of being hit by Seeker or his allies.


However, if someone stands still to prevent the damage, they will be caught by Seeker's new ability Blood Rite. As a result, the victim will be silenced and unable to dash or CC seeker once Rupture has worn off -- they're in a tight spot without their allies help! (a recurring theme with Seeker, especially in his new kit -- it's a kit full of weird perks and insane drawbacks for his targets and himself)


With Talon.. It's what? You stand still and get wailed on unless you can destroy him in a super short time frame or escape with your life. Simultaneously, if you're running -- he's probably still hitting you -- but you're taking extra damage for it too.


Giving Talon a rupture like ability doesn't make him more interesting. It makes him a fuckton more annoying to deal with. His abilities need to be fine tuned to accommodate such a mechanic, otherwise its just plain excessive.","1412122073"

"HongKong","t5_2rbn0","It does not appear that you have not properly read what I have written and have not taken any of my concerns to light. I might have been young then but I have experienced life in HK before the hand over and I do remember it. Like I said before, **I fully support the demonstrators aspirations, but I just expressing my concerns over the points I posted. At no point did I criticise anyone** in my original post.

&gt;I'm sure it causes some delay to some emergency services, but so does the everyday congestion which plagues Gloucester Road. 

You clearly did take anything I wrote into consideration. Like I said, I volunteer for an emergency service. I gave a simple explanation on the speed at which a fire can grow, and that every second counts. Let me give an example. With Hennessy road fully blocked at the main intersection in CWB, and the closest fire station next at the edge of cwb and wan chai, how do you expect fire fighting personnel to get to a fire at the library or victoria park.

[Also it seems like my concerns over having a 'service corridor' have been addressed by protest leaders. Hopefully you will see it implemented today.](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1604955/protest-leaders-agree-humanitarian-corridors-emergency-vehicles) so there is no point in me saying any more.

&gt;They have no ""out"" and don't believe they have much to lose.

This is what I'm trying to address with my second point. Just because people don't have much to lose, doesn't mean that the people around them don't. Perhaps the example I gave was no clear enough, so let me expand on it. I said I have worked at the restaurant my brother works in during my time in HK which happens to be located in the central area. While I was there I was mainly doing a minimum wage job washing the cups and glasses. When the restaurant is busy, they bring in extra staff and someone to wash dishes as the kitchen staff need an extra hand. It is normally an middle-aged/older woman that comes in who does not appear to be particularly well off or educated and definitely looks like she could do with the income she earns washing dishes. Putting it bluntly, she looks poor. I have worked with her, doing the same/similar minimum wage job in HK. The restaurant is on Wyndham Street. The other day, they posted a photo of the street with the caption, ""Central is so Occupied there's no one on Wyndham Street"". Wyndham street is normally bustling with people. The simple fact that the street is practically empty shows that business is quite for everyone (at least all the businesses on that street). It means that the casual/part-time staff like the dish washer don't get as much work as they like/need. It would be safe to assume this is not a unique situation and would apply to many businesses/workers in the affected areas and this doesn't even take into account the loss of revenue for struggling business owners.

OK, if you didn't read what I have just written again. Please at least read this.

**TL/DR**

I am certain all HKers support the aspirations of the Occupy Central movement, myself included, but the current demonstrations are hurting people I directly know and have worked with in HK. ","1412122081"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Yea, really. If you actually read the site you might realize that the propaganda against it is pretty ludacris. Especially when you consider that you can link Obama and pretty much anyone to seedy characters if you like. It's very easy. Deal with the subject matter.

Lincoln’s own secretary of state, William Seward, said, “We show our sympathy with slavery by emancipating slaves where we cannot reach them and holding them in bondage where we can set them free.”

I'm for intelligent discussion. It's not intelligent discussion to go on pretending Lincoln was crusading to free the slaves. He wanted power and taxes like all leaders and dictators want. Something good happened to come from it, but he freed the slaves as a strategy to win the war, not because he gave a shit.

Lincoln:

“I view the matter (Emancipation Proclamation) as a practical war measure, to be decided upon according to the advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion.”

“I will also concede that emancipation would help us in Europe, and convince them that we are incited by something more than ambition.”

It's not racist to point out what Lincoln actually said on the matter.","1412122084"

"ultrahardcore","t5_2tswi","Today, today.... well lets see today, i slept till 3:34 that was great, I then got up went to PCH to meet john, hung out there for a few, then headed to backspace, but my dad called to get games for his computer, i got pissed that he wanted to do this at that time and at that time only, but i got them for him, and we moseied on to backspace, so played pool then played scrabble. that was fun, as we were playing scrabble the one person i knew we were going to run into showed up, alana. Now as per alana's LJ she's allways at backspace, so anytime im near it, i feel that i need to go check and see if she's actually there. Which most of the time she isn't so basicly she's a liar or i have impecably bad timing. Anywho so after we finish this epic battle of scrabble we head towards my work since i don't know what time i work on monday, then we go to paddy's for some food and libations, so i drink a hot drink then i says to sean, hey sean, whats good for people who are sick? sean says well alcohol is bad for people who are sick, kills all of the vitamin C they have and is toxic to the system. I say WHAT THE HELL KINDA BARTENDER ARE YOU? not really im just more let down that i shouldn't drink whilst im sick. SO he sells me on a red bull and vodka, since the red bull have vitamin C and B vitamins and such, then he gets me one of thos super vitamin packs from like 7-11 that you see. He's so awesome. ANywho so now im all amped up from redbull and vodka, so i go to my friends birthday party at voodoo lounge. Ok lets get one thing straight, i would never ever go there had it not been for my friend being there and having a VIP room. IT was one of the lamest places ever. very few people dancing, just abunch of pretty people being pretty and trying half heartedly to communicate with each other. It was really a sad site. Any who, hung out there for a bit, had some jello shots and got kinda drunk and walked home, had a good swig of NyQuil, and i think im going to eat a little something before going to bed and getting up at 11am. I don't get math. Its pointless. I'm doing it now and its only seven problems but its taking me foreverrr. I got a new ipod today. I've been saving up forever for it. Its a nano and its purple. The guy at best buy was so unenthusiastic about me buying it. Like it wasn't special. I wanted to get a balloon or something. Anyways I'm waiting for my sis to pick me up. I'm going to sleep over at her house tonight. My back hurts! I'm moving so my room is empty. So i have no furniture. So I'm sitting on the floor in a weird position. I say so a lot.... I could do wall sits, probably should but i don't feel like it. I ate so bad this week. I went on a camping trip with my class and they fed us like every 2 hours. I'm the type that if you put food in front of me I'm gonna eat it. I have a platypus named Gioff. I got him at Petsmart on sale. One night while I was sleeping, Gioff climbed into my head and started randomly singing STYX songs. Once I was done screaming like a little girl who just got the **** scared out of her because somebody jumped out from behind a bush with a monkey, I tried to stick my hand inside of my head and retrieve the damn platypus. I didn’t fully succeed. So, with half a platypus hanging out of my ear, I went back to Petsmart and complained. I told them that I’m never buying an animal from them again because they crawl inside of me. They were shocked, and I clarified that it went through my ear, and then they were relieved. They told me that there wasn’t anything they could do about it. I threw myself on the floor, making a scene, and demanded a free hamster. That night I was eating my dinner and all of a sudden Gioff, still hanging out of my ear, started to cry. I asked him what was wrong and he said that he doesn’t like it in here anymore. I told him to shut up and that it was his fault, he didn’t like that. I attempted to get a shower the same night, but it’s a little hard whenever you have a platypus hanging out of your ear. I did what I could and headed off to bed. But, just then, I remembered I left my free hamster in the car and by this time it probably already ate the cheese puffs I had hidden under my seat. I dashed down the stairs, Gioff screaming from the sudden movement, and bolted through the garage to the car. I than opened the door cautiously incase of a sneak attack from the vermin. To my surprise, my cheese puffys were still there, and the hamster was asleep on the back seat. I went to pick up the hamster carefully, but it freaked out and bit my finger. I tried to yank my hand away from it, but it latched itself on pretty well. Running up the stairs, Gioff now screaming even louder, I remembered I had forgotten my cheese puffs in the car. Running BACK down the stairs, Gioff in hysterics from the stress, I safely got them cheese puffs. With the hamster still biting and Gioff still flipping out inside of my head, I managed to work my way up the stairs. Once upstairs, I gave my hand a good whack to the wall, and off came the sadist hamster.","1412122085"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I used to work a 911 center that had hiring practices this bad. There were several classes that needed to be taken by new hires in order to understand the protocols we use, and on multiple occasions they would get fucked up. Trainees would be sent to classes in different cities days after the class concluded or when there wasn't one at all. Other times they would be signed up for classes but were never told, so they would get a call at 8:00 AM asking where they were for a class they knew nothing about. I was signed up for a class about an hour away from my residence and booked a hotel or to stay there only to find out on my own the class had been moved to my own town. Nobody planned on telling me. I only learned of it after mentioning to the director of the 911 center *whom was teaching the class* that I was looking forward to getting out of town for a bit. 

The ongoing quality control program is a joke, too. There's supposed to be an ongoing review of randomly selected calls to ensure everybody is up to pay and following procedure. This should amount to each reviewer listening to a few calls each week. Instead, we'll get told on a Friday that our shift of 7 people needs to review 125 calls by Monday or else the recertification paperwork will be late.

The same person is in charge of both processes. I have no idea how they have kept their job. I feel terrible for new hires that get shit on by management from day one, but apparently that's the level of service that my local 911 center aims to provide. ","1412122086"
"chelseafc","t5_2rsl6","Am I the only one who does not like the style we've developed in the last few games? First few games of the season we were outstanding, yet for a team flowing with hard-working, pacey, intelligent players going forward, we seem to have started every game recently in 1st gear - and far too often it takes conceding for us to start playing the way we should. The way we kept giving the ball back to Sporting and then sitting back and hoping they wouldn't get through was embarrassing for a team of our quality. Don't get me wrong, 3 points is 3 points, but its incredibly frustrating and tense as a Chelsea fan seeing a team far below our quality dictate the pace and frankly outplay us in the second half.

People will disagree I'm sure and claim ""we knew exactly what we were doing"" in defence and that Mourinho knows how to see out games yadda yadda, but I think it would be naive to think we wouldn't have conceded on another day and we'd only have this *almost* lazy style we've developed to blame","1412122087"

Yes, the leaders are probably too set in their ways to change, but those who sympathize still might be open.

"aquaponics","t5_2rioe","Just to pinpoint what you're asking, AP depends on fish food &amp; small amounts of nutrients ( phosphate, iron, magnesium, etc ).   You'd like to close the loop entirely by feeding the fish what grows in the AP system?  

That's theoretically possible but the main benefits of AP is closed loop circulation which cuts down on water needs ( 5% or less of what a conventional farm would use), organic to borderline organic food, nitrate/minerals for conventional farming,  and given enough investment 4 seasons/year around growth.   Harvesting fish for food is more of a bi-annual/necessary reward but not a major profit source.


Edit/addendum -  SRAC's reports/fact sheets are considered one version of the Aquaponics holy bible.  A lot of the 400 series reports like this one - http://fisheries.tamu.edu/files/2013/09/SRAC-Publication-No.-454-Recirculating-Aquaculture-Tank-Production-Systems-Aquaponics-Integrating-Fish-and-Plant-Culture.pdf  are insanely invaluable.

It is important to remember that the people fighting on his side are not fighting his war and to protect his position.  They have interests and concerns of their own.  If Assad is killed I do not think the war would end.  The Allawites and other minorities dread the possibility that they will be massacred if they lose.

"AskElectronics","t5_2se13","It depends.  A transformer (or inductor) usually has two current ratings:  

The first current rating is the max current that can flow through the windings before resistive heating causes damage.  That is the current at which the transformer will start to ""melt"".

The second is saturation current.  This is the current at which the iron/ferrite core can't increase in magnetic field.  When that happens, the output voltage can't keep up with the input voltage, so the output voltage will drop.  Also, the current on the input side will go way up.  This will also cause the transformer's core to heat up a bit.

What is the difference?  Well, if you exceed the resistive saturation current briefly the transformer will still operate as expected.  As long as this doesn't continue for long the transformer will not overheat.  Exceed the saturation current however and the transformer's output will falter, causing problems with your circuit and possibly damaging other components.  The input side current will also spike, which will likely trigger overcurrent detection or blow fuses.

If you are only given one of the ratings you should assume the worst and not allow the current draw to go over the limit.  You could also test to determine if the current limit is due to saturation or not, but that is probably not something you really want to be doing.","1412122096"

"stevenuniverse","t5_2viyl","&gt;We know that Rose gave up her physical form for Steven to be created. This makes makes me believe she still exists in some form, whatever it is.

Rose had to give up her **physical form** for Steven to be born because he ***is*** half-Gem. Therefore, he needs a gem of his own in order to exist. It contains not only his powers, but half of what makes up his physical form, and half of WHO he is. This means that Rose had to remove herself from the Roze Quartz entirely, to allow Steven Quartz Universe to enter it. 

So, as Rose no longer has a Gem, it cannot be that she has a corrupted gem. Lion certainly seems like it has a connection to Rose, possibly some sort of Gem animal she befriended, or developed a connection to before allying with G.A.P., but I don't think it's HER, and here's a few reasons why.

Lion is peaceful to Steven, but he's shown as peaceful to everyone that's not an enemy. However, he doesn't treat Steven in any real special way, even appearing completely apathetic to him at times, only really helping him when they have to deal with a real threat. If anything, I believe a lingering sentiment of Rose exists within her Room, or within Steven's Gem, but Rose herself, as a simultaneously significant and thoughtful entity, is gone.","1412122098"

That's what I said. I mentioned that exactly. We have the DK2, which brought higher res, low persistence, a new screen type, new tracking capabilities, and a host of other featuress. 

So far, the Crescent Bay demo has: a higher res screen and a few more IR lights on the back for 360 tracking. 

Now, I'm not knocking those, but that's not enough of a reason to upgrade after dropping $400 on the DK2.

Put another way, the DK2 is to Oculus Rift's DK1 as Sandy Bridge was to first-gen Intel Core series chips: a ***massive*** leap forward in the architecture. Crystal Cove, however, is Ivy Bridge: a very minor revision that is slightly better in every way. If you're on those first gen Core CPUs, and you skipped Sandy Bridge, then those Ivy Bridge chips are looking pretty good.

"ProtectAndServe","t5_2ug10","We've already been through this. Citizens do not control the police. The police are appointed by the government. The police are an extension of the government to protect the citizens and enforce the law. If citizens had direct oversight of the police, there'd be no reason for them. Same as the government does not have direct control over the police, as the police can and will enforce digressions of law on the government. 

No, we are not in Iraq, but using your logic, the people also control the military, which you conveniently left out of the equation. But what is the difference between the military and the police? Both are agents of the government. Both are charged with protecting the citizens of the U.S. and the Constitution. One is in charge of protecting the citizens from outside threats, one is in charge of internal threats. Both have the same mission, and are both appointed by the same entity. I don't see civilians controlling them. 

&gt; However there should also be very clear consequences in case of intentional failure to comply with our requests, or unintentional failure due to incompetence or other reasons.

You're on the right track, as there is consequences. But, what exactly do you want that's not part of the procedure now? Police officers actions are judged and reviewed by people and those who are guilty are prosecuted to the full extent of the law BY a civilian court. And civilians even find those transgressions reasonable under the law. So what exactly do you want? 

&gt; The problem with your reasoning is that as long as you fail to acknowledge and respect civilian oversight as your chain of command, we as citizens have little recourse but to reign in your authority and overwhelm you with all kinds of ridiculous paperwork to keep tabs on you.

You're not part of the chain of command for a reason. Police have to remain impartial, and not only the government but the citizens also contribute to corruption. Neither side should have any more power to control than the other, and the police should be independent of control of either. Both sides should come together to punish those who abuse or outright disregard the policies set forth and the mission of police.

&gt; I think it's fair to say that most Americans want police to be able to do your jobs effectively. We want to give you the tools, and we want to make sure you have everything necessary to allow you to do the job with minimum risk to yourself. The problem is that the actions and the general attitude of police (certainly also reflected here on this subreddit as well) is completely counter to those goals.

So you say, which is contradictory to the argument. Minimal risk to ourselves, yet no ""militarization"" in a country where violence is pretty common. People argue this ""militarization"" point trying to say acquiring surplus gear that has camo patterns make the police look too much like the military. It's a ridiculous argument. 

I can see we're probably not going to agree on this subject, so we'll just agree to disagree. In the end, the police and civilians need to work together and not against each other. The problem is, no one comes up with logical solutions to the problem. Your solution is civilian oversight, and that'll never happen. I like the idea of civilians being part of the oversight, working hand-in-hand with Law Enforcement and the government for greater transparency and more understanding. Until it happens, it'll stay the same.","1412122104"

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","I'm gonna take a stab at this.

So, the way binary works, right. If you have 0011, this is 1x2^1 + 1x2^0 = 3.

Now, those numbers keep going behind the radix point: 0011.11 is 1x2^1 + 1x2^0 + 1x2^(-1) + 1x2^(-2) = 3.75

The problem this runs into is that floats can only really ever get values with 5 as the last digit (.5, .25, .125, so on and so forth). Things like 1/3 or, hell, even things that to a person are easily intuited (like 1/5, 1/10, etc) can't really be represented perfectly to begin with.

When you then exacerbate the situation by doing math on those already-not-perfect numbers, they then have to make an approximate result with their already approximate inputs. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems is a good read if you're so inclined.

#Also, you can play with something like http://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-decimal-hexadecimal-converter.html to see the problem immediately. Type in a number like .01 in decimal, then copy the binary representation if gives you and repaste the binary. Your decimal result changes.

Edit for super layman's terms: 

Imagine that you have no concept of odd numbers. Someone walks up and says ""add 2 and 2"" and you're like ""Well, that's 4. Duh,"" because you are the master of all things even. Same dude asks you, ""add 3 and 2."" So you ask him what 3 is. ""It's between 2 and 4."" So you reason ""Well, then it's like, less than 4 and more than 6?"" You'd be right, but you wouldn't be perfect.

Floating point does that, except on very small scale. It can only ever ""see"" decimals that end with the digit 5, essentially: 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, so on and so forth. It can get super small, but it will only ever be able to approximate things with that in mind.","1412122107"

"DishonoredRP","t5_32npg","""Ex-Guardsman Bathory,

Although, I suppose it is Overseer now, isn't it? Funny how those things happen. You may wonder why I am contacting you, especially after everything that happened, but I assure you, it is for a good reason.

You see, Mr Bathory, I was finally able to get your name out of my father, Watch Officer Medigo. He was loathe to tell me who you were for the longest, preferring to deny that anything had ever happened between us. I truly do apologize for what happened, but I don't regret that night, just as I hope you don't either.

That night, that wonderful night of her Majesty's Ball, I took you into myself. I willingly admit that I seduced you, despite my father's insistence that it was your fault. And a few weeks after your discharge from the service, I found out that I was with child. And yes, I am sure it is yours. You were the first man I ever truly ""coupled"" with.

He is almost 3 months now, his name is Damien Rowe, but I don't know how you'll be able to see him, seeing as how I live without the compound with my father and he has threatened to have you arrested if you return.

I'm sorry, but I thought you should know...

Before I answer your question, I want to share with you a [neat visualization](http://resonate.io/2014/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Moritz-Stefaner-01.png) that appeared in Wired magazine recently. It shows how fields like neuroscience is becoming more and more interdisciplinary over time with other fields (including psychology!). It may appear that neuroscience has been making more progress than the others within CogSci, but this does not mean that those fields are becoming less relevant or even, obsolete. Rather I would describe what you observed as a cycle. This cycle is mainly due to new technologies, new methodologies, and new ideas a field is making (e.g. cognitive linguistics was huge back in the 1960s and now neuroscience and AI). With that said, it's okay that these fields are answering the same questions; we want them to. As cognitive scientists we want to see how these fields *converge* on those questions based on their *own* levels of analysis and their own viewpoint. It's only going to help us better understand ourselves and how we operate as human beings.","1412122122"

Yes we did show some vulnerability to counters, but I don't think we will play the same way against higher quality opposition. I was getting annoyed by the HT analysis by those Brits about our defensive line. (think Germany vs Algeria and Germany vs France)

"knitting","t5_2qiu0","What I would do:

- knit what you want with it.  Maybe one of those bunny rabbit head / blanket body lovies?  Women's shelters in my area are always looking for blankets and toys to give to kids in rough situations.

- if it needs blocking: hand wash with fragrance-free soap in cool water, rinse very well, then lay out and let dry. Then, ""kill"" the yarn by placing a towel over the project and running a steam iron over it.  You want to get it just hot enough to soften it, not so hot that it melts.

- if it doesn't need blocking: run it through the washer in a lingerie bag with a little bit of fragrance-free detergent and ideally a little bit of fabric softener.  I might run it through a second time with no soap and maybe a little bit of vinegar, just to make sure there's no detergent left.  Throw it in the dryer on low.

In my experience, RHSS doesn't get soft enough to be **kept** next to the skin (so no baby blankets, scarves, sweaters, etc.) but it does soften up enough that it doesn't feel scratchy (so it's great for toys, blankets for toddlers on up, etc.)","1412122124"

The one thing you should definitely check into is if the way they have the kitchen configured is up to code for that area. The stove and microwave are right up against a wall. Besides this leading to frustrating cooking, this could be a fire hazard and also could be a sign that they did renovations without a permit.

Instructions:

* Dump the sweet cider into the fermenter and take a gravity reading. (Should be around 1.050)
* Pitch the D47 wine yeast
* Ferment @ 70F!
* When fermentation is complete, take another hydrometer reading. (Should be around 1.004)
* Add some priming sugar and bottle (or keg and force-carbonate.)

Therefore, if you're trying to use a synthetic herbicide that is analagous (only actually works), I would buy a preemergence herbicide. There are weed and feed products, but fertilizer isn't always needed. If it is, then I would buy a weed and feed with prodiamine or pendimethalin in it. Walmart carries a product called Expert Gardener, Crabgrass Preventer. It contains pendimethalin on a 30% nitrogen carrier. It can be applied in the fall to prevent winter annuals and in the spring to prevent summer annuals. There are also products containing dithiopyr, like Hi Yield with Dimension, that are commonly sold in the spring. I don't like Atrazine products due to the fact that there is ample poa annua (a winter annual) with herbicide resistance to it and other photosynthesis II inhibitors.

What we really need is to have some system where the heads of mosques must denounce violence and jihad, whenever the topic arises. This is probably the majority already, but the media usually focuses on the negative stuff and usually the minority is the most vocal.

Free speech? The idea of a complete democracy from the start is ludicrous, because you need to make sure the majority isn't fucking bonkers.

"MakeupAddiction","t5_2rww2","the new YSL Fusion Ink Foundation did not live up to my expectations at all.
Hearing good reviews on youtube and the foundation being 60$ (for less than an oz!) i was expecting this to be my new favorite foundation but boy was I wrong.
When i first applied the foundation, it felt so weird on my skin, almost like silk? But not in a good way, it felt like it wasn't ""latching"" on to my skin and was just slipping on the surface; It says that it has ""high coverage"" but after 2 thick layers i could still see blemishes on my face, and i don't even have that many. It also claims to last up to 24 hours which is totally false; almost laughable. I've had drug store brand foundation that lasts longer. Even only after an hour from application i noticed my face getting oily and the foundation was settling into the fine lines on my face.  I was pretty upset because it was the most money i had ever spent on a single item of makeup. I tried it out for a week and didn't like it any better than the first time i applied it so I exchanged it for the Kat Von Dee Lock it in Tattoo foundation which is way better and my new favorite (and half the price).

In the last few months the last few pieces clicked into place and now I can't bottom enough. Seriously, I'd sit on it all day if I could. First issue was sorting out the bowel movements. My cool (gay) doctor knew what the deal was and recommended Pysillium Husks which makes your poo just right - not hard and not runny. That sorted out all the other problems. Then after years of practice I worked out how to clean myself out properly and reasonably quickly. That helped a lot. Finally, I worked out how my insides were all constructed - dick feels better going upwards rather than forwards. (That might be common knowledge but it weren't for me for a long time). And after that - no problems.

From the page: 

""I am a disabled artist and advocate for survivors of domestic violence. I am in need of help paying one large bill that began when I was in the hospital in 2011.

I maxed my emergency credit card to pay daily and school related bills after I was hospitalized for a month. 

Ever since then, I have not been able to pay this card down due to my disability. After being released, it took me 2-3 months to get back on track with my income and expenses. I was forced to leave school soon after due to my physical condition. 

I still work; however, I cannot work enough hours to get ahead. I even began a small business for my art but find that keeping up with making and promoting it takes me out for weeks at a time. I have big dreams but limited means in every sense.

Removing even a portion of this debt will go a long way to stabilising my life, even if it is not the full amount. Currently I can only apply enough funds to pay the interest.

The bill is 3100 dollars. 
I am asking 3300 in order to cover any costs associated with raising money via gofundme.com. 
I originally thought to set this goal to 3000 so that I could pay the last few hundred, myself (which is extraordinarily difficult on my budget and could take many months!). However, beggars cannot be choosers.

If it could be paid in part or even in full, you will be helping a person help themself as well as their community.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I have had many strangers rely on me for help in times of need and I have been honored to assist them. Now, I rely on the kindness of strangers to do the same.""

"keto","t5_2rske","Please post your complete stats (Height, Sex, Weight, BF%) so you can get better advice.

* How many calories are you currently eating?
* Macro breakdown, in grams, not %
* What type of exercise do you do, duration, how many times per week?

Also...

&gt;So when I decided to adapt to a keto lifestyle, I had heard all these amazing stories of how quickly people who'd followed it had been dropping weight and how effective (and healthy) it is if you do it right.

This are exceptional cases, and mostly on very overweight people. Once you get near your goal weight, stalls happen more often and last longer.

&gt;Well, I've ""started"" keto twice now, and stopped each time, because of a lack of progress after the first week (maybe two) each time.

This is why you are not really seeing results. The ""magic"" weight loss some people experience during the first weeks is water / glycogen weight. The smaller you are, the smaller the weight changes will be. Also, if you already come from a low carb diet, water / glycogen loss will be on a smaller scale.

&gt;I first began Keto in April of this year and did it consistently for two months , during that time I lost about 6 pounds (and I believe this was in the first week) and nothing after that! Despite positively staying under 30-20 carbs a day and 1200-1400 calories. Around graduation time (end of may) I then stopped doing keto.

Without your stats, we can't know if 1200-1400 is too much or too little. Also, 200 kcals can make a difference between losing weight or staying the same.","1412122145"

1: Yes, because most stereo reverbs are actually two mono reverb units, as most stereo effects are. As such, due to inconsistencies in the springs, each channel's input audio, and circuit tolerances, phasing can be an issue. 

2: often, when creating a stereo image from a mono source, the mono output is simply attenuated and duplicated. The only sense of stereo you hear is due to separation of sound sources.

3: Assuming a mono reverb unit even has a stereo input (which it wouldn't), it would sum the two as it is only a single reverb unit and cannot process two separate signals, else it would be a stereo reverb unit.

M&gt;M

1: rarely are stereo reverbs made only for stereo audio. As such, you can usually use each side as a mono unit, however the controls will sometimes still be the same for each side.

2: mono reverbs are the basis of reverb units, be they stereo, mono, or even cross-verb units. ","1412122147"

Tom Morello:
&gt;I regret that my twitter salvo about the treatment I received at a Seattle restaurant and the subsequent digital tempest in a tea pot may have taken away from the important work of those organizing for a $15min wage and the Seattle show I played on their behalf. 
When next in Seattle I would be happy sit down over a beverage--or sooner on the phone--and discuss the matter to conclusion with all concerned. The restaurant, the incident and my bruised feelings don't matter. What does matter is the hard, tireless work put in by those committed to fighting for a more just world. 
If interested however here is the non-140 character blow by blow of the ""Encounter At @The5PointCafe"":
Our team of musicians flew to Seattle for a benefit show for 15 Now, the grassroots campaign to raise the minimum wage to $15. I've long been a supporter of this particular campaign as well as the national drive for a living wage.
The show itself at the former Off Ramp went great. I was reunited with former @Audioslave band mate @ChrisCornell for the first time in years and together with the raucous crowd it was really a special evening. A good deal of money was raised for the 15Now cause and we wandered into the Seattle late night happy...and hungry. 
Two of our hosts from 15Now a band mate of mine, a woman from management, and my brother from Kenya comprised our party. Someone suggested Five Points, a spot I remember fondly from back in the day. I had some reservations because one of our 15Now friends said that while the owner was a good guy and treated staff well, the restaurant itself was on ""the wrong side of the minimum wage issue"" and had attempted to water down the $15min wage legislation by drawing out the implementation period and adjusting for tips to make it more palatable to small businesses. I am 100% on the side of an undiluted $15Now initiative which is in my view the only ""pro worker"" position, but hey we were hungry so let's give it a shot.
The restaurant was packed and spirited and we asked the doorman ""party of 6 for dinner?"" He said they were at capacity and it would probably be a 10min wait. No problem. Then ten people or so left the restaurant. ""Can we come in now? Those people just left."" No. ""Why?"" I'm not letting anyone in. ""Wait a second. Are you at capacity or are you not letting anyone in?"" I'm not letting you in. ""So you're no longer at capacity but we can't come in?"" No. ""Um ok. How about we order take out and sit at one of these 20 empty tables outside?"" No. ""Ok what's really going on here dude? Some of us have traveled a long way. He's from Kenya! I'm from the 90's!"" I'm not letting you in. ""Say, is your manager here? Maybe he's a Rage Against The Machine fan? He might even raise your pay to $15 an hour!"" More people leave the restaurant. It's clearly under capacity. Then our friends see that inside the restaurant several tables are occupied by friends of ours from 15Now. ""Hey look we don't even need a table. We'll just join our friends who are already inside?"" No. ""Really? Why not?"" I'm not letting you in. ""Can we just go TALK to them and see if they have room for us?"" No. It was like a hipster version of a Studio 54 doorman. At that point my band mate made a flavorful declaration and we decamped to the trusty, attitude free, IHOP where we enjoyed a drama free stack of hotcakes. 
To be clear: at no point did myself or anyone in our party ""demand special treatment"", a ""private room"" or any other ridiculousness.
I was however pissed at the rudeness of the doorman to my friends and my younger brother--of whom I'm quite protective. I question what underlying motives the doorman may have had. Bad day? Anti-Kenyan? Preferred the Spin Doctors?
Whatever the cause, it is unfortunate that MY actions in response have diverted attention from the great work done by 15Now. ""Twitter bitching"" is counterproductive as it invites grossly misinformed conjecture not easily dispelled in 140 characters. Lesson learned.
As I've said before Seattle is truly an advanced society with its $15 minimum wage, its legal pot, it's gay marriage, its great music and its Seattle Seahawks. 
Next time we'll call ahead.","1412122148"

I have no idea how you can get the position he is in without understanding the question ""Can you telnet to port 22?"". We had to teach him that, and so many other basic things that I just don't understand how he can even do his job. 

It's not just his lack of knowledge, but the lack of finding his own answers. If he doesn't know something he will never, ever, Google it. He always just starts asking people.

For a long time the Colts were built around Manning getting the team that early lead, allowing the Colts' ends (Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis) to employ pure pass rush techniques and tee off on opposing quarterbacks. While allowing for a lot of success in the regular season, this strategy hit snags in several postseason games where the Colts weren't able to grab that early lead.

Ulta requires Benefit Brow Artists to be licensed.

Anyways, if you don't have a kit, and are trying to build artistry skills and contacts, working at a counter (at a Department store) or like Ulta or Sephora is a good way to go.
If you aren't ready to commit that much, you can try to become a vender/artist/representative for a brand. Depending on the brand, the amount of artistry is either very low and they rely on you for sales and training, or they are looking for very, very strong artists.

It might be the ""fastest"" route, in terms of time, but sitting in that stop and go traffic every day would drive me nuts.  Anyway, I-70 is of course a shorter distance than 25 / 225.  But depending on what time you commute, it may be slower due to wrecks and airport traffic.

I would suggest taking Speer through Cherry Creek to Alameda, but the construction near Cherry Creek is a nightmare right now.  Colfax (or one of the streets near it) to Monaco or Quebec and then down through Lowry to 6th Ave might be the least stressful option.  Lots of stop lights, yes, but personally, I'll take 10 minutes extra travel time not to deal with the many, many wrecks and general idiocy that comes with major highways.  Anyway, that's just a matter of preference, you'll have to take lots of different routes to find out what you like best.  ","1412122158"

We've done a poor job tackling, we haven't been great at getting pressure (until this last week) and Carey Williams had been burned multiple times and threw a temper tantrum like a child afterwards.

Ultimately, IMO blaming time of possession for the defenses performances is just making excuses. Theoretically, if the defense was playing well enough, the opponent wouldn't be sustaining drives either. And frankly, in the end, the defense is still responsible for preventing the opponent from scoring whether their own offense is playing well or not. 

Sometimes the defense is on the field more, sometimes the offense needs to make up for the points the defense is allowing. Ultimately, everyone still needs to be held accountable for doing their job ","1412122161"

&gt;It contains alleged quotes from Hitler such as ""Once I really am in power, my first and foremost task will be the annihilation of the Jews.

You really have to look at this stuff carefully and examine the record. 

The source of the quote you cite is: 

&gt;Hell, Josef. ""Aufzeichnung"", **1922**, ZS 640, p. 5

If you [dig up the document](http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/archiv/zs/zs-0640.pdf), you find that ZS 640 is dated 1955; the text was written in 1945, and the source was Josef Hell's notes from 1922. Josef Hell was a reporter for the anti-Hitler newspaper ""[Der gerade Weg](http://i.imgur.com/QKdT4ZS.jpg)."" So it's not the most reliable source.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","Okay. I'm gonna have to make some assumptions here. 

Assumption 1: ASOIAF Dragons =/= TES Dragons. That means that Dragonrend won't affect them, and that they won't release their souls to the Dovahkiin. This is a reasonable assumption, as they display few of the same abilities and none of the intelligence of TES Dragons, and are permanently killable without a Dragonborn's presence. 

Assumption 2: Dragonborn is an adult male Nord, competent with most hand weapons and bows, with a small knowledge of magic (basic healing and combat spells). He uses fairly simple but well crafted iron, steel, and leather gear, probably sturdier than the equipment available to Westerosi Knights, Dothraki, or Unsullied. 

Now, given the sheer destructive power of the Thu'um, even without his typical advantages over TES Dragons, I say the DB takes this. His shouts are too useful and varied, such as the ability to pause time, to become ethereal, and to directly damage through fire, frost, and sheer force. He can increase his speed, reflexes, and make animals like him. 

The Dragons in ASOIAF are less intelligent and no less susceptible to the Thu'um than their TES counterparts, and as they don't have access to shouts of their own, would likely be easy prey for the DB. ","1412122162"

This could be attributed to the retirement of longtime OL coach, Dante Scarnecchia, but it's hard to say for certain.  
  
  Aside from that, the guys coming back from injury don't appear to be at full speed yet (Gronk, Wilfork), Brady has not been great to start the year and we've been asked to play from behind - something very difficult for a team with a weak interior DL, a defensive strategy that is predicated on forcing turnovers and poor pass protection limiting big offensive plays.

"Firearms","t5_2ryez","&gt;Chick-fil-a never banned anything or anyone. There is a huge difference between supporting a business who discriminates, and supporting an individual's free speech. If you want to make the claim that these people would patronize a business that's discriminating stick to that, let's not stretch the facts.

You're correct-- they never did, but that's not the point I'm making. You made the point that these ""internet bigots"" are essentially paper tigers. That's the point I don't agree with: I don't believe that these people are *just* espousing hatred online; I believe their actions also support hate, and that there are enough people in any given case of discrimination that would support a company that supports discrimination, whether implicitly or explicitly. ""Voting with your money"" isn't enough to force anybody to change their ways. 

&gt;Sorry, the government taking your money doesn't give you carte blanche to impose your morality on someone else. 

No offense, but you're the one bringing morality into this. I'm talking about *equal access*. If a business owner made his or her own road, generated his or her own power, managed their water and gas, managed their own contingencies for crime or disaster, and also didn't have the benefit of social security, worker's compensation, or even the courts to enforce contract law, then your argument might have more merit.

You should consider defining up to code here.  That has a lot of different definitions.  For example, a house with a ungrounded outlet isn't 'up to code'.  a  house falling down and dumping bricks on a highway also isn't 'up to code' but may be getting fined thousands on a daily basis.  There is a big gap.  

I'd done transactions before where people were facing fines and liens if they didn't sell by a certain date while the city agreed to give the new owners tons of time to correct them and deal with them.

That's ridiculous. You could say that about any story no matter what order they're in. There's no ""need"" for them to be that way, but there's no reason the shouldn't be either.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_at_Every_Size#History

While today's message of HAES is that at any size you should have healthy habits, though they are ignoring the large elephant in the room that having healthy habits in the first place will lead to a weight loss if you are obese, it seems that it's been riddled with the myths that ""dieting doesn't work"" and that being obese was a natural size for a person. These claims date back to the 80s.

While I would like to believe in a romanticized version of HAES being simply as ""have healthy habits"", it seems to have been pretty fucked up from the beginning.

I used to believe that Linda Bacon had a decent message, but seeing as how she purposefully directs her message towards to super obese like Ragen, Jes Baker, Julianne Wotasik, she's another quack doctor that needs to be stopped.","1412122168"

2) Put the secondary titles on people who are important, and let them interact with OTHER people who are important. Too often the titles are used to get people over, when it's the people who should be getting the titles over.

"Borderlands2","t5_2spu9","I only recently found the Waterfall Skip, by mistake, when I was doing loot midget runs.

To be entirely honest though, most of the skips that I've learned, i.e. the Elevator Skip on BNK3R which if you're unaware of I would be more than happy to show you on PC, through watching Speed Runs.  Specifically the AGDQ multiplayer speed run that was done by TeaWrex, Professor Broman, Ubergoose, and iMysty - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2YYwM1coOU.

I just got a basic idea from the runs and then looked at each skip in more detail on Youtube, just for the sake of citing sources the guy I learned the Bloodshot Stronghold skip from is this guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5A_J6bAYRM, and while he isn't amazing it gave me a decent concept on learning how to grenade jump and where the grenade actually falls.

The best ""Guide"" I can recommend is just to have a video pulled up, either on a phone or second monitor, and play through a part until you have it ""learned"" then move onto the next part and then repeat it several times through the entire thing.  Also, having someone run it with you while you're learning is a lot of help since you can't really know what you're doing wrong unless the video makes it obvious.","1412122169"

The only way to switch that I saw was swapping with someone in your BOLC class well before you graduate (that is probably the only time you'll need your branch manager as a Lieutenant).  

Also in my experience, the best prep for CCC is an ABCT.  I was lucky, I went from an ABCT, to CCC, back to an ABCT.  Most of the guys I knew that were light before, or stuck in some CSSB or stand-alone outfit alone and unafraid have had real troubles adjusting.  Only one I know that went from light or low-footprint to heavy did well and we commanded sister companies and were continually talking to each other about issues.

It's one of the faults of the system.  Brigade Commanders have near complete control of the slate unless DIV Strength Manager intervenes.  That's what happened to me-  I was slated to stay in the Brigade but since I was post command and CCC complete they pulled me to fill a vacancy.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","The fuss IMO is that why should females have to be scantily clad to do the job? I'm sure these ladies and plenty of others are more than qualified to be on the ice team whether or not they are completely done up, showing their stomach, and have perfect hair.  Think about it the other way, you have a team of men shirtless in skinny jeans cleaning the ice.  That sounds ludicrous no?  Why couldn't they keep them in the first place and just put them in matching uniforms as the men?

Also, these types of female roles tend to be disgustingly underpaid (NFL cheerleaders make something like 70-90 dollars a game). Offset that with the amount of money it costs to keep up with perfect hair, top of the line make up and a nice body and they are probably spending more money than they make.  That's really my problem with the whole situation.  if they come out and show me they get paid as much as a man doing their role then sure, you go girl! Give them a union to protect them and maybe get them some benefits, I'll audition! I work in entertainment and I've learned to live with the fact that sometimes objectifying ladies puts butts in the seat. Hell, I've been on stage in lingerie, sighing to myself. But you also best believe I make a liveable wage, have union protection, and see men do things that I am asked to do.  That's why a lot of ladies have a problem with ice girls.","1412122174"

He always blamed himself, and holed himself up completely.  The loss of his  mother pushed him over the edge.  The person responsible walked free, and he blamed the system.

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","I started reading the series about six months before the show came out. There was very little talk about the show at the time, it was just barely on anyone's radar. I didn't know ASOIAF was really popular in the fantasy community, I thought I had randomly stumbled upon a very niche fantasy title buried in an ancient book recommendation thread. 

The world felt medieval and magical and brutal but also slightly alien. The way there are houses with family trees and they all have their own storied histories, triumphs and failures, some going back thousands of years, makes the universe very tangible. I immediately became pretty obsessed with the book, was constantly thinking about it and imagining scenes from it and running plot points over in my head. Hadn't felt like that about a book since Harry Potter when I was younger.

By the time the fifth book came out, I was just finishing the fourth and the show had exploded in popularity. When I started the series a few month before and mentioned it to friends they would say ""Game of Thrones? What's that?"" A few months later I'm in line at a sold-out book signing.

The fourth book was meh, way too many characters I didn't give two shits about, fifth was solid. All in all I'd reread this series from the beginning in a second, especially now that it has been about 3 years and some of it has started to fade.","1412122186"

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","mehhh, Crucible isn't competitive at all and there are no incentives to win.  If bungie's desire for crucible is to be anything more than a time to dick around at your own pace then its up to them to create incentives.  

Implement a rank system,  fix matchmaking, give better loot to the better team.  These are all easy things bungie could do, and if they don't then its obvious they don't give a shit about making cruicible into anything more than a subpar team death match shooter.  

Personally I get my competitive FPS fix from CounterStrike.  I was honestly hoping Destiny would bring something dramatically different to the PvP FPS genre (like holy shit this is nothing like Halo or Call of Duty).  I was hoping the they would take some elements of non-FPS games to intergrate with their PvP.  Nope, instead a got a less fun and much more broken version of CoD or Halo (games I don't really play anyway). 

It not terrible.  I mean when I am in a fireteam already and we finish the nightfall and are looking for something else to do, its fun to jump into the occasionale crucible match.  But it doesn't stand on its own (when I think it easily could if they wanted it to). 

I don't blame people from jumping into a game just to get the two crucible marks and being ideal the entire time. I am not going to appeal to random stranger humanity to create an optimal gaming experience for me.  That is entirely on bungie.    ","1412122188"

but if arena in WoW has taught me anything, reserving rewards for the best just makes it impossible for anyone behind the curve to become the best.

I should also point out that any favoritism, perceived or not will only serve to make the wait times for matches longer as it discourages new/undergeared people from queueing. something I've experienced far too much in other MMO style games.

""Chava is a golem, a creature made of clay, brought to life by a disgraced rabbi who dabbles in dark Kabbalistic magic. When her master, the husband who commissioned her, dies at sea on the voyage from Poland, she is unmoored and adrift as the ship arrives in New York in 1899.

Ahmad is a jinni, a being of fire, born in the ancient Syrian desert. Trapped in an old copper flask by a Bedouin wizard centuries ago, he is released accidentally by a tinsmith in a Lower Manhattan shop. Though he is no longer imprisoned, Ahmad is not entirely free – an unbreakable band of iron binds him to the physical world.

The Golem and the Jinni is their magical, unforgettable story; unlikely friends whose tenuous attachment challenges their opposing natures – until the night a terrifying incident drives them back into their separate worlds. But a powerful threat will soon bring Chava and Ahmad together again, challenging their existence and forcing them to make a fateful choice""","1412122189"

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","Working at Longs Drugs (now CVS) you can have no more than 5 twenty dollar bills in your drawer (no bills higher than a twenty can be in your drawer at any time).  Instead they have what is called a ""drop box"".  This said drop box is a secure, quick way to put away large bills and what not; every night each drop box is opened and the money is pulled out in order for us to place it in a deposit bag.  For those of us with morals and respect for the law, this is just another part of your job and you are expected to help the closing manager in according.  Mind you not all closing managers will allow the co-workers to help organize the cash from this box, however, my closer always knew he could trust me and I was fully bond-able.

Now that I have that explained let me tell you the story.  One night, as usual, I was closing and the closing manager called all of us to come and watch the register and doors while he was gathering the cash and getting the paperwork ready for the next day.  I began to help him separate the cash from the drop box and was dividing it into 20's, 50's &amp; 100's.  The other worker that was there suddenly came up and began to help by dividing the cash.  He proceeded to make a comment that ""pocketing the cash would be easy even if the camera's were watching because he could just run out of the door.""  Anybody with common freaking sense is not going to say this while they are dividing money in front of other workers and a management staff, but oh no not this bright one.  The very next day I reported him to my then main store manager and I had already had an issue with him making comments about my figure (I've got some booty and some boobies without being a fluffy person), so this guy was already on watch to begin with.  That very same day he was reported, he was also fired.  I was so grateful because as a worker preventing internal shrink was my job and I was proud that I had helped the store avoid a bigger issue in the future.

Trust me, my complaint isn't the material or that it's too challenging or that we're using textbooks, it's the way what we're learning is being put across. I know I still need some sort of textbook guide because I know I need it to get better - there's still heaps I need to learn. My annoyance is that we're just focused on this (kind of meh) textbook and have no real life context for what we're learning. Which is why I want to take some of the learning into my own hands, which is why I posted here in the hopes I'd get some helpful suggestions.

I hope I can look back after this year and feel like I've come somewhere. I'm just not sure that that's going to be the case =/","1412122191"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Er, actually a quarterly report published by the IAEA [stated](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/05/us-iran-nuclear-iaea-idUSKBN0H01HL20140905) that ""Iran has failed to address concerns about suspected atomic bomb research by an agreed deadline"".

&gt;The Islamic Republic has implemented just three of five nuclear transparency steps that it was supposed to by Aug. 25 under a confidence-building deal it reached with the IAEA in November, according to the quarterly report.

&gt;Crucially, it has not provided information on the two issues that are part of the IAEA's investigation: alleged experiments on explosives that could be used for an atomic device, and studies related to calculating nuclear explosive yields.

This was recently followed up by [more concerns](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/05/us-iran-nuclear-iaea-idUSKBN0H01HL20140905) from the IAEA, which reported:

&gt;The IAEA had also observed via satellite imagery ""ongoing construction activity"" at Iran's Parchin military base, the report said. Western officials believe Iran once conducted explosive tests there of relevance in developing a nuclear weapon and has sought to ""cleanse"" it of evidence since then. Iran has long denied U.N. nuclear inspectors access to the base.","1412122191"

Also, I'm not saying he didn't regret it. Not at all. 

I mean more along the lines of regardless of whether he did or not, it's a hugely jarring issue for where things stood at the time.

EDIT: Or maybe the opposite, high radiation when it's on, so it's harder to maintain and get to, or maybe just high radiation all around so you need a rad suit.

EDIT2: Or maybe low radiation for a coal generator, and for a larger radtown have a small nuclear power station? Or maybe a bunker/military outpost with a nuclear generator? Maybe like in World War Z, a submarine with a nuclear power station?","1412122199"

**RB: Gio, Ellington, Bradshaw, Ingram, D. Brown (To be dropped...)**

**WR: Megatron, Harvin, DJax, Gordon, Cooks**

**TE: Orange Julius, Niles Paul (To be dropped...)**

The reason I'm kind of itching to get a trade going is that I'm 1-3 (most points in my league though...) and Calvin's health is concerning me. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, even if it's just to tell me to stand pat because my team is going to come around.","1412122201"

"LeagueofLegendsMeta","t5_2smhl","Well if you look at bans they should be theoretically even depending on the OPs and champion pools of the pros. Maybe one pro is really best on one champion so he needs to first pick that. On the other hand maybe there aren't a lot of OP picks at the moment so the pros value getting one of the few that slip through on first pick

But Purple side has the ability to counter pick the mid which doesn't happen as much b/c often they are only soft counters or the player is not comfortable on the counters. 

If you ever watch LastShadow9's coaching for league of legends he often goes very indepth into how in high tiers Blue and Purple side make a huge difference in play. Pros take some of the smallest things most people don't understand and abuse these. This goes into positioning hitting skill shots early dragon control etc. Its much harder for purple side to steal dragon. 

Now you might say purple side can steal baron easier which is true but usually when a pro team is taking baron its because they aren't scared of the other team stealing b/c the purple side isn't in a position too. ","1412122205"

Of course, the horizontal line in both of these is actually part of a larger ""stroke"" that includes a vertically-oriented line. Anyway, in both of these examples, I have noticed in handwritten characters that the appearance of the line immediately following the horizontal line is affected. Reversing the direction in which I write the horizontal line will completely alter the way the character is written, and I fear it will look as though it were written backwards.

That said, perhaps that isn't a big deal outside of the instructional context! I'm not sure of the effect reversing stroke direction has on legibility. ","1412122205"

&gt;Comorbidities are other diseases that occur at the same time in the same individual.  Many of these diseases overlap to some extent both in the clinical sense, (the symptoms and signs one has when they are alive such as concentration/memory problems) and the pathological sense (what their brain looks like upon post-mortem examination).  For example, of the brains that the Boston lab has studied, 10% of “CTE cases also met the pathologic criteria for Alzheimer’s Disease” (4).  Another “thirty-seven percent had comorbid neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer’s, Motor Neuron Disease, and Parkinson’s” (4).  This means that 47% of the 80 submitted cases have other potential explanations for the clinical presentation of these athletes.  All of these other conditions also happen in the general, non-football playing population.

&gt;Another study performed in Canada using the Canadian Football Leagues ‘brain bank’ at Toronto Western Hospital also found that 50% of the cases that had been submitted, and suspected of having CTE due to extensive concussion history, did not have any evidence of CTE (5).  All were presumed to have CTE prior to their deaths, however 3 of the 6 subjects did not.  They instead had normally occurring diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and ALS (5).

&gt;“It is worth noting that a number of the degenerative tauopathies, such as behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, share many of the clinical and pathological features of ‘modern’ CTE” – McCrory et al., 2013 (1).

&gt;There have been 61 pure athlete cases (the rest have been military or other) that have gone through the Boston lab.  Of these 61 athlete cases 25% demonstrated no pathological features of CTE and a number of others (approximately 24%) had co-morbid conditions as stated above.  Of the pure athlete cases only 15 were diagnosed as having a pure CTE pathology.  Furthermore, in these 15 cases there was not always a clear association with the pathology discovered and the clinical presentation of the person when they were alive.  In other words, some of those with observable CTE findings in their brains had virtually no signs or symptoms during their life and some were donated expected to be controls.  Others that had signs and symptoms and were considered to have CTE given their extensive concussion history, had no evidence of CTE during examination of their brain (1,3,6,7).

You can't go wrong with any combination of these. Either the MVP if you want long battery life, or the VV v3 if you want more portability.

If you get the VV v3 I'd reccommend the Nautilus mini because the regular nautilus would be pretty large on top of it.

There seems to be no advantage/disadvantage or nonneutral game that occurs when someone does a move that's safe on block in other fighting games.  I mean, I like zoning and the neutral game and all, but it's a little disappointing when that's practically the whole game.  Some characters flat out don't have the mixup tools that I listed above and I'm a little confused as to how they're supposed mount a sensible offense when they can hardly force a favorable situation if the opponent chooses to play passive.  This design ruins the interesting push-pull of maintaining or stealing the initiative that you see in other fighting games since there's often no advantage to having the initiative.

"JobFair","t5_32ex8","I was also a US Navy sailor, and I looked into going to a maritime academy to become a licensed engineer.  I decided not to do it at the last moment.  Look into civil maritime schools.  I'm sure Finland has something, but if they don't, look into another country nearby.  A number of European countries have rich histories in maritime related things.  This is probably your best way to become a deck officer.

If you want to go the laborer route (more like enlisted military vs officer), there are probably vocational schools as well.  I'm not very sure.

It can get lonely at sea, but you just don't think about it.  In the military, we were often busy, so there wasn't much time to think about it.  If you like to be alone, and alone with your thoughts, you will have plenty of time.  Take lots of books, study for your next license advancement, take it easy when you can.  

And one thing to remember is that you can find shore side jobs as you get more advanced.  There are jobs in shipyards as well as jobs that don't spend so much time at sea.  Not every ship is going to be a blue water freighter.  Ferries are often not as bad, as well as tug jobs.  They still spend nights away from home, but it isn't quite as often as a large international ship.  However, the pay is in blue water ships.  The shittier the job, the more you get paid.  

I don't know how the marriage dynamics work out over in your neighborhood, but I do know that many, many merchant sailors in the US are either divorced or never married.  When you're young, being away from home a lot isn't all that bad, but if you want a family, I would focus on a career that gets you closer to home more often.  This *can* be done as a merchant sailor, but the jobs pay less and are probably hard to come by.  If you're one of the best, you are obviously more marketable, and that will affect your prospects greatly.

As always, things may be different in Finland, but I doubt it is very different.  I looked into this quite a bit and talked to a number of merchant sailors.  Their stories are all quite similar.","1412122227"

"FantasyLife3ds","t5_328nc","I don't know if people might tell me I'm terribly wrong here, but I wanted to hoard some money so I could think about moving and getting some stuff for the house to decorate with, and so I got into doing bounties, which as a tailor at first seemed kind of hard, but then I realised there are some really handily set up spots for ""farming"" bounties. 

If you're either patient like me, or a fighting class, you'll probably find the best bet is to collect the iron troll things from the cave in the mountain peak area (you can just go up into the final treasure room and back in and there'll be a new troll, so that you end up taking all 3 to that handy bounty collector on the mountain side), or the biggest bounty I've gotten so far, and perhaps the easiest, is to focus on the that little campsite area between the port puerto side of the grassy plains and the outskirts of the desert area. The campsite has a handy save point and bounty collector, and then it's just a matter of going down one screen, across the first bridge and taking out the two goat things so you can have some space to fight the ""killer horn"" or whatever it's called (there's no mistaking it). It's really hard for me as a non fighting class, but I found that by hitting once, running back up the bridge I came from until it loses interest and returns to it's default position, I can come back, get a free hit, retreat and repeat. I don't seem to have the agility needed to duck back in a normal fight situation, but the retreat method does work, I've gotten two so far, and each one is worth 1200 dosh. Or you can go back up the path from the campsite and get ""taurus"", I think there are two around there, and they are 750 each, and respawn ok from what I've seen. 

By focusing on bounties, I've now saved 43000 or so dosh, and I've never used my ""skill"" or crafted items to make dosh (I just craft them so I advance, and keep them in case I want to wear them later). Killing the big horn can provide golden fleece which I imagine for non tailors might be worth a bit of dosh too c: I'm sure that if I were to sit and do the maths on it some of my tailored items might be worth exploiting for money but since I'm a poor with numbers, I like the literal payment of bounties since I didn't have to invest anything, I know it's all profit c:","1412122233"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","When you have no self-esteem, are deep in a depression, have quit all the things that matter to you, lost your pets and your partner, and probably left school as well, how will that help you to be the guardian of the family? Because that is exactly what's going to happen if you don't kick her out now.

Your parents seem to think there are two options here: you living a responsible satisfying adult life with your sister and you living a responsible satisfying adult life without your sister. They are wrong. The two options are: you living a responsible satisfying adult life without your sister or you retreating into mental illness and dropping any pretense of competence and responsibility because of your sister's abuse. You being OK and well and living with your sister isn't one of the options on offer.

Your parents like her so much? Let them have her. You owe nothing to your family. I don't mean that we, in general, owe nothing to our families. Family members should support one another whenever possible. I mean that you, specifically, little-animal, have family that could not possibly give less of a fuck about your mental and physical well-being. This thread is full of strangers on the internet who care more about you than your family does. When you have family like that, family that doesn't care about you in the slightest, then the correct response is that you owe them nothing.

We want to have our parents praise us for our accomplishments, I really understand that. But your accomplishment here is ""slowly killing myself so that my sister could take full advantage of my kindness."" It's not an accomplishment your parents should wish on you. If they do, their praise is worth nothing.","1412122240"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Adding to this because it's all fantastic advice:

When you talk to your dad own up to your feelings about moving here and acknowledge that you felt and do feel that way. But also say the exact same things you've said here: you're proud (it's implied) of your dad as his hard work. You aren't asking him to give up the career and job opportunities, etc. But this current school situation is way less than ideal for you. Ask him for support in speaking to the school and administration.

And also ask him for support in staying connected with your old friends, via email, phone, skype, maybe even a visit back to them once or twice. But understand you will need to form new connections in this new village or you will become even more emotionally isolated.

Those connections don't need to be from your school or even your same age group to be honest. Most of us don't become mature enough to connect (really connect) with another person of a different age group until later on but don't rule out becoming friends with another adult. 

What are things around town that you can do? Are there any clubs, sports or hobby or interest focused? My own sister built up her current social network after her old one bottomed out by hanging out at a yarn shop. She even eventually got hired because she meshed so well with both the core customer base and the employees. As you get familiar with your new home look for places where you can spend time and get to know others naturally.

Doing all that as a Catholic: Yikes.

This happens when an argument against Catholic moral teaching becomes less about self-intuition and more about what God is actually trying to tell us.

Obviously, you'd go to the counter to get your record when you picked one out.  But the wicked little thought persisted - suppose they were just selling the album covers without records to unsuspecting (or uncaring) hipsters?  

Now that thought might not be so far-fetched. 

The records are there to listen to, though the reasons for listening to them rather than digital formats are mostly the fun, or just the irrational appeal of it.   Plus, if you have a taste for classical music, LP's are cheap and in excellent condition;  some are really dirt cheap.  I picked up a really nice recording of Beethoven woodwind ensemble music, Trio in C Major and Sextet in E Flat Major, for 49 cents.

An arborist said this tree was dead and had to come down, so we had them fell it and chop it up.  If I could do it differently, I'd have them cut into 6"" logs so they can be easier to manage.

I've drilled 3 holes in a column about 6"" apart and spaced each column about 6-8"" apart, effectively gridding it.  Then waxed the top, which is considerable wax.  I've been cutting the expensive cheese wax with cheaper parrafin I found at grocery outlet for 3 dollars/ lb.

"creepyPMs","t5_2ug83","Met this guy at a friend's party, we exchanged maybe 5 words total. He was pretty cute and into rock climbing. He added me on facebook, we chit chat, he asks for my number, we keep talking. He seems cool, interesting, and funny. Then he gives me a huge speech about his feelings, how he was falling for me and how he ""would be hurt but wouldn't be mad if I liked another guy"" which set off some red flags because I was dating a few other guys and felt nothing more than mildly interested in getting to know him better. I thanked him for the compliments, explained that I had just gotten out of a serious relationship and stopped answering him. 

I climb at a rockwall near my house every day. He texted me on the 19th and said something along the lines of ""I'm going to [the rockwall] and if you don't want to see me then you better avoid the place."" I was kinda indignant that I should have to skip climbing because of him and also didn't really believe that he'd make the almost 2 HOUR trip to the rockwall. So, after discussing my discomfort with one of his friends and being assured that he was totally harmless, I went.

He was there. He was incredibly nice, charming, friendly and normal. We climbed for a bit, he belayed me (after some hesitation) and everything seemed fine. He wanted to party afterwards and I said maybe, but I was leaning towards just having a quiet night in. Then this exchange happened. I haven't answered yet and he hasn't texted again but sends me a few snapchats a day and likes everything I put on Instagram/facebook.

I kinda have a really bad gut feeling about the situation. But I also understand that if he really is depressed he might be struggling and not really aware of how creepy he comes across sometimes. My heart broke when he said the last thing and I'm fighting every urge to start apologizing like mad and invite him over. I also realize that he knows I have a huge soft spot for sad people and could be manipulating me. It's a bit of a weird situation because I'm pretty close with a lot of his friends and I'll definitely run into him at parties in the near future. 

Any advice would be hugely appreciated :)

I mean, our dog is borderline entirely silent, aside from his feet pounding against the ground as he runs, and his occasional nails clacking, he makes not much noise. He's also almost entirely black, so at night other than his teeth, he's *very, very* hard to see.

While it is nice most of the time, we really wanted him to bark and let us know that something was wrong or agitating him *before it was too late*. A slippery slope to try and navigate, definitely, but it was worth him barking.

Mostly this is truly in the ""worst case scenario"" kinda deal, but for all parties involved I'd rather have him definitively warn anyone first. Spare no chance.","1412122249"
"keto","t5_2rske","BPC is a staple of my Keto program.  3 days a week I do IF with just BPC.  Usually 2 coffees in that day, with a bunch of water or tea throughout the day that's it.  and it is just like fasting if you are following the 5:2 Fasting protocol which allows up to 25% of your normal calories.  MAny here know that Keto mimics what fasting does metabolically.  

It can sustain you.  You definitely want to use MCT oil instead of Coconut Oil if you can afford it as its like 6x more potent for the MCTs , which help with the mental clarity/energy.  I see a lot of people recommending different things (like whipping cream instead of Oil) and really you need to start with what has been proven to work, and then go from there.

Use BP Coffee beans - You can use normal but I am telling you it makes a difference in the results due to lack of mytotoxins.  What stinks is it is expensive(I am finishing a 5 lb bag).  If you don't want to , you need to source an Organic coffee that uses Wet Processing of the beans, but just using regular starbucks (Uggh) or K-cups is going to affect the potency.

Use unsalted grass fed butter - I recently switched to regular butter because I was out and notice a difference when I do.

Once you are crusing along, you can start experiementing for yourself, but don't knock it if you haven't tried it in its original intended form - There is more science behind it than you think.

Use MCT Oil instead of coconut oil - It ends up being cheaper in the long run due to the potency of the Medium Chain Triglycerides.

You can then add a few other things (I add stevia, cocoa powder, protein powder, just to change things up a bit. 

I hear people not blending it and trying to just mix it other ways like shaking in a blender bottle (my daughter does that ) - If you don't blend it  it will taste oily.  If blended, it will be frothy/smooth (frothy especially when I add a bit of Whey powder).","1412122249"

Whenever a programmer implements OS detection, it relies on that release version number, not the name of the OS.

My main problem with the old PL was that he used to have a really low chance of creating illusions, so you could not rely on creating them midfight. You either had to use manta or create them beforehand.

Now, the chance is high enough that all you need to do is start rightclicking. Charge is also an amazing spell because it helps him and his illusions stay on his opponent. With just aquila/treads/diffusal, you can now contribute to a teamfight.

One thing I also notice about some PL players is that they tend to doppel when they jump on somebody. Instead, you should lance-&gt;charge them, then use doppel to dodge their counter attack, or stun or whatever they throw at you. Sometimes you can charge in, get a kill and doppel out before their team can lock you down.","1412122256"

His younger brother (lets name him Jim), who I of course knew, seemed rather normal. Anyways me and Bob stopped being friends with each other all together. 7 years go by, I haven't seen Bob but last December I saw Jim. He seemed rather different, had this strong vibe about him that I just could not place. I told him if he ever needs anything, to call me (we live quite close) and I'll help him out. Anyways fast forward 4 months, I get a call and told that he's being tried for attempted murder. It was surreal, almost like it hit so close to home. He was a good kid, but something changed I guess.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","Heres what I mean in the simplest terms, I can't write a treatise on the complex Economic and Sociological factors that go into it, suffice it to say that I'm not blaming white people or even racists really, like much of society's ailments institutional racism is the result of individual actors trying to maximize utility. 

A group of thugs is not an institution in this context because they have no authority outside of their self contained group. In this same way the modern KKK isn't an institution. If a group of thugs decided to discriminate against white people you could literally shoot them for trying to attack you and you'd have the law on your side.

"IWantOut","t5_2r5hw","Seattle: It's best for one's social life to live somewhere inside the Seattle city limits, but some neighborhoods are better than others.

I recommend somewhere close to the main lines (I-90 or I-5) within about 10 miles of the city center. Living close to I-5 south means you can use the Light Rail for transit, which is super helpful, but the buses are pretty good anywhere there is a transit center.

This is a tech town; your skills are in demand.  Don't worry about your major; Microsoft is chock full of History majors. If your skills are up to snuff and you are willing to do contracting, you can likely land a job over the phone in the next few days - no joke. Put a resume together and throw it on Monster and Dice and watch your phone blow up. Push hard enough and you may even get some sort of relocation package.

I've been to Texas. Seattle is better. I grew up here, though, so I am a little biased. :)

If those people don't hold the same religious rights as a corporation and a corporation is allowed to bring another religion in to its daily functioning, then you have a conflict of interest and someone's going to have to give up their 'freedoms'.

"environment","t5_2qh1n","I don't know if this is the best place for this, but I believe it warrants some discussion. This was brought to my attention at a Garnet Roger's concert I attended recently.

According to Garnet, and some hasty research on my part, the land for Black Point, AKA Fogerty's Cove, Nova Scotia has been expropriated from family that has owned the land for generations. See Expropriation Act here:

http://nslegislature.ca/legc/statutes/exproprn.htm

It is notoriously difficult to fight this legislation in Nova Scotia according to Garnet.

http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1218328-difficult-to-fight-expropriation-in-nova-scotia

I'll supply some more links below, all of which I found through the link in the title for Black Point's Facebook page. The area in question is in the migration path for whales and the environment impact could be devastating. Garnet said something along the lines of making it difficult, or at least more expensive, to push this through, because there is a historical precedence for this kind of expropriation not being overturned.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","Disclaimer: I'm one of the co-founders of Hedgy (listed in the article), so I can only speak on how Hedgy is different than Coinapult.

Hedgy is a two-sided OTC derivatives marketplace that matches bitcoin speculators, who are long on bitcoin, with miners, merchants, remittance processors and payment gateways looking to short bitcoin, without selling for another more stable asset. This enables the long parties to gain consistent exposure to the price movement of bitcoin without buying or selling the underlying asset; and gives those looking to short bitcoin, a way to protect themselves against the downside price risk, without converting to another more stable asset. In this approach, we designed Hedgy to give bitcoin holders a better reason to keep their bitcoin, which we believe is great for the bitcoin economy.   

Coinapult's ""Locks"" service solves the same pain point of bitcoin volatility, but they simply take a different approach. From what I understand, Coinapult will liquidate your bitcoin for a more stable store of value, such as gold or USD. This is great for solving the micro problem of bitcoin volatility in the short term, however it actually increases the macro volatility of bitcoin in the long term because it adds selling pressure to the entire bitcoin market. 

Basically, just two different approaches to the same problem. Although as Hedgy's designer, I must say that I'm a bit envious of Coinapult's beautiful design ;)

 A first-time parachutist is worried about his chute not opening, and the instructor assures him there is a second parachute. 'But what if that fails?' 'In that case, say ""Allah, save me.""
'Will that work?' 'Without fail.'

So, up in his plane, he jumps - and the parachute does not open.
In a panic, he pulls the seconf cord - but it comes away in his hand.

Falling rapidly, he remembers the advice and calls out 'Allah save me.'

A large brown hand extends from a cloud and softly catches him, then lowers him to the ground.

Standing up and finding himself unhurt, he says 'Thank Christ for that!'

From the cloud, a large brown foot extends and squashes him. 


Of the first two jokes, I'd say the first is more thought-provoking, the second more laugh-getting. So perhaps it is the better.

Section 2. [**Impact**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck_tha_Police#Impact) of article  [**Fuck tha Police**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck%20tha%20Police): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The song ""Fuck tha Police"", containing N.W.A's trademark inflammatory lyrics, stood out in particular from many of the songs on *Straight Outta Compton.* It highlights many of the tensions between black urban youth and the [police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_the_United_States). The song was prophetic in its reading the widespread resentment towards the police that later boiled over in the [1992 Los Angeles riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots) following the [Rodney King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King) incident. The song also alleged that blacks in the [police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police) were worse than the whites, with lyrics such as:

&gt;But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop

&gt;Especially controversial were the areas of the song that appear to condone violence towards police authorities; lines such as ""I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope/Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope/with me"" and ""A sucka in a uniform waitin' to get shot/by me, or anotha nigga"" directly reference the murder of police officers.

In a hypothetical situation where you are allowed to add a running back to your team, and your options are Abdullah or Gurley, which one (NOT 3) would you pick?  That is very clearly the question.

I'm sure your 3 runningback rotation is great, but you'd have to be pretty dense to think that switching one of them with Abdullah or Gurley wouldn't be an improvement.  Again, we're not comparing 3 to 1.

You need to mark edges as Sharp (also Edge Menu) where it is actually a hard edge.  This will prevent the Shade Smooth (Face Menu) faces from rounding along the edges that it should not.  This will really clean up your metal frame.

As for reflection, here are my 2 best renders so far with reflections - if you have any questions I would be happy to elaborate.

Edit - Also, you definitely need a nice bevel on a lot of your sharp edges - it will really catch the light and add a lot more realism in a close-up like this.

And to the pros and cons relating to 1 and 2 -- I do think it's possible to like 2 over 1.  Personally, I think the story//lore of 2 is fascinating and better than 1. But I was REALLY disappointed with the NPCs. Most NPCs in 2 felt static, their storylines felt too streamlined.

"ainbow","t5_2tcpq","Well, that's because you want to make Islam look bad. I'll address some of your examples.

&gt; Iranian Executions
&gt;
&gt; Saudi Arabian Executions

You're merely listing countries that happen to have Muslim rulers and also the death penalty. Most of the death penalties carried out in both countries are related to the extremely harsh drug laws, in particular convictions of poor foreign men. While Islam does not look lightly upon drug use and abuse, harsh policies on drugs are not unique, and it is questionable at best whether this has anything to do with Islam. It should be noted that not only are the laws very harsh, the trials have also been criticized. Most of the convictions directly derived from Islamic law have to do with murder and rape. The remainder however are indeed quite horrifying, and though the amount of convictions for adultery, sodomy and apostasy remains relatively low, particularly in Iran, every one is one too many.

&gt; Chinese Axe attacks
&gt; 
&gt; Russian Bus bombings
&gt;
&gt; Philippino muslim terrorists

There is something to be said about these, for while their methods are and should be criticized, they are also a result of the central government's repressive rule (less so in the Philippines). Terrible indeed, but their motivations are also related to nationalism and not Islam solely.

&gt; 9/11
&gt; 
&gt; Boko Haram
&gt; 
&gt; ISIS
&gt;
&gt; London Bombings

These are clearly horrible, and the perpetrators probably didn't doubt they were doing God's work. But let's say for demonstrational purposes that the perpetrators of these are 500.000 people. Half a million is about 0.03 % of all Muslims. If it were Scientology, that would be about 150 murderous Scientologists. I don't think a tiny, tiny minority of Muslims being violent terrorists is quite enough to justify generalized Islamophobia. It should also be noted the great majority of Muslims do not feel that these represent them, and many clerics have argued that they are not proper Muslims or even Muslims at all. That is a theological debate I am not qualified at all to go into.","1412122288"

An LDR is a funny, funny Blue Pill thing. Around these parts it's also known as ""the Nothing"". Having a Long Distance Relationship with a girl is exactly the same as having a big fat Nothing with her.

Sometimes when two people are *all over* one another, and circumstances force them apart, they might start a Skype-lationship or something to tide the two of them over in the time they need to spend apart. Even then, the RP fella will not buy any long distance bullshit the girl might push at first, insisting that all bets are off until the two of them are together again. She might balk at first, but ultimately love him for it. She will work all the harder to keep his attention during the Skypelationship, with sexy outfits she'll model for him on cam, and who knows what... There's a good chance she won't have the time or inclination to stray, because her attention is on keeping her high value guy from straying. How does she know he's so high value? He didn't agree to LDR, for starters.

But in your situation, stuff has already gone south big time with this woman. You gain absolutely nothing by pretending like the two of you are in this LDR thing and you still have her pussy on lockdown. You don't, and really can't do that. Has to be the girl's own idea, please sir lock me down. Because she's holding on for dear life to you, the super unique high value man in her life. Has very little to do with the man's looks, everything to do with behavior and entitlements. Subtle cues that she'll be reading, rain or shine, to descry whether you're The Shit (tm) or - just shit.

(source: Industry cost study that was reviewed and vetted by the FCC) The problem is that the jails are currently allowed to collect commission from the phone providers, and in order to win the contract with the jail, you have to offer high per min rates and high commission rates. So then you have to recover your costs through fees that are noncommisionable. It's a giant fucked up nightmare. Some of the providers are paying commissions up to 95%, and then charging $20 payment fees. While others are trying to pay 40-60% commission rates, with only $2-3 payment fees.

Ebola was spread through the internet and the FCC is looking to regulate internet speeds to prevent viruses larger than 1mb from infecting the human population. Nasa has teamed up with pornhub to help raise awareness of the Ebola outbreak and Obama is herding the infected into concentration camps to try to contain the virus. Engineers are working around the clock to prevent the spread of Ebola to mobile devices. recent research also shows that there is a 90% chance unidan has ""fucked ur mum"".

None of these have stories.  None are play balanced.  None are intended to represent things that I have ever used or would recommend anyone else use in a story-appropriate way.  They're just hypothesis generating ideas.

Why ""horrors""?  Because I found that to be just the sort of funny thing that a common, ignorant person might call it in folk-lore despite adventurers and wizards and whatnot knowing better how minor it truly is.  I don't explain it with anything.  

Why doesn't it do horrific necrotic damage? Because Fire damage from tiny booming dirty explosions was cinematically more interesting to me with fireflies, and more accessible, and sufficiently horrific if one were just some guy getting blasted with it.

Why fireflies?  Because from a folklorish standpoint, that they give off light is reason enough to have a superficial narrative locus on ""fire""--it isn't intended to be literal any more than Leomund's Tiny Hut being a dome and nothing ""hut-like"" is intended to be literal. And they fly.  Flying fire.  Pretty simple--even if overly so.  Undead because that's just creepier.

Flaming stones are not as interesting to me as firey explosions from bugs.  Otherwise, hey, ""Bag of Brimstone"" sounds fine.  

Does that clarify?

"tf2trade","t5_2s0s4","Your post has been automatically removed by this bot because your title is incorrect.

**Trading Items.** Your title must appear like this: [H] Item or items you have [W] Item or items wanted

The full details of the trade are not required to be in the title, but if not they must be in the description. However, you must say what you are willing to accept as an offer in your title. For example, ""[H] Sandman [W] Offers"" is inappropriate. However, ""[H] Sandman [W] Offers in Metal/Keys/Promos"" is acceptable as long as a specific price is listed in the trade description.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

**Other types of appropriate titles.** You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts.

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of great community importance.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited).
5. [Contest] - If you are holding a contest to give away free things.
6. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.

**Tag Formatting.** The tag used must start the post title, and some text after the tag is required. Extraneous text within tag brackets will cause the post to be removed. For trade posts, [H] must start the title (come before [W]).

**Scammers.** If you are attempting to report a scammer on our game servers, please review [this post](http://redd.it/mbpbg) and follow the process within it.

If the scammer is not related to our community, please direct your report to [SteamRep](http://forums.steamrep.com/forums/report/). Unfortunately with the ubiquity of scammer accounts, [PSA] posts warning about specific scammers are not permitted here.

**If you have not already, PLEASE review the rules of /r/tf2trade by clicking [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/wiki/rules).**

Important rules to remember are that prices are required for all items (Rule 10), and to limit your posting of trades ([H]/[W] or [Store]) to one trade per 12 hour period regardless of whether any other trade is closed or deleted (Rule 11).

"statistics","t5_2qhfi","No! You have dependent and independent backwards. In my example, Radon is the **dependent** variable. I probably should have addressed this since you started out Part 1 saying

&gt;  a dataset with multiple dependant and independant variables

This is not typical. For any introductory regression, be it LM or GLM or nonlinear or classification, etc., there is **one** ""outcome"" variable that you're interested in modeling/predicting/understanding, and it's referred to as the **dependent** variable. All your other variables, the predictors, the covariates, are your **independent** variables. A model relates is a theory for how the response variable *depends* on the other variables.

&gt;  the county accounts for a lot of variation in the radon readings which is not expected to have any systematic relationship with the between-floor differences.

Yes.

&gt; But the important thing I omitted in my Part 3, is that you can also use the model to make broad statements about the variance in radon levels in variance counties, using measurements from multiple floor levels.

Yes, and you can get posterior estimates for each of the counties, which will not be as extreme as if you had only used fixed effects. And I think in your original Part 3, you also confused independent and dependent variables.

&gt; [From your original Part 4] Practically speaking, it [Generalized Linear Mixed Model] is used to compare how whether any two datasets with a linear relationship are significantly different from each other, and is especially used when the experimenter is aware that some of the variance is unrelated to the covariate of interest.

This sounds very confused. I'm not sure what you mean by ""two datasets"", maybe you mean two variables? ""Some of the variance is unrelated to the covariate of interest"" This reads like your correct interpretation of the radon example.  A little bit, though, it seems like we'd only use the the GLMM if we're interested in a better `floor` estimate, but that's not the case. We'd often prefer the GLMM because we think it fits better it fits better than the GLM, and it provides 

- better estimates of the `floor` effect
- believable estimates of overall `county` variation
- therefore better understanding of the `radon` levels
- post-hoc it offers more believable estimates for individual counties
- and, superior prediction if we wanted to predict a new radon measurement in either an existing county or a new county","1412122301"

"HannibalTV","t5_2vs7z","I always wondered about this! Looking through Lara Jean Chorostecki's [pre-Hannibal IMDb photos](http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3886328064/nm1892299?ref_=nmmd_md_pv) it looks like her hair is naturally curly, but the curls are nowhere near as [tight and consistent](http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3935030016/nm1892299?ref_=nmmd_md_nxt) as they are in Hannibal. At first thought I would guess that it's a perm due to the tightness and consistency, and 'cause it'd be easier for the hair team. But then probably not because perms loosen over time so, depending on the length of the shoot, you'd see a difference which hair and make-up teams don't like, and they're more than used to spending hours creating a look, so curling an actresses hair before every day's filming probably isn't that big a deal. And on [this post](https://www.facebook.com/LaraJeanChorostecki/posts/259592267559370) on her facebook, someone confirms it's curled every day of shooting although I don't know who that guy is and why he'd know.

 We keep waiting for the game to come to us before we take it to the opposition though. If we hammered a team like Cardiff and Birmingham did to us in the first half, I'd hope we could then learn a different skill, in how to kill a game off and sit out a decent 2-0 home win.

"openSUSE","t5_2rgiq","I would try stable first. Keep in mind 13.2 is coming out in about a month, so if you can wait it may be better to install a fresh system as 13.2, especially if you want KDE Plasma 5 right off the bat.

If that doesn't meet your requirements, you can then go to software.opensuse.org and see if there is a Factory or more updated repo for the software you need FOR 13.1/2. You can also check the software version there. Do NOT try to use repos for a different version of opensuse than yours.

If the software is still outdated for your needs, then try out Factory. I do not recommend Tumbleweed because it is being phased out in favor of Factory (which will have slightly more stable packages than the current way of doing things).

I used to run Tumbleweed but it required too much maintenance for me, especially since I use proprietary nvidia drivers. I do not recommend any rolling release for you if you don't want to deal with crap all the time and just want your computer to work. Stable should be great.

&gt; Europe’s borders have been drawn in blood and to change them will draw blood again. One thing that was absolutely central in all agreements with Russia and Europe at the end of the Cold War was that borders would not be changed, no less changed by force.

Just like most religions are quick to shove their views down your throat, atheists are the same. Religion is a sensitive topic. It brings people comfort, it's what they grew up learning, it answers questions to answers too big for them to grasp... Whatever the reason, religion is important to many people.

And, like with vocal religious fanatics, the more vocal atheists tend to be more aggressive when presenting their views. This is not helpful if you're trying to be likeable. 

In general, people don't like their views questions. Aggressively or calmly, logically or emotionally, scientifically or spiritually. People tend to be more content with the views they grew up with, and with the information they know.

I agree. My Bolts are awesome. I love seeing what we're doing this year.  Are we(chargers) better than Seahawks? I honestly don't think so. If we're lined up to go at the Superbowl together and win, then I would consider it. But until then your team is top 2 for sure.

Men, in general, certainly have a more -vicarious- societal role, at least in the US.

At 18 we must be involved with the military draft, women of course do not have to.

Men commit suicide more and live shorter lives than women.

Men are more likely to die in a workplace accident.

Men are more likely to be murdered.

I'm saying you should leave nothing to doubt-

"Cyberpunk","t5_2qi50","You're not far off. .Hack // Sign was created by a host of people involved with other Cyberpunk anime, including [Kazunori Ito](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazunori_It%C5%8D) who wrote the screenplay for Ghost In The Shell (the movie). Of course, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto is the character designer here (who worked for Gainax and did the character design on Evangelion among others).

Yuki Kajiura does the score for .Hack // Sign and it's actually fantastic music. Her album [Fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction_%28Yuki_Kajiura_album%29) is probably her best work. (Her work on Xenosaga is also pretty good, but this is mostly overshadowed by the fact that Yasunori Mitsuda didn't work on the project :|).

If you're interested in .Hack // Sign it's a pretty good anime. It's more focused on the MMO aspect than it is cyberpunk, per se. Anyway, be warned that it is very slow-paced.

Honestly your advice is far better than ""not touching it."" It looks like it has some active rust on it which needs to be taken care of. Even recommending to lightly use lubed up copper or brass wool on it from the start on the tougher places I think would be good advice.

Also, worn out brass bore brushes work well for getting rust out of light pitting than does the wool.

"tifu","t5_2to41","Sadly people have to worry about many things and not just their sex lives.  Though the ideal way would be to get a divorce, there are other problems.  If a man initiates a divorce, there's a long battle for custody ahead.  Do you want that for your kids?  Do you want to have a custody battle with the person you chose to marry? If you're the breadwinner, and she is the caregiver (which seems true in OP's case) the chances of a man getting custody is slim to none unless a man can prove his spouse has some serious issues they are dealing with.  

Is what the OP did a good thing? No.
Can anyone justify cheating because their partner refuses to have sex (man or woman, I don't think we need to differentiate between sexes here)?  Yes, in my opinion.  

Should a woman take responsibility for a man's decision to cheat? Fucking absolutely!  Divorce is not always the best first option.  A person should never have to choose between being with their kids or having sex.  Thats just not right.","1412122343"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Warranties. A business will not sell a product unless it is finacially beneficial to do so. The warranty costs a certain amount of money, and that amount covers the average cost the company pays out for the warranty, plus profit. Companies figure in 'planned obsolescence' in their products (like microwaves, TV's, etc), and use that figure, say 2.5 year average lifespan), and then sell you a warranty for 2 years. 

That is why people come up with conspiracy theories about companies rigging their products to die ([it's true](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) and common knowledge for business majors).

He could hear the needles bounce off metal; it was more than likely that the needles had been deflected, but he didn't turn around. The Arrancar confirmed his assumption with an arrogant taunt.

He heard the footsteps of the Arrancar tap on the dusty ground behind him. *So he figured out where I was,* Zemaiah thought. *The Arrancar isn't as stupid as I thought.*

The last thing Zemaiah wanted was to release this soon. He still had plenty of tricks left up his sleeve. He braced himself, placed both of his palms against the wall behind him, and whispered an incantation as the ground began to shake. *It's the spikes,* he thought. *I have to move soon.*

As soon as he finished incanting, Zemaiah yelled out aloud to startle the Arrancar:

**""Hado 1: Sho!""**

An extremely concentrated Sho shot from Zemaiah's palms, sending the wall careening toward the Arrancar. As soon as the Sho left his palms, he flash-stepped on top of another building to avoid the ominous ground tremble.","1412122352"

In terms of monitor, there is no particular brand that is the best, each offers something worthwhile.  Recognizable brands in no particular order are LG, Asus, Dell, Acer, HP, NEC, BENQ, PHILIPS, EIZO, etc.

Hertz is how many frames per second your monitor can display.  Most 1920 x 1080 p monitors are 60 Hz.  This is a good choice and the absolute minimum you should consider.  Another name for Hertz, or Hz, is refresh rate.  In other words, even if you can run a game at one billion FPS, the monitor will only display 60 FPS if it has a 60 Hz refresh rate.  60 Hz is fine for your use although some competitive FPS players prefer 120 or even 144 Hz for even more ""viewable"" FPS.","1412122356"

I know you *can*, thank you Captain Obvious! The point is it's insecure, so you can't do it securely. It's like saying ""you can store your gold inside your car!"".

&gt; If any powerful actor wants Bitcoin hashing power, it would be much easier to get it. Governments can even just seize mining pools. Impossible with POS.

So instead of addressing the *fact* that 5% of Nxt's hashing power just got stolen, you talk about an hypothetical attack by the governments, lol... And you don't seem to understand the difference: With Bitcoin, at least the attack costs money. With PoS coins you can sell the coins before starting your attack.

&gt; The cap has little to do with the problem in the first place.

The cap will have a strong relation with the hashing power of the network, and therefore its security. This is cryptocurrency 101.","1412122358"

Section 9. [**Anecdotes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper#Anecdotes) of article  [**Grace Hopper**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace%20Hopper): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;Throughout much of her later career, Grace Hopper was much in demand as a speaker at various computer-related events. She was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style, as well as a rich treasury of early war stories. She also received the nickname ""Grandma COBOL"".

&gt;


&gt;* While she was working on a [Mark II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_II) Computer at a US Navy research lab in Dahlgren, Virginia in 1947, her associates discovered a [moth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth) stuck in a [relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay) and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""[debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging)"" the system. Though the term *[bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_bug)* had been in use for many years in engineering   to refer to small glitches and inexplicable problems, Admiral Hopper did bring the term into popularity.  The remains of the moth can be found in the group's log book at the [Smithsonian Institution's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution) [National Museum of American History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_American_History) in [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.) 

&gt;* Grace Hopper is famous for her *nanoseconds* visual aid. People (such as generals and admirals) used to ask her why [satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite) communication took so long. She started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot long (11.80 inches)—the distance that light travels in one [nanosecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosecond). She gave these pieces of wire the [metonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonymy) ""nanoseconds.""  She was careful to tell her audience that the length of her nanoseconds was actually the maximum speed the signals would travel in a vacuum, and that signals would travel more slowly through the actual wires that were her teaching aids. Later she used the same pieces of wire to illustrate why computers had to be small to be fast. At many of her talks and visits, she handed out ""nanoseconds"" to everyone in the audience, contrasting them with a coil of wire nearly a thousand feet long, representing a [microsecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsecond). Later, while giving these lectures while working for DEC, she passed out packets of pepper that she called [picoseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picosecond).

&gt;Jay Elliot described Grace Hopper as appearing to be ""'all Navy', but when you reach inside, you find a 'Pirate' dying to be released"".

Also, any people coming into the countries have be required to log every single location they visit in effected countries (as well as provide a travel itinerary upon entering the country so the government would have a means to double check whether the visitor is truthful or not) as well as any contacts the come across so it can be cross referenced with actual registered Ebola patients.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

I have a feeling the same can be said about the following Battlefield. I assume it will be 2143. (I think after developing Battlefront, 2143 will be an easy transition.) 2142 is more of a Battlefield replacement, but not for everybody.. So a lot of people will find their way back to Battlefield 4. 

After that expect Battlefield Bad Company 3... this is more of a Battlefield replacement, but without 64 man servers and jets... Some people will still prefer the classic Battlefield gameplay.

So I think it will be awhile before we see Battlefield 5... and I think they supported Battlefield 4 this much so it could be more like the long standing Battlefield 2.

Of course I based all of that off of next to nothing. We could see Battlefield 5 at the end of 2015 made by some random EA studio. Idk.","1412122368"

You had the proof in the pocket that it was a shit bike, though. You could have lowballed. Heck, you could have asked for service records and catch him cold handed with his antics! Then...

""Look, this bike has major electronic component issues. It needs to go to the dealership shop to be fixed, and I have to wait for the components. I'm fine with doing that and it looks like you need it off your hands. I'll give you...""

I don't dislike Milo, I think he's a good ally, but I don't get why everyone wants to think he's like Gamergate Jesus or something.  He hurt us (well, we hurt ourselves more) with the hype around Anita's police report and LW's donation shit.  It's good for us to have people who are giving our cause things to keep it moving, but we need to be just as critical of them as we are the journalists on the other side.  Showing off Leigh's racist remarks on Twitter and ignoring Milo's sexist ones makes us hypocrites (and I don't care if you think they were sexist or not, the fact of the matter is he is a public figure at this point and we need to hold him to the same standards we do others).

So we are hating on her because she got in a pissing contest with Milo?  Or she's a concern troll/shill?  I don't get it, many of the things she expressed in this article are very anti-SJW.  So what if she's a feminist, at least she's not trying to censor and poison the rest of the world with her ideology.","1412122371"

I really don't think these people realize how mean they actually sound saying this.  First off why waste time judging what people choose to put on their face?  Who made you queen of everything to decide how others should look and act? Second, why are you assuming we wear makeup for men?  We do it for ourselves, a side effect could be that we look more attractive to everyone which includes men.  Third, if you replace makeup with anything else it sounds ridiculous.  ""How dare you wear a dress.. You think guys like their girl all dressed up?  No they want a natural girl who wears jeans and baggy tshirts all day"".

Makeup enhances your natural features (if done right), it's similar to wearing a nice dress or nice pair of shoes.  I'm sorry I actually want to look good when I go out.. I'm not rocking that baggy tshirt face 24/7.. And why should anyone?  How boring are you that sometimes you don't wanna spice things up even a little.  Variety is the spice of life and makeup allows me to look a variety of different ways based on my mood.. Which is fun :)

Think if it like a large company.  The C-Suites can be a revolving door, but that likely has little to no impact on your day to day duties outside of administrative tweaks or the occasional layoff.  You dont report to the CEO or other executives anyway, and everybody ""Trusts"" the leadership of the guy who's been there 20 years over a new manager anyway.  

I think the solution to this is pretty simple - an Attorney General with the balls to prosecute these people.  Holder, while he did do some good things, in my opinion was far outweighed by the damage he caused through arguing in favor of drone strikes on Americans and spearheading the largest government crackdown on journalists ever.  Unfortunately we dont vote for the Attorney General, either.","1412122378"

”Hvor meget vil du betale for en flaske alkohol - 40 %?” – mener i max eller til daglig? Kan godt finde på at købe en god flaske whisky der holder flere år, men vil ikke betale mere end 100 kr for en slavevodka fra netto.

”Af hvilke årsager drikker du typisk alkohol - 20%?” - tæller vin? Eller er det kun shots?

”Hvor vigtig er kvaliteten af alkohol for dig?” – mange har forskellige holdninger til forskellige typer alkohol, personligt ville min nok ligge på: vodka 1 – øl 2 - vin 4 – whisky 5, hvad skal jeg så svarer på her? Mit gennemsnit rammer 3, men det er da rimeligt misvisende. 

”Betyder flaskens design noget for dig når du handler spiritus?” – til daglig eller generelt? Igen er der forskel på om man køber en god flaske whiskey, eller en slavevodka i netto.

"MTB","t5_2qo3d","at 5'10"", if you are riding that much, you have enough muscle that 30lbs of weight loss is probably not possible (or at least, not a good idea). you probably don't have 30lbs of fat to lose, some of it would have to come from muscle.

so don't shoot for a weight target, shoot for how you look and feel, and maybe a body fat %.

as for how to lose it, check out some of the weight loss subs, like loseit and keto. i'm sure you already know that beer makes you fat, so you're going to want to cut back on that, sadly. i switched to bourbon from beer (i still drink beer, but only when i'm out with friends and don't want to rock the boat) and saw improvement in my waistline, but if i was REALLY serious i would cut all alcohol out (not going to happen)

also, and maybe you already know this as well as this knowledge seems to be reaching critical mass in the last year or so: 

eating dietary fat doesn't make you fat. think about how much fatter america has gotten since the 70's when the low-fat craze started. dietary fat makes you full, so you eat less food in general- when people started cutting out dietary fat, they started eating more because they were constantly hungry.

you know what does make you fat though? alcohol (ethanol) and sugar (fructose/sucrose). your body converts a good portion of the calories you get from sugar (and alcohol) into fat stores in your body, but sugar doesn't make you full. not only does your body start storing more fat, but you keep eating because you are still hungry. this includes things that people think are healthy, like 100% fruit juice - you're still taking in the fructose from like 8 oranges when you drink a glass of juice - not good for you)

i know someone is going to chime in saying ""none of that matters, it's all about calories in vs calories out"". that's (partly) true, but it's MUCH easier to stick to that caloric target when you eat more fat and cut out the sugar, since you will get full more quickly and stay full much longer, so you won't be thinking about eating all the time, inevitably leading you to eat more calories than you wanted to","1412122384"

As for the rankings, I seriously don't care, but it's still interesting seeing how everyone stacks up the clans to each other. People on the accused teams have already confirmed the collusion in private, so knowing we would have won the first (and most important) Battle Royale if clans were playing for themselves alone is enough for me. Also, knowing that our clan is the best in terms of player-to-player skill would be enough already. To the clans saying we don't deserve a top spot because we stopped playing: there is a reason you were below us when we did play. You can say we had no competition, but we could say you didn't have competition either, unless of course you played one of the aforementioned clans by Yoyo and lost, which proves you didn't deserve a higher spot anyways.

All the instruments were nice sounding, perfectly in tune, PAs and mixers and all of that.  I realized that the big clean no-compromise sound is what is so important to me from a cover band when covering the classics.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There is logic and reason in most situations you'll find yourself in.  Studying formally is another matter.

It's not an insult to tell you that you obviously don't formally study philosophy or logic or reason.  You obviously don't.  Why is it obvious?  Because you make poor arguments, and have poor understanding of the things presented to you.  This again, is NOT AN INSULT.  (The other obvious thing is that anyone who's studied these things would instantly retreat from the notion that it's simple to prove non-existence.  I mean seriously, that's Intro to Philosophy stuff.)

Like, you can say to me ""Jon, you don't know very much about rocket science."" (I really don't.)  That's not an insult.  I don't have (much) formal study in astrophysics. Why would I possibly consider that an insult?

Referencing Santa Claus is meant to provide you with an example of a couple of logical fallacies. Anything I say in defense of the existence of Santa Claus is just a pantomime of the argument for the existence of God.  You can make the same argument about anything really.  Like, as in the link I provided you, I could tell you that there is a teapot hovering in space.  You would have no way to definitively prove the teapot's nonexistence.  However, a lack of a proof of non-existence is not a proof of existence.","1412122395"
"wow","t5_2qio8","I did this at 505 iLvl, and I can tell you that people will tell you do to it quick with incinerate and conflag to burst them down, but it's not safe nor reliable given that gear level that you'll kill them as quick as you need.


In order to get through this phase, I turned the pitlord on passive as soon as I interrupt the Cataclysm prior to the phase, and send him behind the pillar to the right of the gate.

I positioned myself near the middle and watched for the first FelHunter.

I immediately banished the first Felhunter. Then, as the second one comes out I put Havoc on it. The Third I would Chaos Bolt. If I got lucky It would kill both the third and 2nd, if not it was easy to kill them with conflag afterwards. Unbanish the 3rd when ready and kill it, then resume the fight like normal. Try to have 3 embers up when going into the phase, using them all on Kan won't do you any good if you can't get past the phases.

Best of Luck.","1412122395"

"golf","t5_2qhcs","For some back story, I love TMaG equipment, product cycles be damned. Currently have in the Catalina 3.0 cart bag a R7 SuperQuad, RBZ 3w, 3h, 2011 TP MCs and a Ghost TM-110. Sorry, but the wedges are relegated to someone else, for the time being. Backup adidas stand bag has a R1 Black, Superfast 2.0 3w 09 Rescue and R7 irons. Own four different pair of adidas cleats. 

Also have an assortment of other clubs - R11s, 07 Burner driver + 3w + 3, 4h, Superfast 2.0 driver and some other pics clubs. I just love TMaG equipment.

As for the balls - I currently have 4dz Penta, 6dz TP5s, 2dz Lethals, 3dz TP Black LDPs and 2dz of the very coveted TP (Preferred, not Proven) Red LDPs. I have many more dozens, but this is the TM collection alone.

I've always thought the TP Red LDPs were the best ball ever made, even better than the ProV1. It was a sad day to see them go and I tried to stock up as best as I could. The two dozen currently in the closet will never get played. I don't know why. Superstition maybe?

The Penta was a revolutionary ball when it came out. I started off with a dozen and thought it was a great ball, just a tad hard. When the TP5 came out, it was even better and was practically what I was looking for in a ball - long, soft and pretty durable. Lethal is almost just as good, maybe a tad firmer for me than I'd like, but not unplayable.

I also tried out the TP3, which was a good ball. Played the original Rocketballz and then the newer Rocketballz yellow. They're both a good ball for when my swing is a little off for the day. I won't completely hook it off the planet. I also received a demo sleeve of the project (a) earlier this season. I love the idea of a softer compression 3 piece ball for the amateur. Alas, I lost them almost as fast as I got them. I recently purchased a sleeve of the Tour Preferred and am looking to putting them into play as I've heard very good things about them.

Honestly, as stated before, the TP Red LDP was probably the best ball TM has ever come out with. If you follow some of the golf forums (GolfWRX), you'll see that it has a cult, stalker like status. Dean Snell knew what he was doing when he came over and developed that ball. Everything he's touched since them has been money.

TM needs to get away from the silly names (even though the technology works!) and stick to it for more than a season. Also, others have mentioned it, slow down the product cycles. Reading around the internet, that seems to be happening.

I'm looking forward to what TM has in the pipeline for 2015!","1412122396"

My question: Did you ever have any ideas for a Xenoblade comic that didn't quite make it? I was always secretly hoping you'd do one.","1412122396"

"photography","t5_2qh2a","Very positive. Probably a case of a camera's parts of the sum adding up to more than the sum of the parts. (Did I get that right?) Lotta pooh-pooers out there, but those great pictures speak for themselves...

I recently sold both my D3s and D600 to get a D810 and am now saving for a macro lens, as I'm not shooting enough to justify two bodies at this point. Nikon's D750 would have been everything I wanted in an FX DSLR except the ""pro"" control scheme. It's an impressive body that I would not have minded to call my [last camera](http://www.dslrbodies.com/newsviews/february-2013-nikon-newsvie/last-camera-syndrome.html) - especially considering my familiarity with the D600 on which it's based.

Curry scores 24 PPG on 61% true shooting, while Westbrook scores 21.8 PPG on 54.5% true shooting. That's a huge gap in terms of scoring. Curry is far more efficient, in spite of scoring at a higher volume. FWIW, Curry only attempted 0.5 more FGA per game than Westbrook last season, and still averaged 2.2 more PPG than him(Westbrook likely would have shot much more, but he only played 30.7 MPG). And they commit the same number of turnovers per game, in spite of Westbrook averaging 1.6 less assists per game than Curry.


Even when comparing scoring close to the basket, which Westbrook is perceived to be one of the best players in the league at, you can see that Curry is better in that regard as well when you compare their shot charts.

* My parents got a new puppy.
* I like one of my new roommates. She's super cool. She's an older, more mature grad student who likes to make delicious cookies and decorates the apartment in a very festive way. 

Negatives -

* While I was sleeping at my best friend's love interest's apartment (she and I were sharing his bed and sleeping off our drinks, he was on the floor), he got into bed with us. I woke up to her (I think) giving him a handjob right next to me under the same covers. They weren't even drunk and I hardly know the dude. 
* One of my roommates is terrible.
* I like my two psych classes, but I'm not great at them.
* I had a job working with older kids that I did not enjoy at all.

Several of my friends actually got a similar citation earlier in the year, so I have a pretty good idea of what to expect.

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","&gt;""The biggest problem I have with the design is that it's effectively useless to do Master quests on a lower level alt. Aside from the free XP/mobs, if I'm leveling an alt I get effectively no usable master points out of it doing a quest for my level 5+ masters. This means leveling Masters is really another ""end-game"" task, which sucks IMO. I love leveling alts, and I just haven't done it as much this league. It feels wasteful.

This is just not true, a lvl 30 mission gives pretty much exactly 50% of the XP that a lvl 60 mission gives! It's a linear increase. Sure a lvl 1-5 mission still sucks, but after lvl 20 or something you can actually do them while progressing and they are quite lucrative compared to their low level.


&gt;The second biggest problem I have is that the scaling is just completely broken. Why are they giving me level 60 maps when I'm level 80+? What is going on here? This is ridiculous. If I'm massively over-leveled for their content, then clearly they should level up faster - or, at the very least, tie their content to higher levels. It bugs me so much to do a level 6 Zana daily knowing I'm getting an 80%+ XP penalty, and getting literally nothing XP-wise from every other master at level 6.

This is also arguable. If masters gave you 75+ maps or well atleast 70+ maps just like that, they would be giving way too much reward (because of loot and Character-XP). A level 75 map in beyond is worth atleast 3 chaos - given that a mastermap is normally way smaller than a normal map it would be like getting a chaos for free from each master every day. Thats kinda like 4 chaos a day for doing nothing. (Just think of all the free mapdrops they would give)


Dont forget that the whole idea behind this master-system is that it is accountwide. It's just not really well designed for the temporary leagues at the moment.

Sorry for the bad feedback on your feedback - don't take it personal, im just trying to explain what I think GGG tried to accomplish here.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","1) Your argument is flawed because you have no idea how many cheaters there are; you assume there are many but that is more likely a reflection of your desire to cheat than the actual conditions. General integrity and the severe consequences of being caught cheating mean most people probably don't. If everyone stole it would be less unethical for me to steal, if everyone fought it would be less unethical for me to fight, but I don't get to assume, without evidence, that the world exists in such a state as to make my bad actions normal or excusable.

2) You claim that even one person cheating justifies everyone else cheating to level the playing field. This is wrong because the greater the number of cheaters, the greater the harm to society. Everyone cheating does not level the playing field, it just makes it random and impossible to tell good candidates. The more people cheat, the less med-school admissions reflect capability to excel in med-school/perform as a doctor. Every additional cheater causes harm in terms of lower quality doctors, and is more likely to take a spot from an honest candidate than from another cheater. 

3) If someone has the grades you do, and found time to engage in extracurriculars and serve the community, frankly they deserve the spot more than you do. Hard to swallow, but they devoted a bigger part of themselves to being a doctor, they proved that it means more to them and that they can organize their time around it. They will probably be a better doctor.

No matter how hard you try there will always be people who are smarter than you. If there's enough of them who also work as hard or harder then you, and they want to do what you do, you won't get in to the top school. That's unfortunate for you, but good for society because the most capable candidates get the best training. If you want to be in that group get smarter or work harder, because almost none of them lied to get there.

4) You say it's not an excuse not to work hard, but obviously it is. Cheating at all is excusing that you didn't work as hard as you could have/as hard as someone else did. If you used the time when you're lying about volunteering activities to do something else productive or interesting, you WOULDN'T NEED TO LIE. Any productive activity looks good on a resume.

In my experience thinking it's ok to cheat generally comes from being unable to accept that people who get into a better school (got that promotion, whatever) deserved it more. Never mind that they have better grades and spent ten extra hours a week as volunteer EMT, I just KNOW that I'll make a better doctor. It's bullshit, everyone feels that way, the people who prove it get the spot. The vast, overwhelming, 99.9% majority of the people who place ahead of you did not get there because of their race, or because they cheated, or because of some other bullshit factor that you couldn't help, they got there because they're a better paper candidate, and if you have intangibles like being emotionally insightful or steady under pressure you didn't engage in activities that allow you to demonstrate it (which means, for all you know, you don't actually have those intangible qualities).

"Multicopter","t5_2u9hy","Have a look around the internet, there are some great forum threads and submissions  on the subreddit, here at least (I cant really speak for the rc forums, I only read them when I need information) there are many people that would be glad to give some clarification, help with a build list or any problems you face during a build. 

Building isn't to complicated (components can be as simple plug and play) once you get the names of the components and what they do under your belt you should be able to connect them all up and have a quad. (I recommend reading the /r/Multicopter Wiki give a very good base understanding of quads, their components and how they work) 

Here is some useful stuff....

* Here is a build list from a couple of days ago it should help you grasp the cost and components of a basic 250 build,
(http://www.reddit.com/r/Multicopter/comments/2hri1d/critique_my_quad/)

* You can also have a look at 250 build logs, there have been some posted up here on the subreddit, and many on forums (this is a little 200 size http://www.reddit.com/r/Multicopter/comments/2hnt2k/build_m200_minion_mini_hquad/) 

* This also might help your understanding (~500 size, components of a bigger quad are basically the same just variations of the same stuff), it seems well written, not to much confusing jargon (http://plankenau.com/blog/post-16/quadcopter)

I also wouldn't go strait to a 250 setup with FPV, work towards the end goal in three steps

1. Buy a Hubsan X4, Syma X1, Blade Nano QX; any small micro quad.  One of theses little quads cost about USD$35 - 60 and are very good to learn on to learn on being very small and robust, learn how to fly on something that costs 40 dollars not 400

1. Build a 250, now you know how to fly you can make something bigger and feel confident that you wont crash and destroy it in 20 seconds, get used to the increased power and flight performance flying line of sight.

1. It wont be long before you get FPV but it is important that you get used to the power of the 250 in step number 2. as it is a big step up from a micro quad and then another step learning how to fly again when moving to FPV, dont try and make the leap from 1 - 3 your just risking your gear.","1412122408"

You need to find the exact time this conversation took place (phone records) and the name.

I get the feeling that the agency is stuck between you and a picky landlord, this may explain the delay in getting your bond back. They probably do not feel comfortable telling the landlord where to go so are hoping that the tribunal will say no and they can then tell the landlord that they tried.

Did you leave the agency a correct forwarding address? They may claim they have sent things to you regarding the matter.

I recommend you contact the tribunal, they can't give you ""advice"" but the staff tend to sympathise more with tenants and can point out things to be careful of and what consequences this could have.","1412122411"

And why was their response (written down and thus deemed a professional representation of how they run their company) so incredibly vitriolic?

Hypothetically, I run a business. My product made someone upset. As a businessperson, am I trained to come back at them with anger, as if this was an attack on me, and not on a product I carry? Or am I trained to apologize and try solve the prospective customer's problem? That's the FIRST thing they teach you in any retail job. And they mention in the email that they've had other complaints about the socks from women. It's not too hard to say ""I'm sorry. I'll look into it."" If it didn't start out offensive, it certainly is now.","1412122412"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Why is this even on /r/sex? Yes sound to me like she might have a depression or is feeling very sad at the least. So not surprisingly sex might not be on the top of the list of things she wants to do when you feel horribly bad for days and days, even with a loved one at her side. 

You can't really help her if this is the case, but you can support her as a boyfriend , be there for her, and assure her (not just saying to her) that the no-sex thing is the least of your problems because what's more important for you is her health and well-being. After that hope that things get better hopefully as she talks with someone to recover. 

Alternatively you can be honest and say that this is too much for you, you didn't sign up for that, and you'd prefer be with an healthy girl with a lot of sex drive , you have needs after all. This is your right and nobody will judge you if you walk away.

But be honest , don't tell her the sex thing isn't a problem if it matters more to you than her wellbeing. Staying with her and making her feel guilty for her inability to perform in her state would make matters worse. She would feel inadequate, not only as your lover but also as a woman. ","1412122413"

PLD and WAR use the same equipment.  Buy one set, level them both, add to set, only other things you need are weapons.  

BLM and SMN use the same equipment, as you know.

WHM and SCH use the same equipment as well.  At level 30 anarchist, just get both jobs going as it's faster to level SCH then SMN but they both use the same base class as their specific level.

MNK, BRD and DRG also all use the same equipment except DRG has some alternate medium armor options at certain levels.  NIN will probably be in this grouping as well for light DoW armor.","1412122419"

Milk, even though it has cholesterol, lowered the pts cholesterol. A plant-based, cholesterol-free alternative did not. Markers of inflammation and oxidative stress decreased when pts increased dairy intake. That's the point. Supplementing a diet with dairy was healthy. ","1412122420"
"pottytraining","t5_2ter6","Good luck! We had a very similar scenario with my daughter. Just didn't care. Nothing really seemed to ""cure"" the problem. For one, we found that she was often constipated. We read that this puts pressure on the bladder and can confuse the muscles down there. Sometimes she would sit on the potty and do nothing, then pee her pants 5 minutes later. Laxatives seemed to help (prunes, kid-e-reg). I would look into that.

Of course there's a psychological component as well. This complicates everything. My daughter just didn't care if she was wet. Sorry to say, she's 6 and still doesn't care. Incidents have slowly gotten more rare over the last few years, but she still has accidents.

It's damn near impossible to deal with this issue every day for YEARS without showing some strong emotions from time to time. I don't think showing frustration, anger and disappointment has helped in our case, but then again neither did anything else so I don't beat myself up about it. Just do what you can and know that some day it will end.

I would then recommend canceling your waivers and finding someone else better to drop for Donnell and reconsider Royal as he's not the WR1 in San Diego and did this same exact thing last year before dropping off hard.","1412122424"

You can do that but adding a `&gt;` mark in front of it.

    &gt;I AM TIRED OF THIS FOOLISHNESS!!!! I have lived in the U.S. for almost three years and never have I once been discriminated
     against, never had I felt oppressed or been treated unfairly because of my skin colour. I....

c) she's wrong on like 8 kinds of levels. 

If she hasn't experienced it shes lucky and I'm happy for her. But recognize. This is the same thing the black community asks from the white community. Recognize that your experience is different from ours based on how you look.

Quoted for fails

&gt;If you go out there looking for it you will find it

that's not the way it work. What's she says here is true but even saying it assumes that this is what a lot of black people are doing.. and they aren't. We always look at Trayvon for this. The kid did literally EVERYTHING right. He fought only when he had to. There was no policeman identifying himself as such for him to submit to. Just a dude who was being creepy following him.

&gt;Umm NOOO I don't see colour

stop lying. it's offensive. to suggest myself and my ex and I are the same color just doesn't make sense. She's a white girl, I'm a black dude we look dissimilar. To suggest otherwise is to suggest either I'm an idiot or admit you are one

&gt;I don't see my skin pigmentation as a disadvantage nor as it ever held me back

This from the same girl who sentences before admits that people thinks she looks white. No one suggests that her skin is holding her back. We're proposing that in her life her skin color has helped her forward. 

&gt;not every ""white person"" is a racist and out to get you

it's been years since I've heard a black person sincerely suggest that. At most I've heard people suggest that MANY white people are racists and out to get you and a lot more are racist and not directly out to get you

&gt;NOT EVERY THING IS ABOUT RACE

again a perfectly logical argument but at the same time.. somethings are about race. The statistics prove this. There's no reason for the inequal enforcement of laws if not race.

Personally, I like the text of your profile, but I'm also a wordy type. See if you can edit it down 25% without losing any substance. ...I also find the favorites section easier to read with FORMATTING. Italicize book titles! Bold section titles! But that's probably just me.

General consensus is that you shouldn't put negatives in your ""message me if""; some might be alienated by the perceived snobbiness, and your real targets probably aren't reading that far anyway.

""Straight girls only""? We're a high match, which means you're (probably) going to get a lot of high matches who are put off by this. Similarly, consider widening your age range on the upper end; -5/+2 smacks to me of immaturity, no matter what the age of the person in question.

I would also recommend filling in ""relationship type.""

Last but not least, if you put ""a lot of thought"" into your first messages, you might be creating too-high expectations out the gate. Try sending shorter, lighthearted (but still sincere) messages for a while. Don't get attached to profiles.

"IOPsychology","t5_2sl29","&gt; For example, Kronos Inc. has opposed the EEOC's efforts in a civil lawsuit to force the test provider to hand over internal validity studies and other documents related to its assessments.

This is going to be such a tricky legal area in coming years. On the one hand, it's not really open, ethical, science if your methods can't be observed by other parties. This is a serious issue and it needs to be proven that these tests don't discriminate. On the other hand, this company has put so much effort in developing this algorithm that can reliability get the results it's client's want. However I don't think companies like this will be able to keep this kind of thing strictly proprietary. This isn't like real estate occupant satisfaction metrics, we need to know if the formula's are discriminatory. 

Personally, I'm not sure I like the idea of pre-screening personality tests at all at our current paradigm. These tests aren't being developed in the academic community where they are open for ethical and academic review. To top it all off, let's say these tests are dead on accurate and not discriminatory. They still cater to people who know how to lie on them.

I started sweating but I thought its only 15 minutes. Stopping would have taken 5 to 7 minutes so I decided that I would make it. Its happened before but nowhere near this bad. I made it last time so I figured I could again.  

I arrive home and decided to leave school stuff in car and run inside. As I stepped out the car it unleashed in a furious manner. There was no stopping it.

 As it was happening I was still quickly, well as quick as possible while your bowels are exploding, to the front door. As I reached the front door it stopped. It all managed to be contained within my shorts. 

When I got inside I jumped right into the shower and stripped naked. Afterward I got a bag and threw the clothes away.

Also "" 10. Must a bicyclist ride on the sidewalk? Is it legal? What about crosswalks?

The MVC does not require bicyclists to ride on the sidewalk and we do not recommend it because of safety hazards to the bicyclist and other sidewalk users. However, Section 257.660c of the MVC states:
(1) ""An individual operating a bicycle upon a sidewalk or a pedestrian crosswalk shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and shall give an audible signal before overtaking and passing a pedestrian.""
(2) ""An individual shall not operate a bicycle upon a sidewalk or a pedestrian crosswalk if that operation is prohibited by an official traffic control device.
(3) ""An individual lawfully operating a bicycle upon a sidewalk or a pedestrian crosswalk has all of the rights and responsibilities applicable to a pedestrian using that sidewalk or crosswalk.""""

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; Herbal supplements aren't allowed to claim effectiveness, so that's a moot point. 

* Manufacturers don't have to seek FDA approval before putting dietary supplements on the market. In addition, companies can claim that products address a nutrient deficiency, support health or are linked to body functions — if they have supporting research and they include a disclaimer that the FDA hasn't evaluated the claim.

So in other words, if they do the research *that you agreed they would have done, if not for it being unprofitable due to FDA approval*, they wouldn't need to even *bother* with FDA approval, on the condition that they market the drugs as dietary supplements.

I am not enough of a glock fan to have specific recomendations, but the cost of JHP is high enough that if the glock is not used for home defense you can probably skip buying this, and until you put a lot of rounds through the glock and are comfortable with it I would not buy or shoot JHP.","1412122440"

Bitf has always been something to look forward in tuesdays and fridays for me , and it's sad to see it end , but all good things must come to an end i guess.

There is really a charm of the how the strips never felt to me like they try to hard to be funny , or rely too much on current events , which is pretty darn good for webcomic!

"Magicdeckbuilding","t5_2sv87","First of all, unless this is a budget deck (which I assume it is), I see no reason to not run [[Thoughtseize]].  Even then, having one or two [[Erebos, God of the Dead]] in the main deck could be very helpful.

I would put [[Nykthos]], [[Urborg]], and [[Lilianna Vess]] into the deck, as the Urborg turns the Nykthos into a swamp, and the devotion could help with an [[Empty the Pits]].  The Lilianna would allow you to tutor for a card in your deck, primarily [[Waste Not]].  Even if you have one Waste Not on the Field, the second one does stack, as it is not a Legendary Enchantment.

I would remove the [[Agent of Erebos]], as you do not have enough spells to trigger heroic to make it worth it.  Nor do you have enough enchantments to make [[Thoughtrender Lamia]] worth the card slots.

The way you have this deck now, you could go in the direction of enchantment power with your Thoughtrender, Master of the Feast, and add in [[Brain Maggot]], [[Doomwake Giant]], and then a [[Gray Merchant of Asphodel]] as a finisher.

The biggest concern I have however, is the fact that you have absolutely no CMC 1 cards.  With Khans officially released, using [[Despise]] could greatly help your build, if it goes in the direction of 8Rack.  But even having a CMC 1 body to soak up some damage would be well worth it.  I recommend [[Disowned Ancestor]] and [[Pharika's Chosen]] as the former can stop some aggro in it's tracks, while the latter deters larger threats.","1412122442"

I also have great insurance that covers absolutely anything (hence the ridiculous premium). Nice peace of mind though.","1412122443"

It shows the NL first basemen this year with 400 plate appearances or more.  The far number to the right is Wins Above Replacement and Reynolds and LaRoche are exactly the same.

I'm no fan of Reynolds, but you could bring him back for about $5 million probably, but LaRoche who will give you exactly the same production will cost at least $10 million.","1412122443"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I think it's possible to make entire statements that are meaningless; it's not just the length of the word that matters in that sense.

I think it's fair to say that a: 5 syllables isn't a magic cut off point where words become meaningless - so your 5 syllable rule is a bit pointless. In fact, one might argue that it's at that point where you start using technical jargon where you *need* to use the correct word and b: you're not really unique in thinking that using *overly verbose* or unclear language is needlessly complex.

To the extent it's kind of trite to even say it.

Lastly, I'm baffled by your last comment. Is there something wrong with being stupid? I don't know how you're defining stupid - but it's preferable not to be stupid.

Is someone who's brain is functioning at less of a capacity than someone else's inferior? of course. If that's your only way of measuring.

Is someone who is a faster runner superior to someone who is slower? yes.

Not that I think anyone should be branded and sent off to a concentration camp because of it.

But it's clearly possible to look at a quality and say ""this is better than that"".

Or are you suggesting that stupid people have some intangible quality that more intelligent people don't have, and are therefore somehow superior?","1412122444"

That aside, you assumedly *know* what the maximal lyapunov exponent is, this seemingly being almost the most trivial problem possible, at least by your commentary, in which case pretending like you don't is flaunting.  Again, it's so close to zero as to be completely unmeasurable and uninteresting.  And in the case that you don't know, obviously very few people here know what that is; ask about convergence conditions as to contribute to this community.

"news","t5_2qh3l","I have thought about this since I read that line.  This is a big miss on whoever saw this guy... My guess is this occurred because of one or any combination of the below numbered reasons--
1:  poor history taken by physician and/or given by patient;  seems insane but don't discount this.  A rushed physician may not ask the 20th fever he has seen if they traveled in west Africa and a patient may not offer any info not specifically asked for.  
2:  physician didn't think guy looked sick enough and blew him off;  Whenever ailments hit the news ERs see a lot of folks thinking they have those ailments.  After I saw some article about ""dry drowning"" on Facebook this summer I had about 10 kids over the next month who had parents convinced their child, who looked 100% fine, was dying.  
3: physician in ER actually consulted infectious disease or the hospitalist (general admitting physician) and they were unimpressed.  I don't see an ID guy down playing this though
4: small ER with little consulting ability with a lazy physician who just figured no way...  This can't be ebola.

My guess is the guy was afebrile in the ER and his lab work was normal.  I just can't imagine seeing a patient with that story and not just airing on the side of ridiculous caution.  It will be interesting if we hear his/her story about his decision making.","1412122450"

It begins to look like he's essentially chronicling gossip—not so much reporting that Jesus actually existed as opposed to reporting what the Christians believe.

If there were all sorts of other clear evidence for historical Jesus, I'd be perfectly willing to add this to the evidentiary pile for whatever it may be worth. But standing alone, it's not exactly compelling.","1412122450"

I'm sure it probably gets annoying hearing about his time in Weezer when people talk to him, and he should be proud of what he's doing after Weezer, as The Rentals do have some great music, but talking shit about something you used to be a part of is usually never a good way to gain people's respect. Some recent interviews with Matt just exude the attitude of ""leave me the fuck alone, The Rentals are better than what I did in Weezer and I don't care about Weezer."" I think EWBAITE is far better than Matt's more recent output, but it's not a contest anyway.

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","O dear I am in college now so I lack the time for 8000 character responses so here have a shorter one

First of I can see where Voris finds an issues it seems a son of St Dominic has lost his way with his admittedly vague statements about homosexuality. 

To me it seems Father Radcliffe has made an effort to show that all love between two people is good and holy even if it is romantic love between two people however his teaching  lacks the clearly defined line given in the Cathecism [CCC 2357] which states the act is immoral while they use that terrible phrase intrinsically disordered. No one can deny that homosexual love is sacrificing however those sexual acts are against the natural order of the world. 

In regards to Voris for the love of God Voris do not call him a sodomy priest that is not what he is about and frankly that is not what gay marriage is about either. Voris thinks about gay sex more than most gay people I know. 

Second I see nothing wrong with his quote at the LA conference we should be open to seeing gay people in society and not treat them like leapers who everything they touched is somehow morally harmful. 

Third Please stop with the Alex Jones level catholic conspiracies how are anything he list related to Cardinal Dolan, Kasper ,the synod or anything else.

Four Bureaucracies have often blown off attempts at accountability especially when you start making them into the enemy

Five and most important the sexual abuse crisis in the Church is not about homosexuality it is about Pedophilia or Endeophila  which are not related to homosexuality at all it is not a homosexual priest scandal go read some books 

Six What is wrong with celibate homosexual men in the priesthood the reasons I found are completely unsatisfying 

Seven as to the current administrator of the Dioceses if it is true he destoryed evidence then he should be in prison and out of the priesthood not running a dioceses ad interim 

Eight How any of this troubling facts relates to Father Radcliff I do not know Voris stop trying to connect the rape of children to the doctrinal irregularities of a Dominican Priest 

Nine six minutes in and Voris finally comes around to the first clearly defined doctrinal issue as I said before Father Radcliffe appears lacks the boundary the catechism gives Civil unions are not acceptable because they give the appearance of an immoral sexual relationship that mirrors marriage as to why a son of the Order of Preachers fails to see this I do not know 

As to what should be done clearly Father Radcliffe should be warned about the thin ice he has stepped on I forget what that's actually called but if I remember correctly Pope Paul VI almost got one in his pre papal years 

EDIT cited wrong paragraph 

TLDR Voris still wrong ","1412122452"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Yemen has been attacked by terrorists (two different groups) for 2 decades. Those terrorists would be a lot less democratic than the current Yemeni government. You're not making any sense. There really is no democratic movement there.

Sisi took power from an Islamist dictatorship. The Democratic movement was overthrown by democratic voting for a dictator who immediately instituted dictatorial powers. It was all a ploy. The religious followers voted for their leader so that they could finally have a religious dictator.

Sisi removed him and runs the country a lot better than Morsi.

The US did a lot to help the Iranian protesters. You're full of shit. The only way news was traveling out of Iran about the protests was with the help of the VOA (US agency). The US was at the forefront of helping that democratic movement. It's pathetic how you twist that and undermine that. 

Don't take offense but do you get your news from RussiaToday? Really I mean no offense, I'm just curious.

&gt;They did support the protesters in Ukraine, Hong Kong and other places though.

AND Egypt, AND Tunisia, AND Libya, AND Iraq, AND Afghanistan, AND Syria. 

Egypt worked a little bit until Morsi declared his dictatorship. Then Sisi took over. There's nothing more to do.

Afghanistan is a successful democracy. People are voting.

Iraq was a democracy, but due to mismanagement by Maliki, the country has split and ISIS took advantage--once again the US is fighting against both Assad (a dictator) and ISIS (terrorist dictators) in support of moderate rebels (democratic movement).

Why are you ignoring all of this?

The US loves democracy and always supports it when such a choice is viable. The problem is that democracy fails a lot too.","1412122452"

One of my neighbors had planted 4 cedars on his farm.

The cedars have been there since the server went up, and he keeps up with his taxes on his unfinished properties, so I'm assuming he has either forgotten about them or decided to wait for them to thunderstruck.

As RNG would have it, one of them became thunderstruck three days ago. When I logged in yesterday, I fully expected it to have been harvested, but there it still was, the lone thunderstruck amongst the cedars.

And whats more, it had a countdown timer of 8 hrs and some on it!

I did not know that thunderstruck trees could disappear, but thats what happened to this one. I logged in at the time it was due to expire, and it just disappeared. I could literally do nothing but sigh in regret as it was on his protected 8x8. What a waste!

It seems like it is trying to fit into the movieverse, but even then it is a loose fit. In the game celebrimbor has almost no memory of who he is and becomes bound to the main character not by choice, but by some kind of ritualistic sacrifice performed on the main character and his family by one of saurons servants. Also,  there are a lot of areas of mordor that are depicted as lush green areas, and not just barren wastelands. Again, im not saying the game is accurate to the lore, just giving my two cents. The game is fun, and the orcs are well done IMO.","1412122460"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","&gt; big ass carts and ignorant people you'll find in walmart

The carts we could deal with, that's just an issue of space and design. The real issue is culture and perception. 

Culturally, Americans don't like being told which line to go to next, even if it saves time. People want to feel as if they have choice, even when it's less efficient and adds to their overall frustration. 

The second part, perception, is even harder to deal with. The further away from the lanes you are, the longer it feels like you're waiting. This is because you perceive yourself as doing something when choosing a lane to wait in or mentally preparing to unload all your items onto the belt. Even though these activity's don't shorten your time any, they distract you, giving a false impression of a shortened wait.  
","1412122464"
"DotA2","t5_2s580","Hmm. Are you in the MMR range where duo lanes are extremely prevalent? In that case, you really need to opt for strong duo lane safelanes, and crush the lane and secure farm. Viper, razor, weaver, etc. Don't pick PA, go safelane, and expect to get farm because **you're safelane**. Being safelane has little to do with getting farm. Having a secure safelane does.

Once mid game rolls around, there's tons of space on the map usually. In fact, whenever I'm in a lower MMR game I always see 4 of my team posturing around while 5 of their team postures around. This is something you need to stop yourself from doing. Just because your team is standing around, you do NOT need to go stand around with them. Part of becoming better is recognizing the mistakes people do, at every level. This is a mistake, repeated by the whole group, which makes it seem ""standard"". It is standard at that level, and is very very bad.

If that doesn't happen, and lanes are pretty static, then again you need to focus on winning the lane. I get it, I know the trap people fall into, thinking there's literally no lane for them to go to (because, in fact, there isn't). And in this case, you need to guarantee you win your lane. As you progress in MMR, you will reach more and more scenarios where teams actually do run an offlane that is not expected to win, because putting your chips into an offlane that needs to win will result in a loss more often than not.

And again, last hits win lanes. More often than not, a lane can be won simply because you last hit correctly and got your power treads at 4 minutes instead of 7 minutes.","1412122464"

The truth is, he still hasn't done ANY these ""out"" things, he's not going to do these things, and being a mama's boy (and I'm sorry, that's just gross - relationship wise... LOL) he's never going to put one foot in front of the other and actually MOVE.  He spends so much fucking time talking about progress, he doesn't have time to actually progress.  We all know people like that... big talkers who explain more than they do.

Yeah... they're liars and unnecessary.

In an irrational behavior course I took, it was taught that, in our minds, we are all model people in the future.  In the future we loose weight, we save money, we change our dating habits.  In the future we are debt free and living comfortably.  But as the time moves forward, we fall into our comfortable behavior.  We stay in place.  

So I bring this up because having a plan of attack like yours is great.  Your mom's tears are your mom's problem... your movement is your problem.  Keep in mind that unless you progress past the point of simple reddit postings, you're no better than the Jehovah's Witnesses who sit around talking about how wonderful things will be in the New System so they don't have to lift a finger now.  

I actually like your plan of attack on the situation (rather - I like the way you wrote it out).  Support groups are everything, so join.  But (in my reference to the fucking coward above) if you find yourself in year FIVE and still not accomplishing anything... know that there's a problem.  

Just stop and reevaluate.  I'm sure you'll get back on track in no time.

It's obviously not as feature-complete as a professional one, and it uses the old soundfont (sfz) format which means that you'll need to find a plugin that handles it.

The cheapest purchasing option that I know of is Garritan Personal Orchestra. It doesn't cost as much, and as a bonus the Aria Player (which comes with it) can handle .sfz files so you can also use the Sonatina library I mentioned above. Personally I don't care for GPO and I never really used it, I actually thought Sonatina sounded better. But your mileage may vary.

For the ultimate package deal, purchase Finale and you'll get the GPO and Aria Player with it. Then you get Finale for notation, two orchestras, and a plugin.

Thematic things

Would you rather go more into the hacky support side, Or the brawly side?

You are unbalanced in an extreme fashion. For example if you are punching with your cyber arm you roll 10 dice as opposed to other hand 7. I would also make a case that you don't get the titanium bone lacing on your cyber arm for damage boost(no bones). 

With 1 edge die, I would recommend not coming anywhere close to bad luck. As it has a chance of making the situation where you need to edge something even worse than it already was.

Quentin is a sunk cost at this point - I almost want them to buy him out, or just keep him on the DL (whether he's healthy or not). Venable is an expensive bench guy they need to trade.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Edit: Bug supposedly fixed now. So... for future reference I guess.

Just tested, Dota 2 works almost better in [Wine](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=24458) on Mac at least. I say almost as in it doesn't crash on Eblade but has many other weird graphical glitches like hero portraits being rendered in the middle of the screen if you have them on (can of course be turned off). At least it's not crashing. Make sure to play against some bots and fiddle with the settings for a while to make sure it's not too bad.

If you wanna give it a shot, there's [Wineskin](http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php) on Mac (do note you have to turn on the Alt key in the options. X11 legacy thing I think) and [PlayOnLinux](http://www.playonlinux.com/en/) or just vanilla Wine on Linux.

To engage my unhelpful saltiness, my impression is that running Source engine games in Wine isn't terribly different from normal. A lot of the engine stuff could be considered native, but at least the shaders for individual games are not. Even as late as Steam Dev Days, they've been showcasing how they've been compiling [Direct3D shaders to OpenGL shading language](http://media.steampowered.com/apps/steamdevdays/slides/movingtoopengl.pdf) (page 13 and 19. I know it says they want to move OpenGL-only, but...). They claim it has little impact, and that seems to be mostly true on working patches, but patches like this one tell me the translation isn't quite equivalent, potentially that OpenGL is holding their DirectX efforts back with the spec required to maintain the translation (maybe they tried something new with their shader effects this patch and it didn't translate). If they're promoting SteamOS (which in some ways it already seems like they've dropped like the Mac version), it strikes me as weird that even the Source 2/Dota 2 Workshop tools show signs of continuing to be Windows-first. Don't get me wrong, that makes business sense, it's just a mixed message on the Linux front, which granted Valve is prone to do given their structure.","1412122468"

Well, basically, your odds aren't good, at all. Adding that to my experience as a PCV, I'd recommend to stay in touch but agree to consider each other free. 

My advice is biased that I was an African PCV years ago. MY god, I'm old! But I don't think that is so important. You will be away from your lived one in an environment your SO cannot even imagine, in many cases. You will be in that environment with peers who are likely around your age group, going through similar experiences. Some of these people may be hot. It's a fact. They get what you're going through. You see where I'm headed.

Even if they don't meet above characteristics, undergoing an experience in a new place, new language, learning new skills, it's hard to keep an SO involved up to the degree necessary. I know the situation is different now with smart phones and such, but the fundamental lack of shared experience is a big, big deal.

Your choice. Shared experience is key. Some people beat the odds. It's up to you.","1412122469"

First off, if you're renting, it's a hustle to find a place quickly, but if you're proactive and hustle, it can be done. Secondly, it's not as expensive as you might think. I will occasionally price HOU/ATX apartments and there's not a ton of difference...but the big difference is space. Once you get over that, you'll find that you can get a great place with easy access for a good price. But rents are going up, which is nothing new to you.

The tech market here is booming. I started out as an SEO and I'm now a data scientist/BI guy, and moving my way up has been no issue. If you've got a drive, you'll do well here. 

All apologies if I haven't answered much, I'm on the bus riding from work to home. Mass transit here is great, just as good if not better than Cap Metro. Seattleites will complain about it, and yeah, it could definitely be better, but I rarely drive these days. Ask me anything if you see this!

EDIT: Seattle is very different from Austin. I left Austin because it was too laid back and there's a mentality of ""young retirement"".

"DigitalPainting","t5_2sy7d","so i'm gonna be real honest here and drop some opinions. 

to me, there are two things going on here: moses parting the sea and the frightened couple. them two are the important narrative elements.

moses is back there and his back is turned to us, we can't see his expression, he's not that important of a character (in this painting, i hear he's a leading character in the old testament. not so much in the sequel, though. anyway.). it's not so much about the character as it is about his actions, him parting the sea. and we see that clearly, no problem. 

but this painting is less about him parting the sea and much more about the reaction, the woman's face. that's where the emotion lies, that's the heart of the painting. if we compare her reaction to the other guys in the scene, maybe she turns to her husband and goes ""holy moses, are you seeing this?!"" or ""get me outta here, i think i'm on schrooms!"" or ""this is the scariest shit i've ever seen, i'm so scared"". regardless of what emotion she is expressing, her expression IS the most important part of the painting. if this was a film, this would be a reaction shot, which is much more essential than the action shot. (to anyone wondering what i mean, imagine a scene where a soldier speaking at his friend's funeral. him speaking, then cut to the camera panning over the people in attendance and the friend's small child, wiping away a tear. that's the heart of the scene, that's when it hits you right in the feels, that reaction shot. without that reaction, the scene would have been nothing. and i know this shit, i've got an imdb page!)

so my problem with this is that you don't show her face! her face is in shadow! i can make out an expression if i look at it full screen, but it's like i want to connect with her but i can barely see her! there's more detail in the shimmering crests of the waves than in her face! if we look at the evolution of her face she goes from clearly defined, easily readable to darker and darker and then red and then darker and darker and darker... and that's a real shame to me, because i want to connect, i want to see her reaction. even the wave seem to want to guide my eyes to her. it feels to me like you are burying the lead, like (in my opinion) the heart of the painting got a little lost on the way. or maybe you shifted your focus to moses at the end. i like the red composition, the arc of the wave draws us to her face, we follow her gaze to the man who is looking at moses, and then we look at moses) but i have to say i like the blue better in terms of colours. 

so, those are my thoughts and opinions. we already know you're a good painter, i don't have to tell you that. ","1412122475"

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","To offer up another one: It depends on the assumptions implied by *why you're asking* whether it's the same ship. There's a whole raft of different things that we attach to an identity and maybe only some of them have remained the same, but we can describe those differences and similarities factually if we temporarily set aside the question of ""Are they the same"".

So you can put together a list of potentially-relevant facts that aren't ambiguous about Ship^A and Ship^B - are they made of the same actual material components, are they made to the same design, are they used for the same job, are they owned by the same person, are they called by the same name... and so on. When you're done making that list you will have enumerated all the things that *matter* and still have ""But is it the *same* ship"" left over as a, now somewhat empty, question that really consists of picking the aspect that matters.

Obviously it gets trickier when we have really good reasons to want to know whether two things are the same. When those things are people for example. But the same principle somewhat applies - if you find yourself in one of the edge cases common to thought experiments you need to decide which types of continuity are relevant to your situation and ask about those, rather than the compound concept of sameness.","1412122477"

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","The trick is to NOT coddle them, and wait until they exhaust themselves. Mom and Dad stopped stalking me and calling after about two weeks, because they realized that they should probably be working, not stalking their daughter, and that even if they called a million times, I'd return the call when I had time, and give them exactly zero detail about what I'd been doing, who I'd been with, or where I'd been, when they had originally called.

Also, I was super careful for the first month after I moved out-- my boyfriend didn't visit me at all in the evening. We went out for dinner or a movie, or I visited him. When they called after driving by, I ignored it. They eventually gave up.

In the case of pounding on my door, I didn't have a choice in response. Ignoring her meant not getting a ride, and I didn't want to spend an extra $50 on gas and deal with my mom telling extended family how financially irresponsible I was, just to prove a point.

If I could be LC, I would be, but we attend the same church, my dad is President of the Board of Directors at my job, and I only moved 20 minutes from them, so instead, I've tried super hard to institute some reasonable boundaries that I stick to like glue. Ignoring her causes escalation in the form of increased control of my SG brother, but he only has a few more months before he'll be moving out, too. It still feels really selfish, but we have a close relationship, and he's good at staying away from home, so I don't worry about him too much.

I coddled her while I lived at home, because I didn't have a choice. Now that I don't, when she goes overboard, she gets a lecture. nMom is pretty spineless, so it's easier to stand up to her. It's just emotional manipulation, and I spent the two years before I moved out training myself to recognize manipulation before consciously acceding, so that the second I became independent, I could stand my ground. It doesn't mean I don't have weak days, or that I was able to prevent the appearance of some FLEAS, but I think I've made fairly quick progress.

eDad is more difficult, because he's good at follow through, and isn't afraid to hit where it hurts.

For example: nMom wanted me to house sit for them while they went out of town. I said I would-- provided they pay me the same rate I've made house sitting for others. She said she'd discuss it with Dad and get back to me.

Dad texted me and threatened to stop letting me use their car if I didn't house/pet sit for free, knowing that is literally the ONLY thing I for which I depend on them. Though it wouldn't kill me to not have a car, because public transportation to and from my full time job is definitely available, and I could walk if all came to nothing, my part time job is a no-go without a car, and I'd have to back out of all other commitments during the week. For an extrovert on many local (work related) committees, it wouldn't be good.

When I lived at home and was going to school, Dad would ground me from my laptop for days on end, forcing me to attempt writing research papers on my iPhone until I could get to school and use a computer there. He was fond of the phrase, ""I hand wrote papers in school all the time! You don't NEED your computer. You're just addicted to it!""

No Dad, actually, my professors require I type up all papers. Turning in a hand written paper will get you a zero. eDad enforces nMom's complaints, and has plenty of FLEAS from her, so he's the one I still sometimes have to coddle. But! I'm buying a car in the next month. And then they both have NOTHING!","1412122479"

It was because she felt truly humiliated. A situation like that back in the day would have literally been my worst nightmare. I can only imagine how she took it. I don't think you were wrong in any way but instead of asking your girlfriend how you should respond, if I were in her shoes I would've been very grateful and felt a slight bit triumph if you without hesitation rolled down your window and told them that they're all thirsty whores and to go suck a dick or something. You don't have to get physical at all. An introvert in no way would be able to ""order"" you to insult them back. But they would feel satisfaction if their boyfriend reacted in a way like it was him that just got insulted. It shows how much you care because their insults directed towards her stirred up something inside of you. But that's just me.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","""I do feel a large part of the physical is to do with proving something to myself.... the achievement for me was nothing whatsoever to do with physicality.""

Can you see how those two statements contradict each other though? I totally appreciate what you're saying, but I've found much the same kind of sentiment from people who've completed similar 'undertakings'. That is, the endeavour is alleged to be a 'personal achievement' (spiritual, character-building, etc), and the physical accomplishment is downplayed as merely being a by-product of it. However, the essence of the endeavour IS physical, as you illustrated by saying you were ""proving something to yourself"", so a sceptic could argue that the 'character-building' is only an immaterial interpretation of the undertaker (no offence intended.... just being hypothetical).

I do agree with your point about your initiative being the highlight though - I think that's something that more people could have in their lives (including me).

Regarding your last point, people used to ride horses across countries just to get where they were going. People didn't right bicycles for trips like that because of the luggage restrictions, but people used to go to some pretty extreme measures just to travel. My point is that this trend will eventually reach some pretty incredible scales, such that walking across town might seem 'extreme'. Also, if lots of people have previously done it, does that take away some of the 'craziness'?","1412122495"

Even at the start of the year, most of us had no clue he was going to annex Crimea. We all thought he was an ass before that, but mostly because of his poor record on gay rights. We all know he's crazy, but what we don't know is what his next move will be. Will he attack the Baltics like he's done with Ukraine? Will he attack Georgia again like he did six years ago, but take it further? We all know him for taking calculated risks, and many of those risks he's already taken were pretty much unthinkable even weeks before they've happened.

At least with ISIS, we all know there will be bombings and kidnappings that we can prepare for. Ever since 9/11, terrorist threats are taken far more seriously than ever before. The 2004 bombings in Madrid and the 2005 bombings in London only amplified this. ISIS will cause devastation, but at the worst, they would only cause a civil war in Iraq and Syria.

Not saying Putin would ever set of a nuke. I doubt he would anyway. But he does not need to set off a nuke to cause more devastation for Europe compared to ISIS. Just remember, he's the president of the ninth most populus country in the world, which has more landmass than the whole of Europe, even when the European portion of Russia is counted. He controls most of the media, has curtailed freedom of expression and the press, dissmissed and jailed some of his opponents, and has the support of millions of body guards, politicians, celebraties, police officers and soldiers. Some of them are not even Russian.

You make a point though, and ISIS is definitely a cause for concern right now.","1412122500"

So if both the Ghost and Guardian are drained, and the Ghost is on just enough to remain intact you could infuse the ghost with light to revive it.

 [**Subconjunctival hemorrhage**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subconjunctival%20hemorrhage): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;A __subconjunctival hemorrhage__ (or __subconjunctival haemorrhage__) also known as __hyposphagma__, is bleeding underneath the [conjunctiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva). The conjunctiva contains many small, fragile [blood vessels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessels) that are easily ruptured or broken. When this happens, blood leaks into the space between the conjunctiva and [sclera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclera).

&gt;Such a hemorrhage may be caused by a sudden or severe sneeze or cough, or due to [hypertension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension) or as a [side effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect) of [blood thinners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_thinner).  It may also be caused by heavy lifting, [vomiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting), or even rubbing one's eyes too roughly.   In other cases, it may result from being choked or from straining due to [constipation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation). Also, it can result as a minor post-operative complication in eye surgeries such as [LASIK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK).

&gt;Whereas a [bruise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise) typically appears black or blue underneath the [skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin), a subconjunctival hemorrhage initially appears bright-red underneath the transparent conjunctiva. Later, the hemorrhage may spread and become green or yellow, like a bruise. Usually this disappears within 2 weeks.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Sounds like you're talking about the CVT, luckily you can put in a regular old Ion 5-speed-automatic and the car wont care. As long as you change the transmission control module and a mount too. I hear tale of people accomplishing this for less than $500. A used CVT could easily last 2 years, but a used 5 speed auto (although slightly more complicated to change) will outlast the car. If it were me, I'd do the swap and sell it. Make back your money and a little more, and buy a Honda. Looks are nice and everything but you need reliability.

The car is not your biggest problem, obviously. First, you were screwed over by that seller. There's no way he wasn't aware of how bad the problem was, he just wanted to unload it on some sucker. A young couple that actually ponders buying a car with a bad transmission is a perfect opportunity to unload a lemon. I would be all up in the guys face with what the mechanic told you, and demand he take it back, lest you get the police involved (you may or may not actually be able to get the police involved, its just a bluff). If your husband was half a man, he'd be doing that instead of whining at his wife. I personally know someone who got screwed over buying a lemon on craigslist, and after a heated confrontation (and some threats of legal action/small claims court) was able to get their money back.

Second, all the bickering with your hubby has to end. Period. Explain to the idiot that arguing doesn't solve problems. You need to work together and decide on an actual solution.","1412122502"

This sort of thing really ticks me off.  Parents, you don't own your child's body.  You are their caretaker, you hold your child's body in trust for when your child is able to make informed decisions about their own life.

If someday an adult wants to perform body modification, let him or her go for it.  It's their body!  But until they are capable of making that sort of decision it is the parent's *responsibility* to make sure the child's body is healthy and unmodified.

And yes, I feel the same way about people who pierce their baby's ears.","1412122503"

I don't want to get mixed up in faction warfare. It will close off entire quadrants of the galaxy to me. 

In fact, that is one of my biggest frustrations with Eve. Things I do in it are so final and have long-term consequences. I am afraid to PvP because not only will I get killed and lose a fortune that it takes me forever to mine, but also I will lower my security status, and I could end up kicked out of high sec space. 

I intend never to join a corporation. I am in my 50's and I work long unusual hours and cannot commit to a group of people to be present for anything ever. I just log in willy nilly - sometimes 15 mins at a time. I have my own corp that I founded for myself and a family member to avoid taxes. 

I even find my little corp annoying as hell because my family member constantly tries to fleet with me and chat with me when I log in, and I just want to do my own thing and be left alone for the most part. 

So for me, doing faction warfare is a total no-go as is any corporate membership. It would start my one little character down a path my lifestyle cannot support.

"tifu","t5_2to41","The issue isn't getting tired of sex.  If one partner stops wanting to have sex, then that is life.  The issue is what does the person who thought that they had a lifelong sexual relationship supposed to do.  Taking a surprise lifelong vow of celibacy *really* isn't a reasonable option.  Priest make that sort of commitment knowingly and after much deliberation.  People getting married on the other hand generally assume that sexy time is included in the package.  At that point you either open up the marriage, divorce, or cheat.  

Divorce is obviously ideal if there are no kids, but people who don't take that option out of hand generally have kids.  They want to stay together for the kids, and they might very well still love their partner, even without sex.

An open marriage is ideal if the marriage still works besides the sex and especially if there are kids involved.  If you don't want sex, WTF is the point of sexual fidelity?  Sadistic joy in torturing your partner?  Sadly, open relationships are sometimes unacceptable to people in such situations.  One person in the relationship unilaterally declaring that sex is off the table for EVERYONE is pretty messed up, but it happens.  I personally think that a person who declares sex is dead for everyone for the rest of their life unilaterally is a VASTLY more horrible person than a cheater.

Finally, you have cheating.  Frankly, there are times when cheating makes sense.  If the first two options are closed off; cheat.  Spouse is very ill and you don't want to leave them, but still want sex?  Cheat.  You have kids and the spouse won't open up the relationship and you don't want to rip up the kids with a divorce?  Cheat.  

Cheating is often wrong, and you should always try and open up a relationship first and make sure you have really talked it out, but if one party has unilaterally declared that sex is forbidden for everyone from now until you are both dead, they are an asshole.  Surprise lifelong celibacy imposed upon you by a partner is one of the least loving acts I can think of.  Fuck'em.  Cheat.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Why are people so adamantly against treating people with different needs, differently?

How are the needs of your sick any different than the needs of my sick, barring any differences from the style of healthcare? Is paying more for no better service a need of anyone rational? Faced with two choices, especially if they have similar outcomes, doesn't it make sense to go with the cheaper one?

&gt; Your health care is already paid for. There is literally no reason not to accept it and go somewhere else. Ours is not paid for so naturally we go and seek the best price/quality tradeoff that suits us.

Then you know nothing of healthcare especially single-payer. Cost is one variable in many. Is there a wait time you don't want to wait for? Is there a doctor elsewhere that you need/want to see? Do you live close to the border (as most of Canada does) and have a centre that specializes in your specific ailment that is closer by but happens to be on the American side? Seriously, it doesn't take much to think about other possibilities. Yet we don't get to have desires other than cost according to you, and cost is the only desire you claim your people want. Such a simplistic assessment is why you can't see the bigger picture.

&gt;When you're forced to prepay for something, that kinda limits choice now, doesn't it?

You seem to think this is some tyrannical government regime implementing this without the informed consent of its citizens. You are wrong. Years ago Canadians voted Tommy Douglas as the greatest Canadian, specifically because he instituted the first single-payer healthcare system on the continent. We chose this healthcare and have *never* looked back. Are there people that don't like the system? Sure. But we're a democracy and not everyone can have their way, so the vast, vast majority of the public *chose* this. If there were actual desire to change it you would have no problem hearing about it or seeing it happen. There is no support for such a thing. Choice, we always have it.

&gt;Surely we can agree, that doesn't make it the best practice.

Again with this dystopian government libertarian pornography. It's regulated on behalf of the public with the public's best interests in mind, namely a good return on their tax dollar, being fiscally conservative. We regulate plenty of things in a variety of markets and industries. Canadian business is doing great, our doctors make incomes almost or in our top 10%. Those poor, poor doctors, if only for government they could be in the top 1%.

&gt;Well go ahead and make the case for why a politician thousands of miles away knows what's better for someone than they do. I'll listen to the argument...

Well your founders did set the foundation as a republic, so I guess I'd use your Constitution. Is that a good enough source?

"Debate","t5_2qja8","I don't know how much luck has to do with it, but I know that any debater should be able to win a round in front of a ""lay"" judge even without ""luck.""  Think about it this way: if debaters can communicate only with those within the debate community, what good is the activity?  In terms of specifics, be sure you slow down and actually vary your tone.  ""Lay"" judges often judge off more than just the flow, so being persuasive and delivering your speech well can be more important in these rounds (though it is important in any round, to varying degrees).  Analytically, be as clear as possible.  Don't use jargon, and be sure that you are explaining everything--don't let evidence speak for itself, and don't assume that the judge can infer exactly how your evidence leads to your impact or how your evidence ties back to your claim.  These are things you should be doing in any round, but they are especially important in lay rounds.  Also, I put the word ""lay"" in air quotes because I think the term is often used negatively/implies that communication in debate is somehow part of another communicative world--ideally, this shouldn't be as true as it is.","1412122508"

One more thing was there's the R7 260x with 1Gb GDDR5 and 2Gb GDDR5 i was wondering if the 2Gb would be more worth it? Obviously the more VRAM the better but i wasn't sure if it was worth it as such?

"lotr","t5_2rfb9","There are certainly other examples, most notably Fingolfin:

&gt; Now news came to Hithlum that Dorthonion was lost and the sons of Finarfin overthrown, and that the sons of Fëanor were driven from their lands. Then Fingolfin beheld (as it seemed to him) the utter ruin of the Noldor, and the defeat beyond redress of all their houses; and filled with wrath and despair he mounted upon Rochallor his great horse and rode forth alone, and none might restrain him. He passed over Dor-nu-Fauglith like a wind amid the dust, and all that beheld his onset fled in amaze, thinking that Oromë himself was come: for a great madness of rage was upon him, so that his eyes shone like the eyes of the Valar. Thus he came alone to Angband's gates, and he sounded his horn, and smote once more upon the brazen doors, and challenged Morgoth to come forth to single combat. And Morgoth came.

Gandalf also shows something like this in his own encounter with the Nazgul:

&gt; 'I galloped to Weathertop like a gale, and I reached it before sundown on my second day from Bree-and they were there before me. They drew away from me, for they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it while the Sun was in the sky. But they closed round at night, and I was besieged on the hill-top, in the old ring of Amon Sûl. I was hard put to it indeed: such light and flame cannot have been seen on Weathertop since the war-beacons of old.'

As does Aragorn in Moria:

&gt; There was a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows behind the great door posts towering on either side, but the gates were shattered and cast down. Aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in his path, and the rest fled in terror of his wrath. The Company swept past them and took no heed of them. Out of the Gates they ran and sprang down the huge and age-worn steps, the threshold of Moria.

I'd guess strong emotion gives the fëa/spirit more control of one's hröa/body (the Elves' greater control over their hröar is mentioned as one of the reasons for their relative power compared to Men). I doubt it's a physical transformation; given Tolkien's usual style it's probably more of an intangible sense of power and majesty.","1412122515"

"trees","t5_2r9vp","I live in Cali and got my card about 6 months ago. At first it was almost uncomfortable buying legally haha. The whole process of going to a store and giving them a card and then going into essentially a candy shop with (usually) friendly people helping you pick the perfect thing for you felt a little wrong. But I was back home for a while and had no dealers around, so I stuck with it, even if it was a little more expensive.

I love knowing for sure what strain I'm getting. I mean, a lot of dealers give names of strains to whatever they sell, but you really don't know for sure unless you are close to the grower. So that was cool, got to start a little collection of new, exotic strains I'd never even heard of. Shit, I mean there are even local strains that only are grown in certain areas like some sort of microbrewery. 

Price-wise, it really depends. In SoCal,  the ones I went to had a TON of variety: I could buy a dirt cheap 1/8th for $15 or top shelf for around $70. I usually just took advantage of buy one get one offers with their mid-quality stuff so I could get 1/4 for around $40.
 
Up in NorCal however,  there is much less of a selection of dispensaries, partially because of the lower population (I'm talking farther north than San Francisco,  they have amazing dispensaries like SoCal) and also the fact that a lot of people who grow and sell up here don't like their business taken. But I'm not complaining as I can get way WAY cheaper prices up there from my grower friends than anything I could dream of at a dispensary.","1412122518"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; Absence of evidence is evidence of absence wherever the presence of evidence would be evidence of presence. That's an unavoidable consequence of how the math works.

No.
The contrapositive is inherent, the inverse is merely sometimes true.  

Absence of evidence is proof of absence only in cases where presence leads to evidence.

*If* we posit a loving God who directly intervenes on behalf of His children on earth, *then* we can say that a lack of evidence for miracles is proof of a lack of God.  

In the case of an indifferent and lazy God who doesn't give a crap either way, lack of evidence tells us nothing really.

In the case of Jesus, a dude who lived and died during the bronze age, all we can say is that some people talked about him while some didn't.  That's exactly what you'd expect so there's nothing much to argue.  The same things can be said about Socrates, yet I go on assuming he was real as well.

Got to remember that Murray had 90 rushing yards in the first half. Ryan started sending 8 guys to the LoS. Regardless if they were blitzing, the game plan was to win back the LoS by beating the OL. 

That also means we were bringing a lot of pressure onto Romo but no pressure on the receivers. Making it easier to complete passes. 

Also didn't help that the defense was biting super hard on play action. 

There were a few times he looked comfortable, but that was because the game plan only sent in 3 rushers. And they just got manhandled.

But I would agree with Galette that they were in his face. Just that the holes made by White were too easy to exploit.","1412122519"

"DowntonAbbey","t5_2seky","I see it ending with many of the characters moving on in their lives, which in itself will perhaps cause Downton to downsize and run it differently.

Anna &amp; Bates move away and finally start that hotel and a family they were thinking about so long ago. Daisy gets a job doing something else or just decides to leave service and run Mr. Mason's farm because he's gotten too old to do it himself. Branson remarries and decides to go to America. Lady Mary remarries and moves in with husband/haves him move in with her so she can continue on trying to run Downton. A part of me wonders if she'll continue to try to run Downton if she marries again, though, as I feel part of her motivation to keep Downton open is of course for George but also to continue to keep the memory of Matthew alive and to pay homage to him. Edith spends all her time raising Marigold, dedicates her life to that and (hopefully) marries as well. Molesley and Baxter get married, hehe. 

I would love the last scene of Downton to be something familiar yet bearing all the signs of moving on and change. Perhaps they don't hire a ton of new staff after the old ones leave due to no necessity for it as times continue to change. We see Carson, Mrs. Hughes and Mrs. Patmore downstairs getting ready for dinner. We see Lord and Lady Grantham upstairs, perhaps with Cousin Isobel and the Dowager and maybe Edith and Marigold if she has not married. We pan out as they're making chit chat and heading into the dining room, last shot is one of Downton, still the same in all its physical features yet emptier and irreversibly changed in its running.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","The streets were quiet except for the faint clamor of the crowd at the tavern in the city center. Night had come and darkness draped itself across the horizon, the fields changing from a hue of deep gold, orange and purple to black as pitch.
He continued to walk in a rhythm, one step after another with the occasional pause, as if he had remembered something, but continued to walk again just the same. His scabbard brushed lightly against his left leg, and his coin purse jingled against his right. His robe originally a deep sage green was now starting to become tattered from the journey, his cropped black hair was greasy but neat and his dark beard was trimmed. He was faintly aware of the man walking behind him, maybe 5 to 10 meters away.

Up ahead, walking from the tavern was a man, slightly stumbling with a confident, yet goofy smile. He seemed hard pressed to see the foreigner ahead and stopped to stare, his smile wiped from his face. The foreigner stopped as well.
The clapping footsteps from the man's boots behind him stopped, and the foreigner heard the sound of a unsheathed blade from behind.

""By the order of King Nikolas the first, put your belongings on the ground and step away from them slowly.""
The foreigner continued to look in front of him, at the stranger from the tavern, now gaping ahead.
""You know I cannot do that."" The foreigner said in a soft spoken voice, without looking away from the stranger down the street.
The man from behind then let out a cry of fury, running towards the him, but before he was even 2 meters away the foreigner's blade was blood red from the man's throat, the man now on the ground gagging and gargling his own blood. His royal sealed sword still ringing from her fall.

The man from the tavern stood in paralysis, looking at the foreigner's blade. The blood cloaked the shiny fuller, and the grip and pommel seemed to glow and shine, oddly enough, like the sun was shining on it.
The foreigner took out a cloth from his person and wiped his blade clean. He sheathed it silently and paused, then continued to walk to the stranger ahead.
The stranger stumbled towards him until they were a meter apart and gazed at the scabbard for some time, the foreigner looking into the stranger's eyes.

Finally, after some time, the stranger opened his mouth. ""How many has it consumed?"" He asked with hesitation
The foreigner frowned at the question, and answered, ""It will never be satiated, even now I feel it's power. I'm afraid that even I will be consumed in time."" The stranger then seemed at ease.
""Did it guide you to me?""
The Foreigner sighed lightly, and paused to look at the sky. His hand was on the grip, with his thumb rubbing the pommel.
""I believe he guides me, Liukan guides us all. Don't be afraid my friend, your path does not have to end today if you don't want it to. You can save yourself.""
The stranger then gave a puzzled look. The Foreigner continued, ""Accept Liukan's gift and free my life. You will possess the blade and my life will finally end. But he who possesses the blade must continue Liukan's mission."" A smile crept across the Foreigner's face.
The stranger stood frozen in fear, his eyes moving rapidly.
""I accept. "" He replied
The Foreigner's face projected a look of pure ecstacy, and he fell dead. The stranger dared not touch the scabbard just yet, afraid of what he had done. He pulled the Foreigner's corpse to his home only two blocks away to a cluster of trees in his backyard and began to dig.

It was almost dawn before he was finished. He picked up the blade, scabbard and purse and pushed the corpse in with a kick. He stared at the scabbard in hand for awhile, finally tossing it in.
The stranger pulled a rugged old book out from his knapsack, and recited a hymn. Then buried the remnants. He knew he would be cursed for eternity but he also knew the blade's corrupting powers. The town never heard from their priest again.","1412122523"

They don't do any where near enough to sell just how impressive this game is.

But the warning to this is that I LOVE grinding, I've spent 960 hours in pokemon x, so I'm just the kind of person who likes to squeeze every tiny little bit out of a game once I like it XD 

This game has an astonishing amount of content, and I think if I don't burn out, I may actually surpass that 960 hours record in my attempt to master all the lives.

Producer? Absolutely, though what matters more is the experience you get working AS WELL AS the classes you take. The worst worst worst part of learning production has to be when you are first learning Protools and getting it to work how you want it to. There are courses at universities dedicated to learning that and Finale. 

Aside from the amazing ""good ol boy"" points you'll get from knowing your professors, you'll pick up a fantastic amount of practical knowledge in strange places.  Getting to know those professors and working alongside them will be your ticket to a lot of places in your life. A company will call up and ask them, someone with decades of experience and a doctorate, if they know any trustworthy students that could do a job for them. And if you work hard and get to be known and liked by those professors, your name is going to be at the top of the list. 

Also, I'll be honest, I've met with one of the best companies in my area for production. They do 90% of the commercials that air on TV in our area  and very regularly produce CDs of bands that have made it, at least a little bit, big. They throw out applications for the non-gruntwork positions if they don't have that degree.  Their job is simply too fast paced and big to trust in someone that doesn't have that slip of paper that says ""I'm dedicated, I get things done, and I know where to go if I don't have the answer.""  

Look for scholarships. If you are on loans and drop out, you're fucked. For a long long time.  I have never met a single person that dropped out and went back in that thinks they made the right choice that first go around. It's infinitely more difficult to get back in and be successful in class once you're out. Not at all impossible, but it's hard. 


College is not for everybody, but when it comes to music production, your name will be lost in a sea of applications that look just like yours without it.

Why did you dislike Amber so much in the game? It seemed to come out of nowhere. Was it just because she had nominated you?

After her eviction, Caleb calmed down a lot and was able to work his way back in with the guys, especially Cody/Derrick, who were previously wanting him out of the house. She was also targeting the same people you &amp; Nicole were targeting (Zach, etc...).

I used to be strongly in favor of contraception, viewing it as a necessity to reducing poverty. What changed it was seeing the effects contraception had on the people around me, *by which I mean* the effects of the actions that contraception allowed. What was startling to me was that all of those effects were predicted in *Humanae Vitae*. 

I also had to better understand what the Church actually taught. What I discovered was a bit of humility, in that even when I studied things intensely I still wasn't understanding the writings the way they were meant to be. When they were properly explained, it became much more logical to me and suddenly they made sense where previously they seemed to be flawed or contradictory.

That's it in a nutshell. There were a few more (as there are bound to be since I was a convert) but many of those are far more personal, and I'm not really in a place where I feel comfortable discussing them in specifics yet. 

In those matters I struggle because I feel as if I can find happiness by rejecting the Church's teaching. Each time I do, it turns into ashes. I seek the same things, over and over, hoping that each time I will be made happy by them, but only being disappointed. Strangely, this is how I know the Church is right about them. I am happy when I follow the Church, I am miserable when I try to seek what She counsels not to. I am just a stupid, flawed human so I have to keep relearning those lessons.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;if you know the history of Viet Nam you would know that the country was only unified when the French

I'm familiar with the history of Viet Nam.  I fail to see what the status of Viet Nam prior to the introduction of the conception of the modern ""nation-state"" has to do with anything.  Viet Nam as an independent nation was born when the Viet Minh defeated the French.

The division into North and South was meant to be a temporary measure only, unification was supposed to happen in 1956.  Diem's delegation even objected strenuously to the idea that Vietnam be divided at all, so even the people from the south felt that there were not two parts of Viet Nam, just one.

&gt;The South didn't wish to have any referendums

Well you don't know that, because you didn't have one.  Besides, the United States and Diem very efficiently killed everyone in the South they could find who did want reunification, whether those people were fighting or not, ala [Phoenix.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program)

&gt;Only a minority fought with violence against the government in the South

Only a minority fought with violence against the insurgency.  The question is, that is the majority of the population, the non-fighting part of the population doing.  And as is clear from the state of the rural areas of South Viet Nam from 1957 onward, the majority of the population in the rural areas (and thus the country, since most of the population was rural) supported the Viet Cong, supported unification with the north.

&gt;they considered the Viet Cong and the NVA as the same entity

After Tet, when a huge number of SOUTHERNERS died, the NVA sent cadres and soldiers south to bolster the Viet Cong in their fight against the Americans, and effectively took over management of the Viet Cong.  But before 1967, so for nearly 10 years, the insurgency in the south was primarily populated and run by southerners.  And I'm actually telling you information I learned from reading a book written by a Southerner who fought with the Viet Cong.

&gt;1974 the US disallowed all involvement in South Viet Nam, the truce of 1973

So you mean that the nation of South Viet Nam basically stopped existing when it stopped being propped up by a foreign superpower?
You keep harping on the North's superpower backing.

Do you know how much the Soviet Union gave North Viet Nam in aid?  Over the course of the whole war, they gave them 8 Billion dollars.

The United States spent $170 Billion dollars propping up the South.

8 Billion vs 170 Billion and you are saying that if ONLY the South had kept getting more money it would still be around??

See, while the market is worldwide, there are potential customers in the US, Germany, South Korea, etc. so is your competition... Washington state's Planetary Annihilation is competing against California's Starcraft 2, Poland's Witcher 3, and Japan's Dark Souls 2. A corporate tax might hinder a Washington state game studio from having as much money to spend on its developers, engine, marketing, etc. as it could, which while this might not hurt the amount spent in the industry as a whole much, it means the customer might decide to pick up Dark Souls 2 off Steam instead of Planetary Annihilation, meaning Japan gets to pull the money into its economy instead of Washington. 

This isn't as big of a deal when it comes to say the service industry, since when someone goes to eat fast food he pretty much has the options in his local town, if a local company doesn't expand as much there and thus doesn't get his money, that guy will likely spend his money at a different burger place in town, he can't just buy a burger from Denmark or Montana. Obviously it's not like a 10% corporate tax is going to be the difference between Washington state's game industry failing or not failing and Planetary Annihilation's studio in particular failing or doing well, but it's still 10% less money available that can be invested in developers, engines, marketing, etc. which across the entire Washington state gaming industry could have a slight effect on how it competes with other area's games and thus how well it does.","1412122536"

"capoeira","t5_2qvtg","Really crucial question. How do you prepare for the spontaneous, the unexpected? This is actually a very interesting dichotomy within capoeira that highlights the fact that the academy and its structured training is a fairly recent development in the world of capoeira. It used to be that your ""training"" was just showing up at the roda and trying to learn ""live"", as you went along.

I agree with /u/GatoBranco to a certain extent - rehearsal is an important component for sure. You need to have the movement ability and agility to capitalize on an opportunity when it comes along.

But - how do you recognize the opportunity when it presents itself, and how do you set up a non-clichéd trap that won't be desperately obvious because you have already spent hours rehearsing it with your partner? My answer to this is simply: experience. You need to have seen enough capoeira for a long enough time that you develop a truly instinctive feeling for what will happen before it does, and how you might take advantage. It's a bit like chess: a true master has studied enough games that (s)he can extrapolate the most likely future scenario in any given moment in a novel game. Once you get really good at this, you can even begin to take away the physical competency aspect and still be successful (see: every 80 year old mestre who somehow manages to catch you out doing nothing but ginga and basic kicks).

For myself, I have begun to notice that little magical moments are starting to happen in the roda, where I get sudden flashes of insight and can capitalize on them. I think it just has something to do with having seen lots and lots of games. Just think of how much capoeira Mestres Cobra Mansa or Acordeon or Boca Rica have seen in their lifetimes!","1412122537"

"GlobalOffensive","t5_2sqho","For me, this was a thing that basically stuck since CS: Source. In that game, bunny hopping is much easier to do compared to GO but to do it effectively it was recommended that mwheel be used for jumping. This is because timing needs to be absolutely perfect for a good bhop using spacebar, but using mwheel made the timing much easier to achieve.

If you think about it logically, pressing spacebar means that the jump command will only be sent once per press. However, using the mwheel allows you to send multiple jump commands to the game with one scroll thus allowing for easier jump timing.

You can still bhop in GO but it's much less effective now so I'm not sure I'd recommend learning it at this point.","1412122541"

&gt; The MISC Starfarer is the galaxy's standard fuel transporter. Starfarers are ubiquitous on both sides of the fueling process: their massive tanks allow for both the collection of space borne fuel from gas giants and extrasolar sources as well as the transport of active fuel from refinery stations to the primary market. 


The thing is, and I know I am sounding a bit like a dick, I expected more from this. As the galaxy's standard you should be looking at what would our modern day equavalant of either a ship's standard or a truck standard. That means either the truck variant of a 50 ton truck (That's the max in my country), not the boxcar of 33,000 lb. (A little below 15 tons) max (US max, couldnt find a source for my own country). 


When comparing this to ships I am less knowledgeable, but the same rule applies. It would be the standard variant. Sure I can understand it wouldn't be the largest mammoth class tanker out there, but it also wouldn't be the small starter ship you'd get to start a startup company for example.","1412122545"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Great.... more fat shaming. 

Until there's a treatment that is proven to work long term for more than 5% of the time,  the fat shaming does no good but make people upset.   Even weight loss surgery,  which comes with it risk of death or shortened lifespan, fails half to 2/3rd of the time.   Research shows that 95% of the time diets after 5 years have failed, and some people end up weighing more than before the diet.     

What about the people who suffer and die due to body self hatred?   Eating disorders have a higher mortality rate than any other mental illness.   Why don't we worry about their caskets? ","1412122548"

"PS4","t5_2rrlp","For me it partially depends on the game. When I buy FIFA, I go physical, and I always will. FIFA has little value to me when it's outdated, so it only benefits me to have the newest one. When I buy physical I can turn it in for the $10-$15 it's normally worth when the new one comes out.

When I buy a game like skyrim, Gta, or any kind of open world/rpg title, I'm getting something I will enjoy forever and I go digital for convenience.

I would buy digital more consistent if there were sales on PS4 that are steam sale quality. Like if they put something like Assassin's Creed 4 on sale for less than $10, me, and I'm sure plenty of other people who hadn't played it yet would be all over that.","1412122548"

I've been here---not as severe as an AP getting in a wreck and undergoing surgeries--but I've been discovered by an AP's wife, so I know what it's like to have that kind of anxiety. 
Here's my advice. This is how it worked for me:

1) don't cover for your AP. He's vulnerable and will likely tell her intimate details if she demands it. Since you don't know what he has or hasn't told her...

2) don't lie to her. Don't deny. 

3) diffuse. Diffuse. Diffuse. 
She's angry. She's hurting. She wants blood. But more than that, she wants to understand *why* this happened. Explain to her that you're sorry, that you feel terrible about how intense things got, that you want to make it right. 


Here's where things get tricky, will she reach out to your spouse? 

My AP's wife didn't, because I gave her enough meat for the questions she asked to satiate her morbid curiosity. 
I fell on the sword. I was accountable. I sincerely apologized. 


Good luck. I know it's difficult. And my experience may not help yours, but my heart really does go out to you. Keep us updated. ","1412122548"

I felt particularly bad for the firefighter's family who featured her at their son's memorial. And then, she sent them a plaque with what she said was a burnt piece of her clothing from that day in memory of him giving his life to save hers.

Having a separate set of abilities for your pet would be cool. They could feed off of your adrenaline. Examples of pet abilities:

* Sacrifice - Your pet prevents a fatal hit in non-pvp situations within the next 3 seconds from killing you. 

* Intervene - Your pet jumps in front of you and takes 33% of the damage of the non-pvp attack
* Taunt - Makes NPCs around you hostile for 5 minutes
* Scout - Your pet moves ahead and attracts the hostility of non-boss NPCs

Your self summary is really long, and doesn't tell us anything about *you*. It's more a what you've done/doing with your life. Describe what makes you you, like your sense of humour, and what makes *you* unique.

There are three possible scenarios when women read your profile, they like you, they don't like you, or your profile is too much to bother. The last one is the worst you could hope for.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Well, you said you don't buy that the absolute numbers support the claim, but this is tantamount to saying the numbers are wrong, when they aren't. There are other ways to avoid them defining the reality (and I can hardly disagree with their relevance, given that I mentioned them in the main post), of course, as I only factored in victory statuses and regional results.

Anyway, it's a team with one win beating a team with three losses vs. a team with two wins beating a team with one loss. One could simply multiply those and see that 1x3 is bigger (""easier""; compare a 6-win team beating a 6-loss team, which gets the biggest and easiest number of 36) than 2x1, and this is mostly reflected in the relative upset rating differences.

Indeed, it won't reflect how the upsets ""felt"" (varies) at the times they occurred, even ignoring the huge factors outside of the pure victory records ONLY within this tournament. But what can I do? Using ratings based on even fewer games (6-7 games per team or 12-19 per region are already rather limited samples) against an uneven and/or lesser spread of teams/regions just makes the ratings super-terrible at representing quality instead of merely ""bad"". In the end the point was a representation of quality of play using as much information as possible. So yeah, how ""meaningful"", ""important"", ""interesting"", or ""exciting"" the upsets were is not particularly reflected, and I admit I can't fix that in any way I find particularly productive.

Thanks for discussing. It is interesting to me, and I didn't mean to seem very defensive, but the numbers are what they are to me, no more and no less. And they naturally will only resemble reality, and really can't support too much in any case, as they are but dirty reflections of reality. I don't really think SSW's odds are THAT high, for instance, given their past with SSB.

now, messi is a better playmaker and dribbler than cristiano, heavily influenced by the fact that they have different roles, playstyles and skills honed for different purposes, but some of these comparisons have no place unless you seek to argue in favor of messi.

through balls when one is a 10 sitting behind the defensive line while the other is a forward running into space? should ronaldo start serving corners and set pieces too instead of trying to head the ball just so he can arbitrarily bolster his number of 'created chances'? tackles?!? might as well compare how many defensive clearances ronaldo has against messi, which is probably a significant number vs 0.

i wouldn't say one is far ahead of the other, but the one performing better than usual is cristiano ronaldo at the moment so i'd put him in the lead.","1412122559"

You should read the Hobby Lobby opinion and the RFRA. To be exempt from a generally applicable law under the RFRA, the burden placed must not be necessary for the furtherance of a compelling interest OR  there must be a less restrictive means of furthering that interest. The latter of which was deemed unsatisfied by the AMA in the Hobby Lobby case as a less restrictive means was already made available to other classes of corporations.

Two twin girls who go to my high school aren't popular. They stick to a very confined social group and tend just to confide in each other. They don't really make an effort to make friends or expand their group of friends, and it doesn't help that one of them tends to be pretty obnoxious and snobby at times.  
  
Over the summer, their mother died of cancer, and I haven't noticed a ton of outreach. No one has really said much to them (at least that I've noticed) because not a lot of people are friendly with them.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","The environments look nice and the gunplay is good, but not at all ""diverse"". It's basically halo 2.0 with added aim assist. Strikes are literally EXACTLY the same each time; there is no real strategy. Maybe for the raid, but there is an entire other set of issues about that alone. Crucible is easy and very unsatisfying, and I play that primarily in destiny. All classes feel the same, nearly a dozen ways to 1 shot kill that require minimal skill, everyone using auto rifles and shotties, very few game types and maps. Quite far from diverse. The leveling mechanics are not diverse; they have been done before, and the light system actually homogenizes the game by requiring everyone wear the same armor. Again, not diverse at all. The subclasses are decent, but only for their supers be somewhat different, the rest is essentially the same. And lol at the new content. Not diverse or enjoyable at all. Not only is it the SAME exact content recycled as new bounties, but the gear you can get from it is the same as the gear you'd be wearing to complete it in most cases, and you can't get shards from it, and the gear the emissary sells is bad too. I think you enjoy the game because you want to enjoy it, not because it is geuinely good or diverse in any meaningful way. And that's fine for some. 

I look forward to destinys future as well, it has strong potential and I'd love to see it become something great, but as of now that is nothing more than wishful thinking. Take it for what it is right now, and when you do that, most take it as I have, that it is greatly lacking and banal.","1412122564"

However don't get discouraged because if you are just visiting it can be pretty neat. It has it's perks, just sucks living there. Lucky for you, you will be there during the Red River Revel which I loved (http://www.redriverrevel.com). It is Oct. 4-11 and is a arts festival that is outside at Festival Plaza which is located downtown. Chill music, lots of art, amazing food, and copious amounts of beer.  

Other things that you could do besides that.. The casinos of course. Both Shreveport and Bossier side. 

If you're a movie buff you can visit the Robinson Film Center and catch a movie. They play the ones that get overlooked by main stream media. I've seen some great stuff there that you normal wouldn't otherwise hear of.

There are 2 gay bars. Central and The Korner Lounge. I haven't been to either of them however Korner is more relaxed from what I have been told. Central is more of a ""club"". If you don't want to go to those you can go to other popular straight bars. Some good ones are Strange Brew, What's On Tap?, or Bears. 

I'd add more but I got to run to a shindig with some friends. Feel free to ask me all of the questions you want and I can respond when I get back! Hope you have fun! What exactly are you doing there?","1412122567"

&gt;

&gt;""__The Night Chicago Died__"" is a song by the [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) group [Paper Lace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Lace), written by [Peter Callander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Callander) and [Mitch Murray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Murray). The song reached number one on the [*Billboard* Hot 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100) chart for one week in 1974, reached number 3 in the UK charts, and number 2 in Canada. It is about a fictional shoot-out between the [Chicago Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Police_Department) and members of the [Al Capone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Capone) [Syndicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Crime_Syndicate). The narrator retells his mother's anguish while awaiting news of the fate of her husband, a Chicago policeman.

"MHOC","t5_31ykc","I was talking about this earlier and though it would be interesting to discuss. I was thinking about political spectrums, and of course the simple right-left is a little simplistic. So people like to split it into a compass, with economic left-right and social left-right. However I think that is to simplistic. I think we should have another category in terms of globalization vs isolationism/anti-globalism. That gives us a kind of cube. So there would then be 8 political ideologies then broadly.

**Neo-Liberalism** (Pro-Global, Social Progressivism, Right-Wing Economy)

**Traditional Conservative** (Anti-Global, Social Conservatism, Right-Wing Economy)

**Socialism** (Pro-Global, Social Progressivism, Left-Wing Economy)

**Neo-Conservatism** (Pro-Global, Social Conservatism, Right-Wing Economy)

**Con-Socialism** (Anti-Global, Social Conservatism, Left-Wing Economy)

**Isolationist Socialism** (Anti-Global, Social Progressivism, Left Wing Economy)

**Progressive Conservative/Canadian Red Tory** (Anti-Global, Social Progressivism, Right-Wing Economy)

Have a good name for this last one? If, so, I would be happy to hear it because I have no clue. (Pro-Global, Social Conservatism, Left-Wing Economy)

What do you guys think? Names wrong, too simplistic, too complex? Where do you fall? I am probably some sort of a combination between a Red Tory and a Traditional Conservative. 

If I were giving parties labels it would be these (tell me if you disagree):

Traditional Conservatism: British Imperialist Party

Socialism: Greens, Labour, Communist Party, Celtic Worker's League

"technology","t5_2qh16","No surprise. I remember reading about a big study financed by the government in the 70s regarding marijuana. The conclusion was that
marijuana was not that harmful. Since they paid for it, the study was
buried for decades because it didn't reflect the result they had wanted
to support the continued war on drugs.

"3DS","t5_2ruhy","Keep in mind you need to format the 64 GB SD cards on a computer beforehand as they do not work out of the box on the 3DS.

SDXC cards come by default formatted as exFAT. You have to reformat to FAT32. The problem with that if you are a Windows user is that Windows does not allow you to format an SD Card to FAT32 if it is &gt;32GB. So you need to download a tool to format it.

Really it isn't a big deal. Just an extra step or two before copying your data from your old SD card.

I have a 64 GB and it works flawlessly.","1412122571"

The subs were rumored to close because the reopening date was originally slated as the last day of the fiscal year. This was standard practice for WDI when wanting to quietly close attractions.

The Monstropolis update was put on the back burner after the MyMagic bands fiasco that sucked money from all Disney Parks. Now that things have been looked at from every angle, the plans are rumored to be back on and will start moving after the holidays.","1412122571"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","I would make the pearly water not magical, in and of itself, but an extraordinarily useful ingredient in concocting magical potions, spells, and rituals.

As in, I'd allow a few drops of the water to replace material spell or ritual components (very useful for spells like Identify). And if they manage to gather enough of it and transport it, they might be able to ""trade"" it for a certain amount of enchantments or magical items. I'd also make difficult to transport. Inasmuch as that, perhaps it evaporates quickly when take from the lake and not carried in an alchemically treated barrel or sommat.

That, in effect, makes it equivalent to gold in many ways, and the PCs end up somewhat limited by how much they can carry and haul away.","1412122572"

"longisland","t5_2qk64","If the trees become damaged after the reconstruction of the pavement and then the tree need to removed, then the roots underneath the new pavement will decompose and then create more issues and the pavement will need to be redone and filled underneath. I live right near all these trees and i feel its sad to see the trees go. I also think the problem is these tall trees are all over the power lines as well and they are butchering the trees to not be obstructions to the lines.

I think they should work on putting the power lines underground. It would help reduce issues like what happened during Sandy and any other 'heavy' storm. Plainview/Syosset is always losing power because of a gust of wind. BUT that would mean PSEG would have to get involved and you know they wont spend a dime.

Although it will be glum to see the lack of trees for this time, I actually think its a smart move to remove old, weakened trees with newer, healthier and deeper rooting trees. They will grow and the streets will be tree lined again.","1412122573"
